<p>At The Game Awards preshow, it's been announced Capcom will be bringing <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a></strong> to the Switch 2 on <strong>24th April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now live, and a demo is coming out later for Switch 2 and other console platforms, so you'll be able to try it out before the full release next year. This is a new IP from Capcom, focused on science fiction action-adventure gameplay with a "hacking twist".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is the near future, and protagonists Hugh and his android companion Diana, must work together as they make their way through the cold lunar research station."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After years of delays, Capcom has confirmed the release date for their astronaut and girl action adventure Pragmata. The game will launch on 24th April for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and… Switch 2! Oh, and there’s a demo out today for PC, coming to other platforms soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pragmata World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6YCL6UW1lI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hugh the astronaut has popped over to the Moon to figure out what’s gone wrong at a big lunar base. After getting split from his team, he’s saved by the android that they eventually settle on should be called Diana – short for the less catchy DI02367. The two form a fast bond, not least because Diana can hack the very angry androids with a quick puzzle minigame to enable you to deal damage. This new trailer shows off some big set piece moments that will push that concept as far as possible.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a> earlier this year, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy. Thankfully, it’s not the most mentally taxing of tasks (at least initially), as the grid appears and you simply need to fill blocks to paint a path to the exit point. Along the way, you’ll want to also pass through marked nodes that will power up the attack, while avoiding those marked as a hazard. It’s very simple stuff, but what makes it feel different is that you need your thumb on the left analogue stick in order to move Hugh and Diana away from any dangers, so directional inputs are instead mapped to the shape or letter face buttons.”</p>
<p>There’s still a lot of mystery surrounding Pragmata, though now there’s a little bit less that when it was announced half a decade ago. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/pragmata-ps5-capcom-release-date/">First revealed for PS5 in 2020</a>, the game was meant to release in 2022, was delayed to 2023, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/12/capcom-delays-pragmata-beyond-2023/">then was delayed again with no further date</a>. We finally have that firm release date, which is very nice, and PC players should check out the Steam demo.</p>

It’s netted 12 nominations, the most out of this year’s contenders, including all five craft awards (Direction, Art, Music and Score, Narrative, and Audio Design).</p><p>On the announcements side, Crystal Dynamics and Amazon Games are planning something <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-will-be-at-the-game-awards-this-week">related to the <em>Tomb Raider</em> series</a>. Keighley also probably had plans to reveal big news about <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, but unfortunately <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/playstation-accidentally-leaks-leon-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem/">it got spoiled early</a> thanks to some leaked key art on the PlayStation Store.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The team at Xbox, including Matt Booty, has just revealed that the next Xbox Developer Direct, scheduled to take place in January 2026, will be huge, but regardless of that, it can’t fit in everything that is launching across the platform in the next year.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the team teased a phenomenal year for Xbox through 2026, with the imminent launches of some massive titles, and some sizeable anniversaries being lined up.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-xbox-developer-direct-is-coming-soon">Next Xbox Developer Direct is Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a recent<a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> interview with Variety</a>, Xbox’s Matt Booty spoke about the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct showcase, poised to take place in just a few weeks:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t share exactly what’s there, but we’ve got a lot of stuff that we’re shipping next year. In fact, usually Dev Direct is about highlighting what’s coming up for the year ahead. This year, we’ve got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show.</p>



<p>So I will tell you that Playground Games is going to be in the Dev Direct, but we’ll have more stuff next year to ship than we can fit into one Dev Direct show in January, which is a good place to be.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to talk about all the good things happening for Team Green through 2026:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For us, it’s really going to be a great year. It’s going to be the 25th anniversary of Xbox, we’re coming up on franchises of ours that have got these decade-level anniversaries. </p>



<p>It’s the 40th anniversary of Bethesda, Blizzard’s 35, ‘Diablo’ shipped 30 years ago. We’ve announced things like the ‘Halo Remastered’ collection that we’ve got coming, and we’ve got a lot of other things that we’ll talk about soon, that ship next year. So it’s going to be a real banner year for the brand and a banner year for some of our biggest franchises to show up across the industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Booty also took the opportunity to address the developing Call of Duty movie, explaining how good a pick Taylor Sheridan is as the project’s writer.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you think about the way that he tells stories, you think about the other things that he’s been a writer on, I think that the team feels that he’s got a good approach to characters and a good approach to story that’ll match up with their vision of what a ‘Call of Duty’ movie is.</p>

<section><p>Here's why Sandfall Interactive's debut title is deserving of our highest accolade</p></section>
        
  
  

        
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                                        <p dir="ltr">In 2023, Final Fantasy Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-doesnt-like-the-term-jrpg/1100-6511939/">indicated</a> his distaste for the term JRPG, saying that Square Enix doesn't go into its games trying to make a JRPG. "We go into them thinking we're going to create RPGs," he explained.</p><p dir="ltr">Before this, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, who worked with MonolithSoft on Xenoblade Chronicles X, echoed similar sentiments, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-developers-weigh-in-on-the-/1100-6428409/">saying</a>, "I feel like we just make RPGs, I don't need anyone to add the 'J', personally."</p><p dir="ltr">In these two instances, there is both a direct and an implied acknowledgement that although there can be positive connotations attached to the label, "JRPG" can also feel limiting and discriminatory.</p><p dir="ltr">Over time, the term JRPG has felt more and more outdated, partly because Japanese developers have expressed opposition to the pigeonholing of their art, and partly because the characteristics that were typically used to demarcate a JRPG have become less and less exclusive to Japanese developers.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy, in particular, underwent a noticeable evolution in style and substance that made it more appealing to western audiences--Shonen-esque narratives have given way to stories aimed at older audiences, and a shift away from turn-based battles has given combat a more action-oriented flow.</p><p dir="ltr">As new generations of people have stepped into the roles of creators and designers on games inspired by the Japanese titles they loved playing, the hallmarks of what made a so-called JRPG have broken out of any kind of geographical attachment they may have been saddled with.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no clearer example of this than Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, a game that, by its developers' own admission, is inspired by role-playing games developed in Japan, but was created by a small team of developers in France. It is a triumphant testament to the universality and potential of what those games offered then and still do now.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="821409031" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

GameSpot's Game of the Year 2025</p><div><p>         Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?       </p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/signup/">Sign up</a> or <a

format.     </p><p>Sorry, but you can't access this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr"><span>The framework of Expedition 33 can very easily be traced back to specific classics and iconic franchises, such as Final Fantasy 10 and 8; The Legend of Zelda; Kingdom Hearts 2; and the Saga series. However, it also draws from more recent games, such as Nier: Automata, Sekiro, and Dark Souls. But what makes Expedition 33 special is that all of its inspirations are brought together in a way that is unique to itself, its creators, and the time in which it was made and released.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Expedition 33 feels like an all-time classic role-playing game that has just been rediscovered. It shows where the genre could have gone had it not pivoted after Mistwalker's Lost Odyssey. In that way, it is a love letter to an era of role-playing games that has been lost to time.</p><p dir="ltr">And at the same time, Expedition 33 is able to proudly stand alongside contemporaries thanks to its utterly bewitching storytelling, which deals with heavy subject matter such as grief, the value of life, and the perils of not being able to let go. It explores all of this with elegant writing and spellbinding performances that, together, make for profound emotional moments of empathy and understanding. It's a game about death that, somehow, is also able to inspire hope and find humor amid its darkness.</p><p dir="ltr">This is all driven by a thrilling sense of adventure that pushes players to explore surreal environments as they go toe-to-toe with everything from shockingly powerful mimes to enigmatic divine entities with the ability to remove thousands of lives from existence with the stroke of a brush. Its turn-based format, reactive combat, and character development systems may be a combination of familiar ideas, but it's all deftly married together in a way that makes it satisfying to engage with. At every step, carefully crafting roles and strategies is compelling, and the pure joy of perfectly timing a parry to survive impossible odds never dulls.</p><p dir="ltr">More impressively is how developer Sandfall Interactive does all this while also presenting the game with an unmatched style. Expedition 33's otherworldly visuals give its setting a dreamlike quality, and the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack emphasizes the melancholic nature of the journey players go on. The studio triumphantly draws from French artistry and culture to provide a window into not just an unforgettable fantasy world, but the real world, too, and how it has shaped the people behind Expedition 33's creation.</p><p dir="ltr">Like Yoshida and Yamagami, Sandfall set out to make an RPG that anyone can find value in experiencing. And what Expedition 33 became, and is about, proves that artistic expression doesn't belong to a single group of people or a place, and that there is no such thing as a JRPG--there are just ideas that have the power to move and inspire people, and that can be realized in ways that feel deeply personal to and representative of those that bring them to life.</p>

After roughly a minute of new footage, the two high five to announce the release date. Additionally, we learn that the game is coming to Switch 2 as well, seemingly on the same day as PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Finally, there's a demo launching today on Steam, but it will come to other platforms, including Switch 2, "later."</p><p>For more on Pragmata, you can check out our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/21/pragmata-blends-hacking-and-shooting-for-a-sci-fi-surprise">hands-on preview of the game from earlier this year</a>.

            <p>The creator of Mario + Rabbids has revealed his next game, and it's a send up of the games industry as a mascot platformer: Bradley the Badger.</p>
<p>Davide Soliani - affectionately known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-ubisoft-crying-man-did-next">Ubisoft Crying Man</a> - joined with writer Christian Cantamessa (Red Dead Redemption, Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor) to found new studio Day 4 Night. Bradley the Badger is its first game.</p>
<p>The adventure will blend live-action and animation as the titular creature explores a variety of unfinished worlds and would-be reboots of his series, each a different genre, as a parody of the games industry - it's been compared to Wreck-it Ralph and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.</p>

<p>Key to gameplay is The Kit, which allows Bradley to modify unfinished assets and solve puzzles, while smacking enemies with a frying pan.</p>
<p>And it looks like there will be plenty of tongue-in-cheek game references too. Badgerborne I'm very interested in.</p>

<p>"We wanted to make something that would reignite us, something capable of taking us back in time to when, with younger eyes, the whole world of videogames seemed to shine," said Soliani. "And we wanted our mechanics to be the perfect bridge between the past and the future."</p><p>"Bradley is part love letter to videogames and part satire of them," added Cantamessa. "Games are an art form and this is a story inspired by our adventures making them. From the inner turmoil of self-doubt to the joy of building worlds, we set out to transform those experiences into a game that anyone can get lost in."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-25-years">Soliani departed from Ubisoft last year</a> after 25 years at Ubisoft, 11 of which were spent on the Mario + Rabbids tactics games for Nintendo Switch. "I have decided to leave Ubisoft to embark on a new adventure," he said at the time. "I can't say more now. Thanks a lot for everything, truly."</p>
<p>Then earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-creator-says-players-want-unique-independent-games-willing-to-tell-different-stories">the developer pair revealed Day 4 Night</a>, stating they were working on a "passion project".</p>
<p>Soliani noted there's "a growing interest from the player towards games that are a bit, let's say, out of the chorus. They are a bit different. They are willing to tell different stories…that's what we are observing as developers and as players."</p>
<p>Bradley the Badger certainly seems to fit the bill.</p>

<p>It’s a very Little Bo-Peep kind of story, where all of the sheep this sheepdog has been looking after have disappeared, so you’ll set out to find them across a sweeping landscape. It is rather lovely looking, especially with a very expressively animated star at its heart.</p>

			<p>South of Midnight will make its inevitable arrival on PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2 in Spring 2026, developer Compulsion Games announced tonight ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>. It's the latest previously Xbox Series X/S console exclusive title to arrive on other platforms, and in this case, it seems like Compulsion Games could be aiming to get it out on other platforms right on the anniversary.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a post on the studio's Bluesky account, with a short statement and graphic confirming the news, though interestingly, only the graphic included a mention of the PS5 version.</p>







<p>South of Midnight arrived earlier this year on April 8, 2025, and if Compulsion is aiming for sometime in Spring next year, it could just be aiming for April 8, 2026, or that same week, since April 8, 2026, is a Wednesday, and games are more commonly released either at the beginning or the end of a week.</p>



<p>I reviewed South of Midnight for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">Wccftech when it arrived earlier this year, and gave it a 7/10, writing</a>, "<em>Overall, South of Midnight has excellent storytelling, excellent artistic and visual design, a wonderful cast of characters and voice actors, and an original soundtrack that punctuates each big narrative beat in a way that will stay with you long after you put the controller down. Unfortunately, the same creativity that went into the rest of the game is missing in its combat and platforming, and Compulsion Games does itself no favors by launching you into the same boring combat scenarios again and again in each level.</em>"</p>

<p>Earlier tonight, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a> briefly ceased funnelling trophies into Sandfall Interactive’s pockets on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-reportedly-charges-over-1-million-for-a-three-minute-trailer-while-just-a-minute-can-run-up-nearly-half-of-that">heavily sponsored</a> conveyor belt to reveal Decrepit: a horror-flavoured, dungeon-dwelling soulslike that’s the debut project of solo dev outfit Jämmerdal Games. It’s being published by Three Friends, they of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romestead">Romestead</a> and ex-Mojang/Ghost Ship Games note, and aims to be out in 2026.</p>

<p>Why give two hoots about yet another difficult, dark fantasy ghoulbasher? Firstly, there’s a bit in the trailer where an undead, still shackled to the medieval torture wheel he died on, attacks by rolling himself across the floor like a bigger, blunter homage to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWK-2VyY1Ks">Dark Souls' Bonewheel Skeletons</a>, and it might be the funniest thing I’ve seen all night. Second, the setup does sound intriguing: your end goal is escaping a vast castle, and dying will dump you right back at the start – but in a different corner of the fortress each time. A successful breakout, Three Friends say, will rely on you learning the layout and unlocking shortcuts over successive runs; "spatial mastery over power creep", to use their words.</p> <figure>

<p>"That’s a roguelike, not a soulslike," an imagined antagonist would argue in my head. It definitely sounds like there’s a bit of that, with weapons and armour needing to be gathered mid-run, though they’ll be pinched off corpses instead of presented as boon options every time you clear a room of twitching monsters. The castle itself remains a constant, in contrast to the semi-randomised zones that come to mind when one thinks of roguelikes; memorizing enemy patrols in certain areas is apparently emphasised, though some recurring baddies might pop up in multiple spots to catch you out.</p>
<p>The influences namedropped by Jämmerdal Games – a.k.a. Starbreeze and Avalanche Studios alumnus Olof Hagelin – include classic first-person magic shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hexen-beyond-heretic">Hexen: Beyond Heretic</a> and dungeon crawling RPG Eye of the Beholder. “In Decrepit I've tried to recapture that feeling of dread and excitement I felt when I played the old classics for the first time," he says.</p>
<p>I’m too youthful and vibrant, as you can tell from looking at me, to have played these in their prime. But I am keen on further exploring first-person soulslikes, after a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-a-first-person-soulslike-work-playing-napoleonic-parryfest-valor-mortis-suggests-oui">friendly first meeting</a> with Napoleonic swordswinger Valor Mortis, and it’s rarely a bad thing when a game manages to make a location feel more than meshes and textures. I <em>want</em> Decrepit’s castle to be a villain, almost as much I want to see more cartwheeling zombies.</p>

<p>South of Midnight developers have just confirmed that the release window for Switch 2 and PS5 is set for Spring 2026. </p>



<p>Compulsion Games’ new action-adventure, South of Midnight, was released for Xbox Series X/S and PC back in April 2025. It seems to have been a timed console exclusivity deal, as the game is finally coming to new platforms, including PlayStation 5 and Nintendo’s latest console, the Switch 2. </p>







<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-arriving-for-ps5-and-switch-2-in-spring-2026">South of Midnight Arriving for PS5 and Switch 2 in Spring 2026</h2>



<p>Just minutes before the highly anticipated The Game Awards 2025 event, Compulsion Games put out a new post on <a href="https://x.com/CompulsionGames/status/1999265661600645401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) confirming South of Midnight’s release on PS5 and Switch 2. The developers didn’t provide a release date, but we do know it is planned for Spring 2026. </p>



<p>In South of Midnight, players embody the role of Hazel, who is a Weaver, a magical mender of broken bonds and spirits. The game features the mythos and creatures of Southern Folklore in a macabre and fantastical world. The protagonist will battle dangerous creatures as she unearths secrets about her family. </p>



<p>Hazel is also tasked with rescuing her mother, saving her hometown, and using her ancient power to restore creatures and uncover the traumas that consume them. The game also features diverse regions of the South, as seen through the decayed county of Prospero and its residents. </p>

                <p>Another great Xbox exclusive, South of Midnight, is heading to rival platforms. Developer Compulsion Games has announced that the action-adventure game is coming to PS5 and Switch 2 in Spring 2026.</p><p>South of Midnight launched in April for PC and Xbox Series X|S, meaning it'll be coming to different systems after about a period of a year, depending on when exactly it hits PS5 and Switch 2.</p><p>South of Midnight is set in the American Deep South. The game follows the character Hazel, who, along with her mother, are preparing for a huge hurricane.</p><p>It's just the latest Xbox exclusive to come to rival platforms. Just this week, Microsoft put Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5, while games like Doom: The Dark Ages and The Outer Worlds 2 came to PS5 this year. Next year, Microsoft will launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> on PS5.</p><p>Microsoft is bringing Xbox games to rival systems to help titles reach a wider audience, and to help Microsoft make more money considering how much larger the PS5 install base is, in particular.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/south-of-midnight-review-a-love-letter-to-the-american-deep-south/1900-6418352/" data-ref-id="1900-6418352">South of Midnight review</a> scored the game a 8/10. "It doesn't exactly wow with its combat and platforming, but these parts of the game are mechanically sound, and South of Midnight's memorable characters, incredible visuals, and catchy soundtrack are so strong that it doesn't really matter that the gameplay is just decent," reviewer Jordan Ramée said.</p>

<p>This year's event kicks off at <strong>5pm PST / 8pm EST / 1am GMT (Fri) / 2am CET (Fri) / 10am JST (Fri)</strong>, though, as ever, a pre-show 'Opening Act' will begin half an hour before that — and you can expect to see some awards given out there too.</p>

<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 4:30pm (Thu) PST / 5:30pm (Thu) MST / 6:30pm (Thu) CST / 7:30pm (Thu) EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 12:30am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 1:30am CET / 2:30am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 9:30am JST / 8:30am AWST / 11:30am AEDT</li></ul>

<p>Normally, TGAs aren't packed with Switch news, but there are a lot of big hitters we enjoyed on Nintendo consoles this year up for some headline awards. We've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> all up for GOTY, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is in the running for a few trophies too.</p>
<p>There's every chance that we'll hear some third-party Switch 2 news from this one, too, with the fresh hybrid still very much being the new kid on the block. Don't go expecting anything from Nintendo itself, but an announcement of a port or two might be on the cards.</p>
<p>Whatever the event throws our way, we'll be here to watch along with you. You can watch the full event — from the Opening Act right up to the final award — and have a natter while you do it, below.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/housing-development-notes-updated-december-9/2207508/5">a forum post</a> formally announcing the official UI change, Community Manager Randy “Kaivax” Jordan noted that the team “quickly” got to work on enabling the floating house UI after seeing the community “almost immediately” embrace the glitch. But Kaivax also notes that the undersides of houses were never intended to be visible, and thus “aren’t modeled are textured.” Players who make floating houses “may decide to hide that part behind other things,” Kaivax suggests.</p>
<p>Players with houses that float too high may also have problems positioning the camera so they can click the door to enter the house. For this problem, Kaivax suggests that “you might want to consider building a ramp or a jumping puzzle or a mount landing spot, etc.”</p>
<p><em>WoW</em>‘s floating houses join a long legacy of beloved game features that weren’t originally intended parts of a game’s design, from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-street-fighter-ii-i-designer-opens-up-about-the-cancelling-bug-"><em>Street Fighter II</em>‘s combo system</a> to <a href="https://docs.momentum-mod.org/tags/rocket-jump/"><em>Doom</em>‘s “rocket jump.”</a> Now if we could only convince Blizzard to make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/blizzard-fixes-diablo-iii-gold-duplication-bug-but-the-damage-may-be-done/"><em>Diablo III</em> gold duplication</a> into an official feature.</p>

                <p>Sonic the Hedgehog fans can save big on one of the Lego playsets that is scheduled to retire before the end of the year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Apple has lost its appeal of a massive district court ruling in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic Games.</p><p>That <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">April ruling</a> from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple “willingly” failed to comply with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown">a 2021 order</a> allowing mobile app developers to link to payment options outside of Apple’s, and she barred Apple from charging a commission on in-app purchases using external payment links, among other restrictions. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26372151-epic-v-apple-appeals-court-opinion/">today’s opinion</a>, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.</p><p>Gonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”</p><p>But the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting <em>any </em>fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.</p><p>The panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”</p><p>The opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”</p><p>Apple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney retweeted posts from <a href="https://x.com/business/status/1999209253131759821"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="https://x.com/schaeffers/status/1999214579956809906">Schaeffer’s Investment Research</a> about the ruling.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/842991/apple-epic-appeal-loses-contempt]]></content:encoded>

<p>Team Falcons and The MongolZ are the first teams to fall from the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs after both being swept by more capable opponents. Their fixtures ended with a 0-2 scoreline, with Spirit knocking out Falcons and a dominant Vitality squad dispatching The MongolZ.</p>



<p>The fan-favorite sides had sparked hopes of an underdog run through the Budapest playoffs, but it simply wasn’t to be. These two spirited campaigns come to an end, and we move on to day two of the playoffs.</p>

<h2 id="h-first-eliminations-confirmed">First Eliminations Confirmed</h2>



<p>The grand final round of the StarLadder Budapest Major is fast approaching, and one team is lining up to walk away with a massive $500,000 prize. Before that arrives, another five fixtures, including the BO5 grand final, has to take place.</p>



<p>Team Falcons fell short after facing the daunting challenge of Team Spirit, who entered the playoffs in formidable form. Spirit was dominant out of the gate, sweeping the series 2-0 without too much fuss. </p>



<p>It was a similar story for The MongolZ, and despite dishing out earlier upsets against some capable sides, Vitality was just too quickly able to outmaneuver the Mongolian side. It was unsustainable, and another 2-0 sweep brought another chapter of the Major to a close.</p>



<p>The remaining matches are set to be blockbuster fixtures:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit vs. Team Vitality</li>



<li>MOUZ vs. FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Natus Vincere vs. FURIA</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Tomb Raider Catalyst is the winner of this year’s “Someone pressed the TGA button too soon” award]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As is tradition, someone somewhere has published information a little too early about a game that is almost certainly going to be revealed later on tonight at The Game Awards. This year Lara Croft can take home not one, but two shiny “Someone pressed the TGA button to soon” awards as two Tomb Raider games have leaked.</p>
<p>The first is Tomb Raider Catalyst, which leaked artwork, synopsis, and the entire trailer, although Amazon has been very quick to take the latter down. It is set for release in 2027 for the PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC and finds Lara on a new expedition across Northern India.</p>


<p><em>“Set in the wake of a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened mysterious guardian forces, Tomb Raider: Catalyst folows Lara Croft on a new adventure across Northern India.”</em></p>

<p>The second game, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, is a “reimagining” of the very first Lara Croft adventure.</p>

<p><em>“Experience a stunning reimagining of Lara Croft’s 1996 genre-defining game with jaw-dropping visuals, modern gameplay, and new surprises that honor the spirit of the original.”</em></p>
<p>If you really want to watch the trailer for that then you can find it in super low res with no sound over on 4chan, I suggest you don’t. I had a look on your behalf and it looks very much like the first Tomb Raider but all modern, so exactly what you would expect.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is also coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC and both games are being made by Crystal Dynamics and published by Amazon.&nbsp; They are also making a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/04/sophie-turner-is-lara-croft-in-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series/">Tomb Raider TV series</a> with &nbsp;Sophie Turner set to take on the leading role.</p>
<p>Turner, whose breakout role came as Sansa Stark in the Game of Thrones series, before she played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, will be the third actor to play Lara Croft. She follows in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie, who starred in two films in the early 2000s, and Alicia Vikander, who had one shot at the role in 2018.</p>

		<p>Have you been keen to step into the 3D meat space of Super Meat Boy 3D? Well there’s no need to wait for PC gamers, as a Super Meat Boy 3D demo is now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3288210/Super_Meat_Boy_3D/">live on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Coming as a slight precursor to The Game Awards tonight, this is a newly updated version of the demo that was playable at Gamescom earlier this year.</p>


<p>The Super Meat Boy 3D demo features 10 levels from the full game, giving a look at two worlds –&nbsp;the squirrel-infested Forest and the trash-filled Wastes. Of course, this will be just a taster, an apertif for what’s in store, which is laid out by the following blurb:</p>
<p><em>Super Meat Boy 3D is a brutal platformer that sees you guide a cube of meat on a mission to rescue his bandage-made girlfriend from an evil fetus in a tuxedo jar—IN 3D! You’ll wall-jump past buzz saws, crumbling caves, and flaming forests, dying a million times along the way—IN (you guessed it) 3D. With old-school difficulty, twitchy reflexes, epic bosses, and loads of secrets, it’s Meat Boy like never before—IN (say it with me!) 3D!</em></p>
<p>Yup, there’s boss fights in this one.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a PC, or want to save the experience for later, hopefully you won’t have to wait too long. Super Meat Boy 3D coming in early 2026 to Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC, and coming day one to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>.</p>

This new card game from Modiphius Entertainment brings a strategic experience to the post-apocalyptic world of Bethesda's iconic action RPG series.</p><h2>The <em>Fallout: Power Play</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2><p>According to an official press release, <em>Fallout: Power Play</em> is a light strategic card game designed for 2-4 players. The game was designed by Resurrectionist Games, the same studio that made the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doom-arena-board-game-blasts-on-to-kickstarter" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom Arena Board Game</em></a>.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>In the game, you take control of one of four factions. Those factions are the Brotherhood of Steel, Enclave, Raiders, and the Super Mutants. From there, you compete to take control of various locations of the Wasteland. This is done by placing agents to gain influence and undertake quests to gain bonuses. In addition, players can use Power Play cards, which can shift the game's dynamic and disrupt enemy strategies.</p><p>But the Wasteland isn't so easily tamed. Every turn, a Wasteland card is drawn at random, bringing an unpredictable change to the game. These changes include sudden atomisation to a Deathclaw rampaging through your home base. As for how you can deal with such chaos, you can always play politics with the other faction, make alliances, and keep some backup plans just in case.</p><blockquote><p><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">“We’ve been making immersive Fallout tabletop games for years - we started with the Fallout wargame experience, and then came the tabletop RPG.

<figcaption>Did you like <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>? Well, here's more of it.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To put it simply, despite the experimental nature of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>itself, you shouldn't expect anything too crazy and different from <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>.</p><p>This isn't a <em>Prey: Mooncrash </em>situation, in which the DLC completely transforms the nature of the base game; rather, it's an additional chunk of <em>Nightreign </em>for those who loved their time in Limveld.</p><p>Depending on what you wanted from <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, that may either come as a relief or an unpleasant surprise. For me, it was the former; I rather liked <em>Nightreign</em>, so I was glad for an excuse to be put back under its weird, wonderful spell.</p><p>This DLC's signature feature is its new Shifting Earth condition, which essentially transforms Limveld into a crystal-strewn underground paradise filled with treacherous chasms and precarious bridges.</p><p>It feels like an entirely new map, and when you first head into it, you can expect more than your fair share of confusion and untimely death as you learn its layout and its most optimal routes.</p><p>That's nothing new for <em>Nightreign</em>; although this new map can be a touch more punishing than Limveld proper, it's still just a matter of spending time with <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> until you're familiar with the area's contours and pitfalls.</p><p>Just like <em>Nightreign </em>itself, I'd very strongly recommend taking two friends with you into this DLC rather than relying on the kindness of strangers.</p><p><em>Nightreign </em>feels like it's built for groups who can communicate beyond the rather limited ping system; there's no built-in voice chat, and <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>' intricate map and brutal boss fights (more on which in a moment) demand co-ordination.</p><h2>Boy Howdy, <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>Sure Is Hard</h2><figure role="group">

<p>The base <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>experience was no slouch in the difficulty department, and <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>ratchets things up to a degree that might test your limits if you found <em>Nightreign </em>itself a challenge.</p><p>The two new Nightlords are fun, engaging additions to <em>Nightreign</em>'s boss canon; one is a group encounter that requires careful observation and management of multiple enemies, while the other is a classic, straightforward Soulslike battle with a fearsome, unpredictable foe.</p><p>They're tough, and they can test unprepared builds, but things really come to a head in the closing battles of each night prior to facing the Nightlords.</p><p>They contain some of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s most terrifyingly difficult fights, and if you're unprepared, you might find yourself scuppered. Expect to be thwarted at the end of day two more often than you're beaten by the Nightlords themselves.</p><p>That's fine in <em>Elden Ring </em>itself - or, indeed, any Soulslike with a liberal checkpoint system - but <em>Nightreign</em>'s boss run is essentially two entire in-game day cycles of exploring Limveld, so it can feel frustrating to fall at the final hurdle, knowing you'll have to repeat everything that's come before just for a chance to try again.</p><p>This is another reason you're going to want Nightfarers whom you trust by your side. Limveld isn't playing around, and players who don't know <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>' encounters can quickly be overwhelmed by its punishing difficulty.</p><h2>There Isn't Quite Enough in <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em></h2><figure role="group">

<p>Of course, punishing difficulty and bosses that reward careful observation and planning are part and parcel of the Soulslike experience, so even though <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>pushes things just a tad too far, it's still got some worthy additions to FromSoftware's boss canon.</p><p>The problem is that there just aren't quite enough of them. I counted eight new end-of-night bosses, all of whom return from either the original <em>Elden Ring</em>, its DLC, or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls-iii" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="668e9b25-a2a4-4068-948b-f4cadb234f16" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Souls </em>title</a> (or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-souls-iii-ringed-city-dlc-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9443ea1d-c1c8-4ffe-b9e9-889600c1099e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">associated DLC</a> thereof).</p><p>That might sound like a lot at first, but things quickly get repetitive, and it wasn't long before I was sighing in disappointment at the same encounter being laid before me for the sixth or seventh time in a row.</p><p>I have no knowledge of the technical side of things, but I can't imagine it would have been too much work to throw a few more <em>Elden Ring </em>or <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>bosses into this DLC, and it would have gone a long way towards alleviating the repetition.</p><p>There are also no new weapons on offer, which feels like a bizarre and unfortunate oversight. Creating new builds and finding fun synergies was a big part of <em>Nightreign</em>, so the fact that there's no new red meat for the crazy theorycrafters is a shame.</p><p>Two new characters are available to play in <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, and for me, one was significantly more interesting than the other.</p><p>The Undertaker is...well, she's fine. Perhaps I haven't grasped the nuances of the play style yet, but she prioritizes aggression and damage, which is okay. She's a perfectly acceptable addition to <em>Nightreign</em>'s roster, but I didn't find her particularly interesting.</p><p>However, the Scholar is a much more intriguing prospect. He's a support strategist, a role that none of <em>Nightreign</em>'s other classes fulfil, and his abilities are powerful for a co-ordinated party that knows what it's doing.</p><p>Neither of these characters is quite enough to stave off <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>feeling samey after a while, and they won't transform the game completely, but they're a fun enough diversion.</p><h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><figure role="group">

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows </em>is a worthwhile addition to the base game.&nbsp;</p><p>Its new bosses are fun, its underground crystal area is atmospheric (if daunting), and hey, it's an excuse to head back into the excellent <em>Nightreign </em>itself.&nbsp;</p><p>I just wish there was more of it, because repetition sets in far more quickly than I'd have liked. More weapons, a few more bosses, and perhaps one more Nightlord would have made this a must-play.&nbsp;</p><p>As it is, if you loved <em>Nightreign</em>, check this out, but if you're hoping for a <em>Mooncrash </em>or <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>-style revelation, you're better off sleeping through this particular night.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of around 14 hours of gameplay.
