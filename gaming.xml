			<p>If you're trying to decide whether you should be playing Baldur's Gate 3 on PlayStation 5 or PC and are feeling a little bit daunted by the specification requirements on PC, don't panic. It's been tested and confirmed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-baldurs-gate-3-on-ps5-is-effectively-the-pc-version-at-ultra-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those over at Eurogamer</a> that the settings on PlayStation 5 are essentially the same as the settings on PC if you were to play it on Ultra. Of course, many people are unable to do so, as the game is very graphically intensive, the world is expansive, and there are lots of visual effects that you need to contend with. Baldur's Gate 3 has been out on PC for quite a while, and since the start of its release, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-available-for-mac-and-consoles/">a number of fixes</a> to work on making the performance of the game better for rigs of all capabilities. While there was some concern about how Baldur's Gate 3 would run on PC, it's been confirmed that it runs fine in Act Three, but it suffers some of the same issues that the PC version does.</p>
<p>While the game is very obviously tailored with a Keyboard and Mouse in mind, the game works just fine with a controller on both PS5 and PC. At the start of the game, it's quite tolerable, and although it looks a little bit odd, it works. However, the more abilities and items you unlock and use, the more complicated your radial menus will get, which can make the interface incredibly overwhelming.</p>
<p>Although this doesn't really affect the performance of the game on PS5 in any way, it does make it a little bit more finicky to work with. Visually, the PS5 version is very similar to that on PC, and it looks almost the same as how it would if the game was being played on PC in ultra settings. Compared to other games on the console, this comes as quite a surprise. As explained in the article by Eurogamer, there are only two options available for image quality on the PS5, with the game being native to 1440p, with no signs of reconstruction or dynamic resolution. If you're unsure whether you should be playing the game in Quality or Performance mode, it doesn't really make much difference.</p>
<p>The Performance mode on PS5 looks very similar to the Quality Mode, but there is a little bit of artifacting and fizzing artifacts in areas that feature a lot of fine detail. This is to be expected, especially considering how they've tried to keep the game running at the highest quality.</p>
<p>When it comes to the performance of the game, the Performance mode of Baldur's Gate 3 on PS5 targets 60fps. For the vast majority, it does do just that, especially if you're inside or in enclosed spaces, even during combat. However, there are some areas that will start to struggle. Even on PC, the city in Act 3 struggles massively, so it's not a surprise that it struggles on the PS5, too. From the tests that Eurogamer ran, it seems that the performance drops to the low twenties when it's at its worst. They've also mentioned that there is a fair amount of screen tearing when the frame rate starts to dip from 60. There is, of course, the option to play the game using the Quality Mode, which easily sees Baldur's Gate 3 run at a target of 30fps. Regardless of being in Quality Mode, you will still see some issues in Act 3, with how densely populated the city is.</p>
<p>Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 has been confirmed by many to run fine on PS5, as long as you can get over the radial menus and get used to how janky they become later on down the line.</p>

<p>In order to cut costs, you have to spend money. Unity revealed on Thursday that it had to spend $205 million as part of its restructuring efforts — which included mass layoffs — throughout 2024.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001810806/16c99346-58d4-4022-924d-7cfefa4f7054.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to the company</a>, the money was spent mostly on “incremental” separation costs for the employees being let go. This included $127 million worth of “incremental stock-based compensation”. </p>



<h6 id="h-related-unity-s-new-ceo-nets-millions-months-after-layoffs-and-scandals">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-ceo-salary-new-bonus/">Unity’s New CEO Nets Millions Months After Layoffs and Scandals</a></h6>



<p>“Of the incremental employee separation costs, $15 million are within cost of revenue, $46 million are within research and development, $52 million are within sales and marketing, and $92 million are within general and administrative,” Unity said.</p>



<p>The company added that in they also had $45 million in restructuring costs related to office closures.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Unity announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-laying-off-25-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to let go 25%</a> of its workforce. The decision was made to allow the company to “focus on our core business and drive our long-term success and profitability”, according to CEO Jim Whitehurst.</p>



<p>The layoffs and changes came after Unity announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-to-charge-game-devs-per-game-install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial change</a> to its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-apologizes-again-announces-major-changes-to-runtime-fee-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runtime fees</a>. A change that was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-cancelling-controversial-runtime-fee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately reversed</a> after backlash.</p>



<p>As part of its earnings call, Unity revealed that it’ had $1.4 billion’s year-over-year revenue for the quarter fell to $446.5 million from $544.2. That’s despite operating expenses falling from $520.3 million to $461.6 million. Overall, the company reported a net loss  of $124.5 million for the third quarter.</p>

But in its recent financial report, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record">Microsoft sounded delighted with Black Ops 6’s early days performance</a>, saying sales on PlayStation and PC were 60% higher compared to the 2023 release of Modern Warfare 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes were on Black Ops 6’s impact on Game Pass, though. Growth in Microsoft’s subscription service has stalled in recent years, and the day one release of the latest entry in Activision’s phenomenally successful first-person shooter series was seen as a make or break moment for Game Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has yet to say exactly how many new subscribers Black Ops 6 brought through the door, although CEO Satya Nadella has confirmed that Game Pass set a record for new subs on launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie, who has worked on Call of Duty for 16 years, said Black Ops 6’s release on Game Pass has helped convince players who were “on the fence” to give the game a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we've seen is it's allowed people that might have been on the fence, might have had some of that friction, might have been like, 'I haven't played in a while' to actually come back and try the game," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That will be music to Microsoft’s ears, given it’s desperate to expand the Call of Duty audience in the long term. Analysts have suggested the company was willing to sacrifice Black Ops 6 launch sales on Xbox for a potential bigger overall player base, which it intends to monetize long-term with the release of battle passes and cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've gotten to the point now where Black Ops and Call of Duty have been around so long - I've been working on it for 16 years," Leslie added. "And really the challenge for us is how do you bring along the fans that love Call of Duty, but how do you create an environment where you can welcome new fans in?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trick now of course is to convince Game Pass players to stick around and keep paying that monthly subscription.

These co-op missions are set during the game’s campaign, but with different characters who are off doing other missions that tie in to the events that follow main character Titus.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Operations mode restricts a squad to one Space Marine of each class. So, for example, it is impossible to have an all-sniper team (developer Saber has said this is a deliberate design decision to encourage “strategic variety.”)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is Space Marine 2 will actively matchmake you into a group with a player who is the same class as the one you have selected. In-game, there is an area of the Battle Barge where players must “assemble” before an Operations mode mission kicks off. The countdown only begins when all three players have selected a different class. This means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together">you can end up in awkward standoffs where two or more players want to be the same class</a>, each waiting for the other to blink first and switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a frustration that often bubbles up on Space Marine 2 Discords, subreddits, and on social media as players work to level up certain classes above others. Staff at Saber have said class matching is on the cards, but modders have already gone one step further and removed the class limits in Operations mode entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Astartes Overhaul, from Tom, aka Warhammer Workshop, is perhaps the most significant mod yet for Space Marine 2. This massive upgrade to Space Marine 2 gameplay, available to download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/89" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus</a>, lets players select any squad configuration without class restrictions, among many other changes that affect the balance of Operations mode. So, if you want an all-sniper team, you can have it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/sm2-1731072484969.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2 modders have unlocked customization options currently unavailable otherwise.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Remarkably, the changes Space Marine 2 mods make to the Space Marines themselves, whether it’s a purely aesthetic customization not normally possible or certain classes using weapons and equipment they’re not supposed to, can be seen online by other players in public PvE sessions. While Space Marine 2 uses dedicated servers, a lot of the game elements are client-side controlled. So if you’re playing with random players, there’s a chance you might see things like Bulwarks wielding Thunder Hammers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-update-40-secretly-clamped-down-on-pvp-modding-publisher-confirms-but-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-pve-modding">Space Marine 2 publisher Focus Entertainment has confirmed to IGN that it has no problem whatsoever with PvE modding</a>, but Tom is playing it safe. He recommends those who use the Astartes Overhaul mod stick to private lobbies “to minimize disruption to other players' games.” “Keeping the Overhaul in private lobbies helps ensure a positive experience for all players,” he continued. “Your support in keeping things balanced is hugely appreciated!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No class limits in Operations isn’t all the Astartes Overhaul mod does. It even adds allied reinforcements to the Operations missions. This means you’ll encounter various allies who bring fresh support to each mission, including Imperial Guard soldiers, Space Marines, and even Dreadnoughts.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/emblems-1731072535187.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Astartes Overhaul adds new Chapter emblems for Warhammer 40,000 lore fans to tinker with.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the mod adds a ton of new Chapter emblems, an expanded arsenal of weapons for each operator, an expanded enemy roster (including early access to a new enemy type), “lore accurate” weapon buffs (“Bolters and other iconic weapons have been rebalanced for that real 40K punch”), new mid-operation checkpoints, new takedown animations, and new Retributor cosmetics and customizable Mark 8 armor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of Retributor cosmetics is notable because the Loyalist Space Marine Chapter starred in Syama Pederson’s much-loved fan-made YouTube video series Astartes. Speaking to IGN last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-developer-used-the-best-warhammer-40000-fan-film-ever-as-a-reference-point">Saber creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick namechecked Astartes as his favorite reference point for the look of the game's Space Marines</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He got the sound of them walking down those corridors… ker-klonk, ker-klonk-ker-klonk… but when they move it’s straight away like they’re predatory animals," Hollis-Leick said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>Gaijin Entertainment has not one but two games enhanced for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's newly released PS5 Pro console</a> at launch: the first-person tactical multiplayer WWII shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/military-online-shooter-enlisted-open-beta-is-now-available-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enlisted</a>, originally released in 2020, and the vehicle combat multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/cross-play-between-pc-ps4-xb1-is-finally-out-in-war-thunder-after-over-a-year-of-talks-with-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">War Thunder</a>, which has been continuously updated since 2013.</p>
<p>To learn how both games have been improved to leverage the most powerful console hardware currently on the market, we interviewed Gergo Horvath, a Graphics Programmer on Gaijin's proprietary Dagor Engine for over four years. Horvath admitted that the PlayStation 5 Pro's improvement over the PS5 is smaller than that seen in the previous generation between PS4 Pro and PS4, but he believes the console achieves its goal anyway, mainly thanks to PSSR, which he reckons is superior to AMD FSR and on the same level of NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS.</p>
<p>Keep scrolling to read the full Q&amp;A.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enlisted — PS5 Pro Enhanced" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob08o1dN_PE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What's the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>While the ~45% faster rendering is impressive alone, the real game changer, in my opinion, is the addition of the Machine Learning Architecture that made PSSR possible. By being able to render in lower resolutions and yet get the same visual fidelity we can free up a tremendous amount of resources. This tech will be especially useful when paired with ray tracing.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is more or less significant)?</strong></p>
<p>I’d say the difference between the PS5 Pro and the PS5 is less substantial compared to the difference between the last-gen console and its Pro counterpart. In the PS5 Pro, we have little to no change in CPU performance, and while the GPU got a nice boost, the difference is much less significant: the PS4 Pro had more than doubled the nominal power of its predecessor's GPU (in terms of TFLOPS). With that being said, back then, the goal was to achieve 4K gaming. This time, it looks like the main focus was on providing substantially better ray tracing. Goal achieved in both cases.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game? Can you share specific details on the target resolution and frame rate and whether there will be multiple modes to choose from?</strong></p>
<p>For the PS5 Pro’s release of Enlisted, we have switched from a fixed resolution to using dynamic resolution together with upscaling techniques for both the Base and the Pro version of the console to make sure we have a stable frame rate at all times while the internal rendering resolution is automatically adjusted. This made 4K@120FPS gaming possible for PS5 Pro players. On the PS5 Pro, this will mean higher rendering resolution, which will lead to more detail rich and sharper visuals. With the faster memory, we could use higher resolution textures and better looking global illumination, which together enhance details even further.</p>
<p>Upscaling from the internal rendering resolution to the display’s resolution is taken care of by our own TAAU implementation for Base PS5, but we are using PSSR for the Pro version. PSSR, of course, does a better job. For the PS5 Pro’s release of War Thunder we’ll offer the opportunity to play the game at 4K@120FPS resolution from day one. More visual updates will follow with the next major update release in a week, and even more are under development.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to other upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>We’re currently using it in Enlisted. During development and playtesting, we’ve found PSSR to be on par with NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS, the other two ML based super resolution methods. While in my opinion PSSR produces less blur, ghosting, and unwanted flicker compared to AMD FSR. These technologies are constantly improving, so I find it impressive that the first version of PSSR is already head-to-head with other more mature solutions.</p>
<p><strong>How does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Will the PS5 Pro version feature the highest graphics settings available on PC?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say we are about 75% to being maxed-out for Enlisted. We’ll give our estimate for War Thunder later when we’ll have all our visual updates implemented.</p>
<p><strong>The big controversy about Sony's new console is pricing. Based on the hardware, do you believe it to be fair or excessive?</strong></p>
<p>It’s always up to the gamers to decide whether the console pricing is up to their expectations or not. Calculating a “fair price” by assessing hardware alone does not make much sense, as gamers usually make their decision based on new experiences offered by a device, and not based on the hardware alone.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-51-release-date">last month's Version 5.1</a>,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.2 officially arrives on November 20th, alongside the long-awaited Xbox Series X|S version of the game. There's still no word on when - or, at this point, whether - the game will be appearing on Switch, however.</p>

<p>In any case, Version 5.2 will introduce two new Saurians to get to grips with: Qucusaurs and Iktomisaurs. They'll help you to reach new areas, find hidden treasure, and even engage enemies in combat, and they'll be introduced alongside two new Natlan clans, the Flower-Feather Clan and the Masters of the Night Wind.</p>

Chasca, the Peacemaker of the Flower-Feather Clan, is a five-star Anemo bow user who can "float and attack mid-air".</p>

<p>She's joined by Ororon, a four-star bow user who wields the Electro element. He can deal damage, taunt enemies, and even boost your team's gliding speed, making him invaluable in exploration as well as combat.</p>

<p>Both characters will debut as part of the first half of Version 5.2's Event Wishes, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-celebrates-version-40-release-with-lyneys-gameplay-trailer">Lyney</a>. In the second half of the update's cycle, you can expect reruns of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zhongli-conducts-in-lovely-genshin-impact-anime-style-trailer-teasing-upcoming-concert">Zhongli</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-reveals-handsome-new-characters-neuvillette-wriothesley">Neuvillette</a>.</p>

<p>Naturally, you can also look forward to new story quests, a brand new boss to take on, and "an array of quality-of-life updates" to make your&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>gameplay experience smoother.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/humankind-developer-amplitude-studios-splits-from-sega-and-goes-indie.1030866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amplitude-studios-sega-split-indie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Humankind&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Endless Dungeon&nbsp;</em>developer Amplitude Studios has announced that it's split from Sega and gone independent, with the studio describing the move as a return to its "roots".</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1124300/view/4465975096247320950" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>&nbsp;(which can be seen across all of Amplitude's games on the platform), Amplitude says its journey with Sega "has been amazing", but that ownership of the studio has returned "to some of our original founders and members of the team".</p>

<p>According to Amplitude, its parting with Sega happened on "good terms", and the studio remains committed to "working closely with our players", which it says is still very much at the "heart of our philosophy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-endless-legend.jpg?itok=q48AdpjT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-endless-legend.jpg?itok=ZeWbq08T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Endless Legend&nbsp;</em>developer Amplitude Studios has said goodbye to its former owner Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned Steam post, Amplitude founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis says the studio currently has two projects in development, describing them as "exciting", although he doesn't elaborate on what they might be.</p>

<p>He also says Amplitude is "backed by strong and meaningful franchises", and that the decision to go independent allows the studio to "be more agile in our approach".</p>

<p>Amplitude Studios was first founded back in 2011, with ex-Ubisoft staffers de Waubert de Genlis and Mathieu Girard setting up the company. The first game released by Amplitude was 2012's&nbsp;<em>Endless Space</em>, which kicked off the&nbsp;<em>Endless&nbsp;</em>series of strategy-focused games.</p>

<p>Said series continued with 2014's turn-based 4X game&nbsp;<em>Endless Legend</em>&nbsp;and tower defense roguelike&nbsp;<em>Dungeon of the Endless</em>, which was released in the same year. Following these releases, Sega snapped up Amplitude in 2016.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-dungeon-of-the-endless.jpg?itok=WdVRWsbJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-dungeon-of-the-endless.jpg?itok=h_pO6JOy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amplitude Studios is working on two new games, although we don't know what they are yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Amplitude's first game under Sega's wing was 2017's&nbsp;<em>Endless Space 2</em>, a followup to the developer's debut game, and that was followed up by an experimental visual novel,&nbsp;<em>Love Thyself - A Horatio Story</em>, which is again set in the&nbsp;<em>Endless&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>It wouldn't take long for Amplitude to return to strategy development, though, with 2021's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/humankind">Humankind</a>&nbsp;</em>(not to be confused with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ancestors-humankind-odyssey"><em>Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey</em></a>) attempting to rival&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>in terms of scope and system complexity.</p>

<p>The studio's most recent project is&nbsp;<em>Endless Dungeon</em>, a successor to-come-reimagining of <i>Dungeon of the Endless&nbsp;</i>that features a new 3D art style and plenty of additional mechanics to wrap your brain around.</p>

For the first time in a long time, the lineup makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Then it’s gaming time.

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's creative director has commented on how Game Pass positively affected the game's launch, saying it helped improve player numbers in multiple ways.</p><p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bbbc.news.twitter%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D&amp;at_link_id=67BD7544-9D06-11EF-9772-A1520462CD00&amp;at_link_type=web_link&amp;at_campaign=Social_Flow&amp;at_format=link&amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;at_ptr_name=twitter&amp;at_bbc_team=editorial&amp;at_link_origin=BBCNews&amp;at_medium=social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a>, Miles Leslie said Game Pass helped convince people who were "on the fence" or "had some of that friction" to consider playing the game. He added that some people who might not have played a Call of Duty game in some time might have been convinced to "come back and try the game" thanks to Game Pass.</p><p>"We've gotten to the point now where Black Ops and Call of Duty have been around so long--I've been working on it for 16 years," Leslie said. "And really the challenge for us is how do you bring along the fans that love Call of Duty, but how do you create an environment where you can welcome new fans in?"</p><p>Black Ops 6 launched on October 25 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">set a number of records for number of players</a>, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella specifically mentioned Black Ops 6 helping to drive Game Pass subscribers at launch. Anyone who has Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month) or PC Game Pass ($12/month) can play Black Ops 6 as part of their subscription for as long as their membership remains active. The game is also available for direct purchase on Xbox, as well as PlayStation and PC.</p><p>Before this, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he anticipated Call of Duty helping to drive Game Pass subscribers for Microsoft, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">only for a period of time.</a> As Zelnick sees it, releasing a major new game into a subscription service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">makes little sense and is a "lost opportunity" for sales.</a> Zelnick, of course, runs a third-party publisher and has his own set of unique opinions for his business that might not compare directly to Microsoft's own business objectives.</p><p>Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft putting Black Ops 6 could lead to up to six million in lost sales; he estimated that 25% of existing Game Pass subscribers would have bought it anyway. Pachter said Microsoft could see as many as four million new Game Pass subscribers thanks to Black Ops 6.</p><p>Microsoft has not yet provided any specifics on Black Ops 6 unit sales. The game is also available on PlayStation and PC, where it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">enjoying strong year-over-year sales compared to 2023's Modern Warfare III.</a></p><p>Black Ops 6 welcomes its first major update, the Season 1 launch, on November 14. It adds new multiplayer maps and modes, along with more guns and even a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-lets-you-become-a-gruesome-killer-with-power-drill-melee-weapon/1100-6527640/" data-ref-id="1100-6527640">power drill melee weapon</a>. November 14 is also the day when Black Ops 6 gets integrated into Call of Duty: Warzone, and when the new Warzone map, Area 99, arrives.</p>

href="https://t.co/azHqjVVSAu" rel="nofollow ">official inZOI Discord server</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"First, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to inZOI fans around the world. Your immense love and interest mean everything to us. I was especially touched by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/inzoi-blew-us-away-with-just-how-much-stuff-you-can-do-gamescom-2024/2300-6464969/">the wonderful reception we received at Gamescom</a>, and it was incredible to see everyone creating such unique Zois during our 'inZOI: Character Studio' demo period," Kim said.</p><p dir="ltr">After expressing gratitude to the many players who tried out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-upcoming-the-sims-competitor-shares-dev-roadmap-and-stunning-character-creator/1100-6523036/">the game's Zoi creator</a> during a community test-run of the feature, Kim detailed the reasons behind the delay.</p><p dir="ltr">"After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have decided to release inZOI in early access on March 28, 2025," Kim revealed. "We apologize that we couldn't bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI--a game that we will be nurturing together from its early access birth. This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible."</p><p dir="ltr">As incredible as it looks, inZOI has several other competitors in the life-sim genre. Although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/life-by-you/">Life By You</a> was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/life-by-you-the-highly-anticipated-life-sim-has-been-canceled/1100-6524334/">canceled</a>, another life sim called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118520/Paralives/" rel="nofollow ">Paralives</a> is set to enter early access sometime in early 2025, and EA has reaffirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wont-drop-sims-4-support-when-project-rene-comes-out/1100-6526534/">its commitment to improving The Sims 4</a> while also working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-project-rene/">Project Rene</a>, a multiplayer Sims-like experience. Still, inZOI includes a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-gamescom-trailer-shows-the-joy-and-pain-of-everyday-life/1100-6525913/">plethora of interesting features</a>, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-life-sim-inzoi-you-can-crash-cars-ride-rollercosters-and-commune-with-ghosts/1100-6526125/">Zois crashing their cars to communing with ghosts</a>, that--combined with its stunning visuals--have players eager to get their hands on the game. But Kim says the wait will be worth it.</p><p dir="ltr">"Until the release date, we'll continue working to improve any areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation," he explained.</p><p dir="ltr">Kim ended his letter with a promise to keep fans updated on the game's future, and said the development stream is striving to create a life sim with a healthy lifespan.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come."</p>

<p>During the QA Section of Bandai Namco’s latest earnings call, it was revealed that most of the sales for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero came from Europe and North America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-saw-outstanding-sales-and-bandai-namco-says-roughly-90-percent-of-that-was-from-european-and-north-american-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20241106_qa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that Dragon Ball Sparking Zero “has been a hit mainly overseas, with sales in Europe and the US accounting for about 90% of the game’s sales” (as translated by Google). The publishers changed their global marketing structure for Japan and North America at the start of this fiscal year. They formed different strategies for approach according to the region they were targeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bandai Namco explained that Sparking Zero’s marketing primarily focused on social media for most regions. However, for specific areas, they also hosted on-ground events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is a direct instalment to the iconic Budokai Tenkaichi series, which was dormant for over a decade. The developers have put real thought into the title’s gameplay, and combining that with its spectacular visuals and varying game modes; it has become a recipe for success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While in early access, the game beat the concurrent numbers of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-tops-all-dragon-ball-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all Dragon Ball titles and other fighting games on Steam</a>. It also sold over 3 million copies within the first 24 hours. The overall popularity of the title has also <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/en_20241106_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">significantly impacted</a> their “Toys and Hobby” businesses, helping them beat “previous forecasts.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> may be one of the most popular gaming platforms in the world, but it's also been repeatedly accused of failing to protect children who use it from would-be predators. Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-banned-in-turkey-over-child-exploitation-concerns/1100-6525659/" data-ref-id="1100-6525659">Roblox was banned in Turkey</a> over child exploitation concerns. Now, The Roblox Corporation has announced plans to prevent illegal exploitation by placing new restrictions on the platform's youngest users.</p><p>As laid out <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updating-experience-guideline-policies-to-keep-our-younger-users-safe/3249079" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Roblox's official developer's forum</a>, children under the age of 13 will no longer be allowed access to unrated experiences created within the platform. Additionally, only children 13 and older will be allowed to utilize the social hangouts and free-form user-creation experiences.</p><p>Will that be enough for Roblox to quiet critics and solve the issue of children being targeted by predators on the platform? It depends on how successful the new measures are. According to a story filed in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> earlier this year, The Roblox Corporation itself reported over 13,000 instances of child exploitation to authorities in 2023, and two dozen people had been arrested for abusing children after making contact with them through the platform. The Roblox Corporation <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to that report</a> by saying that it didn't contextualize the scale of the issue with the size of the platform's massive user base. The company also touted its work with law enforcement to tackle illegal activity on the platform.</p><p>The new restrictions for players under 13 will go into effect on December 3. At the moment, Roblox is leaving the rating of the restricted content to the users, but the company will integrate the rating into the process of publishing new experiences at some point in the future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-sales-hit-1-5m-in-nine-weeks-sony-reveals.1030827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has revealed its financial results for the second quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and they contain some rather reassuring news about&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>sales, especially if you're a 3D platforming fan.</p>

<p>According to a report summarizing the company's financial performance this quarter,&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>has sold 1.5 million copies in the nine weeks since it was released, which Sony says qualifies the game as "a hit".</p>

<p>The report says that 37% of users who bought&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>hadn't picked up a first-party Sony title in the last two years, and that the percentage of younger gamers and families who bought the game was "much higher than other titles", contributing to a "widening of [Sony's] user base".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials-platforming.jpg?itok=sajYTDe0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials-platforming.jpg?itok=cL9a_i3q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is "a hit" with younger players and families, according to Sony.</figcaption></figure><p>In the report, Sony also makes reference to the two live-service games it's released so far this year, namely&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</p>

<p>Of the former, Sony says it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales">was a "huge hit"</a>, although the company does rather conspicuously omit the controversy surrounding the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">need for a PSN account</a> to play the game on PC (which was later <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">rescinded after a widespread backlash</a>).</p>

<p><em>Concord</em>, meanwhile, "ended up being shut down", as Sony says, although that's rather understating the catastrophe the game turned out to be; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">shut down just two weeks after its launch</a>, and last month, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator">closed down the game's developer Firewalk</a>.</p>

<p>In numbers terms, Sony's gaming sales increased by 12% on a year-on-year basis, driven mainly by "third-party software sales", including "a new sports title" (likely&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana"><em>EA Sports College Football</em></a>)&nbsp;and "an action RPG title from China" (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m">probably&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-ps5-sony-financials.jpg?itok=G_qyUeFa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-ps5-sony-financials.jpg?itok=TTgmVLUB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An "action RPG title from China" helped to drive strong PS5 software sales this quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>That strong performance has apparently helped to offset a decline in PS5 hardware sales, although it is worth noting that this quarter ends in September, so it doesn't include sales of the PS5 Pro, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november">was released yesterday</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-developer-reveals-patents-nintendo-says-its-infringed-plus-lawsuit-demands.1030824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>studio Pocketpair has outlined the terms of Nintendo's patent infringement lawsuit against its game, and it looks like there are three patents Nintendo is basing its attack on.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the official Pocketpair website</a>, Nintendo is seeking "an injunction against&nbsp;<em>Palworld"</em>, as well as five million yen payments to both The Pokemon Company and Nintendo itself, in addition to "late payment damages".</p>

<p>The patents Nintendo is accusing Pocketpair of infringing were all apparently filed (or at least published) after&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was released, and they're all <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2024-032983/10/ja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">related</a> to various <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2024-123560/10/ja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">functions</a> within <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2024-026645/10/ja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">videogames</a>, including one that pertains to a method of throwing an object in order to capture a creature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-airborne-pal.jpg?itok=afVM1Yi7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-airborne-pal.jpg?itok=QWIFySw6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We now know which patents Nintendo is going after&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair for.</figcaption></figure><p>The injunction Nintendo is seeking against&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>would presumably involve the game no longer being available to buy in Japan, although since this is a Japanese lawsuit, it's not likely Nintendo could block Pocketpair from selling the game elsewhere.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with this&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>lawsuit, it was filed against Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">back in September</a>, with Nintendo alleging that the Japanese studio had infringed on its patents.</p>

<p>Initially, it seemed like the lawsuit might block the release of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release">on PS5 in Japan</a>, but Pocketpair went ahead and launched&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on PS5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release-japan">in early October</a>, just in time for several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins">new Halloween skins</a> to arrive.</p>

<p>Since the patents in question were approved after the launch of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, Nintendo's legal action seems a touch opportunistic to me, but then Nintendo has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-loses-appeal-in-nintendo-eshop-lawsuit-in-germany">pretty rich history</a> of aggressively <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-dmcas-zelda-pitch-documentary">pursuing legal claims</a> (especially where its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-missing-link-dmcad-by-nintendo">IP is concerned</a>), so perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-warsect.jpg?itok=jn3lp-En 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-warsect.jpg?itok=ZQBUilkD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is far from Nintendo's first legal target.</figcaption></figure><p>As for&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an open-world creature-collecting survival game that blends the gotta-catch-'em-all aspect of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with the gameplay of games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>

<p>You'll fend for yourself in a hostile world filled with Pals, creatures you can befriend (or enslave) as you see fit, and you'll need to build bases, fend off attacks from aggressive Pals, and generally carve out a life for yourself.</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/palworld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has stated that he is “not really worried” about GTA 6 running on the Xbox Series S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the latest Take-Two <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/06/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q2-2025-earning/?irclickid=wQIV77RNJxyKWsB3AWwmhXdXUkCTkgySWUGN2E0&amp;utm_campaign=mpid&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;irgwc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>, Zelnick was asked whether the team was concerned about GTA 6 facing problems on the Xbox Series S, as the title could potentially be one of the most advanced games to date. Zelnick replied that they would continue supporting platforms as long as consumers were on them. “Despite different levels of tech”, the team will “find a way to support platforms”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelnick said he’s not worried about hardware advancements and doesn’t worry about things he has zero control over. He believes in the audience, and if the audience shows up for their properties, they “have to make sure to be on an array of platforms.” From the looks of it, GTA 6 should be fine on the Xbox Series S. </p>



<p>Zelnick also discussed PCs and how open formats will continue to grow. Take-Two believes the PC platform is “a more and more important part of the console business going forward,” which isn’t a problem to support. Zelnick concluded, “We make the tech work when we can make it work as long as the audience is big enough to make that worthwhile.” GTA 6 does not yet have a release window for PCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two has confirmed that GTA 6 and Borderlands 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-will-not-release-close-to-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not release close to each other</a>. Also, Rockstar once thought ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-age-of-trump-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the age of Trump</a>’ would mess with GTA 6.

<p>New details have emerged on Nintendo’s lawsuit against PocketPair’s Palworld over alleged Pokémon Patent Infringement.</p>



<p>The news came from PocketPair earlier today, which revealed that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company is actively seeking 10 Million Yen (around $66,000 USD) in damages over alleged patent infringement.</p>



<p>According to Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, Palword developers PocketPair infringed on three different patents.</p>



<p><strong>Patent No. 7545191<br></strong>[Patent application date: July 30, 2024]<br>[Patent registration date: August 27, 2024]</p>



<p><strong>Patent No. 7493117<br></strong>[Patent application date: February 26, 2024]<br>[Patent registration date: May 22, 2024]</p>



<p><strong>Patent No. 7528390<br></strong>[Patent application date: March 5, 2024]<br>[Patent registration date: July 26, 2024]</p>



<p>The patent dates have caused some confusion online. Some question whether Nintendo can sue for patents that were applied for and registered after the release of Palworld, which was released on January 19, 2024. For those confused, Nintendo has done what’s called ‘Parent Patenting,’ essentially connecting the new patents to existing ones and making them valid.</p>



<p>PocketPair say that they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings” on the lawsuit. The claim states that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are requesting:</p>



<ul>
<li>Payment of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to The Pokémon Company</li>



<li>Payment of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to Nintendo Co., Ltd.</li>
</ul>
