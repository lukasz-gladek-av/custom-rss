			<p>After a pretty abysmal live stream where Bungie defeatedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">confirmed that one of its developers had lifted the work of another artist and put it in its new shooter</a>, Marathon, without permission, attribution, or compensation, you could practically taste the delay announcement incoming. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-rumor-of-no-marketing-plans-suggests-potential-delay/">A sudden lack of any marketing</a> for Marathon further pushed the rumour of a delay, and a month later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">by June 2025, it was official</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, we've not seen hide nor hair of Marathon (though Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-star-wars-expansion-renegades-bungie/">has been active with new Destiny 2 content</a>), and you would absolutely not be the first to have speculated that the game was never going to come back. Not so, it would seem. Bungie proved, at least to some degree, that Marathon is not dead, and has opened a new round of sign-ups for a Closed Technical Test taking place later this month.</p>



<p>The test is invite-only, and players wishing to participate will have to sign an NDA in order to do so. The test will run later this month, from October 22-27, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply">blog post on Bungie's website,</a> the studio adds that it has been running closed tests since June, and this is the first one it is looking to open up to more players. The test will include three maps, proximity chat, a solo queue, and "<em>re-tuned</em>" combat.</p>



<p>Bungie claims it'll talk more about what's next for Marathon at some point after the conclusion of the test. The last we heard about Marathon's release window is that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">currently set for sometime in March 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>
In the late '90s, early 2000s, there were two distinct flavours of aesthetics: boomer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, and Y2K girlypop vibes (for the sake of this argument we will ignore every other aesthetic that existed at the time). Boomer shooters like Doom and Wolfenstein were bloody, gory, and had a real "video games are gritty and cool now kind of vibe." Conversely, products aimed at young girls were often glittery, pink, featured leopard print, and were often about love and harmony. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/incolatus-dont-stop-girlypop">Don't Stop, Girlypop!</a> is a game that combines these two vibes, and it is very good (and stressful).
</p>
<p>
Quite specifically, Don't Stop, Girlypop is a self-described "Y2K arena movement shooter where standing still is not an option." You really do have to be constantly on the move, there's even a combo meter that raises higher and higher letting you go faster and subsequently damage more. I had a go at its new demo that just came out today, and let me tell you, I felt like I was having a heart attack, in as positive a way as I can put that.
</p>
<p>
This is a game where calling it maximalist would be an understatement. There's flip phones, you can customise your arms to have funky patterns, you can put little bows on your guns, enemies are constantly coming at you from all angles, and you need to be ready to take them down quickly, because everything moves fast in this world. The thing is, I'm not very good at shooters, so in my experience of its demo, I quickly got overwhelmed. Even still I could find myself learning the ropes as I went along, and I'm sure more experienced shooter aficionados could get to grips with it pretty quickly.
</p>
<p>
Outside of loving its vibe, I'm into the equally over the top story - "Mining corp Tigris Nix wants to drain your world of The Love, a natural force keeping your planet alive. Lay waste to its robot drones to heal the Oasis!" That's all ridiculous! Yet it matches the tone of its look, and has a healthy amount of corporation frustration, always an added bonus in my eyes.
</p>
<p>
Don't Stop, Girlypop! doesn't have a release date just yet, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/">but you can wishlist it and try out its demo on Steam now</a>.

The creative direction, permeating enemy designs, architecture, and even the language of signage outside facilities of interest are all rooted in the cultural influences that the team grew up within.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This identity, as CEO and co-founder David Carrasco told Game Developer at Tokyo Game Show, was a hard sell for some when searching for a publisher.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Without saying names, some mentioned it, but one specific publisher asked us to translate the signage to English," Carrasco said. "To us, that was almost untouchable, because if we're trying to propose a game with Hispanic folklore and with such a strong traditional component, doing so would dramatically decrease its veracity. It's like making a game with Samurais where everything is in English."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even amidst visual references and signage in Spanish, Carrasco said the team worked on the concept of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crisol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with an international audience in mind. For example, if a player approaches one of these signs, an in-game caption translates them. But some publishers expressed zero interest in this, or in the cultural aspect altogether.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There was one publisher who said, 'but who's gonna be interested in Hispanic culture, in Spanish culture?,' to which we said, in God of War, who's gonna be interested in Vikings? You don't need to be knowledgeable of Hispanic philosophy or art history to want to play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crisol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But you put these things in there and there'll be people who will be interested."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/indie-hit-megabonk-moves-over-a-million-copies-in-two-weeks" target="_self" data-discover="true">Indie hit Megabonk moves over a million copies in two weeks</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vermila has been working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crisol </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">for over five years, with the game slated for launch in early 2026. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/thq-parent-company-embracer-has-purchased-i-metro-i-dev-4a-games-and-others">Embracer Group acquired</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the studio in August 2020 for €0.9 million (around $1.06 million at the time), and according to the official site, the team also received a MegaGrant funding from Epic Games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The survival horror of scope creep">The survival horror of scope creep</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As time passed, Carrasco explained that the studio's debut project considerably grew in size. For reference, the team is composed of 20 people and some contractors. Vermila then reacquired itself, and spent what Carrasco called a considerable time looking for a new publisher.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We've already suffered in the desert, but given the chance to do it all over again, I'd have probably made a smaller project, something we could have tackled in two to three years," he said. "But in the end, with this being such a big project with a small team and such a high production level, it had a strong impact when we started looking for funding and [to] garner publisher interest. You're not saying, 'I need a small amount of money,' you're saying, 'not only do I need a much bigger amount, but instead of projecting this game six months from now, it's going to take two years.'"</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/funcom-is-closing-metal-hellslinger-developer-the-outsiders" target="_self" data-discover="true">Funcom is closing Metal: Hellsinger developer The Outsiders</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Carrasco said Vermila signed with Blumhouse Games around a year and a half ago, and that the publisher has granted the team "tremendous" creative and artistic freedom. The developer had a second "finalist" in mind that offered a similar approach, but as Carrasco explained, finding publishers willing to grant this autonomy is far from easy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are publishers who take a look and say, I want this graphics quality, I'm very interested in the mechanic about using blood to reload weapons, and I see you build levels well, but I really don't care about those Spanish things," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Carrasco recalled a publisher's suggestion to center </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crisol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> around an undisclosed country's civil war. He argued that it's better to speak about what you know and what you grew up with, as opposed to another country's culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But some of the proposed changes sought to alter the game almost entirely. According to Carrasco, Vermila was asked to replace the game's religious statues with zombies or soldiers. When he tried to counter that doing so would drain the meaning from the story and original concept, he was told that "it has the meaning that I want, because I'm the one who has the money."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloverpit-has-sold-500-000-units-in-eight-days" target="_self" data-discover="true">CloverPit has sold 500,000 units in eight days</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Publisher pressure can crush authenticity">Publisher pressure can crush authenticity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As anecdotal as these conversations are, Carrasco emphasized the serious pressure of having to make decisions to keep the lights on, and how that can sometimes compromise a project's creative vision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As you search for publishers who give you more freedom, the closer you're getting to the end of your capital, the less you start caring, because what you want is for the company to stay alive and to at least release the game in the best possible state," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While he wouldn't call it a common occurrence, he said there are many companies who see an opportunity to make money with a game, and feel entitled to ask for changes because they can offer five, 10, or 20 million dollars. Going back to the example of the publisher asking to translate the signage to English, Carrasco said he would have made the compromise if he didn't have another choice, even if he wouldn't have been happy about it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Accepting certain fundings is dependent on the current situation of a studio and the state of a project," Carrasco said. "In many cases, they can turn your game into something much more generic or simplified that is drowned in a sea of projects with a similar style or genre. But perhaps that publisher makes the most sense and, well, if you have the financial need and don't have the money to stay afloat, then you have to start making decisions that oppose your artistic goals."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.

<figure data-uuid="8c96ac7ff2dc7"><a title="Sonic x Olympics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c96ac7ff2dc7/sonic-x-olympics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / International Olympic Committee</em></figcaption></figure><p>SEGA and the International Olympic Committee have today announced that they are teaming up on a new "co-branded merchandising programme" featuring none other than Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>The multi-year deal will see the blue blur cropping up alongside the Olympic rings in a whole range of merch planned for release next year. According to the <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-and-sega-announce-multi-year-licensing-agreement-featuring-sonic-the-hedgehog">official announcement</a>, SEGA and the IOC will now "explore opportunities to license the new designs for select merchandise collaborations", and we got the following first look at the 'Five Rings' collaboration to boot.</p>

<p>To be clear, the only specific that we've got so far is that the collaboration will feature <em>merchandise</em>. Importantly, that's not games. But come on, you know where everyone's mind went...</p>
<p>The collab announcements on the <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1975184289622065600">official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sonic-official.bsky.social/post/3m2jo6phzuk2k">BlueSky</a> accounts have been awash with replies hopeful of an '<strong>at the Olympic Games</strong>' comeback. Of course, Nintendo — and therefore, Mario — doesn't appear to be on board yet, but let's not pretend that Sonic hasn't had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/05/sonic_ditches_mario_in_his_very_own_olympic_games_tokyo_2020_release">solo Olympic adventures</a> in the past too.</p>




<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/rumour-mario-and-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-finished">last we heard</a>, the Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games series was dead in the water after the IOC apparently chose to end its partnership with Nintendo and SEGA to focus on NFTs and esports. That was according to series veteran Lee Cocker, who, after working on each entry in the franchise, claimed that it was "finished" after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_sonic_at_the_olympic_games_tokyo_2020">Tokyo 2020</a> instalment.</p>
<p>Whether the series actually returns or not remains to be seen, but at least the IOC and SEGA are back on speaking terms. We'll be keeping an eye out over the coming year for more information.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/most-movies-are-%E2%80%98s-%E2%80%99-so-ridley-scott-just-goes-back-and-watches-his-own.1317871/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ridley Scott is one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ridley-scott-movies-ranked-gladiator-ii-1851701914">most prodigious directors</a> working in Hollywood right now. Every movie studio seems content to lavish him with massive budgets no matter how tenuous the pitch. But the filmmaker behind <em>Blade Runner</em> and other classics has grown unimpressed with what everyone else around him is producing. “The quantity of movies that are made today, literally globally–millions. Not thousands, millions,” he said during an interview this weekend. “And most of it is shit.”</p> <p>The choice comments came during a retrospective on his career at the BFI Southbank in London, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/ridley-scott-hollywood-drowning-in-mediocrity-1236570875/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a>. Scott, whose 2024 blockbuster <em>Gladiator II</em> at one point featured a mostly green-screened sea battle within a colosseum with massive sharks, lamented that too many bad films are “saved” with digital effects added in post-production instead of relying on solid scripts.</p>

 <p>Scott was asked if he has any movie comfort foods. Why yes, yes he does: his own movies.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I watched Alien with his commentary last night and every other scene he said something along the lines of “damn that’s good” or “it hasn't aged at all” and I just nodded in agreement every time. <a href="https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj">https://t.co/iYnYyBpZaj</a></p> <p>— Barto (@bartonovopolis) <a href="https://twitter.com/bartonovopolis/status/1975050651299426475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Well, actually, right now, I’m finding mediocrity–we’re drowning in mediocrity,” he said. “And so what I do–it’s a horrible thing–but I’ve started watching my own movies, and actually they’re pretty good! And also, they don’t age.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I watched&nbsp;<em>Black Hawk</em>&nbsp;[<em>Down</em>] the other night and I thought, ‘How in the hell did I manage to do that?’ But I think occasionally a good one will happen, [and] it’s like a relief that there’s somebody out there who’s doing a good movie.”</p> <p>It’s unclear if he went on to mention what those “good ones” are. It would be hard to top 2023’s <em>Napoleon</em>, after all. Scott’s next movie is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller called <em>The Dog Stars</em>. It’s out March 2026.</p>

<p>The release, which comes either as a bundle or separately via the eShop, has garnered a fair bit of attention for its price over the last few weeks, but the simple fact remains that these are, in our opinion, two of the finest platformer games ever created, and they've never looked better.</p>
<p>In fact, our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2">recent review</a> ended with a coveted score of <strong>9/10</strong> in which we praised the boundless creativity on display along with the thoughtful visuals upgrades, but noted that the gyro controls don't quite stack up next to the original Wii controls. It's also currently sitting at a healthy 88 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2/">Metacritic</a> too, so that's nice.</p>

And if you haven't played it yet, or you feel like changing your mind at a later date, then fear not, you can always come back later – we'll be here waiting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pearl Abyss's upcoming Crimson Desert finally has a release date after being<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/"> delayed this past August (at least publicly) for the second time</a>. Its<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/"> first major delay in 2021 was an indefinite delay </a>with no new release date in sight, and since then, we've seen it appear <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">at annual shows like Gamescom</a> with gameplay demos that did not lead to release date reveals, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">including this year's Gamescom show</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, we only got its release date reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">last week during PlayStation's State of Play event</a>, confirming that it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming March 19, 2026. Now that we have a release date though, we can look forward to its arrival and look at gameplay showcases with a more engaged eye, since we know it'll be in our hands within the next six months.</p>



<p>As part of IGN's First preview series, a new 11 minute gameplay video showcases one of the many quests you'll encounter in Crimson Desert, though for the most part it features a fairly bombastic boss fight, one of the many you'll have to face in the open-world action-adventure game.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, we've been waiting on and hearing about Pearl Abyss's upcoming open-world title for six years. It'll be seven by the time we actually have the game in our hands next March. For even more context, back when <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">Wccftech spoke to Pearl Abyss in 2019</a>, the studio said it was "<em>very positive</em>" about Google Stadia, as we were starting to learn more about Crimson Desert and where it would be playable.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we've seen the last delay Crimson Desert is going to get, and can just look forward to its launch on Mach 19, 2026. </p>

                <p>The latest Pokemon event at GameStop hasn't gone as many would like, to say the least. The retailer distributed physical cards containing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-free-shiny-koraidon-and-miraidon-in-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet/1100-6534715/" data-ref-id="1100-6534715">codes for Shiny Koraidon and Shiny Miraidon</a> to be redeemed in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet beginning September 26. But after the well of codes quickly ran dry, GameStop announced that a second wave of codes arrived this past weekend, albeit with a catch.</p><p>GameStop has approximately 50 codes per store, according to a statement on X. These codes will be printed on receipts instead of the usual cards with unique art. The statement emphasizes the limited nature of this second round, adding that the retailer is committed to distributing every code it receives and providing more if The Pokemon Company makes them available.</p><p>This event has drawn outcry from Pokemon fans, who point out the scarcity of the codes and the prevalence of scalpers on platforms such as eBay who are selling code distribution cards. Many also believe that 50 codes per store is still not enough to meet demand. GameStop appeared to shift blame toward The Pokemon Company, responding to complaints of the limited supply by tersely <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1974637403609718984" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stating on X</a>: "Not our decision."</p><p>According to GameStop's initial <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1974565308112445874" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement of the additional codes</a>, the company "bugged" The Pokemon Company for them until the company "gave in." The Shiny Koraidon and Shiny Miraidon event is scheduled to end on October 15.</p><p>Some distribution events for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet have utilized the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-how-to-get-these-shiny-legendary-pokemon/1100-6533355/" data-ref-id="1100-6533355">games' Mystery Gift feature</a>, which allows players to claim items or Pokemon. Mystery Gift only requires an internet connection to receive any gifts and doesn't require any codes, let alone codes that players must obtain in physical form.</p><p>Next up for the franchise is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, which releases on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 16. The action RPG will also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-paid-dlc-and-two-shocking-new-mega-evolutions/1100-6534700/" data-ref-id="1100-6534700">receive post-launch DLC</a>, along with its own distribution events in the future. Here's hoping that those ones go a lot smoother.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Outsiders, the Swedish studio behind the rhythm-based heavy metal shooter <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metal-hellsinger/a-rhythmic-symphony-of-destruction">Metal: Hellsinger</a>, is closing its doors as a result of layoffs at developer/publisher Funcom.&nbsp;</p><p>“Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting,’ says The Outsiders’ founder and creative director, David Goldfarb, who took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m">social media</a> to announce the closure of the 10-year-old studio. You can read his full statement below.&nbsp;</p><p>Friends,</p><p>I have not had much time to process the news but all of us at The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm have been affected by the layoffs at Funcom and our 10 year old studio will be closing. Many of us had survived a near-death studio experience years back when Darkborn was cancelled, and because of this team’s loyalty and refusal to quit, Metal Hellsinger was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.&nbsp;</p><p>We had hoped to do something even better this time--</p><p>--Things don’t always go the way you hope.&nbsp;</p><p>But we are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form. If you think you can help in any way, with business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is, I would be genuinely grateful if you reach out here. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting. Thanks so much.</p><p>The Outsiders, which was acquired by Funcom in 2021, is another casualty of layoffs across Funcom following last week’s news that the internal development team behind this year’s Dune: Awakening <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies">was also impacted</a> as part of a “studio restructuring.” The Norway-based Funcom was acquired by Chinese megacorporation Tencent in 2020 and has studios operating in Romania, Portugal, and the US via North Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p>The now-defunct studio is best known for Metal: Hellsinger, a rhythm-based first-person shooter that was released in 2022. Set in Hell, players wielded a variety of weapons to blast demons to the beats of a heavy metal soundtrack. The game received positive reviews and scored a 9 out of 10 here at <em>Game Informer</em>.&nbsp;Reviewer Wesley LeBlanc wrote, "What the game gets right far outshines what it doesn’t, and the developer, The Outsiders, has created what I hope is just the start of a new FPS franchise set in Hell."</p><p>The Outsiders joins the list of shuttered studios this year, which includes Monolith Productions (Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/F.E.A.R.), Player First Games (MultiVersus), <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/28/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-its-developer-cliffhanger-games">Cliffhanger Games</a> (Black Panther), and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-lays-off-thousands-of-employees-cancels-perfect-dark-everwild-and-more-xbox">The Initiative</a> (Perfect Dark).&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/06/metal-hellsinger-developer-the-outsiders-is-shutting-down]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-tracing-qa-fsr4-omm-ser-support-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest tech-focused interview with Gaijin Entertainment</a>, we asked the programmers behind the War Thunder game and the Dagor Engine whether Sony's PS5 Pro can support the new path tracing global illumination technology <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently introduced on PC with the game's Leviathan update</a>. Here's their response:</p>



<p><em><strong>László Perneky (Lead Programmer):</strong>&nbsp;Technically, it could; the only question is with performance. It is a decision for the future, though. First, we focus on releasing RT support for consoles, with all the effects except PTGI (hopefully very soon). Then, we will have a better picture of how much GPU budget we have to include PTGI and if we can make changes to it to fit that budget.</em></p>



<p>You might recall that about a year ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we asked a similar question to PS5 Pro Lead System Architect Mark Cerny</a>, who was very cautious about committing one way or another:</p>



<p><em>One difficulty in answering your question is that there are so many strategies for doing ray tracing or path tracing. Just to give an example, the engine that drives Alan Wake 2 is very, very different from the engine that drives Cyberpunk 2077. I really hesitate to say that PlayStation 5 Pro can or can't do path tracing, but you need to have a highly optimized strategy for doing it if you're going to do it on PS5 Pro.</em></p>



<p>To this day, no game has introduced path tracing support on PS5 Pro. War Thunder might be the best chance the console has to pull it off, since it is not a full-fledged path tracing but just PTGI. However, it is more likely that console users will have to wait for the PS6 to get proper path tracing support.</p>



<p>In the aforementioned interview with Gaijin, we also inquired about the Nintendo Switch 2 and whether there would be any port of War Thunder and/or Enlisted for the new console. Here's what CEO Anton Yudintsev told us:</p>



<p><em><strong>Anton Yudintsev (CEO:</strong> We’re always eager to be among the first to support new devices, so we’re definitely considering Switch 2 versions of our games. Unfortunately, right now we’re still waiting for the requested Switch 2 dev kits.</em></p>



<p>If a developer the size of Gaijin is still waiting for their Switch 2 devkits, it seems like the situation hasn't improved much since <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-developers-access-nintendo-driect-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our previous report on the devkits shortage in July</a>. This is unfortunate, as many developers would be very eager to port their games to the highly successful console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released a Psion UA update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. This new version of playtest material for the popular fantasy TTRPG introduces tweaks and changes to the Psion class, a casting class that focuses on psychic powers.</p>



<p>In a blog post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2072-designer-insights-from-unearthed-arcana-psion#the-updated-psion" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a> the design team discussed the changes in the Psion UA update. It covers the fundamental parts of the Psion, like its class features and its Psionic Energy dice, as well as tweaks to three of its subclasses. The fourth subclass, the Psi Warper, has been unchanged from the previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-class-introduced-in-new-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-ua-update-text-box_0.jpg?itok=ovkHorzP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-ua-update-text-box_0.jpg?itok=4UI2z5xX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some of the core changes were meant to streamline the class. Telekinetic Propel and Telepathic Connection are now baseline abilities; you can use them at will as a Bonus Action. They can also be enhanced with Psionic Energy dice. Certain effects have been reworded so you only lose energy dice if your target fails a saving throw. Psionic Modes have been removed, and you have more means of regaining energy dice.</p>

<p>The Metamorph subclass has received some buffs across the board. Now, whenever you use a Psionic Energy dice, you gain temporary hit points. The Life-Bending Weapons feature deals additional damage without spending Psionic Energy dice. Curiously, the UA specifies that if the Psion shows up in a future book, it will include magic items that enhance the subclass' Organic Weapons feature.</p>

<p>The Psykinetic is another subclass that has been bumped up. It has a new feature called Stronger Telekinesis, which enhances the Mage Hand spell, letting it carry up to 20 pounds of weight. The reworked level six feature, Destructive Trance, adds bonus damage to spell attacks. And certain mid-to-late features like Rebounding Field and Heightened Telekinesis either don't use dice, spell slots, or provide temporary hit points.</p>

<p>The most significant changes are reserved for the Telepath subclass. New spells have been added to its spell list, The Potent Thoughts feature greatly extends the use of telepathy to 60 feet. The Scramble Minds feature has been simplified to where enemy behavior is dictated by the caster and not by random dice rolls. This helps add more utility to the subclass without dragging down the pacing of a fight.</p>

<p>The feedback form for the Psion UA update playtest material opens October 9.</p>

            <p>I dunno about you, but I usually dig a big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">mod</a> that threatens to make my number of hours spent padding around Tamriel even more ludicrous. Lordbound is the latest danger to the free time of poor folks like me, having just soft launched after ten years of development spent creating a fresh region bigger than the Dragonborn DLC's Solstheim and filling it with stuff to do.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160493">The mod</a>'s set in the Druadach Valley between Skyrim and Daggerfall's setting of High Rock, and so offers a chance to mix it up with tribal orcs, Imperial legionnaires, and highfalutin Breton lords. Think The Reach, but with a few less plant-hearted warriors and weird bird-ladies. Those three factions form the pillars of "the biggest main quest you've ever played in Skyrim, with choices and consequences that change the state of the valley". Here's a synopsis of the situation you'll walk into:</p>
<blockquote><p>The drums of war are beating inside the Druadach Valley. After two hundred years of isolation the valley has restored its severed connections to the provinces of Skyrim and High Rock, exposing its withered remains to the rest of Tamriel. Chief Gorek of Garshakur refuses to surrender his mountain fortress to the Imperial Legion, denying them control of the highly-valued trade route between the cities of Jehanna and Solitude.</p>
<p>As the war wages on, the people of Druadach are forced to seek protection within the walls of Highreach, home of the young Lord Haelan - but even the last bastion of Druadach is threatening to fall at the hands of a mysterious knight of unknown origin, leaving only death in its wake. Whatever the choices are in the end, the fate of the valley rests in the hands of champions both new and old.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a nice Elder Scrolls lore knot to unpick by shouting at things and also slapping things with your sword. The modders reckon that, plus the 40 or so new quests and 50 or so new dungeons that help flesh out the valley, will keep you occupied for around 60 hours. Damn, that's about 1/8th of the time it usually takes me to sort my Skyrim load order out at any given moment.</p><p>That said, I'm slightly concerned that the mod cites "surprising consumables" alongside its fresh gear. What could be shocking to consume in the estimations of someone who's hung out with Sheogorath for at least five minutes during that one quest? Call dibs on which bodily fluid you reckon below. Anyway, the NPCs are fully voiced, so I'll be able to ask one of them to spill the beans.</p>
<p>Do expect some teething issues if you dive in at this soft launch stage to enquire for yourself. "We're still actively completing features of it, and there will be bugs," Lordbound's devs wrote. "While everything is largely playable, we still have work to do on the voice acting side of things. Additionally, our final checks have of course revealed more issues than anticipated. We scrambled to get the worst offenders fixed, but be fully prepared to encounter bugs through your adventures (not the chaurus kind)."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379">Skyrim Script Extender</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15109">Fuz Ro D-oh - Silent Voice</a> are requirements to get it running.</p>

<p>But why?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fe3dadf3e45d7"><a title="Horipad Turbo 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fe3dadf3e45d7/horipad-turbo-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Hori has introduced another budget-friendly alternative to the official Switch 2 Pro Controller, with a new pad coming in at roughly $54 when converted from Japanese yen (thanks, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/791438/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo-nintendo-switch-2-controller">The Verge</a>).</p>
<p>This means it's priced significantly lower than the $89.99 Nintendo itself is asking for with its official offering, but a few sacrifices have been made to bring costs down. So crucially, the Horipad Turbo controller cannot wake the Switch 2 remotely, there's no headphone jack, and it doesn't sport any NFC functionality for your amiibos.</p>
<p>What it <em>does</em> do, however, is let you lock the buttons in the middle – like the home, capture, +, and - buttons – via a small toggle located on the back. Why? Well, who knows, but there you go.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, there are plenty of arcade controllers these days that include tournament lock toggles to disable any inessential inputs while in the heat of battle. It's possible Hori might want to capture some of that niche, but these new pads don't particularly strike us as the go-to option for fight fans.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the joysticks utilise TMR technology to minimise any potential stick drift, while there are two additional inputs on the back of the pad to rival those found on the Pro Controller. Finally, Hori has seen fit to allow remapping across pretty much the entire suite of buttons, so that should come in handy if you like to tinker around with that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>There's no word on when (or even if) these new pads will make their way to the West, but we'll be keep a close eye on them regardless. Even if they don't sport all the features you're looking for in a Switch 2 controller, it's always nice to have options.</p>

<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-bright-blue-inventory-screen-with-a-bandage-as-the-only-item-it-contains.jpg?itok=O0Vx7htW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-bright-blue-inventory-screen-with-a-bandage-as-the-only-item-it-contains.jpg?itok=G1FdTWK7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The actual content of the inventory screen is familiar, but the high-contrast '80s microcomputer interface is a nice touch.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve not had a chance to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2339330/The_Lacerator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">game’s Steam page</a> yet, let me fill you in. <em>The Lacerator</em> is an old-school survival horror game from developer Games from the Abyss and publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dread XP</a> in the <em>Resident Evil </em>mold.</p>

<p>In fact, it would be fair to say that this game is an homage to <em>Resident Evil</em> in many ways. It does both of the two different camera styles that the series has used, namely, over-the-shoulder and fixed, and is about escaping from a house filled with gory humanoids bent on your death. Oh, and you spend most of the game being chased by a huge, muscular monster. You could have told me this was an unreleased tongue-in-cheek Resi spin-off and I’d have believed you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You play as Max, The man Who Loves Sex, one of the most popular porn stars of the 1980s. After spending a night doing what you do best, you wake up to find that you, your co-star, and your cameraman have been kidnapped and locked in some sort of basement dungeon.</p>

<p>As you explore your location, it’s clear that you’re in some sort of snuff den, and you need to try your best to get out without losing any of your extremities, and I do mean any of them. Let's just hope that this isn't giving DreadXP 'nam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">flashbacks to their last slightly sexual horror game</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Let’s Get Lacerator-y</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-over-the-shoulder-shot-of-a-man-over-a-grungy-catwalk-holding-a-hatchet.jpg?itok=YUa2L_vE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-over-the-shoulder-shot-of-a-man-over-a-grungy-catwalk-holding-a-hatchet.jpg?itok=prHCtQjq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't think it's technically possible to 'aim' an axe that you have no intention, nor ability, to throw.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The way that <em>The Lacerator</em> plays will be completely different depending on your set-up. If you choose to go with the classic ‘fixed’ camera, you’ll be controlling your character with tank-controls and sudden camera angle shifts. If you choose the more modern, over-the-shoulder style of camera, you’ll actually be able to play the game.&nbsp; In either case, the bulk of the rest of the gameplay revolves around killing zombie-like enemies, finding items, and solving puzzles to unlock further progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If that last paragraph wasn’t clear enough, I found the fixed camera angle a pain. Not only does it make certain puzzles based around timing very frustrating, but it also makes the already janky combat nearly impossible to wrap your head around. I understand that combat in a survival-horror game like this is supposed to feel chaotic to keep things tense, there’s only a certain level you can hit before the experience becomes genuinely unpleasant.</p>

<h2>Fight the Power, and the “Zombies”</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-old-tv-and-an-original-atari-2600-but-with-crt-scanlines-over-the-top-of-it.jpg?itok=ouVv_lbR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-old-tv-and-an-original-atari-2600-but-with-crt-scanlines-over-the-top-of-it.jpg?itok=aLUfzUVc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Max has some interestingly negative attitudes towards various things throughout the game, but that is almost certainly part of the point.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The combat in <em>The Lacerator</em> isn’t without merit at all. Generally, it functions fairly similarly to the <em>Resident Evil </em>standards. You ready your weapon by holding one button, then press another to attack. With ranged weapons this is pretty easy to get a hang of, though the game starts out incredibly reticent to dole out ammo. However, melee weapons take a decent amount of getting used to, made all the harder if you’re attempting this on fixed-camera mode. Part of the reason for this is a slight issue with the game’s controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During melee combat, you have to try and dodge incoming attacks, but you don’t really have a dodge move. All you can do is back up as quickly as possible, avoid the incoming damage, then swing with your melee weapon again. This sounds fine, but the game won’t let you keep the run button held between attacks, so you have to get used to the very specific timing window that you have after landing an attack to quickly press run again before you start moving backwards if you want to avoid damage. It’s easily doable after a bit of practice, but it also results in melee combat feeling formulaic once you’ve got it down. Either way, by the latter half of the game, you have better access to guns, so melee becomes less of an issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Splintering Pathways</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-standing-in-a-hallways-that-looks-like-its-made-out-of-rusted-iron-and-human-flesh.jpg?itok=AYoj9JcF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-standing-in-a-hallways-that-looks-like-its-made-out-of-rusted-iron-and-human-flesh.jpg?itok=EBl_1zQl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guys, does this place look familiar to you?&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Combat aside, there is a decent amount of fun to be found in <em>The Lacerator</em> for fans of old-school survival horror. You have the same style of room-clearing gameplay, but weirdly without the map that you might normally find in such games, it feels a lot creepier exploring each new area that you come across.</p>

<p>At least, it does the first time through. This is also the sort of game that is made with replays in mind thanks to multiple endings being available, so on your second visit the creep factor is definitely lessoned, though it’s not the only draw either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also an irreverent tone, and the '80s-style aesthetic to a lot of the environments you’ll come across makes you feel like you’re playing a parody exploitation movie, and that is also borne out in the storyline too. Playing a porn star called Max in the '80s is already pretty grimy, but add the extravagant gore and you could be forgiven for thinking that this is some stupid edgelord game with not much interesting to say.</p>

<p>Keep playing and paying attention and you’ll come across an interesting narrative that alludes to a lot more going on beneath the surface with Max’s character and backstory.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Getting Gored &amp; Bugged</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-mostly-nude-man-standing-with-his-back-to-the-player-who-is-in-a-pool.jpg?itok=fjLS4hOv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-mostly-nude-man-standing-with-his-back-to-the-player-who-is-in-a-pool.jpg?itok=kwD7YsEN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm almost 100% sure that he is not supposed to be stood there like that.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest mechanics in <em>The Lacerator</em> is the ability for you to get several bits of yourself chopped off. If you're not paying attention to obvious traps, or the 9-foot naked guy chasing you down, then you're likely to end up losing an arm, or worse, your junk. Depending on what you lose, the gameplay changes accordingly.</p>

<p>So, lose an arm, and you'll begin to find combat a fair bit harder with most weapons. Lose a leg, and you'll move slower as you get around by hopping, or drag yourself around by your arms, if you lose both of them. This is an interesting mechanic, as it does mean you can only access certain areas or abilities by having certain things chopped off, but you'll also want to avoid doing it if you can help it, since finishing with nothing chopped off is the only way to unlock some of the best endings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While you're going back through for the other endings or just to check out what else there is to see, you'll need to keep your eye out for a couple of bugs. I'm not sure how it triggers, but sometimes when you're reading a note or picking up an item, the game will get the overlay stuck on the screen while you're still able to move around the world.</p>

<p>It's not game-breaking, unless the item you were trying to pick up is a key item, but it's certainly annoying. I also had a really weird bug where The Lacerator himself seemed to get stuck staring into a wall, though in fairness, this did just add to the eerie feeling a bit.</p>

<h2>Sound &amp; Visuals</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-in-pink-boxers-standing-in-a-dilapidated-building.jpg?itok=Z5sUs_kU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-in-pink-boxers-standing-in-a-dilapidated-building.jpg?itok=IChu5Jph 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Max was also known as one of the hairiest porn stars of the '80s, though there is a lot of stiff competition.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the old-school gameplay, <em>The Lacerator</em> uses an old-school PS1/N64-style aesthetic. So, we’re talking blocky 3D polygonal characters with slightly blocky textures laid on top. While a lot can be said about this being ‘nostalgia bait,’ it’s a really effective aesthetic when you’re working with a grungy, and gory, grindhouse story like this. The distorted visuals and audio being used add to the eerie feeling of the game, and that distortion also helps to keep you guessing more about what each new sound you here might mean, until you discover the horrific source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s also more of a game about the sound design than the soundtrack. When you’re wandering around exploring new areas and trying to solve puzzles or make progress, you’re generally listening mostly to your own footsteps. Occasionally, you’ll get some diagetic sound from an in-game stereo or record player, but other than that, it’s only during monster encounters when you get any music. It’s a style of gameplay that works best in an explorative horror game, and it’s right at home here.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Lacerator</em>&nbsp;Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

The slight jank to the controls make the melee combat tough to get into, a fact that isn’t aided by the fixed camera mode, but thankfully a lot of what the rest of the game has to offer is great. There is the heart of soul of a great game here, but it’s buried beneath layers of minor bugs and QoL fixes that need to happen first. Until then, only the horror-dedicated will find entertainment within.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Oh boy. Unfortunately, it's one of those days. You might remember that last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> developer Funcom laid off an unspecified number of staff. Yep, that same Dune: Awakening that appeared to be doing pretty well for itself. Go figure! Today, there's more bad news, as it turns out that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-hellsinger">Metal: Hellsinger</a> studio The Outsiders will be shutting down completely as part of said layoffs at parent company Funcom.
</p>
<p>
Founder of the studio David Goldfarb should word of the studio's shuttering in a statement posted to his own X account, explaining, "I have not had much time to process the news but all of us at The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm have been affected by the layoffs at Funcom and our 10 year old studio will be closing.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
"Many of us had survived a near-death studio experience years back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkborn">Darkborn</a> was cancelled and because of the team's loyalty and refusal to quit, Metal: Hellslinger was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen."
</p>
<p>
Goldfarb did try to offer a bit of hope amongst the gloom, as he did say the team is going to try and continue in "some new form." He also noted that if anyone reading the statement could offer help, from business leads, to helping employees find new work, anything would be appreciated. Fingers crossed that the team is able to find their footing.
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, former editorial director Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-hellsinger-review">thought Metal: Hellsinger was bloody good</a>, so if you've already got it in your library but not tried it out yet, might as well give it a go.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Any creator that wants to be taken seriously needs to start focusing a lot more on their audio. It doesn’t matter if your doing simple vlogs from your couch or conducting those man-on-the-street styled videos. Your viewers, whether they are conscious of it are not, are going to notice your sound quality. Cheap audio reduces the production value of your work, even more so than poorly shot or low quality video does, at least in my opinion. The good news is that it’s easy to take your audio up from sounding bad to sound pretty good. The DJI Mic Mini is a wireless lavalier microphone that is easy to use and far from expensive.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/"> It normally goes for $60, but right now, Amazon has it listed for 29% off. That saves you $17, bringing the price down to just $42 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4534/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable on You and in Frame</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini is an ultra-light miniature wireless transmitter that can be worn comfortably and is aesthetically pleasing on camera.</p>
<p>This mini microphone for creators can be placed on the speaker’s person in three different convenient ways. It can clip onto the collar of their shirt as well as the inside of a button-up. You can choose to magnetically adhere it. Just slap the mini clip magnet behind the shirt with the DJI Mic on the front. And then lastly, you can use a simple lanyard and have it hang around the speakers neck like a necklace.</p>

As is tradition, we’re kicking off a month of exclusive content with a brand new gameplay video. Above, you can watch a playthrough of The Captured Fortress, one of Crimson Desert’s faction quests, in which you help Duke Wells retake his castle from rebel forces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This 11 minute-long video showcases a number of Crimson Desert’s key features. First and foremost, of course, is combat. Ever since we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-is-like-god-of-war-and-dragons-dogma-had-a-baby-gamescom-2024">first played Crimson Desert at Gamescom 2024</a>, we’ve known that developer Pearl Abyss has been assembling something special when it comes to battle, and here you can see protagonist Kliff making use of a wide array of abilities. Among our favourites is using a spear to pole-vault into an enemy, and the incredibly powerful, magically-charged heavy attacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this demonstration mission covers more than just combat. You’ll also see how Kliff can explore the environment using magic leaps, a Spider-Man-like swing, and his Crow Wings ability, which allows him to glide through the skies towards far-off objectives. You’ll also see him using his sword to reflect light, a skill that highlights points of interest in the world and guides you towards interesting discoveries. By following the shining lights, Kliff is able to infiltrate the Duke’s captured fortress in a more stealthy manner… and discover some extra loot along the way, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, a Crimson Desert showcase wouldn’t be complete without a boss battle, and so this video concludes with a full, violent clash against Fortain, the Cursed Knight. This armour-clad bad lad wields a sword with a mighty, supernatural ability that you don’t want to miss. You might even be able to claim it for yourself…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And remember, this video is just the first drop. Throughout the month of October, IGN First will take you on a journey into the world of Crimson Desert. You’ll get to see many more bosses, regions, combat abilities, and two or three exciting new things you’d never guess would be part of a medieval fantasy game. For all that, stay tuned to IGN over the next few weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-gameplay-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

Even so, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to beat out all the other keen collectors, scalpers, and their bots who might be trying to nab one before you can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we’d advise is to have your paid Walmart+ subscription set up and you be logged in on 6 October, and if you get the chance to add one of those half-priced Prismatic Evolutions ETBs to your basket, you take it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-free-dlc-release-date-reveal-november/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-free-dlc-revealed-arrives-november-2025.1317748/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After confirming that Assassin's Creed Mirage <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-indeed-getting-new-free-content-later-this-year/">would indeed be getting a DLC update this past August</a>, Ubisoft revealed the full free DLC today, titled Valley of Memory, which is set to arrive on all platforms this coming November 18, 2025.</p>



<p>The free DLC update will add a new region for players to explore called AlUla, a historical setting placed right in the middle of the Incense Road from the Golden Age of the Abbasid Empire. Ubisoft worked with archeologists and historians to ensure it could recreate AlUla as accurately as possible for this new DLC to showcase what this bustling trade-hub would have looked like during the 9th century.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory Reveal Stream" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TjZ8XG8QBY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Valley of Memory will feature an entirely new storyline that's part of Basim's coming-of-age journey, with this DLC specifically revolving around his search for his father. Beyond the main arc of this new DLC, there will also be new contracts, side quests, and some highly-requested gameplay changes, namely the ability to replay missions at your leisure. It also adds a new faction of Robbers for Basim to deal with. </p>



<p>Ubisoft has also further expanded the gameplay in Mirage by adding a new tier to tool upgrades, new parkour abilities like being able to jump manually and refinements for the less-populated northern region of AlUla, where Basim will be climbing rocky terrains instead of the ubran areas of Baghdad.</p>



<p>When Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">first released Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, new DLC content wasn't initially part of the plan. This DLC eventually happened partly because of the positive reception Mirage got, though more significantly because of Ubisoft's partnership with Savvy Games Group, the videogames-focused investment company founded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). The same PIF that will be one of the lead investors <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">acquiring EA and making the company go private.</a></p>

<p>In an official reveal today, Ubisoft revealed that the DLC will arrive on November 18. Valley of Memory's new story chapter takes place just before the final story beats of the base game, with Basim looking for answers about his father. Both the base game and the DLC will see a bit of a parkour revamp, the ability to replay base game missions with fresh rewards, and three new difficulties - medium-plus, very hard and custom.</p><p>"When developing a game, we explore countless ideas and iterations for the setting in which the story takes place, the DLC's creative director, Oliver Leonardi, said. "For Mirage, we ultimately chose 9th century Baghdad as the backdrop. But, from the start, we had other locations in mind for Basim's journey." So, Ubisoft say, this DLC's about celebrating the game's second birthday by bringing one of those old ideas to life.</p>
<p>The reveal saw Ubisoft discuss how AlUla's been re-created in the game, with one of the talking heads being <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulrahman-alsuhaibani-299443a6/?originalSubdomain=sa">Dr Abdulrahman A Alsuhaibani</a>, vice president of culture at the Royal Commission for AlUla. <a href="https://www.rcu.gov.sa/en">The Royal Commission for AlUla's website</a>'s 'our aspiration' section notes that their "development work in AlUla encompasses a broad range of initiatives across archaeology, tourism, culture, education, and the arts, reflecting the ambitious commitment to cultivating tourism and leisure in Saudi Arabia, outlined in Vision 2030." That'd be the <a href="https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en">Saudi state's Vision 2030 project</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has declined to offer conclusive answers as to whether the free DLC has been funded by the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund. Since news of the DLC broke, the company has faced criticism and questions over working with the country, both externally and reportedly from staff. According to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">internal Ubisoft Q&amp;A published by Game File's Stephen Totilo last month</a>, Ubisoft workers asked whether Ubisoft execs believed associating with the authoritarian Saudi state could have a negative effect on the company's image earlier this year.</p>
<p>The worker specifically cited the killing of journalist <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">Jamal Khashoggi</a> in their question, which was allegedly carried out at the order of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman. Khashoggi's murder aside, Saudi Arabia have an abysmal human rights record, including state-sanctioned homophobia and mass killings of migrants at the country's border with Yemen. The state has been accused of using investments in industries like games and sports to attempt to 'wash' this reputation, rendering itself more palatable in foreign eyes.</p><p>In that internal Q&amp;A, Ubisoft, who have asserted that they've retained creative control over the DLC, attempted to make a distinction between the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund and bin Salman - who is also <a href="https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/who-we-are/">the Public Investment Fund's chairman</a>. "The [PIF]'s money is not MBS's, and talking with partners who do not share our democratic values does not mean abandoning them," the company's management said at the time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>OpenAI launched its new generative AI video tool, called Sora 2, last week, alongside a TikTok-like social media platform where invite-only users could share <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-sora-2-videos-pokemon-spongebob-dragon-ball-2000631137">all of their favorite copyright-infringing nightmare fuel</a>. There was Mario racing from the cops and Goku fighting the hero from <em>One-Punch Man</em>. But the 9-second clip I can’t get out of my head is an AI-generated <a href="https://x.com/SHL0MS/status/1973959800754217190">Sam Altman barbequing Pikachu</a> before munching on a slice of the beloved Pokémon mascot like it’s seared tuna.</p> <p>Nintendo and other companies have yet to comment on OpenAI’s latest legal minefield, but Altman is already backpedaling on Sora 2’s initial free-wheeling, anything-goes, copyright-holders-be-damned spirit. The company recently announced a change to how the tool is structured so that companies have to “opt in” for users to get Sora 2 to generate videos using that company’s IP, where previously they had to “opt out” for it <em>not </em>to do so. OpenAI will also be setting up some sort of payment system to give companies a fraction of the revenue generated from their IP-adjacent slop.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/cpoIMax3Xq">pic.twitter.com/cpoIMax3Xq</a></p> <p>— 𒐪 (@SHL0MS) <a href="https://twitter.com/SHL0MS/status/1973959800754217190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Altman <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/sora-update-number-1">wrote in a new blog post</a> on October 3:</p> <blockquote><p>We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of “interactive fan fiction” and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all). We assume different people will try very different approaches and will figure out what works for them. But we want to apply the same standard towards everyone, and let rightsholders decide how to proceed (our aim of course is to make it so compelling that many people want to). There may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t, and getting our stack to work well will take some iteration.</p></blockquote> <p>He also specified that Sora 2 users were producing a disproportionate amount of meme clips using anime and video game characters. “In particular, we’d like to acknowledge the remarkable creative output of Japan—we are struck by how deep the connection between users and Japanese content is!”</p>

Disney, Warner Bros. and other major media companies are already suing competitor Midjourney over the ease with which its users can generate rip-offs of <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>, and<em> Batman</em>. Meanwhile, publishers like<em> IGN </em>owner Ziff Davis and <em>The New York Times</em> are suing OpenAI <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/14/nx-s1-5258952/new-york-times-openai-microsoft">over unauthorized copying</a> of their online archives to train its algorithms.</p>

 <h2>What is Nintendo saying about generative AI?</h2> <p>So far, however, most video game companies have have yet to cut deals with OpenAI or accuse it of theft. The notoriously litigious Nintendo recently called a report from a Japanese politician stating that it was lobbying for AI protections untrue. “Contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI,” the Switch 2 maker <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220">announced over the weekend</a>. “Whether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.”</p>

 <p>While companies have stayed silent about how they’re dealing with potential infringement concerns, most are happy to advertise their ambitions to use new generative AI tools to try and streamline production. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/over-50-of-japanese-game-companies-use-ai-in-development-according-to-tokyo-game-show-organizer/">According to a recent survey</a>, roughly half of Japanese game studios are already using some form of AI in game development. Microsoft, an early backer of OpenAI, is one of the technology’s loudest proponents, though the results so far have been meager at best. When it comes to gaming in particular, the tech giant has rolled out <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">AI chatbots</a> for game help, and is experimenting with quick prototyping of gameplay.</p> <p>“You could imagine a world where, from gameplay data and video, that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run,”&nbsp; Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-muse-ai-phil-spencer-dipshit">said earlier this year</a>. Who knows if that will ever actually happen? For now we have fake footage of <a href="https://x.com/fofrAI/status/1973152115259482575">Master Chief in <em>Mario Kart 8</em></a> instead.</p>

        <p>Anton thinks he’s the protagonist in his story, but someone is always watching, directing from the shadows.

From the basement of a quiet Brooklyn DVD store to the neon-lit streets of 2012 New York’s underworld, every encounter is choreographed, every fight feels cinematic, and every choice has consequences.

		<p>Haven’t had one of these for a while, the ESRB (Entertainment Software Ratings Board) are usually on the ball when it comes to what they post and when, but something has slipped through, namely Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/aliens-fireteam-elite/">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a> 2 has not been announced, there has been nothing from the publishers but perhaps that is because, according to the ESRB, Daybreak Games are publishing the game and not Focus Interactive.&nbsp; Daybreak are more famous for its MMORPGs such as DC Universe Online, Everquest, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online,&nbsp; a multiplayer shooter is somewhat of a departure for them. Cold Iron Studios developed the first title – more on them later.</p>


<p>Last year, a design document for the game,&nbsp; codenamed Project Macondo, leaked, and it said, “unlike Aliens Fireteam Elite, Project Macondo will feature fixed preset character archetypes and non-customisable characters.” It also stated that a new horde mode called Annihilation would be part of the game. It also suggested the game would be out near the end of 2025.</p>
<p>We can now add that information to a<a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/daybreak-advances-cold-iron-partnership-with-additional-investment-of-approximately-6-5-usd-million-ahead-of-2025-release/"> press release for investors made by Cold Iron Studios in February,</a> in which they stated, “Daybreak is working closely with Cold Iron and on track to bring its new game to market later this year.” It appears that Cold Iron are developing the sequel it’s just the publisher that has changed.</p>
<p>According to the ESRB, Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2 will launch on Windows PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>We gave the original game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/03/aliens-fireteam-elite-review/">7/10 in our review,</a> “Aliens: Fireteam Elite has a lack of mission variety, technical issues, bad matchmaking, and a repetitive structure. All of that said, it’s still a fun time. I’m off to play some more right now,” said Nic.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/broken-sword-smoking-mirror-reforged</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/broken-sword-the-smoking-mirror-reforged-revealed-for-early-2026.1317703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary point-and-click developer Revolution Software has announced&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged</em>, a remastered version of the second game in the&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword&nbsp;</em>series, and it's due to arrive early next year.</p>

<p>Per a press release, <i>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</i>"celebrates the series' enduring legacy while introducing enhancements for modern players". CEO and founder Charles Cecil says the remastered version will "respect the original while making it shine for modern audiences".</p>

<p>It sounds as though the new remaster will work in a similar way to last year's&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</em>, coming complete with new visual enhancements, audio improvements, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/broken-sword-the-smoking-mirror-reforged-beach.jpg?itok=yg8s4qC3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/broken-sword-the-smoking-mirror-reforged-beach.jpg?itok=VJRNpiHn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>remasters a point-and-click classic next year.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Revolution Software, the new version will feature "beautiful high definition" visuals, as well as "crisp audio", but if you love the original, you'll still be able to switch between the new and old styles at any time.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you're the kind of person who gets frustrated at point-and-click adventure puzzles (for which I will throw absolutely no shade your way whatsoever), then you can play with the new "story mode" in order to get "subtle hints".</p>

<p>Once this one's been released, it will be intriguing to see whether Revolution Software decides to revisit its adventures into three dimensions with remasters of 2003's&nbsp;<em>The Sleeping Dragon&nbsp;</em>and 2006's&nbsp;<em>The Angel of Death</em>. Arguably, they're the ones most in need of remastering.</p>

<p>For now, though, you can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>right here. It'll show off the new art style and give you a sense of what you can expect if you pick the game up.</p>




<p>Let's also hope that this remaster is successful enough to prompt a potential new entry in the series, a la 2020's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/beyond-steel-sky" rel="nofollow"><em>Beyond a Steel Sky</em></a>.</p>

<p>For now, though,&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch early next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>developer The Outsiders has been closed down by its parent company Funcom, according to studio founder David Goldfarb, but he says he's determined to press on regardless.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky post</a>, Goldfarb confirms The Outsiders' closure after ten years of operation. The studio's shutdown is part of a wider spate of layoffs at Funcom, which the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced recently</a> (despite latest release&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>being Funcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">most successful game</a> to date).</p>

<p>Goldfarb says he and his studio "survived a near-death studio experience years back when&nbsp;<em>Darkborn&nbsp;</em>was canceled", referring to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embrace-your-inner-monster-in-darkborn" rel="nofollow">a project</a> that was first revealed back in 2015 before being <a href="https://x.com/outsidersgames/status/1255834216815890434" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">canned in April 2020</a>.</p>

<p>However, Goldfarb says this might not be the end for him and his team. He says they're "not giving up", and that they "are going to try to continue on in some new form", asking followers to help out with "business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is".</p>

<p>Funcom originally purchased The Outsiders back in 2021, just a few months before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funcom-acquires-conan-ip-holder" rel="nofollow">acquiring the rights</a> to the&nbsp;<em>Conan&nbsp;</em>IP and the holding group that originally held those rights (along with the rights to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Solomon Kane&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mutant-year-zero-road-to-eden" rel="nofollow"><em>Mutant Year Zero</em></a>, the latter of which uses the Swedish <em>Mutant&nbsp;</em>RPG's setting).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, The Outsiders is far from the only studio to be closed down by its parent in recent months. Others include Xbox subsidiary and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative</a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">NetEase-backed outfit T-Minus Zero</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3" rel="nofollow">Echtra Games</a>.</p>

            <p>
There is a belief that appears to crop up within the games industry that to work in it, you must be wholly aware of everything in it. You must live, breathe and die by games! That doesn't always result in interesting games though, sometimes it's actually quite useful to have outsiders come in to bring other perspectives. Admittedly that occasionally results in writers from the film industry waltzing in thinking it's a one-to-one transfer, which is admittedly not great. But other times you get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, whose writer, as it turns out, had not played a single video game in her life before writing it.
</p>
<p>
Lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen recently spoke with Lits Play (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-writer-did-not-play-any-video-games-before-joining-the-hit-french-jrpg-but-now-shes-speedrunning-the-hits-i-have-platinumed-elden-ring-god-of-war-god-of-war-ragnarok/">GamesRadar</a>) about some of her influences, but also her experience with games before working on Clair Obscur. After being asked about if she liked genres like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> prior to joining the writing team, Svedberg-Yen said, while laughing, "So, I have to admit, before this I did not play any video games because I grew up in a very strict Chinese household and I'm the oldest. At the time video games were very expensive, so I didn't have any exposure to [them]. I went to the library and I read books."

<p>
Svedberg-Yen went on to explain that before she joined developer Sandfall, she generally played tabletop games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Then after she joined, she figured she needed to do her "homework," so along with her husband (who did play games), she started off with the Borderlands series. "Now we have two TVs, two PlayStations, we sit side by side. I am a trophy hunter, I have platinumed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, God of War, God of War: Ragnarok. I guess you could say I play quite a lot of games these days," she said.
</p><p>
If this lack of game influence from her side is a bit befuddling, it is worth noting that director Guillaume Broche did co-write it with her, who more famously is a Final Fantasy aficionado. In terms of her own influences, Svedberg-Yen brought in a lot of classic sci-fi books like Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series, particularly on the world building front, as well as the magic systems in Brandon Sanderson's works.
</p>
<p>
For any budding game writers out there, take this as an important lesson! Games are sort of eating their own tail at the moment by only being inspired by other games, but the best works out there always draw from every wellspring they possibly can.
