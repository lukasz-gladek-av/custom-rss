There are 1) wizards, 2) tons of tactical breaching, 3) a huge conspiracy to unravel and 4) so many windows to throw people out of.

Jen Kellan, the Storm Witch who serves as <em>Tactical Breach Wizards’ </em>de-facto protagonist, has just returned from a job gone badly. As a PI, she responsibly goes to the police to file her report and findings before being dismissed for inserting herself into missing persons cases and having her abilities dismissed as “witch’s tricks.” Since the game is wildly sharp, it lets you talk your shit right back at them, pointing out that maybe she wouldn’t have to insert herself if the police did their jobs. Soon after, you spend a mission dismantling the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-police-recruitment-poster-peoria-apology-1851300689&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-police-recruitment-poster-peoria-apology-1851300689">brutally inefficient police force</a></span>, and once again, toss people out of windows.<br></p><p><em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>is immensely talk-y. It’s got an unfiltered voice that I’m deeply jealous of and which bleeds into its presentation and lovely level design. Some of my favorite moments in the game aren’t even in combat, but instead in the dialogue-heavy cutscenes that play between missions or just before you breach a door to begin a level. You get to know Zan, a veteran black ops wizard with ties to the game’s villain, and the “base” he brings you back to is actually his mom’s flat. Once you’re there, the two of them regale you with Zan’s “origin story” and his mom tells you that he’s got his dad’s “dogshit spirit.”</p><figure id="" data-id="0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-recommend-id="image://0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan having a hilarious conversation." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan having a hilarious conversation." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Tom Francis</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-recommend-id="image://0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan having a hilarious conversation." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Everyone is a <em>character</em> in <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>,<em> </em>which makes me appreciate how much it squeezes from these interstitial scenes. A traffic warlock with uncanny hearing named Steve Clark is among the brightest of them, and he thankfully recurs as a hilarious rival to Jen. Bori, a pyromancer known for producing barely-hot flames, is another such oddity, and a necromedic named Banks even ends up joining your team. Her whole shtick is that she can only heal people by resurrecting them and she can only resurrect someone who’s died within an hour, so she carries around a gun to expedite things. Yes, she resurrects you with a headshot. </p><p>Naturally, this quirkiness extends into the game’s story and approach to level design. Combat plays out via a turn-based system on an isometric grid, where you first deploy your units and take your actions before the enemy goes. If you leave one of your allies in a precarious position, you can foresee what the enemy will do before ending your turn and committing to it, and a rewind button allows you to carefully calculate every step of the turn before letting your foes advance. More often than not, you won’t be dealing direct damage as much as you’ll be debuffing enemies, knocking them into parts of the environment, or sending them careening out a window or into holes. However, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>does a marvelous job of ramping things up, despite how simplistic this might sound.<br></p><p>One of the latest levels I took on occurred within Jen’s own anxiety dream, and it was appropriately pretty unorthodox and challenging, both thematically and mechanically. On one level, Jen is quite literally interrogating herself about her inability to separate her identity from her work, diminishing her worth and sense of self. On another, two versions of her are fighting through stifling bureaucratic offices filled with the very police officers and traffic warlocks that filled her otherwise bland daily life. That is, until Zan came to her for help preventing World War <em>Five</em> and she began to feel like she was capable of being more than a cog in a broken machine.<br></p><p>In addition to familiarizing me with her struggles, this anxiety dream also pushed me to get to know all of Jen’s tricks. For example, the biggest thing about Jen is that she is both highly mobile and capable of pushing units around, so rather than confronting enemies head on, I tried to reposition her near windows. That way she could either use her main weapon (which pushes a unit at a time) or her Chain Bolt (which knocks back even further and also attacks multiple enemies) to send people flying out of windows, <em>or </em>use her broom to fly out of a nearby window and emerge from another one.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-recommend-id="image://7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan crouching in front of an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan crouching in front of an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Tom Francis</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-recommend-id="image://7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan crouching in front of an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Banks plays an excellent supporting role, being able to transfer damage from one character to another, opening up eldritch portals that enemies can be sucked up into, or even just softening them up with a thrown sedative, multiplying the effectiveness of any knockback damage. Zan is much more offensive, having the ability to set fire to any enemy that crosses whatever axis he fixes his sights on, but my favorite move of his eventually allows him to send out multiple projections of himself to take fire, shoot at nearby enemies, or even interact with objectives. It’s corny to admit, but you feel downright magical after a certain point, though <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>rarely feels pitched in your favor because of that.</p><p>An enemy turret will still absolutely cap you in 1-2 hits, and other traffic warlocks will send spectral cars and buses in three lanes directly at you. Neutralisers occasionally fill the ranks of enemies, and since they fixate on the closest unit to them and strip them of their magic, you have to carefully consider pulling enemy aggression when breaching a room and tactically position your allies accordingly. You wouldn’t want Zan to be pinned down on that opening turn, for example, since his clones and uniquely offensive skills make him ideal for taking out that Neautraliser quickly. That then creates an opportunity for Jen to dart through the room and push people into walls, portals, or out of windows. No matter what you think the goal of this game is, it’s <strong>pushing as many people out of windows as possible.</strong></p><p>If you don’t believe me, try and meet all the “confidence” goals in every level. These sub-objectives encourage you to optimize your playstyle by challenging you to sometimes beat a level in a certain amount of turns, toss a certain number of enemies out of windows in one move, or extend a turn so long that you and all your allies are able to use a number of skills, which take either action or mana, or sometimes both. Each character has their own confidence objective, which gives points to unlock cosmetics, but just beating missions will reward XP that can be doled out to modify and level up individual skills in a system that’s deeply familiar to anyone who’s played the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331">beloved tactics game <em>Into the Breach</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p>While I am two acts into the game, there’s another two that are even longer and there’s a slew of dream missions, which include challenging gauntlets as well as survival missions. You know, just in case you thought there wouldn’t be enough meat on the bones. Between its ridiculous cast and premise, a sleek sense of style, and a mystery I actually want to unravel—complete with a board and lots of interactive red string—not to mention its incredible wit, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>is absolutely one of the best games I’ve played this year. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a big play for nostalgia but also one that’s paying off, as it reinforces the remake’s faithfulness to the original, which <em>Silent Hill</em> sickos basically don’t want to see any changes to. </p><p>The good news is that it sounds like improvements have been made without sacrificing any of the eerie allure of the OG experience. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-remake-dares-to-modernise-a-classic-and-is-largely-succeeding&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-remake-dares-to-modernise-a-classic-and-is-largely-succeeding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s</a></span> Thomas Morgan, combat is more varied but not overused. There are new puzzles and additional endings, but Bloober Team is mostly sticking to the specifications and spirit of the original <em>Silent Hill 2</em> blueprint. “It provides the game a comfortingly familiar structure—while allowing new detail to flourish around it like a trellis—and I’m looking forward to seeing where it grows past its first three hours,” he writes.</p><p><em>IGN</em>’s Dale Diver <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was similarly impressed</a></span> with how reserved Bloober Team was, likening <em>Silent Hill 2 Remake</em> more to BluePoint Games’ by-the-book recreation of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> than Capcom’s remade <em>Resident Evil 2</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-preview-significantly-better-than-the-trailers-youve-seen/1100-6525893/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-preview-significantly-better-than-the-trailers-youve-seen/1100-6525893/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em>’s Jessica Cogswell</a></span>, meanwhile, said the overhauled graphics haven’t negated the grimy mystique of the older version. “The <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake is a gorgeous game that doesn’t abandon the grime, grotesquerie, and yes, fog, that made the original game so mesmerizing,” she wrote. “In fact, it regularly amps it up.

<p>The rumors of FIFA and 2K Sports working together continue to circulate, and it’s even gotten to the potential competition at EA Sports. In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/fc-25-developer-interview-career-mode-football-manager-fifa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, EA FC 25 developers Andreas Wilsdorf and Alex Constantinescu&nbsp;addressed the rumors of FIFA 2K coming in the future.</p>



<p>“It’s still just rumors, but even if the rumors are true, we welcome competition. I think competition is always interesting to see, you know, how other people approach the sport,” Wilsdorf says. “We know how tough it is to make a football game and it will be interesting to see how they would challenge us, but again, we’re welcoming competition.”</p>



<p>To add to that, Constantinescu, EA FC 25’s principal game designer for Career mode, said that challenges from the past is something they he feels they are lacking at this stage.</p>



<p>“I remember it was pure coincidence that a couple of years ago when we added press conferences to the game, PES did as well,” he said. “And when we saw the announcement from PES, I remember I got like ‘Okay, this is interesting. Now I really need to pick it up a notch and work a bit more on the content’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wilsdorf then said that while competition “brings out the best of everyone”, the team at EA Sports isn’t afraid of what could happen with a FIFA 2K game.</p>



<p>“We’re not worried because we know how good the game is…,” he said.</p>

<p>Regarding FIFA 2K, while nothing is official, there have been continued talks between FIFA and 2K parent company Take-Two Interactive. After talking to sources last week, the hope is that the sides can announce a deal sometime later this year. Negotiations, which date as far back as earlier this year, remain ongoing.</p>

<p>He also said, thanks to their mobile manager game Top Eleven, that they are already in the “soccer business”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-dune-awakening/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>There are so many upcoming games worth being excited about, but few offer the scale and scope of Dune Awakening. It’s an upcoming open-world survival game set on the world of Arrakis from the Dune franchise. Developer Funcom, known for Conan Exiles, likely has a clear winner on its hands. Here is everything we know about Dune Awakening!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-dune-awakening">What is Dune Awakening?</h2>



<p>Dune Awakening is a third-person action survival game set on the massive open world of Arrakis. You’ll explore the endless deserts in search of Spice, delve into underground laboratories, and uncover secrets within hidden caves inside of sprawling canyons. To accomplish such a daring adventure, players will have a variety of abilities, skills, and weapons, most of which you can upgrade over time to dive into new content.</p>



<p>As you grow in power, engaging in combat with infantry, ground and air vehicles, and more, you’ll form a guild to take control of a House Minor. Yes, you can even harvest Spice to bring immense wealth to your House.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-dune-awakening-release-date">Do We Know the Dune Awakening Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Funcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>We do not know Dune Awakening’s official release date. We expect to hear more soon, hopefully at Gamescom, but there’s no guarantee Funcom is prepared to announce a date just yet. They’re still working on scheduling a playtest or two for the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-systems-is-dune-awakening-launching-on">What Systems is Dune Awakening Launching On?</h2>



<p>Upon release, Dune Awakening will be available on:</p>



<ul>
<li>PC (Steam)</li>



<li>PlayStation 5</li>



<li>Xbox Series X|S</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-is-dune-awakening-multiplayer">Is Dune Awakening Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>Dune Awakening is an MMO with survival elements. It’s set in a massive, persistent world where players will strive to survive a hostile planet against other players and enemy NPCs while building a House Minor from humble beginnings.</p>



<p>That said, it’s unclear precisely how many players will inhabit each server in Dune Awakening. While the game is billed as an MMO, we’ve found that many developers and players use the term loosely. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-dune-awakening-have-character-customization">Does Dune Awakening Have Character Customization?</h2>



<p>Dune Awakening offers an extensive character creation toolset, with players able to choose a body type, height, skin tone, age, various details (head, eye, nose, etc.), hairstyles, facial tattoos, makeup, and so much more. </p>



<p>From what we’ve seen in the character creation trailer Funcom released in July, the mechanic is rather extensive. You can create a unique character that you’ll shape from nothing to something!</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-dune-awakening-cross-platform">Is Dune Awakening Cross-Platform?</h2>



<p>As Dune Awakening will launch simultaneously on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, the question of cross-platform support frequently arises. Unfortunately, Funcom has yet to confirm cross-platform support or crossplay for Dune Awakening. </p>



<p>The tech is certainly there, as so many other games opt for cross-platform support these days, but it’s a matter of Funcom having the resources and know-how to achieve the goal before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-dune-awakening-free-to-play">Is Dune Awakening Free-to-Play?</h2>



<p>It’s unlikely that Dune Awakening will launch as a free-to-play title. We suspect it will launch at the same price point as Conan Exiles, which sells for $39.99 retail. That said, they may opt for slightly more expensive, considering the overall scope of this project seemingly surpasses their last open-world survival game!</p>

<p>We expect to see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-games-well-see-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quite a few games at Gamescom</a>, and Dune Awakening is one of them. Here’s hoping for gameplay and, at the very least, a release window!</p>

Final Fantasy 16's two DLC expansions, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi-echoes-of-the-fallen">Echoes of the Fallen</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi-the-rising-tide">The Rising Tide</a>, are launching simultaneously on PC, too, but you'll need to pay extra if you want to play them. While it's unclear if the story add-ons can be purchased individually, Square Enix is offering a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1029295/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Complete Edition"</a> version of the game for $69.99 that comes with the base experience, both DLC expansions, and a few miscellaneous in-game items. Additionally, Square Enix confirmed that a demo is available on Steam and the Epic Games Store now, with any progress made in the demo carrying over to the full build.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Final Fantasy 16 was released in 2023 exclusively for the PS5. Last September, Square Enix confirmed that a Final Fantasy 16 PC port was in the works, which came to the surprise of many as Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-producer-denies-existence-of-pc-version-buy-a-ps5">previously shut down</a> the possibility of it coming to PC, noting players should go buy a PS5 if they wanted to play it. In March, during an interview with Game Informer, Yoshida revealed that the PC port of Final Fantasy 16 was in the "<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-pc-port-final-stages-of-optimization">final stages of optimization</a>" and hinted that the system requirements to run the game would be "somewhat high." </p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review">our review of Final Fantasy 16</a>, IGN wrote: "Featuring fast, reflex-driven, action-heavy combat, Final Fantasy 16 is certainly a departure from what fans may expect out of a Final Fantasy game, but its excellent story, characters, and world-building are right up there with the best the series has to offer, and the innovative Active Time Lore feature should set a new standard for how lengthy, story-heavy games keep players invested in its world." </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-hands-on-the-evolution-not-revolution-of-a-great-idea.957027/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-hands-on-the-evolution-not-revolution-of-a-great-idea<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Lots of portals. Still no cake.</h2></div><section><p>There are few ideas more worthy of a sequel than that which powered Splitgate. Cribbing Aperture Science’s portal tech and loading it into a competitive arena shooter? I mean, c’mon – who the heck wouldn’t want to play that?! But while the first stab at this awesome concept proved too much of a rough draft to keep players’ fickle attentions for long, Splitgate 2 hopes to build on what worked by making modest improvements to the formula. After playing four hours of its fast-paced PvP matches for myself, I think this streamlined sequel stands a much better chance of keeping my attention, even though it seems like it won’t exactly swing for the fences with the kind of significant overhauls one might hope for.</p><p>Most of Splitgate 2’s tweaks are incremental improvements rather than anything revolutionary, but nearly all of the decisions developer 1047 Games has made are welcome changes. Without question the biggest refinement is the addition of character classes in the form of the three playable factions. Aeros is all about mobility, with abilities that keep you moving faster and let you easily restore your health. My personal favorite, Meridian, is a support faction that can reveal enemies through walls for their whole team and manipulate time within an area of effect, so you can do things like shoot and reload faster, but your enemies do so more slowly. Finally, there’s Sabrask, who are brute force bruisers with sticky grenades and deployable protective walls they can shoot through while their opponents can’t.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Splitgate 2 First Reveal Images</h3></div></output><p>None of the factions play all that differently from one another (you’re still always manipulating the battlefield with portals, jetpacking all over the place, and using samey feeling weapons with all three), but the abilities and equipment they each bring into battle are pretty significant, and since they all have quite short cooldowns to boot, that makes them feel pretty distinct despite having a lot in common. Dropping barriers as a Sabrask knucklehead or a time-altering dome as a Meridian agent can have a significant impact on the flow of battle, and encountering a Aeros fighter hopped up on stims and flying through the air at blazing speeds can be extremely bad for your health. It’s also neat that you can customize all three with a handful of different options for your class equipment, a few options for perks that passively augment how your character plays, and more. For example, if you want a more tactical version of the Sabrask faction, you can replace your sticky grenade with a smoke grenade that gives you a different sort of advantage with that class. Or, if you’re like me, you might just want to go into battle with a shotgun to pop out of portals and give the enemy a lead surprise at close range.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The freedom you lose from getting to assign your portal manually is more than worth sacrificing for a simpler and more intuitive experience.</p></div><p>Another fairly big adjustment comes in the form of Splitgate 2’s maps, which are much smaller than its predecessor’s arenas and are more conservative in their placement of surfaces you can place portals on. The original Splitgate’s maps were often too big for the player count and as a result, it took a bit too long to get into the action after each respawn. In Splitgate 2, that’s not a problem at all, and maps on the whole seem to be a lot more thoughtfully planned out. Of course, smaller maps mean there are also more opportunities for spawn killing, and at least a few of my deaths came mere seconds after spawning, which never feels great. The fact that portals only appear in select areas and are way less common than in the last game is also mostly a good thing. Plus, there’s generally less chaos and fewer opportunities for more experienced players to sweat all over newcomers with their portal-based tricks and superior map knowledge, which definitely makes for more welcoming matches. On the other hand, though, it’s a bit of a bummer that there are fewer opportunities to get creative and pull off wild stunts. I’ll probably need more time in the wild with the more prudently placed portal surfaces to say for sure whether this adjustment is for the best.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While factions and map design represent the biggest changes in Splitgate 2, most of the other adjustments are much more minor. One nice update is how your respawn timer works, which grows longer with each death, and can be sped up by having your teammates score kills against the enemy, with each frag reducing it by three seconds. Another is how portal mechanics have been simplified, so instead of having to juggle two separate commands for each part of your portal, your gun is now smart enough to do this automatically based on context. The freedom you lose from getting to assign your portal manually is more than worth sacrificing for a simpler and more intuitive experience. These minor quality of life updates might not be the game-changers one might expect from a sequel, but they definitely help nudge an already rock-solid concept in the right direction.</p><p>The flip side, though, is that so much of Splitgate 2 remains unchanged from the original that I’m genuinely not sure if it’ll be enough of a shot in the arm for this sequel to avoid the fate of its predecessor. From what I can tell, it certainly seems this will be a step up from Splitgate 1, but will it be enough of an improvement to keep my attention? Time will tell.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tactical-breach-wizards-review-breach-and-seer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You might not know them by name, but developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-developer-tips-shared-by-gunpoint-dev-tom-francis">Suspicious Developments</a> has been around the indie scene for quite a while. The creators of <em>Gunpoint</em> and <em>Heat Signature</em> are back with what might just be their best game yet, which is saying a lot since this studio takes risks and isn't afraid to be weird and different.</p>
<p>So for their latest game, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>? Like I said, it's definitely weird and different, but also cleverly designed and wildly inventive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat.jpg?itok=gk2wk9fC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat.jpg?itok=VW6EJeaC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Throwing someone out of a moving train is also an option.</figcaption></figure><h2>Hurling Baddies Out of Windows in <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></h2>
<p>Here's a little lesson on defenestration. Even as an English major, I hadn't heard of this word, but once you learn it, it captures the essence of <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> quite well. To defenestrate someone is to throw them out of a window, which goes to show there truly is a word for everything.</p>
<p>On the surface, one wouldn't put wizards and throwing folks out of windows together, but <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> says otherwise. As a <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/turn-based-tactics">turn-based tactics</a> game, you use the magical powers of your units to move enemies around in strategic ways -- usually involving windows.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-objectives.jpg?itok=LCmLjC_e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-objectives.jpg?itok=lL-Jl1wG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In the absence of windows, there's always alternatives... like hacking the turret here.</figcaption></figure><p>In this regard, the strategic elements of <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> follows the same philosophy as <em>Into the Breach</em>: using abilities to move enemies into positions that put them at a disadvantage or outright dispose of them. You can approach each mission like it's a puzzle and you'll do just fine -- finding how to optimize your strategy and defeat enemies in the least amount of turns is half the fun.</p>
<p>With quite a few missions across a roughly 15 hour campaign, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>' employs exceptional level design and combines that with an array of powers that make anything seem possible. Mission objectives are often accompanied by secondary, optional tasks that add a bit more difficulty, and in turn, variety.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-lore-2_0.jpg?itok=OKSTNtAt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-lore-2_0.jpg?itok=cpnKQzDj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm sure you can figure out who the main characters are.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Colorful Cast of Characters in <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></h2>
<p>But the real star of the show are your units themselves. As you progress across <em>Tactical Breach Wizard</em>'s campaign, you'll recruit a few extra members. Once your party is complete, everything comes together and a whole world of possibilities are revealed.</p>
<p>Jen and Zan are the first two units players start with, and this duo starts out a bit underwhelming but become powerhouses as time goes on. Now Jen, she's especially useful when it comes to defenestration, as her abilities push enemy units pretty far. She can even chain together lightning to push around multiple enemies at once, so you can just imagine the possibilities she offers.</p>
<p>Zan, on the other hand, is arguably the most important unit in the game. This multi-talented Navy Seer has the ability to create mirages that distract enemies and even shoot at them later on. The attack with his weird-ass gun/staff hybrid moves enemies a bit, too, so on top of dealing a lot of damage, he can also move people around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat-4.jpg?itok=SevyADGs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat-4.jpg?itok=nNsUVhAr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dessa might just be the most fun to play, but that's just my preference.</figcaption></figure><p>His quintessential power is that of foresight, enabling players to make moves <em>before</em> a turn ends and see how solutions play out -- and thankfully, this ability extends to other units even when he's not in a battle. This allows you to commit and experiment, so <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> encourages players to test out different strategies rather than punish you for silly mistakes.</p>
<p>The other units that'll join you are extremely helpful in their own right, like Dessa. She's a necromancer, so she can revive teammates, but don't just think of her as your traditional healer. She has some awesome abilities, like a spell that creates Death's Door that, when you push an enemy into it, they're thrown into the void, never to return. Now <em>that</em> is metal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat-2.jpg?itok=Tesd04Yu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat-2.jpg?itok=R6dAjl6M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might not be able to walk from building to building here, but with spells, there is a way.</figcaption></figure><h2>Spells: <em>Tactical Breach Wizards' </em>Tools of the Trade</h2>
<p>Here's how one scenario could play out: use Dessa to put Death's Door on a wall behind another of your units, Dall. Use Dall to swap with an enemy halfway across the map. Now that the enemy is in close range to your other allies, have Zan use a spell to push the enemy into the door and have them removed from combat for good.</p>
<p>Two more characters join you, and it's when all five members of the party are together that <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> shows its full potential. Only a few missions will have all members of the team on at each time and you can't choose, so I would have liked to see them all in action at the same time more often.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat-3.jpg?itok=JPDJMUHT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat-3.jpg?itok=6lDUCrrf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As time goes on, missions start to feel a bit more ambitious.</figcaption></figure><p>Nonetheless, the ever-expanding arsenal of abilities and even skill trees keep each unit more or less on par with the others. I can't begin to imagine the work it took to create levels revolving around so many unique abilities, but they make it work.</p>
<p>Environmental hazards like exploding barrels and electrified walls on top of the copious amount of windows means you can and should take full advantage of the environment around you, especially since enemies become more complex in their own abilities as time goes on. <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> is a game that demands to be broken, and with your teammates, nothing seems impossible.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-dialogue.jpg?itok=ZXRR7x1_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-dialogue.jpg?itok=yrrkyyDh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Um, okay?</figcaption></figure><h2>Tactical Breach Wizards' is Quirky, Alright</h2>
<p><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> leans pretty hard into the narrative side of things, so it pains me to say it didn't captivate me nearly as much as the gameplay did. There's a lot of back-and-forth dialogue, which in itself is fine<em>, </em>but it has to be intriguing to keep my attention. This is not the case, and in fact, turns out to be more annoying than anything else.</p>
<p>The characters are pretty goofy and quip at one another, so dialogue is definitely more lighthearted and jokey than anything else. Try as <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> might to be humorous, it didn't resonate with me at all. I wanted to like the characters, but some of the things they said to each other were just so unrealistic and weird, it was hard to get over.</p>
<p>The goofy dialogue and the serious content of the story clash with one another. The stakes of the plot are high, so for the characters to be these goofballs the whole time while attempting to stop a giant war feels wrong.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-lore.jpg?itok=-Oo9WSTZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-lore.jpg?itok=pB0BB_v4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't do mana dust, kids.</figcaption></figure><p>We're led to believe every single enemy we defeat isn't killed, even though some of them are quite evil. We're throwing enemies out of windows, slinging spells, and knocking explosive barrels into them. That's not something you can just walk away from alive.</p>
<p>Even still, the world-building is admirable, if a bit messy. <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> drops you into the deep end and creates a modern fantasy world where Traffic Warlocks and the Druid Mafia are just everyday things. Some elements of this world can be pretty funny, even if the vast majority of dialogue suffers from too many jokes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-outfits.jpg?itok=I9VhYfaN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-outfits.jpg?itok=mitXPK_p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cosmetics are always welcome! All you need is a little confidence.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I usually play turn-based tactics games with a controller, but <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> makes that difficult. The Gamepad's joystick moves a mouse cursor on the screen, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. It only ends up making the controller an absolute burden to use.</p>
<p>Using a controller for most tactics games makes things quick and snappy, but it's the exact opposite here. It feels like you're swimming against the current where instead, gamepad should be an easy alternative to mouse and keyboard controls.</p>
<p>It's easy to forgive <em>Tactical Breach Wizard</em>'s shortcomings when the core gameplay itself is so inventive and addicting. It's definitely one of those games where you'll be surprised by your own ingenuity, and <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> encourages you to think outside the box. So go on -- defenestrate to your heart's content!</p>

            <p>Please lock your Chocobos to attack position and set your Phoenix Downs to stun: Square Enix have released fresh details of Final Fantasy 16's PC port, which has now been dated for launch on 17th September. They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-review-16-easy-to-like-hard-to-adore">console-playing freelancer</a>.</p>
<p>According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</p><!--more-->

<p>Final Fantasy has a track record for showing up fashionably late on PC - it took Final Fantasy 7 Remake, first of the FF7 reboots, well over a year to land on Epic Games Store following its PS4 launch. As regards Final Fantasy 16 specifically, Square Enix had to work around a six month exclusivity deal with Sony and PS5 following the initial release in June 2023. Producer Naoki Yoshida has also indulged in a touch of bait-and-switch with journalists, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nobody-said-a-word-about-a-pc-version-says-final-fantasy-16-producer">jocularly denying that Square Enix had ever announced the game for PC</a> at one point. I suspect the uneven communication there has less to do with trolling than with the unpredictable nature of game development.</p>
<p>"The reasons vary for each title, but in the case of FFXVI, it primarily comes down to the original game being tailored for the PS5 in a lot of different ways, and it was impossible to do this at the same time as all the optimization work that was needed for the PC version," Takai told me over email, when I asked why this and other Final Fantasy games tend to arrive later on PC. He was unable to tell me anything about the specifics of the PC version's development, other than that this is the same team who made the original PS5 version.</p>
<p>So what do PC Final Fantasisers get for their patience? For starters, the port will accompany a Complete Edition which includes two DLC packs, Echoes Of The Fallen and The Rising Tide. I haven't played either of those, but they seem reasonably juicy. Echoes Of The Fallen's offerings include a new final dungeon, while Rising Tide packs a new region, an endgame mode and new abilities for this iteration's protagonist Clive Rosefield - "Devil May Clive", as I boisterously call him down the pub, forgetting that all my friends got sick of that joke over Xmas.</p>
<p>Square Enix have also added a bunch of new graphics and performance settings, as you'd expect. "Since PC gamers all have different PCs with different specs, we've provided extensive configuration options to maximize flexibility," Takai told me. "We've increased the frame rate cap to 240fps, and you can choose from various upscaling technologies such as NVIDIA DLSS3, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS." </p>
<p>Argh, so many letters and numbers! Where is hardware editor James to translate? Oh dang, I think he's gone to Gamescom. I feel like Final Fantasy games should have their own bespoke jargon for graphics features, blending third-party terminology with the series own naming conventions. Any PC RPG can boast of supporting upscaling, but only a Final Fantasy game could get away with e.g. Fabula Nova CrystaLSSIII or AMD Fenrir Shiva Ragnarok.</p>
<p>Square Enix have made a big noise about pushing beyond console lately. In May this year, the publishers promised "aggressive" expansion to other platforms, perhaps in light of the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-sales-did-not-meet-high-expectations-says-square-enix-president">FF16 did not meet the company's expectations on PS5</a>. They said they wanted to "win over PC users" especially. With that in mind, I asked Takai whether Square Enix feels the audience for Final Fantasy games differs much between console and PC. "That's a difficult question!" he said, before proceeding to answer it very straightforwardly. </p>
<p>"Honestly, there's not much difference between playing games on PC and consoles these days, so I don't know if there's any real difference when it comes to FF fans," Takai commented. "However, more people have access to a PC, so I'm hoping we can get the game into the hands of a broader audience of gamers with the PC version."</p>
<p>The company have yet to share sales of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which released on PS5 in February, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sales-drop-year-on-year-despite-release-of-final-fantasy-7-rebirth">they have reported a year-on-year overall game sales drop</a>, offset by relatively steady returns from subscription-based MMO Final Fantasy 14. All this notwithstanding, Takai doesn't think the Final Fantasy series has become unsustainable and in need of a fundamental rethink, not least because Square Enix are always rethinking it.</p>
<p>"While it's always important to balance development costs with sales, I don't think there's any kind of existential risk for the series," he told me. "As developers, we just need to keep creating what we think is fun - and if players think to themselves, 'they went in a new direction this time, but it was still fun', then maybe that's all the dramatic change we need."</p>
<p>If you're curious about FF16 on PC, I've saved the best for last: there's now a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738000/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_DEMO/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/final-fantasy-xvi-demo-c289c2">Epic Games Store</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Rockstar Games' new GTA+ subscription service offers a rotating library of games by the Grand Theft Auto developer, and Bully is next on tap. Rockstar announced back in April that Bully and LA Noire would be coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/la-noire-and-bully-free-for-gta-members-this-year-along-with-millions-in-gta-online-cash/1100-6522333/" data-ref-id="1100-6522333">GTA+</a> "later this year." A recent post on the developer's site <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o337151o33aa79/the-new-benefactor-vorschlaghammer-sedan-free-with-gta" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Bully will be available through GTA+ starting on August 20.</p><p dir="ltr">A listing on the Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee indicates that a version of the game called Bully (Canis Canem Edit) is coming soon to new platforms, including PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC (per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/bully-rated-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc-in-taiwan">Gematsu</a>). An emulated version of the PS2 classic is available to buy on PS4, and previous re-release Bully: Scholarship Edition has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12200/Bully_Scholarship_Edition/" rel="nofollow ">out on Steam</a> for over a decade.</p><p dir="ltr">GTA+ is a rotating library, but it's unclear if this new Bully will replace any of the service's existing offerings, which include LA Noire, Red Dead Redemption, GTA Trilogy, GTA: Liberty City Stories, and GTA: Chinatown Wars. GTA+ offers a variety of benefits in addition to these older Rockstar titles, including a monthly $500,000 deposit in GTA currency, multipliers on currency earned within GTA Online, a new vehicle workshop, and access to an app that makes vehicle requests easier. Rockstar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-gta-6-release-rockstar-raises-gta-price-by-33/1100-6522616/" data-ref-id="1100-6522616">increased the cost</a> of the GTA+ service from $6 to $8 a month back in April.</p><p dir="ltr">One of Rockstar's most beloved games of the PS2 era, reports of a shelved Bully sequel emerged <a href="https://x.com/lyluancake/status/1825204275238322593" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">back in 2022</a>. That hypothetical Bully 2 would've come out in the early 2010s, but was ultimately canceled. As for newer projects, Rockstar plans to release Grand Theft Auto 6 next fall, though it's very possible the game is delayed beyond that point.</p>

Both games boil down the essence of grid-based turn-based tactical games like Firaxis' XCOM series to simple simple, efficient forms, and each gives players some degree of autonomy to test out different moves before committing to a full turn.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's plenty to learn comparing the design decisions around both games, but I've been fixated one major point of divergence: how each game approaches narrative design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Their strategies are completely different. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Into the Breach</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makes the most of a sparse storytelling strategy, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> weaves an international escapade with snappy dialogue, fully-fleshed out characters, and a "red string" investigation board that helps players understand the who, what, where, when, and why of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With such similar game design fundamentals, we have a window to explore how each game's low-budget (but still high-impact) methods improve—or maybe at times worsen—the experience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Into the Breach"><span>Into the Breach</span> goes for a (lean, and maybe too mean), narrative</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Into the Breach</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Subset Games took a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>very </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">light-handed approach to game narrative, stripping the game story back to very simple elements. The player controls a team of mech pilots jumping from timeline to timeline, fending off a neverending invasion of alien bugs on the verge of overwhelming Earth.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/tactical-breach-wizards-shows-how-strategy-games-can-tickle-the-funny-bone" target="_self">Tactical Breach Wizards shows how strategy games can tickle the funny bone</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On each run they encounter different leaders for each of the four "zones" they can explore who offer brief context on the game mechanics unique to each zone, and comment on the players' successes and failures at achieving mission objectives. After the player begins the final mission, one specific leader gives them instructions for how to blow up the bugs for good. If the player is defeated at any point, or if they win, these leaders (and their own pilots) will lament their defeat or celebrate their win before sending the player to the next timeline.</span></p><p>Image via Subset Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pilot characters offer an equally sparse amount of dialogue, though they stand out by their unique reactions to being damaged, killing bugs, or protecting civilians in each mission. Their visual design and barks offer brief glimpses of their backstories and motivations, expanding the scope of the game world by implying the existence of alien creatures and fully-sentient artificial intelligence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aaaaand that's it. Even though this game pays tribute to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/why-do-game-developers-love-mechs-">thunderous mechs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of Gundam, Battletech, and Neon Genesis Evangelion, it tosses out the dense political and sometimes religious themes that accompany each series. This approach compares to the "narrative design" of a board game: the goal isn't to tell a linear narrative, but to use the essence of narrative to inspire players to engage with the core mechanics. Those core mechanics are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>really really really really good</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but never build up to a grand finale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A deeply-invested player can take inspiration from different pilot characters to decide their moves, but most players focused on winning will only be lightly influenced by these trappings. They mostly add an element of "oh that's cool" while you scan their related abilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This approach is far easier for production, as game writer Chris Avellone (who </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/fallout-new-vegas-writer-chris-avellone-settles-sexual-assault-allegations">in 2023 settled sexual assault allegations levied at him</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) could prioritize unique, clever character barks instead of stressing over everyone's motivations and how they'd drive the plot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I find there are flaws in its simplicity. This method never gives the player an "off ramp" to put down the game. The Subset Games team correctly identified that getting players quickly from run to run would drive interest more than any amount of dialogue, and the dense gameplay and promise of unlocking new tools would motivate players invested in the turn-based tactics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But because there's no definitive finale (or even the illusion of one), most players' time with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Into the Breach</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will end with them ending a session and then just...never picking it up again. There isn't a killer last memory to leave players with, one they'll want to tell other prospective players about—there's just a vibe of "oh, I've seen all there is to see."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This decision also reflects in the themes and "vibes" of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Into the Breach</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s story. If you care about saving the worlds at all, this game's story is downright Sisyphean. The alien invasion can never be beaten back, and only a fraction of a fraction of the infinite universes can be saved. After a while I felt myself going "what's the point?" I'd regularly sacrifice worlds just to preserve pilots I'd heavily invested in, treated the end of the world as an inevitability and not something worth fighting for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By the time I put down </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Into the Breach</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I'd spent hours and hours delighting over the turn-based tactical synergy, but I didn't feel proud of the worlds I'd saved (especially because there's no way to reconnect with them), I just felt like it wasn't worth saving any more.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tactical Breach Wizards"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span> celebrates its "loveable idiots"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> tells its tale on a shoestring budget—there's no voice acting, cutscenes have very simple animations, and Suspicious Developments put in effort to ensure players who only want to engage with the turn-based strategy game can skip as much as possible and get right to the tactical defenestrating. But for those who dive into the plot, they'll find Tom Francis' dry dialogue and sincere characters ready to engage with them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The plot is ambitious, but possibly difficult-to-follow for players hyperfocused on the turn-based tactics. In an alternate Earth where video game-style magic is real, Magic users Zan, Jen, and their comrades race to stop a rogue group of commandos trying to kick off a catastrophic world war. Zan has a personal connection with the lead antagonist Liv Kennedy, Jen is struggling to find purpose in her post-enlisted life, and the rest of the crew has their own hangups worth digging into.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are other design efficiencies you can spot in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A lot of dialogue beats play out between encounters with two characters facing each other on either side of a door. It's a familiar, repeating beat that saves on character animation and captures the sense of two people arguing or debating while they should be focused on the fight around them (something the fight mines for comedy). Jokes and character reactions are sometimes nestled in the user interface, giving players a chuckle when they go check relevant data.</span></p><p>Image via Suspicious Developments.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most ambitious narrative swing is in the personal "dreams" of each character. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a bit of fun treating its "optional" missions as the characters gaming out combat scenarios while they sleep. These missions can have more creative setups, like including multiples of characters that couldn't appear in the game's main story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then the game goes a step further, creating optional missions that are crafted around each character in the squad. In the first of these, Storm Witch Jen is confronted by her own inner critic, and the pair argue while blasting away the enemies inside her own mind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The international conspiracy element of the story is a little bit "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Putting%20a%20hat%20on%20a%20hat">putting a hat on a hat</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" (one character even points out that the gang hasn't progressed in their core objective for two missions), but it's hardly a great narrative sin.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The narrative design is fun! Suspicious Developments does a great job weaving the dialogue-driven tale in with charming vignettes with the same assets used in gameplay. They make for a nice respite between missions, and play nicely with the "slow and brain-stimulating" nature of its turn-based tactical combat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don't want to play the mission just to see the next puzzle, I want to play to see what happens next in this fantasy thriller.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="So which narrative style is better?">So which narrative style is better?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not helpful to say any one way of making games or telling stories is objectively "better." Stories (and games) are experienced subjectively, and plenty of folks may bounce off of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' narrative design, wishing that time had gone into new missions instead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But...</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I believe more developers should follow in Suspicious Developments' footsteps, and squeeze every ounce of story out of their game that they can.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In my decade or so writing about games (and occasionally working on them) I've crossed paths with developers frustrated by how resource-consuming narrative design can be. They're tired of games bogged down by cutscenes, dialogue, or gigantic tomes full of way-too-dense-and-not-useful worldbuilding. They'd prefer to focus on efficient design and fantastic art direction. "Most game writing is really bad," is a phrase I've heard from a few professionals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Swing by the the GDC Narrative Summit and you'll hear great arguments about how good storytelling will make your game appealing to players. That's true, but it can force writers to re-stage this argument over and over again to justify each story for each kind of game they work on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'd put it like this: good storytelling isn't just good for your players, it's good for you too.</span></p><p>Image via Suspicious Developments.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Suspicious Developments founder Tom Francis pulled double-or-triple duty designing, coding, and writing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. While playing, I could feel him getting something out of his brain and into the world that you can't do just by writing a blog or lobbing ideas around with friends. His ideas about how games should play and how people experience the world are imparted to the player while they figure out the best way to tactically yeet a traffic cop named Steve out a window.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But I'm not as good a writer as Tom Francis," you might say. That's okay! I've played a few other great games recently where the writing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>didn't</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> click with me, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>WarTales</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cobalt Core</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sea of Stars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I loved these games for other reasons but in the end just didn't connect with the words on the screen. But I still felt a connection to the people making the game while I read them. Each game swung for the fences in a way that made me think "huh, someone on the other side of this screen was really, really passionate about this."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a B2B game journalist I'm not as harsh as many players will be, and it can be scary to put yourself out there when you're not confident in your writing. But something good comes out of everyone when you try to say something about the world even while you're trying to entertain people.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Give yourself permission to tell the story bouncing around your head.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

			<p>Final Fantasy XVI has been wanted by those on different platforms for a long time, with the game finally coming to PC as of September 17. Initially, when the game was being developed, it was established as being on PC before they decided to make it a PlayStation 5 exclusive, which was released in June 2023. Since then, the game has received two paid DLC episodes, with multiple fixes coming out to make the game more accessible, especially with camera controls.</p>
<p>While the announcement dropped today with a brand-new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI, it is also on good authority from a known leaker named NateDrake that the game is potentially <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-happen/">coming to Xbox in the future</a> on ResetEra forums, as developers have stated in the past that they want as many people as possible to play the game.</p>
<p>In the new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI titled "Deliverance," you can see some of the action you can expect throughout the game as you fight against Eikons and other enemies. The DLC will be available to purchase on release for those who plan on purchasing it on PC. You can buy the base game on PC for $49.99 or the Complete Edition of Final Fantasy XVI, which includes the two DLCS: The Rising Tides and Echoes of the Fallen, for $69.99.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the system requirements for Final Fantasy XVI aren't as heavy as some might expect. Below are both the minimum and recommended specifications for Final Fantasy XVI. The most surprising thing on the list is probably that the game is a whopping 170 GB.</p>

But you can also dig deep into the ground with a shovel in the hopes of finding a small deposit.</p><p>On top of resources like iron, many armor sets also require Armor Crafting Kits, which you can find in high-value loot containers and as quest rewards for the traders.</p><h2 id="h1746"><a id=""></a><strong>Types of armor in the game</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b18565e0252e9da4b623006d05ff8e88" data-recommend-id="image://b18565e0252e9da4b623006d05ff8e88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The armor crafting UI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The armor crafting UI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Fun Pimps / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b18565e0252e9da4b623006d05ff8e88" data-recommend-id="image://b18565e0252e9da4b623006d05ff8e88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The armor crafting UI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In total, <em>7 Days to Die</em> features 16 unique armor sets, with the majority offering a set bonus that boosts your stats and abilities for wearing every piece.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esl-faceit-group-announces-partnership-extension-with-dhl/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>More and more companies are getting involved in esports. DHL, the popular logistics organization, has officially announced an extension of its partnership with the esports tournament organizer, ESL FACEIT Group. This is a multi-year deal that will showcase the brand across various ESL broadcasts.</p>



<p>DHL already has a prominent presence within the Snapdragon Pro series, which is the world’s largest mobile esports competition. </p>



<h2 id="h-esl-faceit-group-extends-partnership-with-dhl">ESL FACEIT Group Extends Partnership With DHL</h2>



<p>DHL first found themselves in a deal with ESL FACEIT Group back in 2018. In those six consecutive years working together, DHL has obtained immense success from the partnership, with a result of gaining more than 10,000 job applications just since 2022. It is a no-brainer as to why the company is choosing to continue working with ESL.</p>



<p>Not only will DHL be a title sponsor for ESL, but they will also be managing the logistics of staging and broadcasting technologies required for events, such as DreamHack and more.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>“Through its partnership with EFG, DHL has become a brand that inspires gaming fans like none other,” said Rodrigo Samwell, Chief Commercial Officer at ESL FACEIT Group. “We see thousands of fans chanting ‘DHL’ at our live events, and the love the esports community shows to DHL is nothing short of extraordinary.”</p>



<p>ESL has been consistently adding more and more partners to its brand, making it one of the biggest names in esports.</p>



<p>“That support is a testament to the fact that EFG’s and DHL’s joint long-term strategy resonates with the most important people: our fans.”</p>



<p>The industry continues to thrive as more and more brands are beginning to partner with esports.</p>







<h2 id="h-about-dhl">About DHL</h2>



<p>DHL is a global leader in the statistics industry. The company specializes in international shipping, courier services and transportation. The company was first founded back in 1969 in San Francisco, California, and has long since been catering to different businesses, people and organizations.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> will launch on PC on 17th September across both the Epic Games Store and Steam.
</p>
<p>
The PC version has been long-awaited since the game was released as a PS5 console exclusive last year.
</p>
<p>
Today's news comes with a new PC specific trailer, see below. A demo is available to try out now.

<p>
The game will arrive as a complete edition, including all DLC: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-first-dlc-opens-that-one-mysterious-door-and-its-characters-minds">Echoes of the Fallen</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-is-finally-complete-though-its-dlc-wont-appease-critics">The Rising Tide</a>.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month speculation rose that an announcement was imminent when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-profile-in-latest-nvidia-driver-leads-to-speculation-of-imminent-pc-release">Nvidia's latest driver included mention of the game</a>, along with a demo.
</p>
<p>
The demo begins at the start of the game and data can be carried over to the full game. This is the same as the PS5 launch.
</p>
<p>
Final Fantasy 16 received a mostly positive response, though some longtime fans were less keen on the series shift from traditional turn-based combat to real-time action combat.
</p>
<p>
The simultaneous release across Epic and Steam differs from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, which first launched as an Epic exclusive before arriving on Steam the following year. However it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-pc-barebones-port">criticised at launch for its performance</a>.

</p>
<p>
Let's hope Final Fantasy 16 doesn't suffer the same fate.
