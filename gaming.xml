			<p>Not only is there the pre-expansion update coming soon to World of Warcraft, but the actual expansion itself isn't far away at all. For those looking forward to the new expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-wows-most-ambitious-story-arc-to-date-launches-august-26-pre-orders-live-now/">The War Within</a> will arrive at World of Warcraft on 26 August. If you want to get stuck, this guide will tell you what to do before The War Within update comes out.</p>
<h2>Preparing for The War Within Pre-patch</h2>
<p>If you like to farm for mounts or achievements, some will be much harder to get once Dragonflight has passed and The War Within has arrived.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complete World of Warcraft: Dragonflight's campaign.&nbsp;</strong>If you care about the story, ensuring you are all up to date on the campaign is vital. It'll help fill in the gaps about the Primalists and help you prepare for the upcoming story of The War Within.</li>
<li><strong>Run Raids and Mythic+ Dungeons.</strong> If possible, you want to be as geared up as possible when you begin to walk through the pre-patch. Some of the enemies may be overtuned, which can make brutal fights even harder. Having a good gear level will help massively with that.</li>
<li><strong>Try out some PvP.</strong> If you've never done PvP, now is a great time to get stuck. You can get PvP-specific gear, collect currencies, and exchange them for mounts and titles if you are prepared for a lengthy grind. Keep in mind that you don't have long to complete these things.</li>
<li><strong>Level up your Professions.&nbsp;</strong>While this may seem like something that isn't important, it can help boost your character. Not only can you get potions that will buff you, but you can then go on to complete Standing Orders for other people to earn some quick gold. There are plenty of professions to choose from, and many of them are highly beneficial, especially in the late game.</li>
<li><strong>Complete Non-Awakened Raids</strong>. At the moment, the three Raids in Dragonflight are classed as non-awakened. Once the patch has gone live, these raids will be permanently awakened, meaning you may find it harder to obtain the raid-specific gear and cosmetics you would have gotten from completing them while they were in a non-awakened state.</li>
<li><strong>Grind Renown levels</strong>. If you like to grind reputation levels with different factions, grinding Renown is perfect. Not only does it give you access to great cosmetics, it can also allow you to unlock mounts and other gear that you may find beneficial on your World of Warcraft journey.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is plenty still left to do in World of Warcraft, and it's entirely up to you what you choose to do with the time before The War Within<a href="https://thewarwithin.blizzard.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pre-patch</a> arrives. Remember, you only have until July 23 to complete all of the time-gated content from Dragonflight before The War Within comes crashing in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-oshamir-ship-reylo-episode-8-1851600313<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Star Wars</em> fandom is a fraught, fervent place. In the modern age, online communities rallying around franchises are often composed of numerous splinter groups, and <em>Star Wars</em> is no exception—it’s got far-right reactionaries, original trilogy boomers, millennial prequel loyalists, Gen Z animated series lovers, and, of course, Reylos. It’s that last group—fans who ship characters Kylo Ren and Rey Skywalker of the sequel trilogy, and who are often women or queer folks—that have felt ostracized by other <em>Star Wars </em>fans in the years since 2019’s <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, and are just now feeling justified thanks to <em>The Acolyte</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sparks undeniably flew between Kylo and Rey in <em>The Last Jedi</em>, only to be briefly fanned and then snuffed out in the almost universally panned sequel, leaving Reylos convinced there was no love left in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, and no love for them, either. But then came <em>The Acolyte</em>, the latest Disney+ <em>Star Wars</em> series, and its season finale—and with it, vindication for Reylos.<br></p><p>Former Jedi Padawan Osha (Amandla Stenberg) and dark side practitioner Qimir (Manny Jacinto) end up together, holding hands, staring out at the horizon. Romance (and specifically the kind of enemies-to-lovers romance that fanfic writers love) is back on the cantina menu, so I spoke to several self-proclaimed Reylos via email to learn how <em>The Acolyte</em> speaks directly to them.</p><figure id="" data-id="412c4ed268748cb056871d65537a71b8" data-recommend-id="image://412c4ed268748cb056871d65537a71b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rey and Kylo reach out.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h5227"><a id=""></a><strong>The rise and fall of Reylos</strong></h2><p>“The two holding hands looking off into the sunset, rather than ending up alone. I think for a lot of Reylos, that’s really healing,” fantasy author Alex Kennington tells me via email. “It’s really nice to see [<em>The Acolyte</em> showrunner] Leslye Headland not shying away from the romance in interviews when it seemed like during the sequel trilogy the creators tried to be more vague and that only fueled the internet backlash.”<br></p><p>For many Reylos, the sequel trilogy’s failure to center the burgeoning romance between Kylo and Rey pointed to a franchise-wide reluctance to cater to the more feminine side of the fandom. Whereas the prequels put Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala’s love at their center, the conclusion to the sequel trilogy shied away from a full-blown romance, choosing instead to focus on Rey’s newly revealed connection to Emperor Palpatine, even though we learned Kylo and Rey are a “dyad,” a duo that shares a similar spark of the Force. The two share a single kiss near the end of <em>TRoS</em>, immediately after which Kylo dies.<br></p><p>“[<em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>] was probably the only time I have seen two characters kiss on screen and then seen fans instead of saying, ‘oh okay…it was meant to be romantic,’ you had people going, ‘oh it was a platonic kiss.’ The time after TRoS was truly wild,” author Ria Parisi explained via email. “The bad [part of their relationship] came from the final execution and unfortunate backlash. It’s very disappointing and sad to set up two characters who are supposed to be one half of each other and then leave one of them alone.”<br></p><p>“Where Reylo suffered the most was in the disconnect of ideas across the three films,” content creator Sawyer Markham wrote, referencing how the first and last films were made by J.J. Abrams while the middle was done by Rian Johnson, a decision many feel led to bizarre tonal shifts throughout the trilogy. And when the Reylos took to the internet to lament what they felt was a squandered on-screen romance, they faced widespread backlash. It’s important to note that, like all corners of <em>Star Wars</em> fandom, there was a sect of Reylos who exhibited some fairly virulent racism, swapping Kylo in for John Boyega’s Finn in fan art and fan-fic. But much of the anti-Reylo backlash felt rooted more in old-school misogyny than anything else.<br></p><p>“I think any online fandom or fandom subsect that is largely made up of people who aren’t cishet white men is inevitably treated badly. Reylos loved and connected with <em>The Last Jedi</em> in particular, whilst another small but very loud part of the fandom didn’t,” writer and director Laurie Kirwan-Ashman told me via email. “This coincided with the <em>Star Wars</em> fandom being infiltrated by the far-right off the back of Comicsgate, which then turned into a YouTube culture wars money-making grift that has created its own toxic cult.”<br></p><p>In the years since <em>The Last Jedi </em>and <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, Disney’s <em>Star Wars </em>stories have mostly avoided romance, but when Headland took the helm for <em>The Acolyte</em>, she made it clear that she wasn’t going to shy away from longing glances and grazing hands. </p><figure id="" data-id="dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-recommend-id="image://dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-format="jpg" data-width="916" data-height="522" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Qimir wields a saber near Osha's face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Qimir wields a saber near Osha's face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-recommend-id="image://dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-format="jpg" data-width="916" data-height="522" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Qimir wields a saber near Osha's face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h5228"><a id=""></a><strong>Enemies to lovers, for real this time</strong></h2><p>In stark contrast to any other official <em>Star Wars </em>media, <em>The Acolyte</em> wears its ship on its sleeve. “We went from Kylo taking off his shirt and people not getting it was meant to be the set up for a romantic relationship to this show saying, ‘Fine you didn’t get it with that? We’ll make [Qimir] fully nude’,” said Kennington. “And seeing the fans come together again in a way I haven’t seen since right after <em>The Last Jedi</em>, it just feels amazing.”</p><p>Not only did the series unabashedly lean into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-acolyte-episode-5-qimir-master-review-1851562506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-acolyte-episode-5-qimir-master-review-1851562506">Manny Jacinto’s sex appeal</a></span>, giving us what may be the first <em>Star Wars </em>character who’s canonically naked on-screen, but it subverted typical series tropes—Osha, raised by the Jedi, turns to the dark side, drawn there by her connection to Qimir. It’s the kind of romance plot Reylos have been dreaming of for years. “I read an interview that Leslye Headland did where she discussed how past characters talked about being seduced by the Dark Side and how we’d never actually seen that onscreen so she decided to give it to us—and she did!” author Sariah Wilson said over email.<br></p><p>“I still have to kind of pinch myself, like, am I really seeing a <em>Star Wars</em> show where a young woman abandons the institutional ‘We Have All The Answers’ club in favor of something more nuanced and complex, and is celebrated in the narrative for it, and gets to hold hands with the guy she had a connection with and look at the sunset?” Carrie, an early childhood professional, wondered. </p><p>And it’s not just about the broad strokes of a corruption courtship, it’s the manner in which that courtship is portrayed, with the kind of soft, sensual femininity that we almost never see in <em>Star Wars</em>. “It’s so slick, it’s so intentional, it’s so <em>hot</em>, it’s everything <em>Star Wars</em> could have been for the last seven years if the (overblown) reaction (from a loud minority of affirmative fans joined by right wing grifters) to <em>The Last Jedi</em> didn’t spook the higher-ups so badly,” said comic artist Para Caspari.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-qimir-osha-ship-sexy-reylo-1851576215&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-qimir-osha-ship-sexy-reylo-1851576215">In <em>The Acolyte</em> episode 6</a></span>, Jacinto’s Qimir offers a not-so-subtle thesis for the “Oshamir” romance: “Below the surface of consciousness are powerful emotions—anger, fear, loss…desire.” Qimir seduces Osha, showing her that the Jedi way is draconian and severe, and even though she resists him at first, once she realizes the mistakes the Jedi made and how they resulted in the death of her mother, she sees that there’s much more nuance than they’d like her to believe. And so, she chooses Qimir, and the Dark Side.<br></p><p> “On the surface level, they’re obviously both incredibly beautiful people but, as with Reylo, what has really sparked so much investment in them is their dynamic: the push/pull tension, the way they surprise and challenge each other, the roles they’re playing and what they offer for each other’s character development,” explained Kirwan-Ashman. “There was a lot of really fun sexual subtext in <em>TLJ</em>…but it’s such a joy to have it be so explicitly explored in <em>The Acolyte</em>, and for the show to be so clearly interested in how seduction and desire play into the wider themes.”</p><figure id="" data-id="50d3d80f50df7c9c6b4f32b2d0a4d135" data-recommend-id="image://50d3d80f50df7c9c6b4f32b2d0a4d135" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Osha and Qimir look into the distance together.

But right now, Reylos are riding high after the recent finale—dare I say, they’re feeling vindicated—largely because Headland has been so open in discussing her vision for the series, and how Osha and Qimir’s dynamic is at its core.<br></p><p>“Leslye [Headland] wasn’t afraid to take risks in setting up the romantic undertones for these characters, and when asked about it in interviews she confirmed that that was her intent, which is something that was markedly missing from the Reylo era,” explained Markham. Rather than squabbling over subtext, <em>Acolyte </em>fans have concrete proof that this is a series about romance, and about blurring the lines between good and evil—as many pointed out after the season finale, Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) maintained a lie for over a decade, insisting that Osha’s sister Mae was the reason why their entire witch coven perished. Qimir, on the other hand, gives Osha all the information she needed to make an informed decision, and space to ponder her future. By the end of the finale, she turns to him, hand outstretched, and chooses to train alongside him. To Reylos, this is a revelation.<br></p><p>“That’s why I think <em>Acolyte</em> is hitting such a chord with so many Reylo shippers: here’s a complex young woman who struggles with her darkness in a very real-feeling way onscreen, who can’t maintain her cognitive dissonance anymore, and who is learning that anger and fear and yes, desire, are all completely fine and normal emotions to feel and to harness in life,” Carrie pointed out.<br></p><p>Caspari takes it a step further, saying <em>The Acolyte</em> is “not just vindication but it specifically feels like a response to the Sequels along the lines of my aforementioned criticisms. It feels like Headland saying, ‘that sucked, here’s how I’d have done it’.” She continued, “Of course, if you’re a Reylo it feels like you’re finally free after being gaslit for a decade…of being told by both antis and affirmative fans alike that we were being weird, reading too much into it, projecting our own immoral fantasies, etc. it means a lot.”<br></p><p> Oshamir is also bittersweet for many Reylos, who wish they would have seen this kind of romance play out on the big screen. “In one way it’s a win because it feels like we’re finally allowing for women to be messy and complex in their characterization,” pointed out Carrie. “But on the other hand there’s definitely some bitterness because if Osha and Qimir holding hands and staring off into the sunset together was fine, why couldn’t we have had anything like that in <em>TROS</em>?”</p><p>“It also feels vindicating in the sense of being a show that includes and represents people who have been historically marginalized, both in terms of on-screen depiction in <em>Star Wars</em> and beyond,” said Kirwin-Ashman. “<em>The Acolyte </em>is created by a lesbian and all the main characters are played by women, non-binary, queer people and people of color.”<br></p><p>And though that may be what caused bad actors to review-bomb it and reactionary <em>Star Wars</em> YouTubers to declare <em>The Acolyte</em> dead in the water, Reylos have a very different outlook. As Kirwin-Ashman pointed out, “it really feels like it’s welcoming a new generation of the fandom as well as those who have loved <em>Star Wars</em> for a long time but have often felt in the past like <em>Star Wars</em> didn’t love them back.”<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>The Sims 4: Lovestruck is one of the game's most meaningful expansions, elevating relationships and player choice while also offering plenty of humor and spice.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>If you're a part of The Sims community, you know there are dozens of different kinds of "Simmers," as Maxis affectionately calls us. You have the luxury-focused "motherlode" spammers, the architects, the storytellers, the folks who find comfort in watching a simple family live out their simple life, the ladder-deleters, and more. Yet even heartbroken players executing their revenge fantasies are not the most depraved of all Sims players. No no. It's the Wicked Whims community who take that crown.</p><p dir="ltr">Wicked Whims, for the unacquainted, is a popular mod that adds graphic nudity to The Sims 4 as well as just about everything you can <em>do</em> while graphically nude. Like, <em>everything</em>. Not that I would know because <em>obviously</em> I've never installed it. That would be indecent. Obviously.</p><p dir="ltr">But if I <em>had </em>installed it, I would be able to tell you that The Sims 4's upcoming Lovestruck expansion certainly doesn't come close to being as colorful as WW. However, it does add just enough spice to put that "Rated T for Teens'' label to the test and contains some concepts we've seen in Wicked Whims' less-spicy companion: Wonderful Whims. And overall, The Sims 4 experience is made much better for it. On top of adding a healthy dose of lust to the game, Lovestruck adds a whole lot of <em>love </em>to the game. Thanks to Lovestruck, we get some much-needed complexity and clarity to relationships, a better replication of what real-life relationships can look like, and a reminder of what makes Maxis a simulation-game powerhouse.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336827-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-22screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336827" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336827-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-22screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336827"></a><figcaption>Two men embrace one another on a couch, looking smitten.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336827-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-22screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Shortly after attending a hands-off preview event offering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-is-finally-getting-rid-of-one-of-its-most-annoying-features-with-a-free-update/1100-6524986/">an overview of Lovestruck</a>, I was given the chance to test out the expansion. Seeing as the DLC was all about romance, I decided to boot up the game and make my very own rom-com protagonist, complete with a job at a <em>very</em> important magazine, an ambitious personality, and a fear of love. I found there are a lot of fun new additions to Create-A-Sim: cute and inclusive new hair styles, plenty of sexy going-out tops, and plenty of other fun items. However, the greatest changes resided in the Simology panel. New to the game are Romantic Boundaries, Turn Ons and Turn Offs, two new personality traits (Love Bug and Romantically Reserved), two new aspirations (Romantic Explorer and Paragon Partner), and the long-awaited ability to set roommates as partners.</p><p dir="ltr">Romantic Boundaries are easily the most substantial update to the game, making it no surprise that Maxis opted to bring the system over to the base game as well. Essentially, Romantic Boundaries establish what behaviors you are okay with in a relationship. Lovestruck breaks it down with four questions: Does your sim get jealous if a partner flirts with another sim? What about if they get a bit hands-on? What if they WooHoo? And lastly, is your Sim willing to talk through their boundaries if they are broken and negotiate their relationships terms? I decided to go with no, yes, yes, yes to see how everything would play out.</p><p dir="ltr">Selecting her Turn Ons and Turn Offs was also a lot of fun. Rather than simply allow you to choose from the game's pre-established traits, the system lumps them into general ideas. For example, rather than just selecting that you like "Loner" types, you can select that you like "Homebodies," which includes Bookworm, Clumsy, Geek, Lazy, Sedentary, Socially Awkward, <em>and </em>Loner. I made her attracted to Hardworking, Career-Minded, and Wealthy Sims, then threw in a bit of a problematic trait that, in my own little headcanon, had gotten her into trouble before: Already Taken.</p><p dir="ltr">I then moved my sim, the somewhat ham-fistedly named Juliet Hart, into the expansion's new city: the also somewhat ham-fistedly named Ciudad Enamorada. The Mexico City-inspired neighborhood is gorgeous, with colorful buildings, plenty of rooftop terraces, and beautiful stone masonry buildings. I moved her into the cheapest of these lots, across from a motel that cost 40 simoleons a night.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336828-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336828" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336828-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336828"></a><figcaption>The neon-lit nearby motel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336828-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-20screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite Juliet's ambitions of being an award-winning columnist, I decided I needed to try the game's newest career path: Romance Consultant. On top of being novel, I figured it also probably offers more job security. Sure, she wasn't a romantic herself, but perhaps her cynicism, which she'd argue was merely realistic, would make her an interesting choice for the position. The second thing I did was sign up for Cupid's Corner, the game's new dating app. While you can't lie about your traits or appearance on the app--sorry, aspiring catfishers--you can only select two traits to showcase on your profile, allowing sims to hide any particularly unappealing characteristics prior to going out on a date.</p><p dir="ltr">After taking a new profile picture and selecting "Ambitious" and "Outgoing" as my traits--conveniently leaving out "Romantically Reserved"--I began swiping, so to speak. In Cupid's Corner, you are presented with seven potential suitors, with the traits that you like and dislike highlighted on their profile; these can then be refreshed every 12 in-game hours. Of the seven matches, you are allowed to "like" three of them, which adds them to the saved part of the app. From there, you can choose to save their number and/or ask them to go on a date with you. The first person Juliet went on a date with was a man named Manuel, whose artsy, Lovebug personality type was a bit different for her.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336830-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-34screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336830" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336830-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-34screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336830"></a><figcaption>The Cupid's Corner interface, in which a woman named Zoey's profile is displayed.

On a random Thursday, Gavin called Juliet from his job and told her she was having an awful day. Juliet then told him she'd bring him lunch and set off to his work with tacos, which made their relationship grow closer. Gavin soon became the situationship she was most invested in, causing her to develop a fear that he might be seeing other sims behind her back--she then was able to have a sit-down with him in which he reassured her he was serious about her, causing the game to grant her "Fear Progress." While I don't know what conquering a fear entails--this was the only time the scenario popped up during my brief playtime--I am excited to explore the concept more.</p><p dir="ltr">A few days later, however, the obscenely wealthy Nancy Landgrab called Juliet with a strange proposition; in fact I am still <em>somewhat</em> unsure of the exact intention behind it. The lonely wife told Juliet that she was looking for some companionship and would pay Juliet a hefty sum to spend time with her at the nearby motel. Naturally I had to say yes, and met the "wealthy weirdo" as the game called her across the street. After two hours, Juliet came back with a bunch of strange objects in her inventory, including several precious stones and a rare black axolotl. Shortly after, Juliet was then invited to star on a reality dating program; the stranger told her they would set cameras all around her home and her mission would be to simply have one week's worth of hot dates. A Herculean task, but she was up for it. She soon developed a number of unique dynamics with other sims: a "Steamy" relationship with Manuel, a "Wholesome" one with Gavin, and a "Strained" one with the married Nancy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336829-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-25screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336829-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-25screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336829"></a><figcaption>A couple in matching, revealing wrestling outfits sits on a bed playing the new, raunchy adult game WooWho?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336829-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-25screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lovestruck is full of these weird, sincere, and steamy interactions. On top of being able to perform "Back-to-Back WooHoo" in the newly resurfaced vibrating bed--a callback to The Sims 1--whilst dressed up in a variety of suggestive costumes found in the game's new costume trunk, there are several new dialogue options. You can ask about WooHoo and romantic interests, ask to attend couple's counseling, ask what they're attracted to, ask about romantic boundaries, check in on your relationship status, recap WooHoos, and reveal desires. Romantically Reserved sims are also offered a number of Mr. Darcy-esque options, like asking an "indecent question," praising beauty, and offering a "civilized remark." After several "civilized remarks," conversations about relationship boundaries, and plenty of "Back-to-Back WooHoo," Juliet and Gavin decided to become exclusive and now live together in their newly renovated Ciudad Enamorada home--and I couldn't be happier for the lil' lovebirds.</p><p>In short, Lovestruck adds a bewildering amount of relationship complexity and over-the-top drama, the likes of which I haven't seen since my favorite The Sims entry, The Sims 2. The Sims expansions can be hit or miss; while some feel like they completely change the game's dynamics and are well-worth the $40 EA charges for them, others can feel more surface-level. Suffice to say, Lovestruck is the former, and I can't quite imagine going back to a version of the game without it. While all the options might be a lot for those whose playstyle is more simplistic (though it's worth mentioning you can turn Relationship Boundaries off in the settings menu), I believe Lovestruck is one of the series' most substantial and <em>fun</em> expansions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/longlegs-nic-cage-maika-monroe-oz-perkins<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Chris Person:</strong> Over the weekend, the release of Neon's latest horror movie Longlegs shocked people with a fantastic opening weekend. $22.6 million! Nicolas Cage is in it in an over the top role. It's creepy. It's retro. Gita: You and I both saw it. I have been digesting how I feel about it. What did you think of the movie?</p><p><strong>Gita Jackson:</strong> It's definitely a messy movie..... but my initial reaction was that I really, really liked it a lot. I might even love it. In particular, there's a string of performances that give the movie a lot of life, Nic Cage of course among them. I think the most complimentary thing I could say about this movie is that I want to see it a second time to really digest it—it's very dense!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I agree it is messy! I think I initially did not enjoy it, I still don't think I really love it, but there's a ton of performances that are fantastic. Nic Cage is the big one and a topic unto itself, but Maika Monroe and Blair Underwood come to mind in particular.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Blair Underwood is really incredible in the film honestly. Everyone else is firmly rooted in this dreamy unreality except for Underwood, who is basically the film's only Normal Man who reacts to things Normally, until he really pointedly doesn't. I know this movie was billed as being exceptionally scary, but Underwood got some big laughs when I saw it in theaters.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> He's a fantastic straight man in a movie where nobody has their shit together I agree. Maika Monroe has this deeply neurotic tension that feels very period appropriate. She has a strong Winona aura.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I truly love Maika Monroe as an actress so much. I know a lot of people probably first saw her in <em>It Follows</em>, a really phenomenal film, but I thought she was just as good if not better in <em>The Guest</em>, playing against Dan Stevens. I fucking love that movie. She's definitely got a Winona-aura...... she can play confident and self assured at the same time as projecting vulnerability. Which is basically what this movie is all about!</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It's weird to see an acting style that lines up with the references the movie is making, Jodie Foster in <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em> is also in there. But the movie is also set in the 90's, you see Bill Clinton visage on the wall. It may be worth contextualizing the plot going into this if you haven't already seen it, but we will be spoiling it a bit if that's something readers are sensitive to.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Let's talk about the set up, at least, and then we can get more explicit about spoilers in a minute. I went into this totally blind, actually, and I enjoyed that experience. So if that's you, maybe tap out now!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I did too!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> In this movie, Maika Monroe plays Lee Harker, an FBI agent who might be a little bit psychic. She's called in by her boss, played by Blair Underwood, to help him solve the Longlegs murders. These murders are all tied together by a note, written in code, signed by someone who goes by Longlegs—but also, there is no evidence that Longlegs himself has ever been at the scene of the crime. All these crimes are committed by the father of a family, who kills the children, his wife and then himself. The only thing the families have in common is that they have a daughter who was born on the 14th of the month, and the murders are committed on or around that birthday.</p><p>Then, this being a horror movie directed by Oz Perkins with Nicolas Cage in a pivotal role, some weird stuff happens.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LONGLEGS | Official Trailer | In Theaters July 12" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OG7wOTE8NhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Perkins and Cage are both working through some stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> A long time ago, Cage gave an interview where he described acting as being like jazz, and a lot of people made fun of him. When you watch what he does in this movie, you kinda see what he means.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Describing Cage's character is hard because it's really singular. Imagine if you gave Buffalo Bill the soul of Gary Glitter, he got tremendously early plastic surgery done, and he started living in a cellar and talking like Tiny Tim in white makeup. It's the definition of a lot. For a while I thought he had a medical condition but apparently it was supposed to be 70s-80s era plastic surgery he got done to please the devil.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> At one point in the film he sings one of his lines instead of speaking it and you CANNOT convince me that was in the script. It's like he's doing this, but for a movie that is good and not bad:&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Nicolas Cage (Deadfall Highlights)" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nN17X-OdGQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I want to just see a compilation of all of his takes for this movie. He is just Trying Shit. The other quote about Cage I love to bring up is that Ebert said he's a great actor in a good movie, but an indispensable actor in a bad one. He will make everyone match his energy by just trying out something super fucking weird and making people react to it. While Cage's performance is getting a lot of buzz, what's most impressive to me is that the other actors match his freak, basically. I especially liked Alicia Witt as Maika Monroe's hoarder mom—I think the only other role people might know her for is Alia Atreides in Lynch's Dune.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think it's a very personal role. He based the character's mannerisms a lot on his mother,&nbsp;Joy Vogelsang, who was mentally ill to the point of being institutionalized. It is a character that hears voices. He also has stated he wanted the character to be androgynous, and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/nicolas-cage-longlegs-serial-killer-inspiration-mother-1235941846/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cited Juliet of the Spirits as a reference</a>, which is a good pull.</p><p>I see some criticisms that the character is either a transphobic or anti-queer role and while I can see that I think it does a disservice to what Cage and Perkins are both pulling from in their lives. Perkins' dad was Anthony Perkins! Norman Bates!</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah I feel like I understand where the idea of this specific role being anti-queer comes from, but given how personal this movie is to the people who made it, it just doesn't scan. Anthony Perkins died from AIDS-related complications and that's, ya know, Oz's dad. Beyond that, I think the movie really clearly sets up a framework that focuses on patriarchal violence and moral panics and when you venture outside that framing, like, <em>nothing</em> in the movie really makes sense.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah you have these really personal motivations for the movie, Cage and Perkins having very fraught relationships with their parents, and it's wedded to a movie that telegraphs what it is doing way too early and where the primary action (compelling fathers to kill their families with the power of demonic possession) does not really make sense outside of The Devil Made Them Do It. That's not how the devil works! That's the part that really pissed me off, you can't just force people to do things that are not in their hearts!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> You see...... I think the argument he makes is that fathers do secretly hold that in their hearts. Early on in the movie, Agent Carter's daughter tells Lee Harker that she thinks that her stuffed animals are childish, but her dad makes her keep them so she "doesn't grow up too fast." The parental figures in the movie all walk this thin line between love and violence—and then eventually cross it. Weirdly it gives <em>P.T.</em></p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It gives <em>Alan Wake 2</em> too. Sorry if that's a tangent, it just looks really similar.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> No you're totally right. There's a shot where the camera is following Harker from behind and you see that big, yellow FBI logo and I just thought, I wonder if Sam Lake has seen this. Similar color palette too—a lot of the movie is greys and beiges and then there's these vibrant splashes of red.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>It's also similar in that, you're never really sure what the tone is? In <em>Alan Wake 2</em> it's because it's made in Finland, but this has this strange mixture of camp and earnestness that sometimes clashes. Like it wants to be <em>Se7en </em>and <em>Zodiac </em>and it is very much a pastiche of those. I think it being fun does make it a more palatable movie.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I love that moment where they ask the guy at the front desk of a mental health facility if they check IDs for visitors and he goes "well, you know that sounds like great idea!"</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That guy ruled. I love a catty gay guy that is not good at his job.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Finally, representation</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think it's got the most in common with <em>M3gan</em>, like it knows what it is there to do first and foremost and it's to have a good time, and I think that's why it did so well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Absolutely. I don't know how long it was, it felt extremely breezy while I was watching it, but it reminded me of a kind of movie that we used to get a lot of in the 90s that they just don't make anymore: a thriller for adults with no ambitions of becoming an Intellectual Property.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, just a fun one off. I think the biggest problem with it is, for me, is that it's not a really great movie (to me at least). I really wanna see what Oz Perkins does after this, but I also saw a lot of people recommend Kiyoshi Kurosawa's <em>Cure </em>after this and I agree with that sentiment because A) It's one of the best movies (period, not just horror) ever made and B) it does the same central conceit far better, to the point where I was like "Wait, are you just doing <em>Cure</em>? I've seen that! You can't do that better!"</p><figure></figure><p>That's the biggest gambit with referencing good movies so aggressively. Like there's a part where Harker's Mom slyly quotes Lilian Gish in <em>The Night of The Hunter</em> and you only get to do that if you make a perfect movie. <em>Do The Right Thing</em> gets to but it's a perfect movie!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah thinking on it...... I think the worst thing about the movie is that it was marketed as a horror movie and not as a "psychological thriller," which is basically a horror movie but people don't have such weird expectations of what that means the movie will be. You can tell when you're watching it how the framework of being a horror films—something they can't escape by referencing <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> so much—forms the arc of the movie. In particular I think it undercuts the very last scene of the movie and the resolution of the murder mystery. Horror often works by making people invoke the creepy thing you're gesturing towards in their own heads, by scaring them with the implication of something rather than its actual depiction. But I feel like this movie had something it wanted to capital s Say about how fucking scary childhood is, but it doesn't actually ever come out and say it.</p><p>I think we may be...... in <strong><em>spoiler territory</em></strong>.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I am fine with that, we've come so far.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Let us proceed my friend</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Into...the darkness...</p><h2><strong>SPOILERS</strong></h2><p><strong>Gita:</strong> God, so the thing I wish they actually spent a little bit more time on is the creepy life size dolls.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I need to know how they work! Sorry to be a nerd, but the mechanics don't really make sense even if you concede that magic and the devil are real.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> YEAH that is something that I think holds the movie back. So much of the symbolism depends on the dolls, and then they kinda just yadda yadda yadda over the mechanics of them.</p><p>For those reading along—it's discovered, eventually, that Longlegs gives all his victims incredibly lifelike dolls that look exactly like the daughter in the family. And over time, you can basically put together how the symbolism here works. The dolls compel the fathers to kill, so that the only thing that remains is the doll, perfect and pristine forever. Violence being done in the name of protecting the daughter, that also kills the daughter.</p><p>And we learn that Lee Harker's mother has been the person who has been dropping these dolls off, placing her into that same structure—she murders to protect her child, but also she has a really weird relationship with her daughter who seems emotionally stunted and stuck at this moment of trauma from her childhood.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That part is again, Perkins making it about himself. A mother protecting their child from truths but never acknowledging the elephant in the room. But the doll thing is so left field. <em>Cure </em>handles this beautifully! Most people know what hypnosis is. It doesn't need to be literally true, it just needs to feel organic. Dolls with metal balls in their head you whisper things into is a lot to load on to the audience and have them accept. That's new lore you've invented, you need to do some scene setting for it, and as it stands it just kinda barrels through.</p><p>I cannot stress how much I hate being a nerd about this, but it's really not done well.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Gita:</strong> And it's frustrating because the pieces SHOULD all line up and then they just. don't.</p><p>Like I was able to really quickly clock that Lee's mother was in on it, and that she probably had already met Longlegs, and that the dolls make the fathers kill. Honestly maybe the part that just doesn't work is the little metal ball inside? Harker's mother says that Longlegs puts "a little of himself inside" but it's like, what does that MEAN.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Right, it's not ambiguous in a way that leaves you guessing.</p><p>And all that said? Still had a pretty OK time. It's fun! But the PARTS are all there, the parts for a better movie, and that's the part that I can't get past.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Sometimes movies are more frustrating when they're almost great.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Chris:</strong> You were so close dude!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I would say it's a solid good not great movie—but it really made me want to watch Perkins's other stuff. I heard that <em>The Blackcoat's Daughter</em> picks up a lot of the same themes that are in this movie.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> A friend liked <em>&nbsp;I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives In The House</em> but I have not seen it. Anyway, moral of the story to readers: Go watch <em>Cure</em>.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>If you are more of a book reading type, I would also read <em>The Gone World</em> by Tom Sweterlisch, which has a similar plot but is a fucked up time travel story with really disturbing body horror elements.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Oh I should read that.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It slaps dude. I reread it all the time. Maybe Perkins should grab the rights!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-annonounced-release-date-pc-ps5-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a> is perhaps the only game based on a big PlayStation IP due to launch this year. Of course, it is also a spin-off title that mainly targets kids of around eight years old.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/making-horizon-zero-dawn-suitable-for-eight-year-olds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry</a>, James Windeler, narrative director at Guerrilla Games (which is working alongside Studio Gobo on this project), said that fans of the franchise will still recognize the main characters in LEGO Horizon Adventures, even though certain themes take on a more lighthearted note due to the different target audience.</p>
<p><em>We have tried to keep as much of the story as possible. A lot of what happens in the world, like the destruction of the old world… that's a pretty heavy theme for an eight-year-old. So we needed to find ways to keep that present in the story, because it is essential to Horizon. But it is also not something we leaned on. You won't find some of those devastating reveals from the first game, like those corporate masterminds dead around the table or anything like that.</em></p>
<p><em>There are moments from the first game that packs a really heavy emotional punch, that we've found, I think, a very good way to represent faithfully, but undercut them with comedy that keeps things light-hearted. This stuff is present, but it's certainly not surface. This is a much simpler version, but it has a lot of echoes from the original.</em></p>
<p><em>It has still got to feel like Horizon. We have definitely bent the rules a lot. But the characters remain core to who they are. I think we've found a really good balance with it. We have a lot of help. Ashley Burch is back as the voice of Aloy, and JB Blanc (as Rost). And you would have heard the exuberance to their performances. It is different to what the other games are, but they're still recognisable. They're part of it and they bought into it, and that's been a huge boon to us.</em></p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is launching this December on PC, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving out Xbox</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-switch-for-everyone-no-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-play multiplayer</a> among the announced platforms.</p>

Following a disastrous launch, producer Naoki Yoshida took reins on the project and rebooted the game with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review">A Realm Reborn</a>, which literally destroyed the world of the launch game, and built on top of it the beloved MMORPG we know and love today.</p><p>A Realm Reborn was a two-fold project that fixed the frustrating gameplay and RPG systems of the launch version while telling a story that literally incorporates the destruction of the launch version into the wider narrative. And while A Realm Reborn quite literally saved FF14, the need to reboot an entire MMO and reintroduce players to the game is its greatest weakness. Compared to later expansions, A Realm Reborn feels downright glacial when it comes to pacing, and the need to revamp the world means its story is far more bloated than it needs to be in later expansions. While A Realm Reborn will always be cherished for saving Square Enix’s MMORPG, you’ll be hard-pressed to say the later expansions aren't better. - <em>Matt Kim</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Stormblood</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/27/ffxiv-40-mediakit-20170501-013-1498603434827.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/30/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood-review">Stormblood</a> is often looked at as one of the lesser-liked expansions, which, to me, speaks to how strong the rest of them are. That’s because Stormblood is still a crucial piece to Final Fantasy 14 that worked to conclude long-standing conflicts and show you just how evil and destructive the Garlean Empire was. I vividly remember the feeling of taking back Ala Mhigo after all these years of them being under Garlean rule, and taking back Doma Castle after seeing how Domans had suffered from the occupation. There are moments in which Stormblood undercuts its own messaging and perhaps didn’t fully find the nuance necessary to elegantly tell a politically charged story. However, it gets the larger picture right, and the liberation of the peoples across the different regions was invigorating nonetheless.</p><p>Stormblood’s zones might not be the most exciting of the bunch, but there’s a tranquility I still feel when flying across the Ruby Sea, over the plains of Azim Steppe, and past the rice patties in Yangxia. I often reflect on the stories of oppression and rebellion in those moments because of the smaller stories told throughout the expansion. I also remember Yotsuyu as one of the most complex villains of FF14 – her heartbreaking story represents how sadistic and corrupting living under oppression can be, which culminated in one of the best boss fights to this day. Stormblood may not have been the best expansion, but it had peaks that make FF14 what it is today. - <em>Michael Higham</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/01/dwan-1719847877677.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>With <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail fresh in my memory</a>, it’s a bit hard to gauge its place in the Final Fantasy 14 pantheon, but even with all its implications yet to be explored, it still stands as a worthy addition to the MMO’s long history. The land of Tural opens FF14 to so many different themes and cultural influences it wasn’t able to incorporate in the past, and although it does come with some mixed results, the vibrant foundation it lays leaves even more room for growth.<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-is-like-playing-a-great-one-piece-game"> Newcomer Wuk Lamat</a> is a large focus and although she’s not the strongest character in FF14, she has the heart necessary to carry out Dawntrail’s message of finding peace through mutual respect and embracing our differences.</p><p>Dawntrail’s lasting legacy is in the second half of its story where things turn in unpredictable directions. Its fusion of references to ancient civilizations, its Latin American roots, and the old-timey American West somehow make sense when they clash with the cyberpunk-tinged sci-fi elements that eventually come to the forefront. It’s able to touch on classic Final Fantasy narrative themes from a fresh perspective. We explored the depths of the pain we feel from losing the things we love most during Shadowbringers and Endwalker, but the way Dawntrail contextualizes mortality is powerfully intimate. In its best moments, Dawntrail can be as impactful as anything else found in FF14, and for that alone, this expansion deserves its flowers. - <em>MH</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Endwalker</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-ffxiv">Endwalker is the culmination</a> of a 10-year long story arc for Final Fantasy 14. From the days of A Realm Reborn, players became embroiled in a celestial battle between the gods Hydaelin and Zodiark. Beset in the real-world by a global pandemic that delayed the expansion by a year, Endwalker was a reward for players who stuck with the MMORPG from its earliest days who can now see the conclusion to a long-running storyline.</p><p>The stakes were high but Endwalker is FF14’s most emotional expansion to date, reinforcing Final Fantasy 14’s core themes of how friendship and courage can overcome even the greatest challenges. And with so much of Final Fantasy 14 now playable in single-player, a new player could play from A Realm Reborn through Endwalker and feel that they’ve finished one of the best Final Fantasy games of all time.</p><p>But thankfully, Endwalker is not the end of FF14, and the newest expansion, Dawntrail, is setting the stage for the next 10 years of Square Enix’s beloved MMORPG. - <em>MK</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Heavensward</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/11/11/ffxivheavenswardbenchmark018png-a80986.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>What a difference an expansion makes. Free from the need to fix an entire MMORPG, Final Fantasy 14’s next expansion after A Realm Reborn, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/29/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward-review">Heavensward</a>, is able to jump right into the action. With the Warriors of Light on the run, they escape to the frozen, holy land of Ishgard which has been too busy embroiled in a war against dragons to do much in Eorzea. </p><p>What’s immediately apparent in Heavensward is that it quickly establishes the themes and storytelling the FF14 team seems to revel in: dramatic, high fantasy that harkens back to the old pixel games like Final Fantasy 6. Heavensward is such a throwback to the classic sword and sorcery fantasy of early Final Fantasy games, while also introducing the dark courtly politics that would make George R.R. Martin grin. If A Realm Reborn took a lot of time to get going, Heavensward is action-packed almost from the jump and from there sets the bar for all later FF14 expansions. </p><p>To quote FromSoftware, the real Final Fantasy 14 begins with Heavensward. - <em>MK</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Shadowbringers</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/11/19/ffxiv-pub-fanfestival-2018-lasvegas-10-1542667050150.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>Final Fantasy 14 truly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/12/ffxiv-shadowbringers-review">found its voice in Shadowbringers</a>. Lead writer Natsuko Ishikawa stepped into the role and her poetic storytelling style gave the expansion its identity, focusing on its characters with a level of depth and emotional sincerity never before seen in FF14. From the moment you step into The First, there’s an immediate sense of urgency that sets the tone for how dire the flood of light has been on the entire realm, flipping the script on typical light versus dark stories. And in horrifying ways, leaned on showing rather than telling.</p><p>Shadowbringers captured its grand moments with a weight and excitement that few RPGs are able to pull off. It earns those moments by building characters like the Crystal Exarch, Ardbert, and Emet Selch in a complex web of heroes and villains to carry its heavier themes, and contextualize despair and tragedy in a world separate from anything we’d known in Eorzea. FF14 began to ask the big questions about loss, grief, and the lengths people will go to preserve the things that matter most to them, and did so with nuance.</p><p>And if we want to count the post-launch content, Patch 5.3 capped off what was already one of the best stories in the series with another incredible conclusion, reaching a height that I don’t think FF14 will ever be able to top. My precious crystal cat boy gave his all to save a realm, and all of my Scion friends were there to witness his greatness as he immortalized his life’s work at the Seat of Sacrifice. From its writing and narrative themes to its music and visual storytelling, Shadowbringers not only proved itself as peak FF14, it’s arguably peak Final Fantasy. - <em>MH</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>These are our rankings for our favorite Final Fantasy 14 expansions.

Specifically </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paramount-s-halo-show-is-kia-but-xbox-will-try-to-save-it">the now-cancelled Halo TV show</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> known as "Halo The Series" on Paramount Plus.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You know, the one where we saw Master Chief have sex before we ever saw him on a Halo.

But that's fine! TV shows come and go. A lot of hardworking people took big creative swings, and there were plenty of times I went "that was a great episode of television" even while screaming about the overall creative direction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as an industry observer, I can't help but notice that the Halo show and Microsoft's game division are suffering from the same problem: a business and creative strategy that, in one way or another, can be summed up like this: "I'll be better tomorrow."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Halo show was not better tomorrow">The Halo show was not better tomorrow</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's do a quick compare-and-contrast of the first Halo game and the first season of the Halo show. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo: Combat Evolved</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the player takes on the role of Master Chief, a super soldier cracked out of cryogenesis on a human warship fleeing a devastating loss against an alien species called The Covenant. The ship arrives over a mysterious ring called the Halo, its crew abandons ship and heads to the surface, and a war breaks out against The Covenant for control of the ring after everyone learns it's a massive superweapon. Then a zombie-like species called The Flood bursts from its innards, slaughters everyone, and only the Master Chief escapes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(Yes I know other people escaped. I read the books and played </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">that's called a retcon).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the Halo TV show...oh boy. The human race is in an existential war with an alien species called The Covenant, which is hunting for mysterious artifacts scattered across the galaxy pointing to a mysterious superweapon. The Master Chief, aka John, and his squad find an artifact while defending a group of space colonists who also hate the government and that stays relevant because surviving colonist Kwan Ha sticks around to throw monkey wrenches into the plot. This sets John off on a quest to find other artifacts while also rebelling against the repression against the United Nation Space Corps who kidnapped him as a child and put a chip in him that suppressed his emotions when they turned him into a super soldier and there's this human named Makee who was kidnapped by the Covenant as a child because she has a special connection to the alien artifacts and so does John and they're both weird chosen ones and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>help i can't do this anymore.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'll try to zip things up like this: Season 1 ends with the humans learning about the Halo. Season 2 follows the siege and destruction of the planet Reach, the battle that is shown in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo: Reach</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and ends with the Master Chief landing on the Halo in the last thirty minutes of the show. He and Makee have a standoff about how the Halo should be used and it ends on a cliffhanger.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was less a "zip-up" and more "getting your zipper stuck on the fabric of your jacket."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a final analysis the Halo show wasn't about the fight over the Halo, it was trying to answer a question that's often asked by executives giving script notes: why exactly do people care about the Halo to begin with? I fear Showrunner Steven Kane and the talented cast and crew working on the project were tasked with making a show about the broader Halo universe because someone higher up on the food chain was very insecure about a story set on Halo itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's not an impossible task but it sure as hell is difficult. It gets even harder when you put the burden of writing such an arc on the shoulders of two people. Picking through the IMDB credits, you start to get a sense of how the business model of streaming services tore this show apart. Kane and writer Kyle Killen (who also has a 'developed by' credit) are credited with the bulk of the scripts across both seasons, with Basil Lee Kreimendahl listed as "staff writer" on season 2.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few other writer's names pop up below them, but this smacks of what's become known as a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/features/writers-strike-tv-industry-streaming-problem-1235666463/">mini room</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" in the streaming era. Before the 2023 writer's strike, streaming service producers tried to pare down the number of writers staffed on a show by knocking out the entire scripting process with a small room of writers during the development process, with the showrunner executing those scripts once it goes to air. This process didn't always result in failure, but writers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/features/mini-rooms-writers-tv-pilot-series-orders-1235061733/">have discussed at length</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> how it hurt careers and made an already-difficult task that much harder.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The final product gave off the inevitable of "trust us, we're doing something different, but we'll get to the Halo soon." Season one passed, and once again we were given the energy of "trust us, we're doing something different, but we'll get to the Halo soon." Then season 2 only gave us a snipped of Halo and by that point...well...everything was so different that the awe-inducing celestial object created by Bungie lost all of its punch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This unfortunately sounds like the problem </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/was-xbox-backed-into-a-corner-by-minor-leaks-">we highlighted with Xbox's strategy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> back in February.

That has to be a stress-free position, right?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jokes aside, the lesson for the Halo brand and Xbox as a whole is right there in the Halo show itself: look at the hard work people put into the product, and give them the power to drive a strong direction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I dunked on the way-too-complex plot of the Halo series further up, but I had a good time watching it. Kane, Killen, and their peers tapped into some compelling stories that writers like Eric Nylund spun in the licensed spin-off books based on the games. The production designers did a fantastic job bringing the art direction first authored by Bungie to live action, and I can't say enough good things about Kate Kennedy's performance as Spartan supersoldier Kai-125. If the Halo show had been about her character in the setting of the games the same way Amazon's Fallout show followed an original cast, I think Paramount would have been cooking with gas.</span></p><p>Image via Paramount.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Say what you will about the show, but it felt like everything onscreen was brought to life by people who were passionate about their work and threw themselves headlong into the Halo world.

            <p>
Things are about to get lively on the Sea of Thieves! After spending far too long as giant, trash-talking disembodied head, the nefarious Captain Flameheart finally makes a proper return to Rare's multiplayer pirate adventure next Thursday, 25th July - and he'll be terrorising players with his formidable fire-belching warship as Season 13 gets underway.
</p>
<p>
As Rare explained <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-bumper-2024-bringing-windy-horns-grapple-guns-a-roaming-warship-and-loads-more">earlier this year</a>, that warship, The Burning Blade, serves as a new roving world event out on the waves, giving players the opportunity to go head-to-head against its awesome firepower if they so choose. The Burning Blade is officially the most powerful ship in Sea of Thieves, sporting ten cannons, the ability launch Ashen Roar balls of fire from its flaming bow, and a sizeable crew of obsidian skeletons to deal with. But if players manage to defeat it in battle, they have a choice: sink it in defiance of Flameheart or pledge their allegiance to the dread captain and become the new crew of The Burning Blade, temporarily at least.
</p>
<p>
Players that choose to do Flameheart's bidding and man The Burning Blade will get some assistance from its former obsidian skeleton crew, which'll be useful as other players - who can always see the vessel on their map - move in to try and take control themselves.

<p>
But what can you do as the new crew of The Burning Blade? Well, that ties in with Season 13's other new feature: Skeleton Camps. These are located throughout the Sea of Thieves, built by obsidian skeletons in order to extract mysterious artefacts from ancient temples hidden deep below the earth. Any crew, regardless of their allegiance, can approach active Skeleton Camps to ride the lift down into their depths and solve the puzzles within, but Flameheart has a special task for those commanding his vessel.
</p>
<p>
Each underground temple contains a crypt that's only accessible by scrutinising star charts and finding constellations hidden on their star-speckled ceilings. Get one open, though, and you'll uncover a half-finished ritual started by Flameheart's nefarious Reapers, who've been using corrupted Orbs of Secrets to extract knowledge from the Ancients buried inside. Crews in charge of The Burning Blade can then complete the ritual, collecting the secrets of the Ancients, and increasing the value stored within their ship.
</p>
<p>
Players on The Burning Blade are free to visit as many Skeleton Camps and complete as many rituals as they dare while they still have control of the warship, but if the risk from other players starts to feel too great, they can return to Captain Flameheart at the Reaper's Hideout and cash in their bounty for gold and Reaper's Bones reputation.
</p>
<p>
And for players that choose to oppose Flameheart, things work a little differently. For starters, when crews not in command of The Burning Blade enter Skeleton Camps, they'll need to scupper rather than complete the half-finished ritual, requiring them to defeat waves of vicious obsidian skeletons. And if they succeed, they can grab the Orb of Secrets, taking it to a Trading Company at an outpost in order to sell it for profit.
</p>
<p>
There's a little more to this side of things, however; if players who oppose Flameheart defeat The Burning Blade during its world event and let it sink rather than take control, they'll be awarded the Blade of Souls - a powerful weapon imbued with fiery attacks that increases in value for each ritual completed. This can then be turned into a Trading Company to earn gold and reputation when the risks start to feel too great.
</p>
<p>
Tying all this together are a bunch of new Commendations and rewards. There's a new Burning Blade ship set to unlock by completing rituals for Flameheart, for instance, as well as new Skeleton Curse customisation options that sufficiently ranked Hour Glass Battle players can use. Players that choose to sink The Burning Blade, meanwhile, can work toward unlocking obsidian weapons and clothing, plus the Obsidian Bone Crusher captain's cabin decorations and ship set. 
</p>
<p>
Alongside all that, Season 13 promises 100 more levels of seasonal progression and a new tier of premium rewards for those that buy the optional Plunder Pass. Additionally, players can purchase new toucan pets from the real-money Pirate Emporium when things get underway next Thursday, 25th July, on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5.
</p>
<p>
And if you're wondering what's next, we already have a pretty good idea. Rare's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-bumper-2024-bringing-windy-horns-grapple-guns-a-roaming-warship-and-loads-more">2024 Sea of Thieves roadmap</a> confirmed Season 14 will round out the year with new features enabling stealthier forms of play. Expect the likes of spring traps, blow darts, crouching and sneaking, plus the ability to silently hang off the edge of ships or scurry around disguised as treasure chests to trick unsuspecting crews. Oh, and there's a grapple gun on its way too...

In fact, they sound so alike that if you search for “cloudstrike” on Twitter, you’ll mostly find posts of people talking about the outage. Folks are now <em>convinced </em>that Cloudstrike is the name of the company that nearly shut down the whole world this morning, which is leading to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NotOR30/status/1814201312755470560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NotOR30/status/1814201312755470560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some confusion online</a></span>.</p><p>In actuality, Cloudstrike is an Arc exotic sniper rifle that was introduced back in 2020’s <em>Beyond Light </em>expansion. Cloudstrike <em>is </em>a pretty potent weapon, generating a powerful lightning strike at the point of impact after getting successive critical hits. Despite that incredible ability, I don’t think it’s capable of incapacitating the whole world like that.</p><p>Suffice to say, <em>Destiny 2 </em>fans went online today and were thoroughly confused at the fact that a four-year old weapon was trending for bringing the world to its knees. That didn’t stop them from getting some jokes off though.</p><p>Some folks working on the game seem to be getting a kick out of things. For example, one of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s community managers posted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/A_dmg04/status/1814326488029892895&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/A_dmg04/status/1814326488029892895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIF from the sitcom <em>Community</em></a></span>, featuring Donald Glover’s character returning to a room only to find it on fire. Most of the replies to his post are joking about Cloudstrike being responsible for the outage. A writer at Bungie posted a screenshot of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HazelMonforton/status/1814311639509782547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HazelMonforton/status/1814311639509782547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now deleted Reddit post</a></span> that sincerely asked, “Is Cloudstrike meta again?” Another user shared a more <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1e74c98/global_cloudstrike_issue/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1e74c98/global_cloudstrike_issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intentionally satirical post</a></span> to the game’s subreddit joking about a “global Cloudstrike issue.”<br></p><p>I’m glad there are some folks out there getting a kick out of things. Now that Trials of Osiris is back up for the weekend, I fully expect some of you to run around with Cloudstrike in honor of today’s historic event.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A CrowdStrike update that caused thousands of computers and servers to infinitely reset and "blue screen of death" finally has a solution, and it involves deleting (part of) System32. Yes, really, deleting one file in Windows' basic system directory apparently solves the problem that caused what some have called the biggest server outage in history.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/website-hosting/millions-of-windows-servers-down-after-crowdstrike-update-how-it-happened-and-how-to-fix" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TechRadar</a>, the fix to the issue involves booting Windows in Safe Mode, navigating to the CrowdStrike directory within System32, and deleting one file that matches a certain alphanumeric code. Meanwhile, Microsoft officially advises customers to restore from a backup if possible, and if not, attach the disk to a virtual machine for an offline repair.</p><p dir="ltr">In online circles, "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/delete-system32" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deleting System32</a>" is a well-known (if ancient) prank that trolls pulled on unsuspecting Windows users. It involves telling the user that deleting the folder will make their computer go faster (often through a specific command line); of course, in reality, deleting this folder would make their computer not work correctly.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it's not clear how many machines were affected by the July 19 outage, it had a major impact on airlines, hospitals, banks, and tech companies. Per <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/technology/microsoft-crowdstrike-outage-what-happened.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYT</a>, it even reportedly caused payment processors like Visa to suffer major downtime. Hundreds of flights were grounded as a result, and emergency 911 lines in multiple US states were also affected. Logistics companies like UPS and FedEx also experienced disruptions due to the snafu.</p><p dir="ltr">Initially feared to be a security incident or coordinated cyberattack, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz went to <a href="https://x.com/George_Kurtz/status/1814235001745027317" rel="nofollow ">social media</a> to quell those concerns. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he said that the issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed, though it'll likely take some time for the affected systems to recover.</p>

			<p>The long-awaited Cursed Sails event for <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-guidelines-frequent-crashes-ifortnite-intel-14th-gen-13th-gen-cpus/">Fortnite</a> is now live. Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is the next collaboration in-game, with players now able to live out their swashbuckling dreams by exploring Shipwreck Shallows and hunting for buried treasure.</p>
<p>With this <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/disneys-pirates-of-the-caribbean-docks-into-fortnite-br?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shiny new event</a> comes quests for players to complete, titled Cursed Sails quests. With this event comes a battle pass, where completing Cursed Sails quests will net you rewards from the Cursed Sails Pass. Completing the Cursed Sails quests will give you access to the Cursed Gold currency, the point system where you can unlock rewards from the battle pass.&nbsp; The battle pass features 11 unlockable cosmetics on the free track, meaning you don't have to miss out on looking the part of a pirate.</p>
<p>As with any battle pass, a free track allows players to unlock certain rewards, but they typically aren't as high rarity or high value as the paid track on the battle pass. By completing quests and unlocking the free tracks of the pass, you can expect to get items such as Jack's Cutlass, Bane Pickaxe, and Jack's Prize Back Bling.</p>
<p>For those who have purchased the battle pass for this event, you will instantly unlock Jack Sparrow's entire outfit. The premium track can net you rewards such as the Jar of Dirt Emote, Jack's Compass Back Bling, and many more Pirates of the Carribean-themed cosmetics. Additionally, you'll be able to get your hands on LEGO Jack Sparrow, where you can take him into LEGO Islands and LEGO Fortnite if you want a blockier experience.</p>
<p>While this event may feel similar to Wrecked, you will get to explore many new vessels that hide plenty of secrets along the way.</p>
<p>Participating in the event means you'll get to explore exclusive features that appear. For example, you may find a Ship in a Bottle when looting the vessels. By breaking it open, you can summon a Ghost Ship, which can crash into your opponents to deal devastating damage.</p>
<p>You can also have a blast with the event by jumping into a Pirate Cannon, launching you skyward and sending you a fair distance across the map. You can also move the Pirate Cannon around to choose where to aim and fire, giving you and your teammates the advantage of exploring uncharted territory.</p>
<p>Additionally, released in conjunction with this event, you can purchase cosmetic packs of Elizabeth Swann, Captain Barbossa, and Davy Jones, all of which come with their LEGO counterparts.</p>

<p>If you're curious but don't necessarily want to buy the game right away, EA Play subscribers have access to a 10-hour trial right now; Game Pass Ultimate members have this benefit as well since the membership includes EA Play.</p><p>College Football 25 is already doing well, as the game reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-hits-2-million-players-before-official-launch/1100-6525147/" data-ref-id="1100-6525147">2.2 million unique players during the early-access window</a>, while another 600,000 people have tried the EA Play trial.</p><p>EA's last college football game before this was 2013's NCAA Football 14. EA and the NCAA broke off their partnership due to a variety of reasons, including legal problems and lawsuits. Instead, EA brokered separate licensing deals to feature all 134 FBS schools in College Football 25. And in a major change, EA is paying athletes to be in the game as part of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals.</p><p>College Football 25 is available on console for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but not last-gen consoles, PC, or Nintendo Switch.</p><p>If you're just getting started with College Football 25, you may want to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-day-preorder-buying-guide/1100-6525115/" data-ref-id="1100-6525115">College Football 25 launch guide</a>.</p><p>You can see a sampling of review scores for College Football 25 below.

You can see sweat on individual players, the lighting is exceptional, and everything pops visually in a way that Madden just doesn’t. There’s also just a lot more stuff to enjoy, from the unique intros for each team as they take the field to mascots dancing around when their school pulls off a big play." -- <em>Will Borger </em>[<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Forbes -- 8.5/10</h2><p>"When I heard EA was bringing college football back, I was fully prepared to play a game of Madden with college uniforms. In all honesty, I would have played it and been mildly satisfied. EA delivered a much deeper experience that easily carves its own identity in every way possible. Once EA learns its way around the restrictions of the NIL situation, the series will go to an even higher level." -- <em>Brian Mazique </em>[<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2024/07/19/ea-college-football-25-review-the-good-the-bad-and-the-bottom-line/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2><strong>Polygon - No score</strong></h2><p>It’s a testament to what is possible with sports games when teams have longer than a few months to crank out AAA titles. And if this is the foundation for future college football games, then the series is in a very, very good place." -- <em>Matt Brown </em>[<a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/24201283/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-ncaa-ps5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2><strong>GamesRadar -- 4.5/5</strong></h2><p>"From nowhere, it's suddenly the sports game that all others have to beat." -- <em>Ben Wilson </em>[<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/college-football-25-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2><strong>Hardcore Gamer -- 4.5/5</strong></h2><p>"EA put all of its chips into College Football 25, and it truly paid off. People are buying consoles just to play this game. It's a cultural phenomenon and the experience that's provided isn't replicated anywhere else. All the new additions to help make the game stand out including Wear and Tear, Turbo Mode, different coverage shells and added hot routes for pre-play, and basically everything added isn't just a gimmick, it's a substantial change. While some bugs and logic need to be addressed, College Football 25 is undoubtedly the most fun football game to come out in years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/tsukihimes-turned-me-into-visual-novel-fan<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While the rest of the world was playing <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, </em>I was playing <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legendary-visual-novel-tsukihime-piece-of-blue-glass-moon-gets-first-english-trailer">Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-</a>. </em></p>
<p>Obviously, these games are on completely opposite sides of the spectrum. One is this highly involved, hard-as-nails action game. The other is a visual novel, more similar to reading a book than it is playing a video game. Yet, I haven't been this hooked on a game in years. <em>Tsukihime,</em> you convinced me: Visual novels are freakin' awesome.</p>
<p><em>Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- </em>is a rather obscure title for those unfamiliar with visual novels, but it came to my attention after diving headfirst into the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fatesamurai-remnant-review-musou-holy-grail"><em>Fate</em></a> franchise. <em>Tsukihime</em> shares the same universe, so I already had a bit of familiarity with the subject matter, though if you want to go in blind, this is a perfectly fine experience on its own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-narative.jpg?itok=5n2pq32J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-narative.jpg?itok=w7nf8wwh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nasu's known for a certain writing style, and if "edgy" is what you'd call it, hey, count me in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Visual Novels Like <em>Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- </em>Might Just Put You in a Trance</h2>
<p>This particular version of <em>Tsukihime</em> is a remake that originally released in Japan in 2021, but the West finally received an official English release in June 2024. I admit, I was very apprehensive. My previous foray into visual novels wasn't as enjoyable as I would have wanted, but like any piece of media, sometimes it takes a few tries before you find something that clicks.</p>
<p>And click, <em>Tsukihime </em>did. This visual novel is a treat to the eyes and ears, immersing the player in a narrative filled with magic, vampires, and plenty of emotional twists and turns. And that's the thing: I normally wouldn't attribute "immersive" to a very passive experience like a visual novel, but<em> Tsukihime</em> achieves just that.</p>

Though there's little motion to these images, in my mind I can see this living and breathing world <em>Tsukihime</em> so clearly conveys.</p>
<p>Sound effects and music coalesce with the narrative as you read, putting me in a dream-like trance. These aspects of <em>Tsukihime</em> might sound like any other visual novel, but as someone who has little to no experience with the medium, the psychological aspects of reading took me by surprise.</p>

<p>Of course, <em>Tsukihime</em>'s story is what keeps me coming back. You play through the eyes of Shiki Tohno, an anemic high schooler with a very powerful supernatural ability: the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. Shiki can see red lines marked on every object and living thing in the world -- these are lines of death which, when severed, mark a permanent end for whatever it was on.</p>
<p>The player learns more about Mystic Eyes of Death Perception and the effect it has on Shiki and those around him. When Shiki gained these eyes after a horrific accident during his childhood, he was warned it may attract other "strange" things. After being outcast from his insanely rich family's mansion, he is summoned to the mansion a decade later to take up the role as eldest son once more.</p>

Vampires and some of the most bombastic fights in fiction are thrown in the player's face as the combination of voice acting, detailed visuals, and well-written dialogue constantly barrage the player in its latter half.</p>
<p>To dive into more detail on the characters and scenes in <em>Tsukihime</em>, well, we'd be here all day. And look, this is not a short experience -- with three different endings, it'll probably take up to 40 hours to finish everything.</p>
<p>So I'll keep it brief and say, I did not expect to get so emotionally involved in a game, much less a visual novel. In fact, few pieces of media hit me as hard as <em>Tsukihime</em> did. A key character, Arcueid, well, her story was so potent to me, I had to emotionally detach myself from the visual novel so it didn't make me a mess. And that is when I realized, if visual novels can do this to me, what else might there be in store?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-flowchart.jpg?itok=7gL0LYRW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-flowchart.jpg?itok=SBv2h1se 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is the flowchart feature, allowing you to jump to previous scenes.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Tsukihime </em>Came Equipped With Handy Tools for Beginners</h2>
<p>Visual novels are already a bit light on gameplay features, but <em>Tsukihime</em> makes things a breeze if this is your first foray into a the genre. There's the bare minimum you'd expect (a reading log, quick save and quick loads), but also other inclusions that made this much more accessible. It was a misconception of mine to go in expecting visual novels to be clunky, but everything flows very well.</p>
<p>There's a flowchart that allows players to jump around the story with ease, collecting new scenes or, if you have a change of heart or even <em>die</em> in the story, allows for a way to fix your mistakes. Though, if you do die, it'll give you tips on how to change your fate, which is also very appreciated as a newcomer.</p>

There's a feature that can automatically skip dialogue you've seen, and you can also adjust the speed in which new dialogue is shown. You can finely tune the timing on these, so developer Type-Moon clearly tried to make this as welcoming an experience as possible.</p>
<p>It was my fault for discounting visual novels as "not for me." If you find yourself in the same shoes, you might just be surprised. Pick up a visual novel with a subject matter that appeals to you -- it doesn't have to be <em>Tsukihime </em>-- and devote yourself to it like it's a great novel. You might just be surprised by how powerful visual novels can be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/19/the-ftc-pushes-back-against-xbox-game-pass-price-increases<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, Xbox <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/10/price-increases-and-new-tiers-are-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">announced</a> it was introducing new Game Pass tiers and raising its subscription prices for existing members on September 12. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with these changes in a filing yesterday to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Microsoft revealed a new tier called <strong>Xbox Game Pass Standard</strong>, a $15 monthly subscription for new members that excludes day-one releases, EA Play, PC Game Pass, and cloud gaming. <strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong>, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20. <strong>Xbox&nbsp;Game Pass Core</strong>, which only offers online play and a smaller library, is raising its yearly sub from $60 to $75 (the $10 monthly fee remains unchanged). <strong>PC Game Pass</strong> is increasing from $10 per month to $12.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the $10.99 <strong>Game Pass for Console</strong> is no longer be available to new subscribers as of July 10. If existing subscribers fail to renew their membership, they will be permanently locked out of this tier and must subscribe to another, more expensive membership.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf">filing</a>, the FTC blasts Microsoft’s discontinuation of Game Pass for Console, stating that users must pay a substantial price increase (81%) to switch to Game Pass Ultimate. Those unwilling to do so must settle for Game Pass Standard, which the FTC describes as a “degraded product” since it excludes day-one releases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“[Game Pass Standard] costs 36% more than Console Game Pass, and withholds day-one releases. Product degradation—removing the most valuable games from Microsoft’s new service—combined with price increases for existing users, is exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged."</p>

<p>The FTC was the primary opposition against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and sees this move as proof of its concerns over the purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs[…]—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger.”</p>

<p>The FTC goes on to call the price increases "inconsistent" with the case Microsoft made during the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/07/11/microsoft-and-xbox-win-case-against-ftc-to-acquire-activision-blizzard">Xbox FTC trial last year</a>. It states, "Microsoft promised that 'the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [CoD] available on Microsoft’s Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition).' Microsoft’s post-merger actions thus vindicate the congressional design of preliminarily halting mergers to fully evaluate their likely competitive effects, and judicial skepticism of promises inconsistent with a firm’s economic incentives."</p>

<p>That last portion references&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-set-for-october" target="_blank">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s (the first new entry to release post-acquisition) October 25 launch on Game Pass Ultimate, roughly a month after the subscription tier's price increase.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-rated-by-esrb-for-pc-ps5-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The US Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> Hunt: Showdown 1986 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Here's the description of the game (which received a Mature 17+ rating):</p>
<p><em>This is a first-person monster hunting game set in a fantastical version of the Victorian era. Players use bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols to kill zombie-like creatures and human rivals. Combat is highlighted by impact sounds, gunfire, and blood-splatter effects. Some weapons allow players to cave in zombies' heads or to cut off their limbs. One type of zombie explodes into blood and viscera when killed; another type is depicted wearing human skin as a cape.</em></p>
<p>Notably, this is a separate listing from Hunt: Showdown. Before you dream of a sequel, though, Crytek General Manager David Fifield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crytek-will-never-replace-hunt-showdown-with-hunt-2-the-way-overwatch-2-did-overwatch-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Rock, Paper, Shotgun in late 2023 that such a thing was not at all in the plans:</p>
<p><em>I would say we would even be less aggressive than Overwatch or, you know, Destiny 2. No, we have no plans for Hunt 2. We just plan to keep going forward. </em><em>You could say that chapter two of Fortnite was Fortnite 2 - they made a new island, they radically overhauled a whole, giant part of all its systems, but they just called it chapter two of a game called Fortnite. So that seems to be more the trend that we'll follow, when updating Hunt: Showdown.</em></p>
<p><em>If we talked about other products in the Hunt franchise, they wouldn't be replacements to Hunt: Showdown, they'd be brand extensions. Here's another game you could make in the Hunt universe, but that game wouldn't be meant to replace Hunt: Showdown, the thing people play.</em></p>
<p>So, maybe Hunt: Showdown 1896 is going to be a brand extension, as suggested a while ago by Fifield. Or, more likely, this is simply the rebrand of the game itself. The developers have hinted at such a thing, and we already know that next month, they will <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-ps5-xbox-series-x-update-release-date-support-xbox-one-ps4-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add</a> proper PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X support while dropping old-generation consoles, which are indeed absent in the ESRB listing.</p>
<p>Either way, big changes are on the way for the game.</p>

<p>The EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) marketing director at Xbox says that the company “isn’t blessed” with a large budget in the region, leading to PlayStation outspending them on marketing in the region.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/xboxs-marketing-boss-fight-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketing Week</a>, Michael Flatt said that Xbox needs to “work really hard” against the competition. That work includes being “quite scrappy”.</p>



<p>“They’re [PlayStation] blessed with marketing funds that we’re just not able to enjoy,” Flatt said. “But that’s totally fine. We adopt what I would call a more fiscally responsible approach to media investments.”</p>

<p>He continued: “We’re not blessed with huge media budgets, so we have to be quite scrappy really, and quite tenacious to fight for funds that would probably go somewhere else.”</p>



<p>This interview comes after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-stop-pushing-xbox-consoles-in-europe-other-regions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims of Microsoft looking to stop</a> pushing console sales in the EMEA region. Instead, Xbox will reportedly put more of a focus on Game Pass, Cloud Gaming, PC, and Xbox controllers.</p>
