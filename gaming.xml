                <p>The MCU's version of the Fantastic Four is finally making its debut on July 25, and it will come as absolutely no surprise whatsoever that it looks like Marvel's First Family <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1945175707698499656" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will receive Fortnite skins</a> to mark the occasion. But it also appears they're bringing with them something a little more unusual skins for this sort of collaboration: a set of four pairs of Nike kicks, with each pair themed after a member of the Fantastic Four.</p><p>The shoes were added to the files with Tuesday's patch and decrypted when the shop updated on Tuesday evening. The set includes a pair of <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19012" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Harbor Blue Air Max 90s</a> for Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19009" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clear Air Force 1s with a blue swoosh</a> to represent Sue Storm/the Invisible Woman, <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19011" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">red and orange Air Max 95s</a> for Johnny Storm/the Human Torch, and <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19010" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">orange Dunks</a> for Ben Grimm/The Thing. The set <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1945272679033929884" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will apparently have a bundle</a>, which would make this the first Kicks bundle to come with more than three pairs. We don't know when these shoes will land in the item shop, but it will likely be during the week before Fantastic Four: First Steps hits theaters on July 25.</p><p>What's particularly interesting about these shoes is that, like all Nike kicks in Fortnite, all four of these pairs are real shoes that were available to purchase. These Fantastic Four Nikes were originally released in 2006 as a tie-in with Fox's Fantastic Four movies, which hit theaters in 2005 and 2007, and you can read more about them over at <a href="https://sneakernews.com/2012/07/10/classics-revisited-nike-fantastic-four-pack-2006/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sneaker News</a>.</p><p>The best part of this set is that the clear Air Force 1s are a major new novelty for Fortnite kicks, as you can see the color of the sock that a skin is wearing with the shoes. That marks the third pair of novelty Air Force 1s, after the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=18299" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">solid white</a> and <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=18301" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">solid black</a> pairs released in May that give off unique trails as you run.</p><p>This isn't the first time Fortnite has imported some tie-in kicks to the item shop. During Star Wars season in May, the shop offered three pairs of Crocs and three pairs of Nikes that were themed after Star Wars characters.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Sega has shared new details about Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds on Switch 2, confirming the game will arrive digitally this holiday season on the console with an upgrade path for original Switch owners. Then, next year, the game will get a physical release for Nintendo's new system with "the full base game on a 64GB cartridge."</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will launch September 25 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox, and Switch--with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworld-preorders-are-live-on-console-and-pc/1100-6532225/">preorders already available</a>. This is the first release window <a href="https://www.sega.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-faq" rel="nofollow ">Sega has provided</a> for the Switch 2 version, adding that Switch players who pay the $10 upgrade fee for Switch 2 will carry over their progression. That also means the Switch 2 edition of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will cost $70 (the same as PS5 and Xbox Series X) instead of Switch's price point of $60. Last but not least, cross-platform matchmaking is a go on Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unknown-worlds-lawsuit-claims-krafton-intentionally-delayed-subnautica-2-to-avoid-250m-payout.1245591/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill filed a lawsuit last week alleging that publisher Krafton intentionally obstructed and delayed the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em> in what they describe in the complaint, which was unsealed to the public and reviewed by Aftermath on Wednesday, as the company's "desperate efforts to avoid paying the earnout, and its flagrant contractual breaches in pursuit of that goal."</p><p>Unknown Worlds is responsible for <em>Subnautica</em>, the 2018 underwater survival game that, by all measures, was a hit. Krafton, the major South Korean publisher known for <em>PUBG Battlegrounds</em>, acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021 for $250 million, plus a bonus of $250 million that would be paid out by meeting certain milestones. Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill were fired in July before Krafton delayed the game into 2026, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thereby putting the bonus payout in jeopardy</a>. Bloomberg reported last week that Unknown Worlds leadership intended to share the money with the studio's roughly 100 employees, which would have earned staff "hundreds of thousands of dollars to seven figures" each, per Bloomberg's report. Krafton, <a href="https://krafton.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement published on its website</a>, said the fired executives "abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them."</p><p>Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill disputed that, and announced they were filing a lawsuit, the details of which are now public. In it, the executives lay out the timeline that claims Krafton was worried about <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s projected success and how much money the company would have to pay out. "As momentum for <em>Subnautica 2</em> was building, the reality of what this would mean for the earnout hit Krafton. When that happened, everything changed," lawyers wrote in the complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>Several Unknown Worlds' "publishing colleagues" from Krafton's El Segundo office met with Krafton in South Korea to "finalize the marketing and advertising strategy" in April, and when they returned to the United States, told Gill that "Krafton leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game," per the complaint.</p><p>"The El Segundo colleagues informed Gill that Krafton’s legal team was combing through the agreements looking for any opening to terminate the Founders if they proceeded with the planned [redacted] release," lawyers wrote. "The El Segundo colleagues told Gill it was clear that Krafton was aiming to avoid paying the earnout."</p><p>Lawyers write that Krafton “engaged in a months-long campaign to delay <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s release,” including that the company “pulled key marketing materials, refused to follow through with crucial partnerships, and reneged on long-standing commitments to handle important prelaunch tasks.” The 58-page lawsuit, filed in early July in the Delaware Chancery Court, goes into detail on what the fired executives call an “obstructist agenda” — Krafton allegedly stopped paying vendors, which impacted Krafton’s marketing support, like trailers and a PC Gamer magazine cover; pulled localization help, back-end services like “analytics and server infrastructure,” legal support for contract review, and policy review for the game’s terms of use. The executives claim, via one Krafton employee in the El Segundo, California, office, that Krafton employees were instructed to stop “<em>all</em> creative tasks related to <em>Subnautica 2</em>” and to stop communicating with Unknown Worlds.</p><p>In May, the executives allege, Krafton “advanced the new company line” that “<em>Subnautica 2</em> was not ready.” That included a milestone review, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has since leaked online</a>, in which Krafton described the game as lacking polish and “market impact.” It showed biomes being removed, fewer creatures, and cut content — signifying “the need to reassess the timeline and roadmap,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the leaked documents that Krafton has since confirmed as real</a>. The executives, in the lawsuit, characterize this review as Krafton’s “obstructionist tactics,” saying that the people who did the review were not experts in survival games nor releasing early access games. The executives pushed back the feedback, according to the lawsuit, and showed that playtest data from community members “unequivocally confirmed that the game was ready to go.” (Earlier in the lawsuit, lawyers call out Krafton’s previous early access game, <em>inZOI</em>, as launching with “less content and being less developed than <em>Subnautica 2</em>; allegedly, Krafton executives expected <em>Subnautica 2</em> would “easily double” <em>inZOI</em>’s 1.1 million sold copies “with proper publishing support.”)</p><p>Krafton began sending letters — “an intimidation campaign,” per the complaint — to the founders on June 10, “falsely accus[ing] the Founders of failing to fulfill their contractual responsibilities and violating their fiduciary duties.” On June 18, according to the document, a Krafton executive met with Gill to “attempt to get the Founders to accept a lower earnout.” The executives claim the offer “did not allow them to share the earnout with the full team, so the Founders declined.” Negotiation continued through late June before Krafton fired the three executives and removed them from the Unknown Worlds board of directors. Steve Papoutsis was named CEO of Unknown Worlds and Krafton announced the game would be delayed until 2026.</p><p>“Krafton flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds,” lawyers wrote. “It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without Cause. Promise broken.”</p><p>The lawsuit also details continues in detailing what it describes as Krafton’s attempt in “harming Unknown Worlds’ relationship with its fan community” by posting on the game and studio websites “a statement apologizing for Subnautica taking ‘far longer than any of us ever intended’ and making allegations about Cleveland and McGuire’s alleged roles.” It also includes the community response to the public dispute, including headlines, YouTube screenshots, social media posts, and Reddit threads commenting on — and worrying about — the executive firings and subsequent delay.</p><p>The executives say Krafton breached their purchase agreement contract and want the court to order the company to pay up the earnout fee, reinstate the founders’ jobs and board of directors seats, and pay other damages. The purchase agreement signed by both the fired executives and Krafton allegedly made it so the founders would “maintain operational control of the Group companies in all material respects, including (for both existing and new products) product roadmap, launch, planning, partnering, budgeting and employee matters,’ so long as at least one of the three of them was still employed.”Krafton declined to comment. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported</a> that Krafton intends to “extend the schedule for a potential bonus payout” for Unknown Worlds. Forty or so Unknown Worlds employees will be “eligible to share a $25 million bonus” if revenue goals are met by the end of 2025, “with a possible short-term expansion,” per the report. Bloomberg sources said the schedule for that $25 million bonus has been extended a year, and that Krafton will “advance a portion of the studio’s projected 2026 profit-sharing bonus pool,” something separate from the $25 million bonus, to all employees in 2025.</p><p>You can read the lawsuit below:</p><p><em>This story has been updated.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/unknown-worlds-lawsuit-subnautica-2]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</h5><p><span>July 11, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Nostalgia is only going to get you so far, when revisiting something from your youth. Sometimes it'll get you too far, and as a critic, it's important to be aware of those instances, so you're not ignoring the faults in a game or product to the detriment of your work. Thankfully, that's not something I had to worry about at all with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 when I sat down to begin playing it for my review.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I have practically no nostalgic love for the series. I was the right age to play them growing up, I had the right console with a PlayStation 2 that still works to this day, and yet the four titans of video game history that are the four Pro Skater games, missed me as I was growing up in my gamer youth. </p>



<p>My skateboarding video game journey didn't begin until EA's Skate games. A fact that I'm slightly regretting ahead of what's sure to be a microtransaction-filled Skate 4 that might play the way I prefer, but I'm dreading will be ruined inch by inch with each monetization update that threatens to take all the fun out of just skating around and doing some sick tricks.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>That's why I've had so much fun playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4. It's not a perfect remaster, but for the most part, it accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is to be a fun return to two classic skateboarding games. Some of the new maps don't stand out as much as old classics, and I do wish that the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 half of the game was more of a faithful remaster to the original game, instead of the entire setup being changed, but it cannot be denied that these games are pure skateboarding fun. </p>



<p>All of my early interactions with the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series came from playing them at friends' houses, so this is the first time I've gotten the chance to sit with games in this series for hours. I have fond memories of playing Tony Hawk games at friends' houses, and that's where the nostalgia kicks in the most for me. Ironically, a game published by Activision is making me nostalgic for a time when you weren't chasing anything in a game beyond high scores and wacky characters, and you could unlock the full breadth of available options just through playing the game for hours. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, that's where the reality of the video game industry in 2025 kicked in for me, as I saw the two deluxe edition-exclusive characters, DOOM Guy and Revenant, on the roster of skaters. At least Bam Magera is included and unlockable through in-game progress, but I also would have personally liked to see more special characters not within the Tony Hawk universe beyond DOOM Guy, Revenant, and Michelangelo.</p>



<p>That aside, this remaster, and the time I've been spending just getting on my board and running through Foundry, the Zoo, Alcatraz, or the Airport, has honestly made me feel like I was escaping the real world in a way that few other games are able to achieve. Part of this can be chalked up to the nostalgia of it all. Another part, I recognize, comes from my real-world experience of heading out on my longboard to get out of my own head when I've needed to take some time and not think about life for a while. Riding has always been a special kind of flow state for me that I've always felt to be distinct to what I experience when I get deep into a game. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 was the closest I can remember a video game has come to getting me into that specific flow state. The gameplay gets me there, every time, and I just wish the soundtrack played a meaningful role. Your mileage may vary on the soundtrack, but the more than 50 songs featured in this remaster fail to do anything for me more often than not. I don't dislike all of the songs, but I've found that I'd rather listen to my own music library when playing, which is a tad disappointing, considering how the soundtracks to these games have been recognized as a key part of the experience. </p>



<p>Only 10 of the songs on the soundtrack are from the original game, while the rest of the 50+ titles are new. As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/less-than-20-of-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4s-soundtrack-is-made-up-of-songs-from-the-original-games/">VGC</a>, Tony Hawk himself claimed to have made a few decisions on the soundtrack and opted to change things up this time around, featuring newer or different songs from artists featured in the original games. Maybe if Tony Hawk could put some boygenius on the soundtrack, we'd have some more common musical ground.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Out of the new parks, Pinball is the standout, though most of the parks feel very new to me, since, as I've said before, this has been my first time really sitting with these parks and spending a lot of time with them. The only problem with that is that the new parks, save Pinball, negatively stand out compared to the original levels that made these games so famous in the first place. It's not that they're bad; they're just not close to the same quality as the original parks. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, my time playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 has been a much-needed break from the world. Setting my mind's clock back to a time before generative AI tools threatened everyone's jobs, before I had to worry about next month's rent, and before I spent every day watching some new atrocity pop up on my timeline. It's excellent, flowing gameplay that feeds into the kind of platforming challenges I can't get enough of is enough to have anyone daydreaming about the days of their youth.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a successful remaster for anyone wanting to shut out the world and grind away your problems for a while, and remember simpler times. The classic Tony Hawk gameplay only seems to have gotten better with age, and the custom parks are sure to keep you skating for hours after you've washed the career mode. Even though it's not a faithful remaster of THPS 4, and your mileage may vary on the soundtrack, any fan of the series would do themselves a disservice to skip out on grabbing this remaster bundle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/valve-we-want-to-allow-everything-on-steam-including-something-that-you-hate/">famously permissive</a> rules for what games are and are not allowed on Steam got a little less permissive this week, seemingly in response to outside pressure from some of its partner companies. In <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/commit/fddd59b5395cc3c1c74574650dbf5784612d0521">a Tuesday update</a> to the "Rules and Guidelines" section of <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding">Steam's Onboarding Documentation</a>, the company added a new rule prohibiting "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or Internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content."</p>
<p>On its own, the new rule seems rather vague, with no details on which of the many kinds of "adult only content" would belong in the "certain" subset prohibited by these unnamed payment processors and ISPs. But the trackers over at SteamDB <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27">noticed</a> that the publication of the new rule coincides with <a href="https://steamdb.info/history/events/?before=64657809">the removal of dozens of Steam games</a> whose titles make reference to incest, along with a handful of sex games referencing "slave" or "prison" imagery.</p>
<h2>Holding the keys to the bank</h2>
<p>Valve isn't alone in having de facto restrictions on content imposed on it by outside payment processors. In 2022, for instance, Visa <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/visa-pauses-pornhub-ad-payments-ahead-of-child-sexual-abuse-trial/">suspended all payments to Pornhub's ad network</a> after the adult video site was accused of profiting from child sexual abuse materials. And PayPal has routinely disallowed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/paypal-sets-down-stricter-regulations-for-file-sharing-sites/">payments to file-sharing sites</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/paypal-blocks-vpn-smartdns-providers-payments-over-copyright-violations/">VPN providers</a> over concerns surrounding piracy of copyrighted materials.</p>

But the team has gotten pretty good at detecting cheaters and banning their accounts. </p><p>One interesting stat that Chess.com’s Fair Play team shared in the blog post is that nearly 40 percent of closed accounts are less than two weeks old. This means the team’s methods of finding and punishing naughty players and bots are doing a solid job of catching cheaters early. But Chess.com thinks it can do an even better job at keeping cheaters out. </p><p>“One of the ways we’re tackling this phenomenon is by screening players more frequently early in their journey on the platform,” said Chess.com’s Fair Play team. “This means we’re generating reports for players that essentially serve as checkpoints as they play more games. It is entirely reasonable (and expected) that it may take time for someone to establish their rating, so these checkpoints go beyond games played and rating earned, but also include strength of play and over 100 other gameplay factors.”</p><p>The team also shared that it uses algorithms to look out for extraordinary examples of cheating or inhuman behavior. With only 30 people watching and 20 million games a day, it makes sense that the team would need extra help.

        <p>"Corporate cowardice in action".</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Valve has introduced new - and worryingly vague - guidelines aimed at the adult-only game development community, forbidding content that may "violate the rules and standards" set by credit card companies, internet network providers, and more.
</p>
<p>
It's not precisely clear when Valve introduced this <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding">latest rule</a> stipulating what developers "shouldn't publish on Steam", but it appears to have been added sometime in the last couple of months. So what's now banned from the platform? According to Valve, "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by [its] payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers."
</p>
<p>
There's some small nod toward additional clarity, but it's not much. Valve suggests developers should "in particular, [avoid publishing] certain kinds of adult only content", but provides no specifics beyond that. Banks have long been skittish about providing services to businesses where sex and adult entertainment may be a factor, but - as this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/16/sex-discrimination-why-banks-shun-workers-in-adult-entertainment">2021 article from The Guardian points out</a> - their inconsistency has proven a challenge for business owners. Which might be where Valve's own decision to err on the side of vagueness was born.
</p>
<p>
Valve, of course, has made headlines recently after a number of controversial sex games appeared on its store, so it's easy enough to imagine banks and similar financial services getting uncomfortable when a platform hits the news for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">publishing content featuring extreme sexual violence</a>. And it seems Valve may have become skittish in return. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27">noted by SteamDB</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/">PC Gamer</a>), it appears the company - which previously said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-backs-away-from-content-policing-says-it-will-allow-everything-on-steam">would "allow everything" on Steam</a> unless illegal or "straight up trolling" - has been frantically pulling incest-themed games from its store in recent times.
</p>
<p>
The vagueness of Valve's wording means confusion and concern among adult content developers is likely to intensify as they grapple with the reality that financial institutions may now be the ultimate arbiters of ever-changing acceptability on Steam. And some have expressed concern this new authority may start impacting the availability of LGBTQIA+ content as corporations buckle to appease the US government's continuing attack on queer rights.
</p>
<p>
"It's the quiet normalisation of financial censorship and it's going to hurt LGBTQ+ games and devs," YouTuber NoahFuel Gaming <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/noahfuelgaming.bsky.social/post/3lu2ngnm3hc26">wrote on social media</a>. "Banks like Visa and Mastercard are now backdoor moral authorities... They already pressured Patreon, OnlyFans, and others to remove NSFW content. Now Steam is next. And guess who they'll target first? Queer, transgressive, or "unusual" games... Queer content gets flagged as 'explicit' even when it's PG... If banks raise a fuss, they'll nuke anything that could be controversial. And they'll say, 'It's out of our hands.' Corporate cowardice in action."
</p>
<p>
Valve hasn't yet publicly addressed its new policy but we've reached out for more information.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo just announced the two leads of its live-action <em>Legend of Zelda</em> film, and unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690607/chris-pratt-mario-nintendo-illumination-animated-movie-december-2022-release-date-cast">celebrity-packed <em>Mario</em> movie cast</a>, <em>Zelda</em> will star <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708143/nintendo-zelda-movie-casting-bo-bragason-benjamin-evan-ainsworth">two young, lesser-known actors</a>: Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. You may not have heard of them, but there’s a good chance they’re going to be a part of the franchise for a while.</p><p>Choosing stars who are in their teens (Ainsworth) and early 20s (Bragason) makes a lot of sense. In the games, even the “older” Links and Zeldas are still typically young adults, so Bragason and Ainsworth seem like they’ll fit the mold. (Yes, I know Link and Zelda are technically older than 100 in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom,</em> but they look good for their age.) The choice of younger actors gives them both room to grow into the roles in any potential sequels — which, given Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">growing ambitions beyond video games</a>, the company must already be starting to consider.</p><p>We can look at Nintendo’s recent expansion of Mario beyond games as an example of what might be in store for <em>Zelda</em>. <em>The Super Mario Bros. </em>movie, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">surprisingly good</a>, quickly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">surpassed $1 billion at the box office</a>, and a sequel is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/10/24096213/super-mario-bros-movie-2-sequel-2026">set to debut in 2026</a>. A <em>Donkey Kong</em> spinoff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/706610/donkey-kong-movie-copyright-notice-nintendo-strategy">might also be in the works</a>. Both franchises are featured in Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">theme</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293604/super-nintendo-world-theme-park-donkey-kong-country-osaka-date">parks</a>, too. It’s not hard to imagine Nintendo applying the same blueprint for the Zelda franchise.</p><p>The <em>Zelda</em> movie has the potential to be a similarly huge hit. The franchise is arguably as popular as it has ever been; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> was the fourth-best-selling game on the original Switch, after all, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> was an excellent followup. If this first <em>Zelda</em> film is even halfway decent, Bragason and Ainsworth might be representative of Zelda and Link for an entire generation of fans.</p><p>The two aren’t complete unknowns – Ainsworth voiced Pinocchio in Disney’s 2022 version of the film and played a major role in Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"><em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em></a> – but Nintendo is still taking a gamble by hinging a potentially risky adaptation on them. They’ll likely be in good hands with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951339/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action-nintendo">Wes Ball as director</a>, though, who is known for his work directing the <em>Maze Runner</em> trilogy and <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>.</p><p>Nintendo is borrowing from a proven strategy here. Warner Bros. recently introduced its <em>second</em> trio of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/674752/hbo-harry-potter-cast-dominic-mclaughlin-arabella-stanton-alastair-stout">young leads for <em>Harry Potter</em></a>, and they’ll be the faces of a new decade-long series for HBO, much like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint were before them for the <em>Harry Potter</em> films. Netflix has similarly stuck with the <em>Stranger Things</em> kids <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707540/stranger-things-5-teaser-trailer-netflix">all the way through the end</a>, even though the first season debuted nearly 10 years ago.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda</em> film could be Nintendo’s next breakout cultural moment when it debuts <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682751/legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-date-delay">in May 2027</a>. If it is, we’ll probably be seeing a lot more adventures starring Zelda and Link.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708494/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-leads-stars-long-time]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">GameFly is running an <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xJP1?object_uuid=848aaa0c-ba68-4e83-981e-ef794d5afd9c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">impressive sale</a> right now on PS5 and Xbox Series X games, plus Blu-ray movies. It’s definitely worth checking out if you’re looking to save money on recent AAA games. You can get PS5 deals like Elden Ring Nightreign for $27.99 and Doom: The Dark Ages for $39.99. You’re not likely to find those kinds of discounts anywhere else for quite a while on new copies of those games, especially after Prime Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The caveat is that all of the games are pre-played (more info on that below). You can shop the <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xJP1?object_uuid=848aaa0c-ba68-4e83-981e-ef794d5afd9c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">whole sale here</a>, or read on for our picks.</p><p id="shop-the-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Shop the sale">Save Up to 50% Off Pre-Played Games at GameFly </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun twist on the From Software formula perfected in the original Elden Ring. It turns the game into a three-player co-op roguelite. It might not be for everyone (see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">review</a> for details), but $27.99 makes it much more palatable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages may be available for Xbox players on Game Pass, but that doesn’t apply to PS5 owners. So this is a great way to play through it at significantly less than the new game MSRP. Check out our 9/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a> for more info on that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on sale are Civ 7, Monster Hunter Wilds, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and many more. You can even save cash on Blu-rays like Mickey 17 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Lots of savings to go around.</p><p id="should-you-buy-from-gamefly"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Should you buy from GameFly?">Is GameFly a Good Place to Buy Used Games?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything you buy from GameFly is “pre-played,” meaning it’s been sent out to GameFly customers. That said, everything GameFly sells in these sales is in good condition. It also comes with brand-new new cases and inserts where applicable. I’ve bought games in previous GameFly sales, and I never would’ve guessed they were used, aside from arriving without shrink wrap. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these games are also “100% guaranteed,” so if you have any problem with them, you can get a full refund. Buying pre-played games is a good way to pick up recent games at way cheaper than new pricing. And this sale knocks even more money off the pre-played discount, which is essentially stacking a deal on a deal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Switch 2 upgrades the now-classic hybrid console with a larger 7.9-inch HDR touchscreen, 4K dock output, and GameChat voice and video chat.

It includes nine booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Team Rocket’s Wobbuffet, and plenty of extras like card sleeves, dice, and a collector’s box. I've got more deals comming your way too. Including the INIU 10,000mAh 45W Power Bank for $12, a 5-pack of six-foot USB-C charging cables for $6.99, the Superman 2025 Steelbook 4K Blu-ray, and TCL’s 55-inch QM6K Mini LED Smart TV for $449.99, $350 off its usual price.

This also mean said chase cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">worth significantly less</a>, but Japanese cards are far easier to get perfect grades in given they're always busting out of booster packs in perfect condition. Want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Pokémon card collection</a> on a budget?

Whilst that unfortunately means it's still way above MSRP, some of these sets are at the best prices they've been in the last month.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been shifting noticeably ahead of the final sets Black Bolt and White Flare, with Psychic-type Illustration Rares like Ralts 211/198 and Kirlia 212/198 each climbing 28 percent this month while Gardevoir ex 245/198 now sits at $54.99 after a 25 percent jump. Miraidon ex and Koraidon ex are both trending upward as well, holding value around $23.99 each. At the same time several cards are sliding down as Fidough 213/198 dropped 15 percent, Armarouge 203/198 is down 11 percent, and Pachirisu 208/198 fell 19 percent. The steepest dips hit Dondozo 207/198 and Starly 221/198, now around $9.99 each after dropping 30 percent and 37 percent respectively, reflecting a market that is narrowing in on long-term playability and collector interest.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As newer Pokémon TCG sets grab the spotlight, Paradox Rift is seeing its high-rarity SIR ex cards drop in value while several Illustration Rares quietly climb due to shifting collector interest and low inventory. Cards like Altaria ex, Gholdengo ex, and Steelix have dropped between 16% and 25%, while Illustration Rares including Morpeko, Plusle, Minun, Groudon, and Iron Valiant ex are climbing fast, with Morpeko leading at a 43% increase. This mirrors earlier trends where less flashy cards gain traction as availability tightens.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Edge of Eternities Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering’s next set, Edge of Eternities, officially launches August 1 with preorders now live on Amazon for bundles including Play Booster Boxes, Commander Decks, and Collector Booster Boxes. Blending Magic’s iconic gameplay with science fantasy themes such as flying space whales and alien races, Edge of Eternities introduces four new mechanics: Void, Warp, Station, and Lander Tokens. Fan-favorite tribes like Eldrazi and Slivers return alongside reprints of coveted Shock Lands. Wizards of the Coast is gradually revealing more details, with a full card gallery arriving July 18 and prerelease events happening July 25 through 31, so now is the time to lock in your preorder if you want first access.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Pricing Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a mixed back for Magic: The Gathering prices this week, so it's always worth double checking eBay before TCG Player and Amazon for a last minute bargain. Also, whoever thinks a Theros Beyond Death booster is worth north of $700 needs to have a word with themselves.</p><p id="nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-worl"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart Worl">Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225375"><div id="225375" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Invites available now on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still struggling to get your hands on Nintendo Switch 2?

Mio and Zoe’s story adds some extra depth too since they do not get along at first but that dynamic makes the whole adventure feel more personal as things ramp up.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds">Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225247"><div id="225247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switc">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225248"><div id="225248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</a> caught my attention for how it brings that classic RPG feel into a modern format. At $34.99, it’s a pretty big discount compared to the usual price, which makes it an easy pick if you’ve been waiting to try it. The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar. Battles stick to the traditional turn-based system but with small updates like adjustable speed and auto-battle, so it doesn’t feel stuck in the past. The soundtrack ties it all together with that same timeless vibe DRAGON QUEST fans already know.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-t"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (T">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225249"><div id="225249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition feels like more than just a regular hardcover.

That's because Update 2.3 is on the way, arriving tomorrow, and features new quests, vehicles, Photo Mode additions, PC tech improvements, VRR on consoles, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Update 2.3 is the last big update, says CD Projekt Red (we believe them this time, considering Cyberpunk 2 has moved into pre-production as of May), and hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC tomorrow. Switch 2 players running through Night City via Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will have to wait for a "later date" to receive the Update 2.3 additions, however.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McF9Ak1r7L8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McF9Ak1r7L8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"This patch introduces 4 new vehicles, the AutoDrive feature, self-driving Delamain cabs, and more," the <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">patch notes</a> read.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a $1.25 billion bailout from Tencent</a>, resulting in the creation of a new subsidiary – partially owned by Tencent – that will take charge of Ubisoft’s three biggest series: <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. While details of how the operation will function remain sparse, we now know who’ll head it up: co-CEOs Christophe Derennes, former head of Ubisoft Montreal and managing director for North America who’s been with the company for over three decades, and Charlie Guillemot, whose main distinguishing feature is that he’s Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot’s son.&nbsp;</p><p>Is Guillemot the very definition of a nepo baby? I mean, yeah, sure, probably. Don’t worry about it, though!</p><p>"I’d like to address this question directly, if I may," Guillemot said in response to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a question from Variety about nepotism</a>. "I completely understand where it comes from, and I want to be clear about it. Yes, I’m Yves’ son. That’s not something I hide from. But my appointment isn’t only about family ties; it’s about what Ubisoft needs at this moment. ... What matters now isn’t my name, it’s the work ahead."</p><p>Guillemot also reassured Variety that he’s spent the past decade "building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft,” which is true. For example, he ran the Ubisoft studio behind <em>Tom Clancy’s Elite Squad</em>, which found itself in the crosshairs of controversy in 2020 after launching with an intro that was widely panned for <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-apologizes-for-tom-clancy-game-imagery-that-sug-1844892904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing on right-wing conspiracies about Black Lives Matter</a>. He then struck out on his own to launch a Web3 studio called Unagi, which has predictably pivoted into AI but is also still clinging desperately to NFTs, before beaming back onto the Ubisoft fathership.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has faced a great deal of criticism for its continued status as a pop ‘n’ pop (‘n’ pop ‘n’ pop) shop. The company was founded by five Guillemot brothers – Yves, Christian, Claude, Gérard, and Michel – in 1986, with four remaining in positions of power at the company to this day. However, recent times have not been kind to the Guillemot family’s reputation; allegations of widespread sexual abuse, harassment, and discrimination <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-and-insomniac-face-dozens-of-allegations-over-mistreatment-of-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit the company in 2020</a>, leading to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-france" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the conviction of three former Ubisoft executives</a> following a 2025 trial.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft’s business has also swirled a precarious drain in recent years, with sales of expected hits, like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, coming in “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/star-wars-outlaws-coming-to-steam-in-november-sales-have-been-softer-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">softer than expected</a>” while longer-tail online games like <em>Skull And Bones</em> and <em>XDefiant</em> have floundered and failed. Despite this, the Guillemot family reportedly <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-buyout-talks-are-reportedly-progressing-but-theres-one-small-hitch-the-guillemot-family-wants-to-stay-in-charge-but-tencent-isnt-so-sure-about-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fought to remain in charge</a> during pre-deal talks with Tencent, and now, here we are.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, best of luck to Charlie in his new role. After all, everyone deserves a little nepotism, as a treat.</p><p>“Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment,” he told Variety. “What’s expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in place for everyone to do their best work.”</p><p>Sure! Cool!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft have recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">set up a new subsidiary</a> within their company which will focus on three&nbsp;core games, Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.&nbsp; The set-up also involves $1.25 billion in investment from the French game publisher from Tencent.</p>
<p>Heading up this new take are two fresh-faced individuals ready to bring a new dynamic to Ubi.. oh wait. Scratch that, it’s being headed up by Christophe Derennes who launched the Montreal studio, and has been with the company 35 years, and Charlie <em>“Do you know who my Dad is”</em> Guillemot. Charlie is most famous for running Owlient, which made free to play game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howrse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howrse</a> in the late 2010s, and Unagi, which has made four web3 games that <a href="https://www.unagi.games/#token" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use NFTS</a>.&nbsp; Sounds just the chap to look after Rainbow Six, maybe they will add horseback combat with some gorgeous NFT horse armour.</p>


<p>We know that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/10/assassins-creed-codename-red-is-going-to-japan-codename-hexe-infinity-also-confirmed/">Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe</a> is on the way along with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/10/assassins-creed-codename-red-is-going-to-japan-codename-hexe-infinity-also-confirmed/">Animus hub</a> which will tie together all the games, but we’ve not heard anything about a new Rainbow Six or Far Cry.</p>
<p>“Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,” Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote for the announcement. “As we accelerate the company’s transformation, this is a foundational step in changing Ubisoft’s operating model that will enable us to be both agile and ambitious. We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies.”</p>

<p>Rumours of a hostile takeover of Ubisoft appear quite regularly, but so far, the Guillemot family has remained in charge.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-release-date-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-claiming-fc-26-fixes-key-problems-players-have-with-the-series.1245477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that its annual football simulation game series, EA Sports FC, will return on September 26, 2025, with EA Sports FC 26. Alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the cover athlete for the Ultimate Edition of the game, Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala have been revealed as the main cover athletes. EA also showed players their first look at gameplay for this year's entry into the long-running series, with a trailer that claims EA Sports FC 26 includes fixes for several key issues players have with the games. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-reveal-this-week-zlatan-cover-athlete/">EA announced that it would reveal EA Sports FC 26</a>, teasing the return of Ibrahimovic as one of the cover athletes. The process these games usually follow, is that the first trailer features very little, if any gameplay, and is instead a vehicle for introducing the tone of the year's entry, cover athletes, and the release date. We got all of that in today's trailer, and on top of it, we got a good look at some gameplay, and the improvements that EA is touting. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Throughout the trailer, text bubbles appear posing as comments from players criticizing different elements of gameplay, such as the complaint that EA is too slow to show actual gameplay. EA attempts to change the narrative at the top of the trailer, switching from a cutscene to gameplay, and into a sequence where EA shows changes and fixes it has made in EA Sports FC 26 that solve the problems players have with the games.</p>



<p>The message of this year's entry is "<em>Innovation powered by you in every mode</em>," and that the overhauled gameplay experience has been built directly on player feedback. Whether that's actually how it'll feel when players get to test it for themselves remains to be seen.</p>



<p>"<em>FC 26 reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,</em>" said John Shepherd, vice president and general manager of EA Sports FC in a press release. "<em>We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new tournaments and live events in FUT, all-new archetype customization in clubs, and a career mode that comes alive through evolving challenges. We can't wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of FC</em>."</p>

At the center of the complaint are allegations that Krafton tried to sabotage the Early Access release for one of Steam’s most wishlisted games in order to avoid having to pay a $250 million bonus. “In the name of its bottom line, Krafton has thrown its promises out the window and ripped the game from the hands of both its creators and its community,” the lawsuit claims.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,197541,196013" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Those and other allegations are contained <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.co/1R3zgapCsJ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.co/1R3zgapCsJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new 58-page lawsuit</a></span>, a public version of which was filed in Delaware Chancery Court on July 16 on behalf of ousted Unknown Worlds cofounders Charles Cleveland, Adam “Max” McGuire, and Edward “Ted” Gill (the group’s legal team provided <em>Kotaku</em> with a copy). It details an alleged ramping-up of efforts by Krafton to delay<em> Subanutica 2</em>'s planned 2025 release in order to avoid triggering provisions from the October 2021 sale of the studio that would lead to a $250 million bonus payout if certain sales goals were met through early 2026. </p><p>According to the lawsuit, the terms of that agreement prohibited Krafton from firing any of the founders without cause or interfering in the studio’s business in any way that might impact that payout. Unknown Worlds would “maintain operational control of the Group companies in all material respects, including (for both existing and new products) product roadmap, launch, planning, partnering, budgeting and employee matters” as long as at least one of the cofounders remained employed there. </p><p>The founders claim the business relationship didn’t begin going south until earlier this year when projections for <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s sales were shared with Krafton management, one of which showed them hitting the targets required for the $250 million payout. “During the first week of April 2025, Unknown Worlds’ publishing colleagues in Krafton’s El Segundo, California office traveled to Korea to finalize the marketing and advertising strategy for <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s launch,” the lawsuit reads. “Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.”</p><p> Things came to a head in a May 2025 milestone review, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101">portions of which leaked online last week</a></span>, in which Krafton argued the game needed more content and development time against the recommendation of the founders. From there, the founders alleged that Krafton began trying to sabotage the launch by locking down all publishing resources, failing to respond to emails with third-party partners, and claiming control over the final release date decision. </p><p>“One of Krafton’s El Segundo publishing employees reported to Gill that Krafton Headquarters told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related to <em>Subnautica 2</em>,” the lawsuit reads. “The employee’s supervisor even demanded that he and his team cease communication with Unknown Worlds altogether.”</p><p>Then in June, according to the lawsuit, Krafton tried to get Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill to take a lower payout while also claiming that the founders were failing in their contractual obligations to the company. “On June 25, 2025, Krafton’s Head of Corporate Development told Gill that Krafton’s plan was to remove the Unknown Worlds board and fire the Founders,” the lawsuit reads.</p><p> “She warned Gill that ‘the lawyers are ready to go.’” They were fired roughly a week later, with termination letters from Striking Distance Studios CEO Steve Papoutsis, who has since taken over Unknown Worlds, blaming the founders’ “intention to proceed with a premature release of<em> Subnautica 2</em>.” According to the lawsuit, the firings were made “without cause,” and Krafton even went so far as to offer them their “post-termination payments and benefits” for being terminated “without cause.” </p><p>The lawsuit concludes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In short, Krafton flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds. It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without Cause. Promise broken.</p></blockquote><p>The founders’ side of the story comes after weeks of vague statements on Reddit and confusing press releases from Krafton, who has argued that the founders were fired for failing to get <em>Subnautica 2</em> ready for a successful Early Access release. In particular, the leaked milestone review points to concerns that a lack of biomes and story content would result in the game failing to meet player expectations for a sequel. It’s denied that the prospective payout, 10 percent of which was due to some of Unknown Worlds’ roughly 100 developers, had anything to do with the management shakeup. </p><p>Caught in the middle are those working on the game who still need to deliver it, one way or the other. With <em>Subnautica 2 </em>now coming out in 2026, Krafton has promised employees that it will extend the bonus payout window to make up for the delay as well as advance them money from next year’s profit-sharing pool, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjYwOTQyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMjE0MjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWkdJMVNUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eu_sHgKRf9uj-U3I1UDNgrJnNjE39Q3OcbLzDsn2xWY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjYwOTQyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMjE0MjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWkdJMVNUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eu_sHgKRf9uj-U3I1UDNgrJnNjE39Q3OcbLzDsn2xWY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>There are countless Android-powered gaming handhelds, but they go beyond the usual slate of Android games by offering console emulation support. The problem is the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/can-a-digital-lending-library-solve-classic-gamings-piracy-problem/">game ROMs</a> on these devices, which are not entirely legal. Italian YouTuber Once Were Nerd is learning how seriously some rightsholders are taking game piracy after agents from the country's Guardia di Finanza showed up to confiscate his consoles. He now says the investigation could lead to criminal charges and the end of his channel.</p>
<p>Once Were Nerd has produced YouTube content covering a plethora of gaming topics, including Android-based handheld game machines from the likes of Powkiddy and TrimUI. These devices usually run an older version of Android that has been heavily modified for gaming, featuring built-in emulation support for retro consoles like SNES, Nintendo 64, PlayStation Portable, GameCube, and more. They've become quite popular as the cost of mobile hardware has come down, making it possible to buy what is essentially an updated PSP or Game Boy Advance for $100 or less.</p>
<p>Recently, Once Were Nerd attracted the attention of Italy's Ministry of Economy and Finance, which is tasked with policing copyright in the country. In the video first spotted by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/once-were-nerd-youtuber-copyright-lawsuit-3577995/">Android Authority</a> (which has an AI-generated English language track), the YouTuber explains that Guardia di Finanza appeared at his door in April with a search warrant.</p>

      Once Were Nerd explains his legal woes.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Agents accused the creator of promoting pirated copyrighted materials stemming from his coverage of Anbernic handheld game consoles. While emulation software is not illegal, a surprising number of these devices ship chock-full of pre-loaded ROMs—the channel showed multiple Sony and Nintendo games running on the device. Once Were Nerd is far from the only channel posting about these devices, though.</p>

But the video game industry’s premiere horse game consultant, Alice Ruppert, finds herself more bemused than amused.</p><p>Ruppert has spent years of her career trying to get gaming companies to take horses seriously and running <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mane Quest</a>, a site dedicated to video game horses. The fact is, many games mess up horses to an almost comedic degree – <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-horses-red-dead-redemption-2-horse-testicles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether we’re talking their legs or their testicles</a> – and the ones that focus on equine excursions first and foremost don’t tend to boast the biggest budgets or best development pedigrees. This typically relegates them to a niche. But now, finally, a horse game for the masses has appeared. <em>Umamusume </em>is already, per Ruppert’s own estimate, "by far the most well-known and well-reviewed game focused on equestrian sports.” Problem is, it’s only sort of a horse game.</p><p>"I have supremely mixed feelings,” Ruppert, who has said that <em>Umamusume</em>’s popularity relative to more traditional horse games is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/malicedafirenze.bsky.social/post/3ltjjxghwus2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going to turn her into The Joker</a>, told Aftermath. “It's not that I don't think this should exist, and I don't think it's bad that people are having fun with a silly sports game that features girls as horses. I do very much see the harmless fun in it. … [But] it's not about horses, which is usually what my criteria for something being a horse game is. But it is very much within that world of horse racing. It is very much inspired by real horse racing."&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I do very much see the harmless fun in it. … [But] it's not about horses, which is usually what my criteria for something being a horse game is.</p></blockquote></figure><p><em>Umamusume</em>’s determined not-quite-centaurs are all based on real racehorses, a genuinely interesting twist that’s resulted in fans forming parasocial relationships with the handful that are still alive, because nobody can just be normal about anything anymore. On that front, Ruppert appreciates the game’s attention to detail.</p><p>"Some of the characters have different colored shoes or socks depending on the leg marking of the horse she represents,” Ruppert said. “And many of them match the hair color to mane color and stuff like that. That's cute. That's attention to detail that I don't see in the horse games that I usually review."</p><p>But that gets to the heart of Ruppert’s conflicted feelings about <em>Umamusume</em>: “I am convinced that a good horse racing game about actual horses could do just as well if it was implemented just as well. I spent years trying to chase after what other horse games do wrong. What do so many of them do so bad? How do they harm their own reach and potential?”</p><p>Ruppert sees potential in a few horse games of today and tomorrow, but <em>Umamusume </em>is in a league of its own.</p><p>“We're seeing more things now where people actually try and take a chance on the horse game audience, with stuff like<em> Windstorm: Legend of Khiimori</em> or <em>Equinox: Homecoming</em>,” said Ruppert. “<em>Equinox: Homecoming</em> doesn't have comparable numbers [to <em>Umamusume</em>] on Steam. I'm not saying it necessarily should, but there's a difference in the amount of polish and reach that [<em>Umamusume</em>] came out with. I so badly wish there were actual horse games like that."</p><p>But of course, there’s an easy argument against Ruppert’s impassioned pleas: <em>Umamusume </em>is first and foremost an anime girl gacha game and, secondarily, a horse game. One of these things, you would think, is always going to grab more eyeballs than the other. Ruppert, however, disagrees.</p><p>"I've seen the argument of 'Yeah, of course this is bigger than any horse games; it has anime girls in it. It's the roster of conventionally attractive, nice, pretty ladies that you get,’” said Ruppert. “But that's missing big parts of the equation for me. On one hand, we simply don't know how many people would play a good horse game if it were made with comparable production value, because nobody's done it."</p><figure><blockquote><p>We simply don't know how many people would play a good horse game if it were made with comparable production value, because nobody's done it.</p></blockquote></figure><p>She even believes streamers might latch onto a well-made horse game in a similarly ironic way, if only because people have spent decades joking about <em>Barbie Horse Adventures</em> and games of the like.</p><p>“I've definitely seen some amount of similar reactions to games actually about horses, where people are like 'Let's try this for shits and giggles,' and then it ends up being actually fun,” she said. “That kind of explosion could technically happen to a horse game as well. I've heard enough people make jokes about horse games that lots of streamers would consider it super absurd. … It’s very hard to predict that, because you never know which trends will pick up steam, but I don’t consider it outside the realm of possibility.”</p><p>For now, though, Ruppert believes that most horse-focused games lack the necessary meat on their bones to gallop to the front of the pack. If nothing else, she says, they could stand to study <em>Umamusume</em>’s core gameplay loop – or assemble any sort of satisfying core loop at all. As with a great many things in this world, more money would go a long way toward solving the problem.</p><p>"Some of the games I review have budgets of $100,000-$200,000 [while] being multiplatform releases. That's nothing. That's no money at all,” she said. “It's not surprising that they don't have time for iterating, balancing, polishing, bug fixing, etc. My point is, these games could be more successful if publishers and investors would take a chance on them. But I also have to acknowledge that, currently, no investors and publishers are taking a chance on anything, so horse games aren't alone in this plight at the moment."</p><p>But thanks to <em>Umamusume</em>, interest in real horses – or at least, specific real horses – is on the rise. That, in Ruppert’s eyes, is something.</p><p>"People gain an interest in horse racing through <em>Umamusume </em>and then start looking into the topic in general, which is fun. Whatever exposes people to new interests and hobbies is fine. I would not dare to judge that," she said. “I do have a few people that joined my Discord this week like 'I checked out <em>Umamusume</em>, and that made me want to play actual horse games. Now I'm looking for them.' So that does happen, on a very small scale."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Whatever exposes people to new interests and hobbies is fine. I would not dare to judge that.</p></blockquote></figure><p>While Ruppert is not exactly hopeful that <em>Umamusume </em>will lead to a horse game renaissance, she hopes at least a small handful of people – hopefully some with money – will learn a lesson from its success.</p><p>"This proves that equestrianism and equestrian themes do not turn people off of games. Mechanics related to training, competition, and care in between – that works,” she said. “People underestimate how many people want to play horse games because they think horse girls aren't gamers, and they think anybody who is interested in horses is at the barn and not at their PC – without accepting that people can actually be interested in multiple things, and that not everybody who wants to spend time with horses can afford to do so in real life.”</p><p>“I really believe that it would work with actual horses; it would target different people, but you could make a game like this with the actual animal,” she added. “And I feel like anyone who immediately goes 'Of course anime girls are more popular’ is underestimating the power of this audience of people who like horses and want to see them done well in games."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/umamusume-horse-expert-interview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whether you feel positively or negatively about the term, "friendslop" games have been more than a little common lately. First (arguably), you had <em>Phasmophobia</em>, the patient zero of friendslop, if you will. Next came a slew of other games that had similar vibes but which all provided their own twists.&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company</em> added creepypastas to the mix, and then games like <em>REPO </em>added an extra dose of chaos and insanity.</p>

<p>Now, the indie-gaming mavericks over at Strange Scaffold are bringing us <em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking</em>, a friendslop game about cooking meals for Kaiju. The developers invited us to a hands-off preview session to learn more, and it seems to be offering a way in for those who previously haven’t been able to enjoy these games with their friends.&nbsp;</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-man-holding-a-torch-from-a-first-person-perspective.jpg?itok=olvgI9f_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-man-holding-a-torch-from-a-first-person-perspective.jpg?itok=3mlxGrlw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Another year, another chance to go and stand on the chanting circle with your homies.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Other than being one of the most accurately descriptive titles I’ve ever seen, <em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking</em> is a first-person ‘friendslop’ game that sees you and several friends playing monks who descend into a dungeon to try and acquire the sort of food that will make a Kaiju creature happy enough to not attack your island monastery.</p>

<p>The focus is very much on finding the right combination of ingredients to please the monster, with each Kaiju preferring different flavors and ingredients. You and your friends descend into the dungeon, search rooms and fight creatures, and try to create the perfect meal, usually by running underneath different flavored geysers with whatever food you’ve managed to gather.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you’ve all acquired enough to please your hungry monster friend, you head back to the surface and launch it into their mouth with a catapult, or at least, with some sort of ancient military device (they were very specific about the historically accurate naming of said device). If you do well enough, the Kaiju leaves you alone for another in-game year, and you all head back to the monastery to rest.</p>

<p>With each in-game year, the story progresses, and ongoing generations of monks work together to maintain their home and deal with the ongoing losses as older monks die out, leaving the younger ones to fend for themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Unique Bucket of Friendslop</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-a-man-standing-in-front-of-some-bars-which-are-keeping-a-minotaur-away.jpg?itok=XqIHZRuk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-a-man-standing-in-front-of-some-bars-which-are-keeping-a-minotaur-away.jpg?itok=3bUZ3sxa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All-in-all, Bob thought that the Cretian holiday was off to a bad start.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;While <em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking</em> is certainly a friendslop game--it even has a ‘chanting’ mechanic that you can almost guarantee is going to be in a lot of upcoming YouTube videos--it’s a friendslop game with a difference.</p>

<p>Firstly, it’s a lot more forgiving. When you die or get hurt, you can be revived by other players taking your heart back to the surface, and the tone is overall a little lighter than most other games in the genre. Sure, “horror” is in the title, but at the very least it seems unlikely that you’ll be running for the duvet playing this once.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As well as that, you’ve got the story elements that are being included. Normally, friendslop games will focus more on having background lore rather than a forward-facing narrative. This game opts for a more direct inclusion.</p>

<p>Between each round, you can elect to go around the monastery talking to the other monks who live there. If you do, and pay attention to the changes that happen to the locale each year, then you will get a proper narrative to follow, not just hints at the creepy stuff that has been going on behind the scenes. However, this story is completely optional. If you want, you can ignore all of the people in the settlement, upgrade your character, and then just head straight back into the main game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s a nice change to have something extra to come back for each game, and it might even give the game an edge over others in the same genre. If you’ve ever failed to get into it, this might be the game that makes it click for you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Worth Your Time?&nbsp;</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-man-stading-in-a-catapult-with-a-giant-monster-head-craning-over-him.jpg?itok=pDwRunZj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-man-stading-in-a-catapult-with-a-giant-monster-head-craning-over-him.jpg?itok=Yj1jX-O0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't think that Foozhochii is about to have the best day, but at least it's nice to know you can feed the monster your friends if you run out of options.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>It bears many marked similarities to other friendslop titles. At the end of the day, you’re collecting items with your friends, and you have proximity voice chat (albeit with a speaking tube that allows you to broadcast your voice to the entire map at once). It’s very possible to completely lose your one friend, only to discover he was eaten by something unknowable while no one was looking.</p>

<p>Realistically, it’s tough to say whether <em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking</em> will stand out from the crowd without getting a chance to go hands-on, but the inclusion of a narrative and a bit more accessibility for players who’ve struggled with similar games in the past might clinch it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, you have to acknowledge that this is Strange Scaffold we’re talking about here. They have a history of producing games that all have at least one interesting thing about them, and it seems this game won’t be any different.</p>

<p>This is a friendslop game with biblical influence, and apparently one that wasn’t necessarily informed by trend-chasing, according to the devs themselves at least. The real test will be whether the game is enticing enough to attract both streamers and the players who are already deeply invested in other, similar games.</p>

<h2><em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-naked-man-standing-in-a-pile-of-blood-and-viscera.jpg?itok=xbgrzpOJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-naked-man-standing-in-a-pile-of-blood-and-viscera.jpg?itok=08Tumnho 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just an average day on Monastery island.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking </em>launches&nbsp;July 29, but if you just can't wait that long, then you can sign up to playtest it on Steam right away. For the next two weeks, the game will be available for an open playtest, allowing gamers to try out the entire game as much as they want over the next fortnight, as well as giving us the opportunity to help and steer the direction of the game.</p>

<p>It's all part of the company's new policy of radical transparency. In fact, they also shared details of two other games that have been in development for a month or less. Both <em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> and <em>Truck-Kun is Supporting Me From Another World</em> are in early stages of development, but Strange Scaffold wants their players to know about it, and be as involved as they can be. So head over to the company's Steam developer page to check out all of the latest info on all of these games, too.</p>

So that makes a “reveal” trailer kind of boring and unnecessary. This is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fifa-soccer-ea-games-sports-fc-franchise-pro-evolution-1848905860&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fifa-soccer-ea-games-sports-fc-franchise-pro-evolution-1848905860">the series that used to be called <em>FIFA</em></a></span><em> </em>and makes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/ea-sports-fc-electronic-arts-earnings-1235890705/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/ea-sports-fc-electronic-arts-earnings-1235890705/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA hundreds of millions of dollars every year</a></span>. Of course, we all knew there was going to be an <em>EA Sports FC 26. </em>The question then becomes: How do you get people to pay attention to your reveal trailer and hopefully win back fans who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25">weren’t happy about last year’s entry</a></span>? The answer: Directly address their complaints in a fun way. </p><p>Here’s the trailer, which is filled with complaints about last year’s game being too slow, not reactive enough, or lacking other important features. And EA confidently offers a solution or improvement for each one. </p><p> “<em>FC 26</em> reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,” said EA Sports exec John Sheppard. “We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new Tournaments and Live Events in FUT, all-new Archetype customization in Clubs, and a Career Mode that comes alive through evolving Challenges. We can’t wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of <em>FC</em>.”</p><p>Now, while we hope the game turns out great, it remains possible that when players get their hands on <em>EA Sports FC 26</em> on September 26, they won’t be happy with what EA has done. But at the very least, I’ll give EA credit for poking fun at itself and offering up a trailer that is unique and memorable. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fc-26-fifa-trailer-reveal-complaints-soccer-ea-sports-1851786431]]></content:encoded>

The new Emerald Gamer pack is included at no extra cost with any level of PS Plus membership, and can be claimed in the PlayStation Store on PS4 and PS5, in the PS App, or <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1477-PPSA01922_00-PSCP300000000000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on the web</a>. In order to unlock the skin in-game, you will need to actually load up Fortnite on a PlayStation device at least once after claiming it from the store. Once you've done so, the skin will be usable on any platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4533112-theemeraldgamer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533112" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4533112-theemeraldgamer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533112"></a><figcaption>All PS+ members can claim the Emerald Gamer pack now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4533112-theemeraldgamer.jpg"></figure><p>This new pack includes the brand-new <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=18187" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sage</a> skin, as well as a matching back bling and pickaxe.
