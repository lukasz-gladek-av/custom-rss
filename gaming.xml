		<p>One of the most pleasant surprises of the past couple of weeks has been Skate. If you’ve been around gaming for a while – which I, ahem, have – then you’ll know Skate from the days of the Xbox 360 and PS3, where it went board to board with Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater by offering a completely different take on the sport and the skateboarding scene. Many had assumed that Skate 3 – released 15 whole years ago – was the end for the series, especially with the shuttering of developer EA Black Box, but just like any skateboarder whose face has felt the cool touch of tarmac, you can’t keep a good game series down. The new version of Skate ten, has just arrived in Early Access, and with the launch of Season One today, the team at Full Circle have announced that the game has already seen 15 million players hitting the sidewalks of San Vansterdam.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Mi9EKoBCSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s a hell of a lot of people. And with good reason too, since the move to Free-To-Play has made this the most accessible skateboarding game we’ve ever had. Even if you only have the most passing interest in skateboarding – perhaps you watched Lords of Dogtown with Heath Ledger in back in the day and thought it was pretty cool – there’s literally no reason not to download the new Skate and check it out. That certainly seems to be what people are doing too, as the player numbers have soared in only three weeks.</p>
<p>I’ve spent some serious time in San Vansterdam already, and really enjoyed this initial foray into Early Access in my review, stating, “I’ve been waiting for Skate. Tony Hawk’s frantic take on the sport is cool, but it doesn’t feel as good as this. The freedom, the variety, and the community are already in place, the only thing missing is you.”</p>
<p><em>Season 1 launches today with all-new skateable areas, Challenges, Tasks, seasonal events, new brand partners, cosmetics, quality of life improvements and more.</em></p>

<p>But what could it mean?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a surprise new short film called '<strong>Close To You</strong>' and it's... not what we expected from the House of Mario.</p>
<p>Initially shared on the Nintendo Today! app before cropping up on YouTube and socials, the short follows a baby that learns to take its first steps via the magic of a sentient dummy (or pacifier, if you'd rather).</p>
<p>It feels very Toy Story, and the animation style has big Pixar energy to boot, but the strangest part of it all is how it feels very... un-Nintendo. There's no Mario to seen, the baby doesn't stumble past some Joy-Con at any point, there's not even a Pikmin cameo.</p>
<p>Or is there? It feels to us like there's something missing in this short. Don't you get the impression that we <em>should</em> be seeing something carrying the dummy or pushing the blocks? Do we spy something moving under the bed in the background <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsufGY5I8jA&amp;t=99s">around 1:38</a>? Doesn't the music sound a little <em>too</em> Pikmin-coded?</p>

<p>The whole thing has a whiff of an invisible Pikmin scheme to us, but hey, that's just a theory. Whether this turns out to be something bigger, well, we're just going to have to wait and see.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this animated short? Do you think it will be part of something larger? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-studios-and-ea-tease-that-naval-warfare-is-on-the-horizon-for-battlefield-6.1318558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, Battlefield 6 is days away from launching on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S worldwide. The <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1974127507260510622">global launch times are up</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-1-7-million-pre-orders-predicted-to-sell-5-million-first-week/">estimated 1.7 million players bought in for October 10</a> will be boots on the ground by the end of the week. So naturally, it's time for Battlefield Studios and EA to talk about what's next for Battlefield 6 on October 11, and every day after that.</p>



<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way">Community Update blog post on the Battlefield website</a>, Battlefield Studios laid out a few data points regarding what it has noticed over the course of its Battlefield Labs testing, followed by updates and changes players who participated in that testing and in the Beta this summer will notice when the game launches this coming Friday.</p>



<p>Towards the end of the post, in the section titled, "<em>On the Horizon</em>," the Battlefield Studios team writes, "<em>There is much more to look forward to beyond our Seasons as our team continues reviewing Battlefield Labs data, player feedback, and ideating on completely new ideas for the future, starting with an exciting new Battlefield take on Battle Royale.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Separately, requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favourite little helicopter, platoons, and more</em>.<em> We appreciate all of your suggestions, and want you to know we're listening.</em>"</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/">recently revealed Season 1 roadmap </a>doesn't include the introduction of naval warfare, nor does it include the return of Little Bird, the helicopter that is most likely referenced by the phrase "<em>little helicopter</em>." But that doesn't mean those inclusions won't be ready for Season 2, or Season 3, and so on. At least Battlefield Studios has made the point that it is part of the conversation for Battlefield 6's future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Poncle has announced a brand new update for the arcade roguelike, and it'll finally bring the ability to play the game online alongside your friends.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1975546530238013703" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>Update 1.14 is due to arrive sometime this fall, and it's bringing online co-op to the game on both PC and consoles, although it's not clear right now whether the game's multiplayer mode will feature crossplay.</p>

<p>Of course, Poncle revealed the news of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' online co-op mode with a characteristically amusing trailer featuring a throwback Windows 95-style operating system, so if, like me, you're hopelessly nostalgic for the days of old-school PC gaming, this one'll appeal to you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-online-co-op-update-windows-95.jpg?itok=VZADLhqn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-online-co-op-update-windows-95.jpg?itok=S10Mc8B4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh, Poncle, you rogue, you.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer also shows a clip of four players enjoying&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>together, and indeed, the game's online co-op mode will support up to four players, so grab three friends and get ready to fill the screen with an absolutely cosmic amount of projectiles.</p>

<p>As well as online co-op, there are four more major features to be revealed as part of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>Update 1.14, and Poncle is pledging to reveal new cards each week, so we'll learn more about what else is coming as part of this update in...well, in a week, as it happens.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' latest update comes just a couple of months after Poncle announced its second major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-publishing" rel="nofollow">foray into the publishing world</a> in the form of brick-breaking roguelike&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kill-the-brickman-poncle-out-now" rel="nofollow">Kill the Brickman</a>&nbsp;</em>(no, not that one).</p>




<p>As for the game that made Poncle's name, if you're somehow unfamiliar with it,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>is an action-heavy arcade roguelike in which you must survive hordes of enemies swarming you across a variety of different maps.</p>

<p>To that end, you'll gain access to projectile and melee weapons that fire themselves, so it's up to you to position yourself correctly and try to build the perfect combination of items in order to survive for as long as you possibly can.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/vampire-survivors/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/vampire-survivors/9pd5bm2z8c4l" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/vampire-survivors-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-v11-cordless-vacuum-at-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-day-2000631582</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-v11-origin-cordless-vacuum-just-dropped-below-the-older-v8-pricing-for-amazon-prime-day.1318552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re under a week out from Prime Big Deals Day. This is Amazon’s two-day sales event where you’ll be able to find steep discounts on products across every category — tech, home goods, automotive, you name it. Despite the even not starting until Tuesday, October 7, you can already start finding some great deals right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">The Dyson V11 Origin cordless vacuum has dropped to $400 for Prime users. The stick vacuum normally goes for $630 so you’d be saving a full $230.</a> That’s a 37% discount and it’s not even Prime Big Deals Day yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Convenience is really prime selling point for a cordless stick vacuum and the Dyson V11 is no exception. This vacuum is easy to move around throughout the home. It’s both lightweight and ergonomic so you can pick it up and clean up high up hard to reach places with ease. Transform the vacuum into a handheld, making it ever easier to maneuver while still not losing any power. That makes it a perfect tool for taking care of the interior of your car before before the next time it’s your turn to drive the friend group.</p>

<h2>Remove Pet Hair From Your Home</h2>
<p>Pet owners wouldn’t give up our furry little friends for the world, but we could sure do without all the hair that falls off of them. It digs into the carpet and can retain that very distinct odor that makes guests who walk in for the first time go, “hey do you have a dog?” Well, the Dyson V11 stick vacuum can help keep your couches and carpets free of fur. The vac comes with a hair screw tool, conical in shape, which can help get hair detangled while you’re going about cleaning your home. The Motorbar cleaner can automatically clear any hair that’s gotten wrapped up around the brush bar.</p>



<p>The vacuum is cordless, so it’s running off of a battery. That battery can last you approximately 100 minutes on a single charge. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">That’s roughly an hour longer than the Dyson V8 can hold up, which is a lot after considering that the V11’s motor spins at 125,000rpm and generates 60% more power than the V8</a>. When the vacuum is not in use, it can be neatly stored against the wall dock, recharging it on its own while its been put away. The LCD screen atop the vacuum shows you exactly how much battery life you have left so you won’t have any unexpected stops while vacuuming because your forgot to charge.</p>

              <p>As the AI plagiarism machines continue to churn out ever-more semi-realistic slop, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">videos of OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman eating a barbecued Pikachu</a>, the harm to any number of industries is incalculable. But there is also the personal harm, and no one has captured it better than actor and director Zelda Williams, daughter of the late Robin Williams, in a recent post on her Instagram.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/zelda-williams-ethers-ai-tributes-to-her-dead-dad-youre-making-disgusting-over-processed-hotdogs-out-of-the-lives-of-human-beings/">reported by&nbsp;<em>PC Gamer</em></a>, Zelda Williams posted an Instagram story (that has since expired) in which she begged her followers to “just stop sending me AI videos of Dad.”</p> <p>Sora, the AI video app from OpenAI, is flooding the internet with macabre depictions of both dead and living celebrities and public figures saying and doing things they’ve never said nor done. Obviously this can be enormously damaging for people’s reputations, with credulous viewers reposting such footage as fact. But what doesn’t always get thought about is how it affects the loved ones of those depicted, especially of those who have died. Such videos don’t need to be outlandish or offensive to achieve this, either—if anything, the more benign a video is, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@stealthlurking/video/7557903802280594702?q=sora%20robin%20williams&amp;t=1759840729478">the more insidious and upsetting it can be</a>.</p>

 <p>“Stop believing I wanna see it or that I’ll understand, I don’t and I won’t,” Williams wrote in her post. “If you’re just trying to troll me, I’ve seen way worse, I’ll restrict and move on. But please, if you’ve got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop. It’s dumb, it’s a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it’s NOT what he’d want.”</p>

 <p>As Rich Stanton points out in his&nbsp;<em>PCG</em> article, Robin Williams was famous for not wanting his face and voice used to hawk any old plastic tat, so it’s especially vile to note the constant dripping from the AI sewage pipe that’s putting words into his mouth. As his daughter puts it, “To watch the legacies of real people be condensed down to ‘this vaguely looks and sounds like them so that’s enough’, just so other people can churn out horrible TikTok slop puppeteering them is maddening.”</p>

 <p>“You’re not making art,” Zelda Williams continues. “You’re making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings, out of the history of art and music, and then shoving them down someone else’s throat hoping they’ll give you a little thumbs up and like it. Gross.”</p>

 <p>And then, in unimprovable words, the actor sums up everything that’s so grim about it all:</p> <blockquote><p>And for the love of EVERYTHING, stop calling it ‘the future,’ AI is just badly recycling and regurgitating the past to be re-consumed. You are taking in the Human Centipede of content, and from the very very end of the line, all while the folks at the front laugh and laugh, consume and consume.</p></blockquote> <p id="dea0a845-47f5-4786-9ec0-3212f05d3981-2">Even OpenAI is <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">balking</a> at the way the just-launched Sora 2 is being used, with Altman backtracking on its ability to use any copyrighted materials, saying from now on companies will have to opt in. But this offers nothing to protect individuals, or their loved ones, from being depicted in such intrusive and ghoulish ways.</p> <p>Remember when AI was going to do all the boring jobs for us so we could live happier, freer lives? Yeah, turns out all it’s capable of is cheap tricks and making people sad.</p>

<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <p>It looks like one of the most disliked characters in the Borderlands series may have been cut from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, according to datamined file names posted online.</p>
<p>As posted by to EpicNNG, a Borderlands content creator and dataminer who previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-borderlands-4-nearly-here-a-community-of-archivists-are-racing-to-revive-a-dead-borderlands-mmo">led an archival effort for the defunct Chinese Borderlands MMO</a>, files exist within Borderlands 4 that explicitly name a character called Ava. This character, introduced during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a>, proved quite divisive when series fans first met her back in 2019.</p>
<p>These Borderlands 4 files, <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975222704094814674">posted in screenshot form on X by EpicNNG</a>, include assets seemingly tied to her bubble (a Siren ability she was shown to have had in Borderlands 3), as well as moments in the game when she'd be accompanying Zane throughout the story.</p>

<p>These files indicate that Ava may have been totally replaced by another character: Amara. Notably Amara is introduced to the play alongside Hermes (Ava's pet from Borderlands 3), and by the crashed Sanctuary ship from Borderlands 3 no less. So such inferences based on breadcrumbs left in the files aren't baseless.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that these small files datamined from the game are the only evidence available that Ava was at one point part of Borderlands 4. There has been no model discovered, nor audio files.</p>
<p>If Ava was originally intended to be part of Borderlands 4's narrative as these datamined files suggest, then this would mark a fairly substantial U-turn for the game during development. <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1840461497371402481">Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford asked the community</a> roughly a year ago what players thought of Ava, and got a passionate response from both those who disliked the character, and those willing to give her a second shot.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-will-let-you-shut-claptraps-claptrap">Gearbox added a Claptrap sound slider to the game</a>, as many fans found the character to be a tad grating to listen to. A smart move, as the option itself is good joke that Borderlands fans could appreciate.
</p>
<p>Ava has yet to be confirmed as a returning character in upcoming DLC at all, so this may very well be the closest she comes to appearing in Borderlands 4. Or maybe she'll make a grand return to the game at a later date. The fact she was considered at all indicates there was some appetite to bring her back a few in-universe years after her grand introduction.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/07/edifier-es850nb-headphones-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/edifier-es850nb-headphones-review.1318507/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The level of competition in the personal audio space is flabbergasting. While the biggest companies – Sony, Bose, et al – manage to stay at the top of the pack, the middle ground and the budget brands continue to rise ever closer to them, as technology improves and components become cheaper and more readily available. Amongst those building a head of steam, Edifier have become one of the most reliable names in audio, and with the snappily-named ES850NB, they’ve taken another step closer to those at the top of the category.</p>
<p><iframe title="ES850NB Active Noise Canceling #Headphones. ???? #edifier" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0KJ-obYho8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The ES850NB – seriously, can’t we have sensible names in the headphone space? – is an over-ear, wireless headset that brings a suite of desirable features to bear, starting with Hi-Res audio certification, active noise cancellation, and a mammoth 92-hour battery life (53hrs with ANC). That’s good enough to see you all around the world, and thankfully, the audio is good enough to take you all the way there too.</p>


<p>In the box you’re getting the ES850NB itself, a very nice hard case with the Edifier logo proudly emblazoned on the front, and a USB-A to USB-C charging cable. The ES850NB fold down, which Sony and Bose seem to have forgotten about in recent years, and there’s a surety to popping them in the case and putting them in your bag knowing they’re perfectly protected. Thanks to that fold, the case isn’t going to take up all the room in your bag, either.</p>
<p>The headphones themselves come in black, brown, ivory and pink colourways, with our review unit appearing in the understated black. The sleek lines of the headband culminate in the rounded oblongs of each earpiece, connected via a single curved arm. There’s a debt here to the visual design of the Bowers and Wilkin Px8, but the ES850NB come away with enough visual identity of their own to stand apart.</p>


<p>Some of that comes down to the leather-like texture that covers the earpieces, lending the ES850NB a premium look beyond its mid-range price. It creates an interesting juxtaposition with the clean, smooth lines of the headband, and the understated Edifier logos help to make this a pair of headphones that retain a sense of class.</p>
<p>There are physical controls here, which are definitely preferable to some of the touch controls we often see at this price point. There’s a volume rocker, with a central raised point that provides a third button, and these provide every control you could want, whether power, call handling, volume, or music controls.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s a separate button for Bluetooth, which also controls mode switching for ANC, and changing between music and the low latency gaming mode. Unfortunately, you can’t combine the gaming mode with the LDAC codec, forcing a reset of the headset every time you switch, but if you’re serious about competitive mobile gaming, this is an excellent choice. That’s all quite a lot to remember, but the physical recognition of the buttons certainly helps to give you some surety when making changes, as does the voice assistant. Alternatively, you can switch between modes in the Edifier ConneX phone app.</p>
<p>At 265g, the ES850NB are a smidgen heavier than Sony’s XM6 and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra, but not enough to notice a difference in your hand or on your head. Soft leatherette covers both the memory foam of the earpads and the underside of the headband, making this an exceedingly comfortable headset that you can wear all day long.</p>

<p>There was a point where I wondered if the ES850NB sounded as good as my Sony XM5s. They don’t, but the fact that Edifier have made something that sounds good enough that I had to check, speaks volumes. There’s a pleasingly wide soundstage, especially wide for a closed-back pair of headphones, and when combined with Hi-Res music, the ES850NBs sound very good indeed.</p>
<p>I have a fairly horrible taste in music, and the Edifier ES850NB delivered all the loud, grinding Metalcore of Bad Omens and Starset with bags of energy. There’s plenty of bass here, but it’s not overwhelming, and with a Hi-Res source like Apple Music, you can pick out details in tracks you’ve listened to hundreds of times, and still find new elements that you’ve never heard before.</p>
<p>When you combine any input with the ANC – rated for -45db – the ES850NB do a great job of cutting out external noises and background sounds, and they provide a natural-feeling fit without any undue pressure. The ambient sound setting is less natural than the best headsets out there, sounding slightly muddied and subdued, but I did like the hold-to-chat function which allowed you to activate the ambient sound setting by holding the right earpiece.</p>

<p>You can dial in a moderate amount of difference via the customisable EQ in the app, and there’s a limited number of pre-made EQ settings as well, but this is currently where the ES850NB are at their weakest. There simply isn’t the level of control or ability to make incremental changes to the audio settings that you’ll find elsewhere. In the end, I opted for the Bass Boost EQ setting, and there was still plenty of top-end detail with this setup, but if you’re the kind of person who wants to dial in a very specific sound, Edifier have some work to do.</p>
<p>There’s the added oddity that the phone app won’t update your headset’s firmware. Instead, you have to use the Edifier Tempohub on your PC or Mac, which is an unnecessary extra layer of faff, and might even lock some owners out of updating their headphones. When everyone else’s phone app can perform that function, I don’t really understand why Edifier’s doesn’t.</p>
<p>At £149.99, the ES850NB are pretty much the epitome of the mid-range. As another option in this price range, the Skull Candy Crusher ANC offer some serious bass, but they lack the refinement of the ES850NB. If you’re lucky enough to catch them in a sale though, you might want to hold out for Sony’s older XM4’s, which remain one of the best pairs of headphones ever made. They also support that all-important LDAC codec.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/supergiant-games" rel="nofollow">Supergiant Games</a>, the developers for hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/transistor-review-kill-robots-talking-sword" rel="nofollow">Transistor</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/supergiant-games/reviews" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades</em></a>, never cease to amaze me. Somehow, each game they make is better than the last. So with their latest title<em>&nbsp;Hades 2,&nbsp;</em>I have to wonder how anything could top this. Yes, it's that good. With how incredible&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is, can you&nbsp;<em>imagine</em>&nbsp;what they've got cooking in the future?</p>

<p>But let's focus on the present for now.&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is undeniably a Game of the Year contender, the same as its predecessor. This <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/roguelite/games" rel="nofollow">roguelite</a> -- filled with mechanical depth and wonderful, complex characters -- continues to give more and more, even after dozens of runs across many hours of gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-hecate.jpg?itok=opPfS3jt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-hecate.jpg?itok=pFLd10Cn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hecate isn't the only one with a grudge.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Hades</em>&nbsp;is Back and Better than Ever</h2>

<p><em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;expands upon what was already a meaty game in&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>. Hailed as one of the greatest in its genre,&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;provided a great deal of content as player character Zagreus fought through an Underworld directly based on Greek myth.</p>

<p>With this title stars Zagreus' sister, Melinoe, who was born after the events of the original and, due to the scheming of the Titan of Time Chronos, she was whisked away from her family at a very young age. Melinoe, along with the titaness Hecate, trained for many years in the ways of witchcraft and combat in order to take down Chronos and save both the Underworld and the other gods of Olympus.</p>

<p>Any good run in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;begins with some prep work, and that's what Hecate's base of operations is for. It's a beautiful, witchy hub where Melinoe can, among other things, conduct incantations at the cauldron to unlock new mechanics. Incantations require materials, which are acquired during your runs, so despite&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s inevitability of failure during a run, you're still making progress towards your end goal.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-incantations.jpg?itok=txCFQvlV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-incantations.jpg?itok=rw41BZmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The iconic witch's cauldron, a very useful tool.</figcaption></figure><p>Because upgrades are introduced at a natural and steady pace, I was never overwhelmed by the breadth of mechanics. There is a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;going on in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, you see, but somehow, Supergiant Games manages to make it less intimidating than it sounds.</p>

<p>You can unlock new weapons, open up new pathways, and add helpful shrines to enhance your run. Conduct the&nbsp;Propensity Toward Gold incantation to allow urns with extra gold to appear, or activate&nbsp;Faith of Familiar Spirits to acquire animal companions.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, incantations are more nuanced than many roguelites' approach to metaprogression. This makes&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>vastly more interesting in terms of gameplay, meaning that every time you unlock the ability to do a new incantation, it's actually quite exciting.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-boon-of-poseidon_0.jpg?itok=0FJcaWym 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-boon-of-poseidon_0.jpg?itok=dGtKzHpm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thank you, Uncle Poseidon.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Gifts of the Gods</h2>

<p>Beyond that, of course, is your standard run through the Underworld in your quest to defeat Chronos. This formula remains true to the original&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;in that you'll fight across a number of zones with hand-crafted rooms arranged in random order. You acquire upgrades and items after completing combat encounters in each room, creating a simple combat loop.</p>

<p>Boons will be the main source of your power here -- these are gifts from the gods that alter your abilities during a run. Like incantations, boons have more nuance to them than your typical roguelite upgrade. You might get stat increases like increased damage or power, but more often than not, boons alter the way your abilities behave.</p>

<p>For every boon you're given three choices, but there are something like two dozen boons for each god, so the possibilities with your builds feel limitless. As an example of what we're working with,&nbsp;I'd get pretty excited every time I saw a boon of Hephaestus waiting for me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haphaestus-hades-2.jpg?itok=gWzIJj53 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haphaestus-hades-2.jpg?itok=T8swHtLb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Side note, I love his design.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The God of the Forge would, appropriately, buff your attacks to have blast-like effects, much like a hammer striking hot metal fresh from the forge. These blast effects deal a great amount of damage and refresh after a cooldown. Hephaestus' boons often inflict a debuff called "Glow" on enemies, which allows foes to take an increased percentage of damage.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll likely find your favorite gods and pick which boons work best for you. Personally, I'm still experimenting with possibilities even after 30 hours of playtime, and I definitely haven't seen everything boons have to offer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-gameplay.jpg?itok=64Aizidb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-gameplay.jpg?itok=_1TzNJOY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They look intimidating, but they're no match for Melinoe.</figcaption></figure><h2>Melinoe the Witch</h2>

<p>Where Zagreus felt like more of a brawler in&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, Melinoe is more like a spellcaster. She is a witch, after all, so it only makes sense for her to utilize more spells and ranged-based attacks. Thus, more of her toolkit favors ranged combat, though you're still given a number of close-ranged weapons to choose from.</p>

<p>Though the melee weapons felt way more underpowered compared to the ranged weapons in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. Why get up close and risk getting hit by an enemy when you can attack just as effectively at range? So yes, I vastly preferred keeping foes at bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of weapon variety,&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is similar to its predecessor. You're given a handful of weapons -- called Nocturnal Arms -- to choose from, which will serve as the basis for your kit. From there, these enhance your attacks, dash-strikes, and specials.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-skull.jpg?itok=XGQsqAGB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-skull.jpg?itok=CByzXfuG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Using the skull on our skeletal punching bag, Schelemeus.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I preferred the Argent Skull, which is an ammo-based projectile that has a potent, long-range attack that catered to my preferred playstyle. You're given four skulls, and after shooting them, Melinoe must recover them in order to shoot again.</p>

<p>It sounds like a bit of an unconventional way to play, but I like that. Melinoe special dashes forward and grabs those skulls, so the Argent Skull has a great deal of mobility to add onto it. Grab Hephaestus' boons to alter its attacks and specials, and you're going to melt bosses!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-weapons.jpg?itok=sj-QFFFn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-weapons.jpg?itok=din5BxJL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Weapons even have variants, so there is so much to unlock and use!</figcaption></figure><p>There's also the cast ability, which you're given regardless of what weapon you choose. This creates a circle on the ground that slows down enemies and can be a very beneficial tool when overwhelmed. Add on a damaging boon, and it serves as a great way to tack on debuffs and damage foes.</p>

<p>Once more adding some complexity and depth to&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s mechanics are Arcana cards, which are permanent unlocks that serve as ways to improve survivability, increase the potency of abilities, and much more. Keepsakes, gifts from gods and other characters, also aid you in&nbsp;this one, as they did in<em>&nbsp;</em>the original. By now, you can probably see what I mean when I say there's a lot going on in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2.&nbsp;</em></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mt.-olympus-hades-2.jpg?itok=IPQ6kARS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mt.-olympus-hades-2.jpg?itok=JHIXZtvn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So this is where the gods live, eh?</figcaption></figure><h2>Taking the Fight to Mt. Olympus</h2>

<p>Truth be told, there's much more to&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>than just traversing through the Underworld.&nbsp;Eventually, Melinoe gains the ability to fight on the surface in an attempt to rescue Mount Olympus from a siege. Here we have even&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>variety&nbsp;in gameplay as it introduces new level layouts, an entirely different&nbsp;set of enemies, bosses, and characters to meet as well.</p>

<p>This is where I realized that&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is more special than I initially thought. The surface is where Supergiant Games' strengths are truly leveraged. Gameplay is, as usual, wonderful, but where they truly excel is with art and sound direction, and strong character writing.</p>

<p><em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is gorgeous, and the zones are so varied. In the Underworld, Chronos' version of Tartarus has this opulent, clockwork aesthetic. Go to the surface, and you'll eventually reach the snow-capped cliffs of Mt. Olympus, which are magical in their own right, despite their beauty being marred by Chronos' attacking army.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prometheus-hades-2.jpg?itok=TyYDL7jH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prometheus-hades-2.jpg?itok=qixaONM7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Holy moly what a cool lookin' dude.</figcaption></figure><h2>All Things Greek Myth</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, this title brings its characters to life with some of the best character design in the business, as well as strong voice performances by its wonderful cast,&nbsp;including everyone's favorite Ben Starr as Prometheus.</p>

<p>I do want to make a point with Prometheus for a second. If you're familiar with his myth, he was essentially damned to a hellish eternity of being chained to a mountaintop while an eagle devours his innards. I didn't realize it at first, but Prometheus has a bandage around his belly along with a giant scar. As a boss, he has an eagle companion as a weapon and also uses fire (the fire makes sense, as he was the one who gave fire to humanity).</p>

<p>This is just one example of strong visual design conveying a lot about a character, but you'll see this in just about every encounter. You don't really need to know much, if anything, about Greek mythology to enjoy the writing&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;offers, though. It's well-written enough that you can intuit a character's backstory based on what they say.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/scylla-and-the-sirens-hades-2.jpg?itok=VzPx4JZ2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/scylla-and-the-sirens-hades-2.jpg?itok=JqC64Crq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This one is for Odysseus!</figcaption></figure><p>It was a particular joy to see characters featured from&nbsp;<em>The Odyssey,&nbsp;</em>my favorite tale from Greek myth. There's the cunning and wily Odysseus, who now acts as a tactician for Hecate. We fight Scylla, a sea monster that had a run-in with Odysseus in the past, as well as the cyclops Polyphemus, who still hasn't forgotten how Odysseus outwitted him that one time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This really scratches the surface when it comes to writing, but I'm continually amazed by how much dialogue is offered in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. There are dozens upon dozens of lines for each character, reacting to different things like how your run went, what items you have on, and the like. It's marvelous work.</p>

<p>Really, writing is very strong up until the end. I expected more of an emotional response, but I wasn't fully satisfied with how things ended. This, I realize, is a common complaint among the fandom, but there's a lot of truth to it. I won't divulge details, but I expected something more, I don't know,<em>&nbsp;</em>compelling or thought-provoking, given how strong the rest of the narrative was.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fields-hades-2.jpg?itok=z6jPCCpR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fields-hades-2.jpg?itok=1R7-zTCE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Where to go from here?</figcaption></figure><h2>Hades 2 Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I know it's in a roguelites nature to be repetitive, but one additional issue I had with&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;was its boss battles. I felt the same way I did in the original, but they're just so repetitive to a point that I don't look forward to fighting them anymore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in order to roll credits, you're tasked with getting to the end of both the Underworld and the surface quite a few times, so you'll be repeating this cycle a lot. There's no simple solution to fixing this. It's a quirk from roguelites I don't really prefer, so I'd lose excitement when I knew a boss was in the next room.</p>

<p>Despite this,&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is by far the most compelling roguelite ever made. Possibly even the best, and I'm not being hyperbolic. Seriously, it's no wonder other developers try to emulate the formula, only to create something less than the inspiration. Well, with a second stab at&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, Supergiant Games one-ups itself with an even better version of the game that shook up the genre.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shovel Knight&nbsp;</em>developer Yacht Club Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>, its upcoming retro-style top-down action-adventure game, has been delayed indefinitely.</p>

<p>Announcing the delay in a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Yacht Club says that despite "working tirelessly day and night to finish"&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club" rel="nofollow">intended October 31st release date</a>, the development team is "just not quite there yet".</p>

<p>According to the studio, the delay in question won't be "major"; it'll simply be an opportunity to "apply some final polish and balancing" to ensure that&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>is ready for primetime when it releases. However, no new release date was revealed, so we don't know when the game will actually be arriving.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mina-the-hollower-delayed-gameplay.jpg?itok=Wm58zpnJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mina-the-hollower-delayed-gameplay.jpg?itok=ucqr7VGp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>isn't going to launch in time for Halloween, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club says it doesn't want to announce a new release date until&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>has been submitted for approval across all of the platforms on which it's intended to appear, beseeching fans to "hang tight as we reach the finish line".</p>

<p>As for what's actually being done during the final hours of development, Yacht Club says the team is currently working on issues like finalizing design and art, game balance, and implementing localization, as well as "eating cheese". Well, that's a noble reason for a delay in my books.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>is, it's the next title developed by&nbsp;<em>Shovel Knight&nbsp;</em>outfit Yacht Club Games, which has also branched out into publishing with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yacht-club-games-announce-8-bit-platformer-cyber-shadow" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Cyber Shadow</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game revolves around the titular Mina, who must traverse Tenebrous Isle in order to rescue it from a curse. It utilizes deliberately retro-style graphics, just like&nbsp;<em>Shovel Knight</em>, but this time, the vibe is much more&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>than&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>.</p>




<p>We don't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>will launch, but when it does, it's set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875580/Mina_the_Hollower/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010918" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Mina-the-Hollower-2887867.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both</a> Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Mina-the-Hollower-2887790.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">consoles</a>.

            <p>I was rubbing along pretty well in House Of Necrosis before I hurled a vial of unidentified black serum at a squashy purple Devourer. I was hoping the serum would be some kind of poison - I mean, come on, an unidentified black serum? You wouldn't pour that on your chips. It turned out to be an XP potion, which transformed the Devourer into a Foul Devourer - still squashy, still purple, but with much sturdier defence.</p>
<p>I managed to recover some of the accidentally donated XP by lobbing a cheeky hex, but not enough to boost the stopping power of my homely pawnshop knife and pistol. So down I went in a pool of that special red serum the billionaires <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/13/rich-men-longevity-history">like to drink</a> when they're feeling mortal.</p><!--more-->
<p>Imagine if this had happened while you were playing the original Resident Evil on PS1. Imagine hurling a bottle of unspecified weirdness into the blindspot immediately after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ntFBVXqPg">the Hunter's first appearance</a>, and hearing a cheery level-up chime. You'd have ripped the power cable out of the wall. You'd have sworn to track down Shinji Mikami and make him eat his own socks. Unless, that is, you'd already played a few Mystery Dungeon games, which do this kind of nonsense all the time.</p>

<p>I described House Of Necrosis as "OG Resident Evil but turn-based" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-battlefield-6-fends-off-an-onslaught-of-cool-indie-rpgs-strategy-games-horror-games-and-piss-simulators">the latest Mawmouth</a>, which isn't inaccurate but (as reader SeekerX pointed out) omits plenty. This neato <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is a tribute to both Capcom and Spike Chunsoft. It sees you exploring a zombie mansion made up of grid-based floor layouts full of randomly distributed enemies, treasures and traps. You've got to find the next floor while sprucing your stats and gathering items. </p><p>It's a game of pleasurable/maddening occult surprises. For example, I was spared death at the claws of an AOE-slopping boss monster by a teleport trap, which whisked me off to a room stocked with green herbs. Thankfully, these do exactly what you're expecting. For people who can't get enough of that old-timey survival horror, there's also a hub environment with proper tank controls.</p>
<p>House Of Necrosis is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005870/House_of_Necrosis/">out now on Steam</a>, still has a demo at the time of writing, and seems jolly, going by the early user reviews. I did enjoy my brief time with the Foul Devourer, though I feel like the game's devout 32-bit murkiness may wear out its welcome, next to the crisper anime stylings of regular Mystery Dungeon. Shame it doesn't appear to be Steam Deck Verified - this feels like it would make a fine portable play. You can also find developer Warkus on <a href="https://warrrkus.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> - they're certainly fond of fifth generation consoles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-the-iphone%E2%80%AF17-amazon-is-offloading-the-new-pixel%E2%80%AF10-for-2x-cheaper-this-prime-day.1318492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The new Google Pixel 10 just landed, and if you’ve been eyeing a phone that can keep up with your daily chaos while delivering pro-level photos without the pro-level hassle, this deal is hard to ignore. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4585/">just dropped the price of the 128GB model to $649 for Prime members, down from $799</a>. That’s a rare discount on a flagship device that literally came out weeks ago and is already going toe-to-toe with the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4585/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the Pixel 10 is Different</h2>
<p>The <strong>6.3-inch Actua display is a major strength</strong>: With a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, you actually get to see what’s on your display when you’re outdoors under direct sunlight, no longer squinting or covering the phone with your hand to view a text message. The display is covered by Corning’s scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the phone boasts an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.</p>
<p>The camera system is where Google shows off: That improved triple rear camera array now boasts a 5x telephoto lens, driving its Super Res Zoom to a whopping 20x, so you can snap clear, sharp shots of your child’s soccer goal from across the sideline, for example, or of that street musician across the courtyard without your picture ending up a grainy mess. Night Sight, meanwhile, still wows by delivering clean, clear images even when lighting is awful, say, indoors at a poorly lit restaurant or after a sunset walk. A new feature called <em>Camera Coach</em> also provides real-time advice to assist with nailing your composition and exposures so it’s not a guessing game of being on manual mode nor pure auto mode.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life sits at 24-plus hours</strong> on a single charge with fast-charging support, so you’re not tethered to an outlet by mid-afternoon. This is an unlocked Android phone, giving you full freedom to switch carriers whenever you want and choose your own data plan. It works seamlessly with Google Fi, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and other major carriers, so you’re not locked into one ecosystem or stuck with a device that only plays nice with a single network.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini AI integration is where the Pixel 10 moves ahead of the pack</strong>. Instead of having to type out every question or task, you’re free to speak naturally via Gemini Live. Point your camera at something interesting, like an unknown plant on a hike or a sea creature at the aquarium, and Gemini will identify it and give you context. You’re also free to chat with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, compose an email, schedule your day, or have things done across multiple apps without having to manually switch between each one. It’s an assistant kind of feature that is useful as opposed to gimmicky.</p>
<p>This obsidian version of the 128GB model is just offered at this market for Prime members during the Prime Big Deal Days, and as new as the Pixel 10 is, a discount like this is rare. Make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-is-offloading-the-delta-2-amazon-lists-the-1800w-power-station-at-its-lowest-price-ever-2000632497</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-is-offloading-the-delta%E2%80%AF2-amazon-lists-the-1800w-power-station-at-its-lowest-price-ever.1318486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages don’t send you a warning text before they strike and the last thing you want is to be scrambling in the dark wondering how long your fridge will stay cold or how you’ll charge your phone. That’s exactly why portable power stations have become essential backup gear for people who want peace of mind during emergencies, camping trips or off-grid adventures.</p>
<p>EcoFlow initially kicked off Prime Day with their Delta 2 priced at $449 for this 1800W portable power station, but then Jackery dropped their 1500W model to $349. EcoFlow responded by matching that price, even though their unit delivers more power. Right now, exclusively for Prime members during Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">you can grab this EcoFlow Delta 2 beast for $349, down from its original $699 price tag</a>. This<strong> marks an all-time low for an 1800W portable power station</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lightning-Charge That Outpaces Other Brands</h2>
<p>The <strong>1800W continuous output</strong> is where things get really practical: This power station is capable of powering your fridge, microwave, coffee maker, portable air conditioner, power tools and just about any household appliance you’d want to run during an outage. With <strong>15 varying outlets built across the unit</strong>, you don’t have to worry about running multiple devices simultaneously by playing musical chairs with your electronics. There are six AC outlets for standard plugs, two 100W USB-C for laptops and tablets to be quickly charged, several USB-A for phones and smaller devices and DC outlets for your 12V devices.</p>



<p>The <strong>capacity sits at 1024Wh thanks to a LiFePO4 battery</strong>&nbsp;which is chemistry shorthand for lithium iron phosphate. This battery type is tougher and safer than standard lithium-ion batteries you find in cheaper units. More importantly, it <strong>can handle over 3000 charge cycles</strong> before capacity starts dropping, which translates to roughly six times longer lifespan than older battery technology. You could charge and drain this thing once per week for over 50 years before hitting that 3000-cycle mark.</p>
<p>The game-changer here is the charging speed: The Delta 2 goes <strong>from</strong> <strong>completely dead to 80% charged in just 50 minutes</strong> using a standard wall outlet, and hits 100% in 80 minutes. That’s seven times faster than most portable power stations on the market. This rapid charging capability means you can quickly juice up before heading out on a weekend camping trip or get your backup power ready in a hurry when storm warnings hit your area.</p>



<p>What sweetens the pot even more is expandable capacity: The base unit offers 1kWh of storage, but additional battery packs can be added to triple it to 3kWh. The modular configuration means you start small but expand your system as needed, ideal for serious RV owners or individuals outfitting off-grid systems. The ability to charge by solar adds even more independence. The Delta 2 takes a whopping 500W of solar panel (sold separately) input so it stays topped off during longer camping forays or serve as a truly renewable backup at home.</p>
<p>For $349, you’re getting a high-end 1800W portable power unit for less money than many companies are asking for their mid-range 1000W models. Make sure you don’t miss that Prime Day deal.</p>

<p>Better late than never</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>More than five years after its initial console release, the retro FPS title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ion_fury">Ion Fury</a> is finally getting its DLC expansion later this month.</p>
<p>Titled <strong>Ion Fury: Aftershock</strong>, the expansion was originally launched in October 2023 for PC, so it's been pretty much two whole years of waiting for console owners to receive the same treatment. Heck, a full sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phantom_fury">Phantom Fury</a>, has even launched in the interim.</p>

<p>Better late than never though, right? Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Uncharted Territories, Higher Stakes:</strong> Ignite the Fury with a gripping new campaign. Traverse 15 freshly-designed levels teeming with lurking adversaries.<br>
<strong><br>
Fresh Faces of Evil:</strong> Heskel’s been busy. Meet his new lineup of augmented monstrosities itching for a fight.<br>
<strong><br>
Packing More Heat:</strong> Enhance your firepower with new weapons and tools.<br>
<strong><br>
Push Your Limits:</strong> Challenge your skills with the grueling new Angel of Death difficulty level.<br>
<strong><br>
Ride On:</strong> Find out what a rotorcycle is and engage in white-knuckle vehicular combat.<br>
<strong><br>
Old, Yet New:</strong> Immerse yourself in Arrange mode for a fresh new take on all 28 levels from the original 2019 campaign, featuring new areas, new enemy encounters, and more.<br>
<strong><br>
Packed With Content:</strong> Engage in a total of 43 additional levels of sheer mayhem. See Ion Fury through a whole new lens.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Our review for Ion Fury back in 2020 described it as the "time-travelling love letter from the past you’ve been waiting for", praising its challenging combat and intricately designed levels, but noting that the boss battles were uninspired, ultimately awarding it a score of 7/10.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-15m-players</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/free-to-play-skate-reboot-racks-up-15m-players-in-under-a-month.1318453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that its&nbsp;free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot has hit a major player count milestone less than a month after launching across PC and consoles in Early Access.</p>

<p><em>Skate&nbsp;</em>launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-early-access-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">back in mid-September</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1975229570807890000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a> by the game's development team, it's managed to attract 15 million players since that time. That figure naturally includes all of the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is available, but EA doesn't say which of those is most popular, sadly.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that, as with any "player number"-style announcements, this isn't a sales figure; since&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is free at the point of entry, players can just jump in for ten minutes, decide they've had enough, and check out, and EA would still presumably count those players as part of the 15 million figure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-reboot-15m-players-diving.jpg?itok=d_TpdO-F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-reboot-15m-players-diving.jpg?itok=PuL1YWWX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skate&nbsp;</em>appears to be pretty popular, if its player count is anything to go by.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it is fair to say that&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>appears to be scratching an itch that hasn't been scratched for a long time. At time of writing, the game has around <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3354750/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">23,000 active players</a> on Steam, with a 24-hour high of about 57,000. Clearly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">the fact you can't play</a>&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>offline isn't turning people off.</p>

<p>As EA points out in the aforementioned social media post,&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is about to embark on its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-season-1-new-stuff" rel="nofollow">first post-launch season</a>, which will introduce new seasonal events and challenges to the game, as well as a raft of new cosmetics to unlock.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>, it's the latest game in EA's&nbsp;skateboarding series of the same name. Unlike its predecessors, the latest&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>isn't a boxed premium product; it's a free-to-play experience with all of the usual trappings, so you can expect battle passes, cosmetic unlocks, and microtransactions galore.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in EA-related news, it was recently revealed that the veteran publisher is being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">purchased by a consortium of different firms</a>, among them the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund and a company owned by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/skate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate-game-preview/9PHF9K5Q6ZLZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and if you want to know what we thought of it, you can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skate-is-return-to-form-but-will-audience-be-there-to-support-it" rel="nofollow">preview right here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-brings-new-story-and-more-next-month.1318450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed the Valley of Memory update for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>, and it's bringing a ton of new story and gameplay stuff next month.</p>

<p>The update, which will be arriving across all platforms on November 18th, was revealed during a livestream in which Ubisoft delved deep into what we can expect from it. You can expect a brand new region to explore, new side quests and contracts, and lots more.</p>

<p>Valley of Memory will take place just before the main game's finale, and it revolves around Basim learning that his father may still be alive in the valley of AlUla, upon which he sets out to discover whether there's any truth to that rumor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-swinging.jpg?itok=v3OLauJk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-swinging.jpg?itok=AjzIo3mA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>'s free Valley of Memory update should give you plenty of reason to revisit it next month.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you can expect a brand new series of main missions in Valley of Memory, as well as new assassination targets to take down. Ubisoft is also promising parkour challenges that will reward you with music sheets, allowing Basim to play the songs he's discovered on the oud.</p>

<p>Rather excitingly, the studio is also teasing "a unique twist on&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s classic black box missions" in Valley of Memory. Given that&nbsp;<em>Mirage&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-reveals-return-to-roots-trailer-featuring-gameplay-developer" rel="nofollow">originally touted</a> as a return to old-school&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>, that's particularly tantalizing for me.</p>

<p>Valley of Memory will also bring a number of enhancements to the base game, including new parkour moves, replayable missions, and new skill and tool customization options, among other things.</p>

<p>While Ubisoft hasn't publicly confirmed this, it's very likely that Valley of Memory is the DLC that was first mooted back in January, when it was also suggested that the Saudi PIF (which is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">one of the firms</a> chipping in to buy EA) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">would fund the update</a>.</p>




<p>In any case, the Valley of Memory update for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>will launch on November 18th for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, and you can play the game on all of those platforms right now as well. Be sure to give our Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-it-feels-so-good-to-be-back" rel="nofollow">review a read</a> if you want to remind yourself what he thought of the game!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When you’re upgrading your storage, you also need to take care of speed and reliability. You don’t just want to add more space; you want something that doesn’t slow you down even when dealing with heavier files. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/">The Samsung 990 Evo Pro SSD does a great job at that, and the 1TB model can be yours for less this Prime Day.</a></p>
<p>We’ve often seen it go for $70 – a $35 discount – but, right now, it’s dropped even further to just $60 on Amazon, marking a steep 43% off. This is one of the best prices we’ve ever seen on this drive, and it’s available for both Prime and non-Prime members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Capacity, Exceptional Speeds</h2>
<p>The 1TB capacity is more than enough to store all your essentials and then some. Think a ton of high-resolution photos, all your favorite videos, a bunch of movies, and even a few TV series to watch on the go when you don’t have a stable internet connection. There’s also a 2TB and 4TB version of this drive available, but we think the 1TB capacity should be enough for most work professionals and creatives out there.</p>
<p>Speed-wise, you’re looking at up to 7,250 MB/s read and 6,300 MB/s write speeds – ideal for large files and heavier apps. You can expect instant boot times and ultra-fast transfers that keep you productive without any slowdowns. Even the basic day-to-day tasks get a significant boost!</p>



<p>The SSD supports PCIe Gen 4×4, with forward compatibility for Gen 5×2, so it’s going to support all your future upgrades just as well. Magician Software keeps everything optimized and up-to-date, plus you will enjoy features like drive health monitoring and extra encryption in one place. And even with all this, you really don’t have to worry about overheating and battery life. There’s an efficiency-boosting nickel-coated controller that ensures it uses less power while still delivering excellent performance under pressure.</p>
<p>Installation is pretty straightforward. Just pop it into any compatible M.2 2280 slot, and you’re good to go. All in all, this is an efficient upgrade that gets you both solid storage and exceptional speeds.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/"> This Prime Day makes it possible to grab it for just $60, down from $105. For more capacity, you can consider getting the 2TB or the 4TB version.</a> Just note that the discount is only around for a short time, so it’s better to hurry.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-curvx-with-22000-pa-suction-and-ai-obstacle-recognition-is-600-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-2000632479</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-curvx-with-22-000%E2%80%AFpa-suction-and-ai-obstacle-recognition-is-600-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock.1318438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums promise to handle your cleaning chores automatically but most fall short in frustrating ways. They get stuck on furniture, miss obvious dirt patches, tangle on cables or require constant babysitting that defeats their entire purpose. The <strong>Roborock Qrevo CurvX</strong> sits comfortably in our top three favorite robot vacuums because it actually delivers on the promise of true hands-off cleaning.</p>
<p>Yes, the standard $1,499 price tag is steep but this is one of the rare models that really replaces you rather than just assisting. It cleans to perfection, navigates your home intelligently and handles the messiest scenarios without complaint or intervention. Right now during Prime Big Deal Days, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4581/">Prime members on Amazon can grab it for $899, down from that $1,499 list price</a>. This <strong>40 percent discount</strong> represents an all-time low and makes premium robotic cleaning accessible at a price point where the investment actually makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4581/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How Qrevo CurvX Addresses Day-to-Day Cleaning Needs</h2>
<p>The <strong>22,000Pa HyperForce suction is among the strongest available in a robot vacuum</strong>, and it directly equates to cleaning performance you can see. Pet hair and debris trapped deep down in carpet fibers are cleaned thoroughly instead of being surface-swept. Areas of floor and grout lines where dirt tends to build up aren’t glossed over.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dual Anti-Tangle system</strong> of Roborock eliminates one of the leading failure modes of robot vacuums. Pet fur and human hair as long as 40 centimeters are dealt with by the system not wrapping around the brush roller and forming a knotted mess, which causes a halt to the vacuum mid-cycle. It is a huge issue if your family members are long-haired or if your pets shed, as other robot vacuums must be continually manually corrected by cutting hair off of the brush by hand.</p>



<p>Coming in at a mere 7.98 centimeters / 3.14 inches in height, <strong>the Qrevo CurvX is also the thinnest Roborock model yet</strong>. Its ultra-low profile gives it a way to slide under couches, beds, and cupboards where dust bunnies are a fact of life and regular vacuums are unable to reach.</p>
<p>The AdaptiLift Chassis represents genuine innovation in robot vacuum design. Roborock pioneered this technology as the first manufacturer to mass-produce a robot vacuum with a liftable chassis system featuring three-wheel control, launching in Q3 2024. The<strong> chassis can lift up to 4 centimeters to clear high thresholds between rooms</strong> or it can adjust individual sections independently to navigate around furniture legs and uneven surfaces.</p>



<p>Reactive AI obstacle detection employs structured light sensors and an RGB camera for <strong>detecting and evading 108 types of objects</strong>. It can work during bright sunlight and complete darkness, its sensors navigating it to safely navigate around objects such as shoes, cords, pet toys, etc., without your pre-cleaning your floors.</p>
<p>The <strong>mopping function uses 80°C warm water to clean its own mop pads</strong> and looses grease and embedded dirt deposited by cold water. It keeps your mop clean and actually cleans your floors rather than spreading dirty water. The Thermo+, <strong>Multifunction Dock 3.0 does it all for zero cost</strong>, automatically: cleaning your mop with warm water, drying off at 113°F to prevent mildew, emptying your dustbin, refilling your water tank, and even cleaning itself with warm water.</p>
<p>At $899 for Prime members, the Qrevo CurvX really provides professional-grade auto cleaning. It’s definitely one of our favorite ones.</p>

              <p>Here it is, folks. Prime Big Deals Day is upon us finally. October 7 and October 8, you can save big across almost every product category on Amazon. The giant online retailer has sales on PC gaming parts, Bluetooth speakers, and even cameras. The DJI Osmo Action 4 has three different bundles which are each seeing sales. Right now, you can save as much as 23%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Let’s break down each bundle. The essential combo is the most barebones of the three. It includes the Osmo action 4 camera alongside a horizontal-vertical protective frame, a locking screw, lens hood, battery, quick release adapter mount, anti-slip pad, and a USB-C cable for charging and data transfer. This essential combo is usually $289, but has come down to $219 for the sale.</p>

<p>Next we have the standard combo. This includes everything you get with the essential set plus an adhesive curved base mount to pair with the quick release adapter mount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/">This set was $299, but has dropped to just $229.</a></p>
<p>Lastly, the adventure combo features all of that and you also get two more batteries so you always have a charged spare at the ready, a multi-functional battery case, a 1.5-meter extension rod or selfie stick as they are colloquially known, and a extra quick-release adapter mount except this one is mini. Normally priced at $399, the adventure combo is now down to just $327.</p>



<h2>Why DJI?</h2>
<p>GoPro is no longer the only name in the action camera business.&nbsp;The DJI Osmo Action 4 produces premium image quality with low-light clarity thanks to the 1/1.3-inch sensor. Capture every detail from dawn to dusk in stunning 4K resolution at 120 frames per second. The high framerate means you can render slow-motion shots without losing detail.</p>
<p>The ultrawide FOV keeps every bit of action in view whether you’re rushing down the side of a mountain on a snowboard or riding waved on water skis. The DJI Osmo Action 4 employs three different stabilization modes to ensure steady footage across rugged terrains of all kind. HorzionSteady is a DJI feature which keeps the horizon of your shots flat and level at all times.</p>
<p>The frame that comes with each of the bundles has a magnetic quick-release. The camera can be shot either in portrait or landscape so you can swap easily on the fly between the two while shooting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/">If you’re looking for a big opportunity to save of some cool gadget to take on your next trip, consider saving yourself up to $72 on the DJI Osmo 4 action camera.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-is-quietly-offloading-its-mini-4k-drones-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-price-on-amazon.1318429/</guid>

              <p>Getting into aerial photography used to mean dealing with FAA registration paperwork, fees and regulatory headaches. DJI changed that equation with the Mini series, and the Mini 4K sits right at 249 grams, j<strong>ust under the 250-gram threshold that triggers FAA registration requirements</strong> for recreational use in the United States. This weight advantage has made it one of DJI’s best-selling drones, and gives casual users the freedom to fly without bureaucratic barriers.</p>
<p>Right now during Prime Big Deal Days, Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/">can snag this drone for an unprecedented $239, down from its usual $299 price</a>. This is<strong> an all-time low for a drone that shoots genuine 4K Ultra HD video</strong> with professional stabilization.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Results in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD camera captures video at 3840 x 2160 resolution</strong> which means you’re getting four times the detail of standard 1080p footage. This resolution matters when you want to crop or zoom into your footage during editing without losing quality, or when you’re capturing landscapes where fine details like distant mountains or intricate coastlines make the shot. The camera performs across different lighting conditions and handles everything from <strong>golden hour sunrises to moody sunset scenes</strong> and even challenging night environments.</p>
<p>What differentiates the Mini 4K from cheaper drones is its <strong>mechanical 3-axis gimbal stabilization</strong>. While electronic image stabilization on a lot of budget-priced drones crops into the scene and still shows jitter, a mechanical gimbal truly compensates for motion by physically balancing it on three axes: tilt, roll, and pan. That guarantees your video stays smooth even when your drone encounters a puff of wind or a sharp directional change.</p>



<p>Flight performance is formidable with<strong> Level 5 wind resistance, i.e., wind speeds of up to 38 kilometers per hour</strong> (around 24 miles per hour). Brushless motors provide the horsepower needed for stable flight at these speeds, and they are also more efficient and longer-lasting than the brushed motors found in toy-grade quadcopters. The same motors enable the Mini 4K to <strong>lift off at altitudes of up to 4,000 meters (around 13,100 feet)</strong> which opens mountain and high-altitude shooting potentia.</p>
<p><strong>10-kilometer video transmission distance</strong> gives you tremendous mobility to roam about and position shots. For all intents and purposes, you rarely take advantage of this limit due to line-of-sight limitations and battery life yet having that longer distance as a minimum guarantee ensures your operator gets a rock-solid connection with no dropouts or pixelation even if flying a few kilometers off.</p>



<p>Battery life provides <strong>31 minutes of best-in-class flight time</strong> per single supplied battery, although real-world flying with camera recording usually enabled normally produces about 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Safety features make Mini 4K accessible to total newcomers. <strong>GPS Return to Home returns the drone to its starting point if it runs low on battery</strong>, loses signal, or if you initiate a return yourself. One-tap takeoff/landing eliminates stress of manual throttle management during most critical flight stages.</p>
<p>Coming in at $239 for Prime members during Prime Day, the DJI Mini 4K offers true 4K quality, mechanical stabilization and intelligent modes at a price low enough to make aerial creativity accessible. It slashes its drone to an all-time-low during this Prime Big Deal Days sale, and it’s a great way to start your journey into aerial photography.</p>
