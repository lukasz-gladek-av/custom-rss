		<p>NetEase’s spin-off from Bungie’s Destiny universe has launched today on mobile and PC. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-rising/">Destiny: Rising</a> is a brand new game set in an alternate universe to the main Bungie titles but retains everything that makes the series popular.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny: Rising | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3JJKAc-C8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>I have been playing the game for a couple of hours using the Mumu emulator for PC –<a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/"> something NetEase actively encourages</a> –&nbsp; and I have to say it’s rather good. It’s Destiny, but all brand new. New characters,. supers, weapons, locations, missions, basically everything everyone has been screaming at Bungie to add to Destiny 2. The only major difference so far is you have two weapons rather than three.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a full report on the game when I have played some more and have reached any monetisation barriers.</p>
<p>The alternate timeline is set in a period way before the setting familiar to those who have played the main Destiny Games, dated before the Last City has been built. Players take control of various characters from a roster that will keep growing, but they will not be based on the classes of Hunter, Titan, and Warlock. Instead the characters have their own abilities. Some of the characters players will get to use include Ikora Rey, Iron Lord Jolder, and Kabr. The main protagonist is a character called Wolf that players can&nbsp; to customise.</p>

<p>The first Season, named Daybreak, will be launching “soon”, no exact date has been given.</p>
<p>The recommended specs and devices include:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Android Devices:</u>&nbsp;Snapdragon 845 or newer</li>
<li><u>iPhone:</u>&nbsp;iPhone 8 or newer</li>
<li><u>iPads:&nbsp;</u></li>
<li>iPad (8th generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro (10.5-inch)（2017） or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro (11-inch, 1st generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad mini (5th generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Air (3rd generation) or newer</li>
</ul>
<p>Or you can just fire up the <a href="https://www.mumuplayer.com/">Mumu emulator</a> and play it on your PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-hp-laptop-with-office-365-is-cheaper-than-buying-office-alone-amazon-clears-out-stock-for-labor-day.1282818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It doesn’t often happen that Amazon’s best-sellers list puts a budget Windows laptop next to high-end MacBook Airs, but that’s what’s happening right now. There’s an HP 14-inch model (Intel Celeron N4020, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB Storage) that has quietly become a serious player on the platform as one of the best-selling laptops on the site, and the reason why is simple: it’s awfully cheap.</p>
<p>With the ongoing Labor Day sale, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/">you can get it for $172 down from its usual $230</a>. At that price, it’s one of the cheapest brand-new laptops you’ll find anywhere, and it’s less than some headphones or tablets.&nbsp;The deal becomes even harder to pass up when you factor in it also <strong>includes a one-year subscription to Microsoft 365</strong> which alone usually costs $129 (per year). And since that comes bundled for free, you’re essentially paying close to the value of the software and getting a full-sized laptop in exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Buy It</h2>
<p>The screen itself is a 14-inch HD micro-edge bezel panel that boasts a slim design that doesn’t scream “budget.” It’s not too small for Netflix sessions or working on documents, and its size sits comfortably in the sweet spot between being travel-friendly and being productive. The laptop is also easy to carry around thanks to a thin build and light weight which is convenient if you’re going to class or a local coffee shop.</p>
<p>The machine runs on <strong>Intel’s Celeron N4020 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage</strong>. It’s not built for heavy creative projects or gaming, but that isn’t what this computer is meant for. Instead, it’s built to give you coverage for normal things such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, email or Zoom meetings. The storage might feel tight compared to higher-end models, but remember—Microsoft 365 allows you to access OneDrive cloud storage which means you can keep your most important files online and free up space on the device.</p>



<p>Battery life is always something to watch out for with cheaper laptops, but HP has managed to keep it respectable here: You’ll have hours of use out of one charge, which should be <strong>sufficient to get you through a school day</strong> or long study session. Add in <strong>preinstalled Windows 11 Home</strong>, and you’re receiving the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system with periodic updates, all for the cheap price.</p>
<p>At $172, this HP laptop is precariously close to “why not?” territory.</p>

                <p>Activision has brought Call of Duty: World War II back to the Microsoft Store and Xbox PC App after it was removed more than a month ago, though the company has still not said a word about what happened.</p><p>A statement released on August 27 confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1960760388221640812" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 2017 game has returned</a>, and is once again available for PC Game Pass players. However, there was no explanation as to anything else related to the game's removal on July 4. At the time, Activision said it pulled the game to investigate "an issue."</p><p>While Activision never confirmed what happened, fans believe they worked it out. Call of Duty: WWII was reportedly overrun with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-wwiis-game-pass-pc-version-was-pulled-reportedly-after-hacking-issues/1100-6532997/" data-ref-id="1100-6532997">Remote Code Execution attacks</a> that had players losing control of their PCs via a security exploit. A similar attack happened to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-servers-shutdown-after-exploit-allows-attackers-to-access-players-pc/1100-6499889/">Dark Souls 3 back in 2022</a>, which led to the entire trilogy being taken offline while the security issue was addressed.</p><p>Activision makes a point to not discuss Call of Duty security issues, saying that disclosing information about its security protocols would only help bad actors get a leg up to create new workarounds and exploits. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-rampant-cheating-activision-finally-responds/1100-6528903/" data-ref-id="1100-6528903">fight against cheaters and hackers is never-ending</a>, Activision has said.</p><p>The issue with Call of Duty: WWII was specific to the PC edition; the Xbox version on Game Pass was never removed after it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-adds-this-underrated-call-of-duty-game-today/1100-6532845/" data-ref-id="1100-6532845">launched into Game Pass at the end of June.</a></p><p>Call of Duty: WWII was developed by Sledgehammer Games and was notable at the time in part for being the first fully WWII-set Call of Duty game since 2008's Call of Duty: World at War. Some of its most memorable missions including the Saving Private Ryan-like D-Day opening sequence and a mission where you go undercover in a German building in Paris featuring some tense moments.</p><p>You play as Ronald "Red" Daniels, with supporting squadmates including soldiers voiced by people like Josh Duhamel, Jeffrey Pierce, Jonathan Tucker, and Brett Zimmerman. The campaign's intensity is ramped up by the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ww2-ditching-health-regen-has-some-fo/1100-6449627/" data-ref-id="1100-6449627">there is no automatic health regeneration.</a></p><p>The next Call of Duty game, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>. Activision recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">canceled the game's Carry Forward program</a>, meaning operators and skins from Black Ops 6 will not be available in Black Ops 7. Activision also acknowledged the fan feedback that <a href="https://google.com/search?q=activision+acknoowledges+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=activision+acknoowledges+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABjvBTIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIKCAQQABiiBBiJBTIKCAUQABiABBiiBDIGCAYQRRhA0gEINTMxMWowajmoAgawAgHxBUiXjwJeshBt&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty has strayed from its identity</a> as a military shooter. Many took this to be a reference to the franchise's wacky skins, but the company did not mention this outright.</p>

<p>Some are pretty obvious, like the short challenge level that's basically a recreation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, but others take a little more time and patience to notice. For example, you might be so busy smashing up the environment to even clock on that Pauline's idle animation actually changes throughout the game.</p>
<p>We mentioned this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">our review</a>, but it's such a small little detail and it can easily be missed if you're too busy having fun. Essentially, though, as Pauline gets more comfortable in the presence of Donkey Kong, her mood will begin to lighten. So she'll go from looking worried to playfully ruffling DK's fur, and even going so far as to tickle him. It's adorable!</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4gxpvsi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1960742460008591862">Supper Mario Broth</a>, the social media channel known for posting obscure Nintendo facts, showcases it wonderfully in the below video:</p>

<p>It just goes to show the care and attention that Nintendo gives to its creations, lending real authenticity to DK and Pauline's growing friendship throughout the game.</p>
<p>In other news, latest figures from the US indicate that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/donkey-kong-bananza-is-selling-like-bananas-on-switch-2-us">Bananza has sold incredibly well in the region</a>, reaching number three in the list of best-selling games during July 2025; a feat made more impressive when you consider that Nintendo doesn't share digital sales.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>S-Game's Phantom Blade Zero made more than a few heads turn when it was revealed back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/">2023</a> with its haunting dark setting and intense action gameplay. The game looked so nice that many believed the trailer wasn't a proper representation of the experience, myself included, but every doubt I had about what looked like yet another soulslike were completely squashed last year when I had the chance to try out a few slices of the game during <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/">Gamescom 2024 </a>focused on extremely satisfying combat and action gameplay whose best qualities managed to shine through even in a version of the game that was clearly rather far from release. And although I felt combat was great, I couldn't help but wonder how the rest of the experience would shape up.</p>



<p>An answer to this question arrived during this year's Gamescom, when I was given the chance to try out two different demos of the action game in development by S-Game. Both demos, an earlier demo available during a press-only event held by NVIDIA one day before Gamescom began, and the one that attendees could try out themselves after braving some of the longest lines I have seen during the show, featured more of the incredible combat showcased in the game's first public demo, but also exploration and traversal to round up the experience.</p>



<p>In this regard, it definitely feels like Phantom Blade Zero will deliver as much as it does for combat. Both locations, with a clear eastern feel, sported an intricate linear design with tons of different paths where items and optional enemies could be found, alongside some NPCs who provided some additional information on the current state of things. Exploring these locations completely will require players to take advantage of Soul's impressive agility and some tools, which feel great to use thanks to the incredible animation work based on motion capture. Better yet, using all of Soul's traversal abilities and tools feels incredibly intuitive to use, making exploration as engaging as combat.</p>

<p>Although I already have found the game's combat incredibly engaging without being unfairly challenging last year, I couldn't help but notice how Phantom Blade Zero has been significantly improved in this regard since last year. The final game will feature a vast selection of weapons, and although only a small portion of them were available in the Gamescom demo, it was easy to tell how much care S-Game is putting into making each one better suited for different playstyles and enemies. Secondary weapons, for example, range from long-range weapons to heavier hitting melee weapons, and the ability to switch between two different main and secondary weapons on the fly not only allows for plenty of flexibility, but it's an actual game mechanic that players should use to extend their combos as much as possible once an enemy is left staggering after depleting some sort of posture gauge with attacks and proper parries. As such, fighting enemies is downright satisfying, as the game requires alternating between different offensive and defensive like in the best character-action games, but without being extremely punishing in the vein of games like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, at least at normal difficulty.</p>



<p>The highlight of the Phantom Blade Zero Gamescom 2025 demo were, unsurprisingly, the boss battles. The fight against the massive Wan Jun was intense but easily manageable after a few tries, especially once I had a better grasp of the many abilities at Soul's disposal, which require resources to further extend combos performed by alternating light and heavy attacks. The fight against the Disciples of the Seven Stars was similarly easily manageable after a few tries, but it was considerably more stunning to experience, thanks to the aforementioned amazing animation work and combat design, which provides Soul with all the tools to deal with multiple enemies at once in spectacular fashion.</p>



<p>Speaking with an S-Game representative during my playthrough of the Phantom Blade Zero, the game has been defined as a Soulslite, which I have found to be an apt description of a game that takes the best features of modern action games and action role-playing games to offer an intense experience that is as pleasing to the eye as it is incredibly fun to play. Thankfully, we may not have to wait much longer to learn when Phantom Blade Zero will launch on PC and consoles, as I have been told a release date will be announced soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netmarble has announced the release date for upcoming anime action RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive</em>, which, contrary to what you might think from the title, is not the same game as mobile gacha RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>.</p>

<p>First revealed during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Xbox showcase back in June</a>,&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC on November 17th, with a current-gen console version due to follow sometime next year (although not for Switch 2, unfortunately).</p>

<p>Despite what the name might have you believe,&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>has nothing to do with&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>; Netmarble says it's an "entirely different game, developed as an independent project by a separate team".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date-steps.jpg?itok=IZY8clYy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date-steps.jpg?itok=XljdX6pU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to come to PC in November.</figcaption></figure><p>It sounds like <i>Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</i>won't be a gacha game, either; according to development producer Kim Gwang-Hoon, there will be no "randomness when recruiting Hunters or crafting weapons", allowing players to "feel a true sense of achievement" through "effort and strategy".</p>

<p>You'll also be able to use boss materials in order to craft weapons, so there won't be any kind of gacha mechanic for obtaining those materials or for crafting the gear you can get from them either, it seems.</p>

<p>You can also expect sharper controls than&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>, as well as higher-fidelity backgrounds that Kim Gwang-Hoon says will "bridge the gap between comic and realism". The backgrounds are still based on the original&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling&nbsp;</em>webtoon, though, so you'll recognize them if you're a fan.</p>

<p>If you want to see&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>in action, then you can check out Netmarble's new release date trailer for the game right here.</p>




<p><em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373990/Solo_Leveling_ARISE_OVERDRIVE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive/9MVHCQ7CJX01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox app</a> on November 17th. A version of the game is also due for release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2026, so stay tuned for more on that.</p>

            <p>You know when you're friends with three people, then one of them suddenly pulls a Robbie Rotten and morphs into a real villain who terrorises your existence? No? Just me then, and also the protagonist of Ken Levine's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, whose main foe you'll get to dictate the identity of through your actions in the game.</p>
<p>It happens via a villainy system, which Levine and the crew at Ghost Story Games discuss in the first ever Judas dev log they've just put out. We've only seen this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-was-basically-a-corridor-says-ken-levine-judas-wont-be-and-characters-will-have-long-memories">non-corridory</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a>-like with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judas-has-reactive-difficulty-evil-dentist-chairs-and-a-giant-robot-dog-for-fast-travel">evil dentist chairs</a> and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judas-latest-gameplay-still-looks-a-lot-like-a-sci-fi-bioshock-now-with-evil-brum-and-a-robot-chef">evil Brum</a> in spits and spurts since the announcement in 2022. This looks to the first sign of more regular updates in the offing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We'd already heard a bit about the 'big three', a trio of key characters who'll be key to your adventures aboard the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. In this <a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-1">dev log</a>, Levine and co reveal that they've got some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> nemesis system-inspired stuff going on.</p>
<p>Basically, rather than having a traditional baddie who's nailed on as being your foil from the get go - à la BioShock's Frank Fontaine - you'll start off as mates with the big three. How you play the game and the choices you make'll influence how much they like you, leading to one eventually deciding they're no longer your mate and becoming the game's villain. Or, as Levine puts it:</p>
<blockquote>In Judas, you're going to get to know these characters intimately. We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you've got to decide who you trust and who you don't.</blockquote>
<p>He also adds that the trio will judge you as you play, including "how you approach combat, hacking, and crafting". No, please, don't hate me just because I'm shite at resource management and keep running away from fights like a coward, Judasers! Whichever of them ends up being en-baddieised gets "a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals", with the example given being a character called Tom turning previously recruitable sheriff bots against you.</p><p>It sounds like it could be cool, but I worry players who've tried their best to keep all three happy will find it incongruent when one of them turns bad, because the game's reached the point when it's decided it needs a baddie in place. Or, conversely, be railroaded into setting off a villain arc in a manner that might feel forced. There's also the matter of whether a baddie whose very baddieness relies on responding to player actions will be able to muster motivations and personality traits as in-depth as a character who's built to be a baddie from the ground up. To me, there's potentially a danger of blunting the story a bit in favour of making it more reactive, something that can be to a game's detriment.</p>
<p>I'm interested to see how Judas tackles all of that. As of this dev log, it's still got no release date, with Levine explaining the team don't want to reveal one just to have to change it later. There's at least some key art by American movie poster artist Drew Struzan to stare at while we wait.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-slashes-all-its-margin-on-the-new-macbook-air-now-cheaper-than-an-average-laptop.1282782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the past few years, Apple hasn’t really been hiking prices – in fact, in some cases it’s been doing the opposite. The MacBook Air is a perfect example, and it got more affordable since Apple introduced its own chips. What was once a laptop that never, ever went on sale is now showing up more and more in big Amazon sales.</p>
<p>This Labor Day, it takes it to the next level with the brand-new 2025 MacBook Air falling to an all-time low. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">13-inch version with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage falls to $799, from a full $200 off its normal $999</a>. The higher-end ones with bigger storage and RAM are also heavily discounted but this model is the one that’s technically fallen to an all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Laptop</h2>
<p>The MacBook Air’s draw has always been combining power, portability and battery life, but <strong>the 2025 version does it even better thanks to the new M4 chip within</strong>. The processor is designed with Apple Intelligence in mind so it’s <strong>optimized to handle future AI features</strong> that will be introduced across macOS and the remainder of Apple’s platform. More importantly for day-to-day use, the M4 makes every task faster and smoother: If you’re looking for a laptop that can manage both the basics and more demanding tasks without slowing down, this deal puts that capability within reach at an affordable price.</p>
<p>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display is still one of the best features of the MacBook Air: With its precise bright colors, sharp resolution, and broad color gamut coverage, it’s a monitor for anyone from a student to a professional. Watching movies, photo editing, or simply typing reports feels more real and comfortable on a display like this. The thin bezels give a streamlined look, and True Tone adapts the color temperature to your environment.</p>



<p>Priced at around 2.7 pounds and measuring less than half an inch, MacBook Air lives up to its name: It fits into any bag and it’s easy to tote around all day. Even with that thin design, it doesn’t cut corners on connections or sound. You still get a pair of Thunderbolt ports, a MagSafe charging port, a headphone jack and a surprisingly deep speaker system for a laptop of this thickness.</p>
<p>Apple has also raised the bar on video calling with a 12MP front camera that includes Center Stage which is a feature that ensures you’re always front and center during a call. And with studio-quality mics and improved speakers, the Macbook Air is prepared for work calls as well as family video calls. For security and ease of use, Touch ID is built into the keyboard so you can unlock the machine or confirm purchases instantly.</p>
<p>Naturally, battery life remains one of the primary points of appeal. <strong>Apple claims the new MacBook Air will last up to 18 hours on a single battery,</strong> so you can get through a full day of classes, meetings, or travel without having to plug in. That combination of power and thrift is exactly why this line has been so adored.</p>
<p>If you’d been waiting for a good reason to finally splurge on the MacBook Air, this Labor Day sale makes it an easy call.</p>

We have known this for a while, of course, but it looks like TCG fans in select regions will have to wait a little longer before they can get their hands on the upcoming creatively-titled 'Mega Evolution' set, as The Pokémon Company has announced a delay.</p>
<p>In a statement on the Pokémon TCG UK <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGUK/status/1960689456857456667">Twitter</a> account, the company revealed that the set has been "slightly delayed in EMEA markets" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), citing "challenges impacting product delivery dates".

<p>The region specification has us assuming that the expansion will still arrive in other regions as planned on <strong>26th September</strong>, but we'll be sure to keep you updated should we hear any changes.</p>
<p>Here's The Pokémon Company's full statement, followed by the initial tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to challenges impacting product delivery dates, the release of the upcoming Pokémon Trading Card Game: Mega Evolution will be slightly delayed in EMEA markets.<br>
We apologise to our fans and understand that this news may be disappointing. We are working hard alongside our logistics partners to ensure products will be available for purchase from 10th October 2025. We would like to thank our community for their continued support and patience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a reminder, the Mega Evolution set includes almost a dozen Mega Evolution ex cards and over 50 Pokémon and Trainer special illustration cards. In short, there's a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>Alongside this set, Mega Evolution will also be making its grand return in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, it'll be allowed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Pokémon Champions</a>, <em>and</em> it's arriving in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> in the Fall.

            <title><![CDATA[Crystal Dynamics Hit by Layoffs, Tomb Raider "Unaffected"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crystal-dynamics-hit-by-layoffs-tomb-raider-unaffected.1282761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>studio Crystal Dynamics has announced that it's been hit by layoffs, but the developer says that work on the next game in the aforementioned action-adventure series remains "unaffected".</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on LinkedIn, Crystal Dynamics says it has "made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of [its] talented colleagues", blaming "evolving business conditions" for the decision. The studio stops short of revealing how many employees have been let go.</p>

<p>Crystal Dynamics goes on to say that while its decision was not "made lightly", it was "necessary...to ensure the long-term health of [the] studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-layoffs.jpg?itok=a9edtL6I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-layoffs.jpg?itok=9WvQuSUE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crystal Dynamics has been hit by layoffs, but&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is "unaffected", the studio says.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Crystal Dynamics thanks its "teams, players, and partners" for helping it to "build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow". That, the studio says, "includes the future of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, which remains unaffected" by the layoffs.</p>

<p>It's been five years since Crystal Dynamics' last original game, namely 2020's&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Avengers</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvels-avengers-ending-development-support" rel="nofollow">ended service in January 2023</a>. Other than that, the studio has also worked alongside Aspyr on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-i-ii-iii-remastered" rel="nofollow">remasters</a> of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">first six</a>&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn" rel="nofollow">first two titles</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>sub-series.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series is in development, although Crystal Dynamics and publisher Amazon Games have revealed nothing about the new project yet. It's likely to be a while before we learn exactly what direction the studios intend to take with the property in future.</p>

<p>Still, even without a flagship game announcement, the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>franchise remains active. Last year, an animated series by the name of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft&nbsp;</em>debuted on Netflix, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="nofollow">live-action series is also in the works</a>.</p>




<p>Crystal Dynamics' decision to lay off employees may well be connected to the fact that in July, Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">canceled its&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, on which Crystal Dynamics was serving as a co-development studio alongside The Initiative.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> is still trying to fix up those gosh-danged Age transitions. For those just joining us, when you move between Ages in Firaxis's latest historical map-painter, it's sort of like starting over. You're asked to pick a new Civilisation, appropriate to the Age, and your units will be reshuffled, downgraded and, in some cases, deleted like rabid dogs. The game also runs a broom over the geography, rearranging all the resources. </p>
<p>It's supposed to be a pace-changer, and as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/most-civilization-players-dont-finish-a-single-game-going-by-civ-6-data-and-perhaps-thats-the-best-way-to-play">a notorious earlygame drop-out</a>, I can certainly see the logic behind that, but the feature has riled a lot of antique Civvers up. Firaxis have tweaked the Age system extensively post-launch, but many recent Steam reviews still list it as a downside. This week, they rolled out yet another patch, while detailing plans for a new approach to Age transitions that is actually "harsher" than the original. It's a bold (4X) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> (game), Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for them.
</p>
<p>A quick recap: Firaxis have previously introduced an Age transition impact setting, letting players choose between having the game gather up your units between transitions, as in the original design, and a new "continuity" option that retains their map locations. 
</p>
<p>"Continuity Mode is a nice way to allow players less disruption to their military campaigns if they like to be fighting continuously from one Age to the next," explains Ed Beach, creative director. "I don't use that setting often in my games, but I did enjoy it recently when I played a full campaign with Genghis Khan as my leader." I do love the concept of Genghis Khan's quest for world domination getting repeatedly reset by a bunch of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01916599.2024.2373542#abstract">bullshit periodisation</a>. Naughty rampaging warlords! We'll stop-start the WAAAAGH right out of you.
</p><p>Much as Beach enjoys the new setting, he feels Firaxis erred in making it the new default while hiding the previous "Regroup" option in the advanced settings. This made it easy to forget which kind of transition you have enabled. As such, the latest patch on Steam and the Epic Games Store makes your choice of Age transition setting "sticky" between campaigns, together with game speed and difficulty. 
</p>
<p>Even as they soften the workings, however, Firaxis are devising another, "harsher" version of Regroup, "a setting we are tentatively calling Collapse". There are no details as to why this is "harsher", but "Collapse" implies further unit loss and degradation, I guess. Perhaps it'll be a kind of "Dark Age" mechanic. "It's still early in testing, and we'll need time to see if it feels fun and fits well into the game," Beach says. "If it does, we'll look into when it might make sense to include it in a future update."
</p>
<p>That's not all they wrote. The <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">full patch notes for Civilization 7 update 1.2.4</a> also mention a few bug fixes, but none of these seem as momentous to my eye as the on-going Age discourse. Are you still playing? Have your feelings changed much since launch?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 is the turn of Hornet in Hollow Knight: Silksong. A new character and setting have raised questions about Hollow Knight: Silksong and its sequel or prequel status, and we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is real, Hollow Knight: Silksong is happening, and Hollow Knight: Silksong releases September 4. The original game feels like a lifetime ago. I’m grateful we’re getting Silksong at all. One of the biggest changes this time around is the main character. The Knight has been replaced by Hornet—a recurring presence throughout the OG Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>This guide is here to let you know if Hornet’s adventure is a prequel or if she’s the new face around the place.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-to-the-original-game">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong a Sequel to The Original Game?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hornet has some sting. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Cherry has declared Hollow Knight: Silksong to be a fully fledged sequel and is a brand-new story set after the events of Hollow Knight.</strong></p>



<p>You actually need to go as far back as Silksong’s reveal announcement for this answer. The original article appears to have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190408202952/http://teamcherry.com.au/hollow-knight-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">archived</a>, but on 14 Feb. 2019, Team Cherry declared that Silksong was in development and that: “<strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong is the epic sequel to Hollow Knight.</strong>“</p>



<p>So, we’ve known Silksong is a proper sequel since the beginning! Silksong started as DLC, but Team Cherry’s vision for the content quickly grew to the point that it made more sense to create a new game entirely. It explains <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why Hollow Knight: Silksong took so long to release</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-knight-appear-in-hollow-knight-silksong">Will The Knight Appear in Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<p><strong>There has been no official mention of The Knight appearing in Hollow Knight: Silksong—but this doesn’t mean it won’t.</strong></p>



<p><strong>*SPOILER ALERT: You have been warned.*</strong></p>



<p>2017’s Hollow Knight has multiple endings, and pretty much all of them end with The Knight sacrificing himself or becoming one with The Void. Team Cherry has said before that each ending is considered “canon,” so it’s fully open to interpretation what has truly happened to The Knight.</p>



<p>The Knight will easily go down as an all-time character for its design and heroism in 2017’s Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>You’d think a The Knight appearance would be kept a surprise. My guess is that we <em>will </em>see The Knight in Hollow Knight: Silksong in some Void capacity. It would also be fun if DLC or a special bonus skin could be unlocked that changes Hornet into The Knight!</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you hoping to see The Knight appear in any capacity? Does Silksong need to be careful with the story, given the importance of its predecessor? Let me know all your thoughts and more through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>IG has plenty of other Silksong guides and content: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-physical-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Hollow Knight: Silksong have a physical release?</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-hollow-knight-silksong-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">does Hollow Knight: Silksong have Early Access?</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it’s coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

              <p><em>Labor Day</em> is here and Amazon is in the mood to clean out its shelves with some deals that feel almost unreal. These record-low prices even beat what we saw during Prime Day in July, which says a lot. And if you’re into LEGO, you probably know Star Wars sets are the ones everyone pays attention to.</p>
<p>Right now, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/">LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano’s T-6 Jedi Shuttle has plummeted to an all-time low price of just $47, from a previous price of $80</a> (41% off), with a whopping <strong>4.8 out of 5 stars across more than 1,500 reviews</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Must-Have LEGO Set</h2>
<p>The T-6 Jedi Shuttle (75362) tips the scales at <strong>over 600 pieces</strong> and springs to life as <strong>Ahsoka Tano’s spaceship in the Disney+ series</strong>. LEGO made sure that the shuttle is not a special one that you build and never touch again. Wings are folded up to flight position, there is an opening cockpit, and the set makes space for play scenarios that Star Wars fans will recognize straight away.</p>
<p>One of the highlights for collectors is the lineup of mini-figures included in the kit: <strong>Ahsoka Tano herself is featured with her dual white lightsabers</strong>, but with her as well is Sabine Wren with blasters, Professor Huyang with his unique droid model, and Marrok, one of the show’s antagonists, with a double-bladed lightsaber. Minifig fans alone are already made this set worth a purchase because exclusive figures inflate aftermarket values.</p>



<p>Design-wise, the T-6 has the details you’d hope for in a modern LEGO Star Wars release: The <strong>ship measures over 10 inches long, about 9 inches wide, and stands 3 inches tall in its landed form</strong>. That makes it a satisfying build that looks good on display without taking over your entire shelf. The play features (like stud shooters and the adjustable wings) are intuitive enough for younger builders to use frequently without frustration.</p>
<p>It’s also a great gift option. With Disney+ placing Ahsoka at the center of Star Wars storytelling momentum, there’s a safe bet kids (and a decent number of adults) will have this ship on their holiday list. At under fifty dollars, it’s one of those deals you don’t hesitate at.</p>

            <p>Bioshock creator Ken Levine has stepped out from the shadows to remind the world about his next project Judas, the first-person action adventure game from Ghost Story Games, through a new dev blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-1">This post</a> revealed a new feature called Villainy - a player-choice driven system that modifies who'll become an antagonist throughout the game. Basically, you start off with "the big three" being on good terms, but if you ignore one of them for too long they get cross and try to kill you.</p>
<p>The post continues with Levine laying praise on Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system, and how it allowed the player to develop relationships with various orcs. This it seems is a substantial source of inspiration for the Villainy system in Judas, with one of the Big Three turning nasty feeling like "losing a friend".</p>

<p>There's still no release date for Judas. <a href="http://eurogamer.net/games/judas">First revealed back in 2022</a>, it's been largely silent on the Judas front ever since. Though, with an indication that more dev blogs are on the way, maybe we're steering a little closer to a world with Judas in it. That'll at the very least mark one of those mystery gameshow titles off the "what ever happened to…" list.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Dino Crisis remake was reportedly attempted twice, but the projects were later scrapped due to low quality.</p>



<p>Replying to a user's question on X, known CAPCOM leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a> revealed that, in the past few years, CAPCOM attempted to bring back the survival horror series with a remake of the first game. The first attempt was from CAPCOM Vancouver before they were shut down, while the second one was from an unspecified CAPCOM team a few years ago. This project, however, wasn't turning out good and was eventually scrapped.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/2) I hope Capcom eventually figures out what they want to do with Dino Crisis. For the record, &amp; I don't believe this is new info, but there has been a couple attempts in the last decade to remake Dino Crisis, the first by Capcom Vancouver before they were shut down (still <a href="https://t.co/f5rMQuk1yX">https://t.co/f5rMQuk1yX</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1960763101613318388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although previous attempts at developing a Dino Crisis remake have reportedly failed, there's a good chance the classic survival horror series may be close to a comeback. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-has-been-trademarked-in-japan-by-capcom-reigniting-hopes-for-a-comeback/">Earlier this year</a>, the series was trademarked again in Japan, something that is usually done in the country when there's a real intention of using an IP again, and in Brazil a few months ago. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-dino-crisis-trademark-revival/">Brazilian filing</a> is particularly interesting, as the series was trademarked again at the same time CAPCOM filed a trademark for Resident Evil Requiem, and with a similar trademark class, entertainment and video games. Hopefully, these trademarks really mean something is in the works for a series that is long overdue its return.</p>



<p>The Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while, but the classic franchise made a small comeback earlier this year with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">GOG release</a> of the first two entries in the series, complete with new features and improvements such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support, and much more. You can learn more about these updated versions of the classic games <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_bundle">here.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a> developers Crystal Dynamics have laid off an unspecified number of staff, their <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">second round of jobs cuts</a> this year. The studio say that the future of the Tomb Raider series won't be affected by this latest taking away of folks' livelihoods.</p>
<p>The news comes not too long after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot Crystal Dynamics were working alongside The Initiative was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">cancelled amid Microsoft's mass cuts in July</a>. The Initiative were shut down as part of that culling.</p>

<p>Crystal Dynamics announced these layoffs via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-we-made-the-very-difficult-decision-activity-7366524687985594369-VkBI">LinkedIn post</a>, which neglected to mention exactly how many staff had been let go.</p>
<p>"Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," they wrote. "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market. To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition."</p>
<p>Crystal Dynamics added that the future of Tomb Raider is "unaffected" by these job cuts. There's currently a new Tomb Raider in the works, and it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">set to be published by Amazon</a>.</p>

"After nearly 8 long years I've been laid off from Crystal Dynamics. It's been a helluva run. From Avengers to Tomb Raider to Perfect Dark it has been a journey of a ton of growth. I learned so much and worked with some of the best. I'll miss them dearly."</p>
<p>Best of luck to all affected.</p>

Regardless, the latter point has been raised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> director Koshi Nakanishi himself, who told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/resident-evil/resident-evil-7-was-possibly-too-scary-and-some-people-couldnt-handle-it-says-director-koshi-nakanishi-and-thats-why-resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-mode-to-make-it-slightly-easier-to-deal-with/">GamesRadar+</a> that part of the reasoning for giving the upcoming sequel a choice of first and third person modes was that the solely FPP <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7</a> – which Nakanishi also directed – maybe worked a little too well at enabling scares.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Looking back at Resident Evil 7's first person perspective, I implemented that as a way to make it more immersive and more scary than ever before," he said. "Which I think most, you know, media and players agreed it was an incredibly scary game, but it was possibly too scary."</p> <figure>

<p>Requiem doesn’t strictly intend to induce fewer gasps and squeaks – it’s previously been pitched as offering "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-core-concept-behind-resident-evil-requiem-is-addictive-fear-which-isnt-entirely-as-silly-as-it-sounds">addictive fear</a>" – but its third-person option will at least attempt to ease up on the intensity, for those who don’t want the beasties getting quite so up in their faces.</p>
<p>"I think some people couldn't handle it, and either couldn't finish or didn't even start [Resi 7]," Nakanishi continues. "And that's something that I look back on thinking that, you know, I want to make sure that people can enjoy this game. So if you started the game off in first person perspective, and you're finding it's too much, then third person is almost a way to step slightly back from that level of horror and make it slightly easier to deal with by having the character on screen as a kind of avatar of yourself."</p><p>I doubt this has been a recent revelation in Capcom’s minds, as the intervening <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> returned to third person for its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-now-try-a-demo-of-resident-evil-villages-new-third-person-mode">Shadow of Rose expansion</a>, including the added option to – hey, this sounds familiar – play the entire main game in either FPP or TPP. And I’d say Requiem having this choice from the start would let Nakanishi direct its scripted scares with the possibility of multiple perspectives in mind, but then what we’ve seen of the new game suggests it takes the same approach to cutscenes as Village’s third person mode: simply cutting back to first-person until you regain control.</p>
<p>As such, swinging out to an over-the-shoulder camera still won’t spare you from <em>every</em> in-yer-face jump scare, or lingering closeup of a monster’s gob. I’d also add that, having played the same Requiem demo that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-its-own-version-of-lady-dimitrescu-but-i-doubt-youll-be-thirsting-for-this-hag">Edwin did back in June</a>, I’d agree with him that it generally seems crafted with a preference for seeing straight through the eyes of new protagonist Grace Ashcroft. Hearing through her ears, too. I, uh, completely forgot to try third person mode at the time, but it’s hard to imagine Grace’s panicked breaths and the dreadful heaviness of nearby footsteps having the same nerve-rustling impact with several feet of extra in-game distance. Still, apparently that’s the point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 6 handheld specifications have leaked online, suggesting the yet-to-be-announced handheld should comfortably outperform the Xbox ROG Ally X and even the base PlayStation 5 in certain scenarios.</p>



<p>In a new video shared earlier today on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, who has recently proved to be quite reliable regarding PlayStation leaks, revealed some new information on the portable system, which has been obtained via up-to-date documentation. The handheld will be powered by the Canis APU, a monolithic 135mm square die manufactured on a TSMC 3nm node featuring 4 Zen 6c CPU cores and 2 Zen 6 Low Power cores that will run the operating system and all non-gaming tasks with 4MB of L3 for the Zen 6c CCX, a 16 CUs RDNA5 GPU clocked at around 1.20 GHz in handheld mode and around 1.65GHz in docked mode and a 192-bit LPDDR5X-8533 memory controller with support to up to 48GB of RAM. Rounding up the features of the handheld are backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4 games, a MicroSD slot, M.2 slot, haptic feedback support, dual mics and a touchscreen.</p>



<p>There is no solid information regarding how much RAM the PlayStation 6 handheld will feature, but it is expected to feature more than 16 or even 24 GB. Asked to comment on the matter, some unspecified developers unanimously agreed that the amounts above wouldn't be enough to run next-generation games with AI features, as even features like UE5's Nanite require a lot of RAM to work properly. As such, these developers believe that anything between 24 and 36 GB of RAM is required for next-gen games.</p>



<p>With these leaked specs seemingly revealed, MLiD also made some performance estimation for the unrevealed PlayStation 6 handheld. Rasterization performance is expected to be between 0.55 and 0.75 times that of the PlayStation 5 in docked mode, while ray tracing performance is between 1.3 and 2.6, which would bring the handheld close to the ray tracing performance of the PlayStation 5 Pro at peak. Factoring in AMD FSR 4 support, the handheld should be able to run patched games at around the PlayStation 5 level of performance, and at <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">Power Saver mode</a> level with unpatched games. With the faster RDNA5 CUs, which are between 40% and 50% faster than RDNA 3.5 CUs and 60% more bandwidth, the system should also comfortably outperform the Xbox ROG Ally X.</p>



<p>With the specs on hand, MLiD also made some estimations on how much the PlayStation 6 handheld should cost to produce and its final price, which is estimated to be between $399-499, based on the better yields of the TSMC 3nm node, the cost of RAM, compared to previous generation, and the fact that Sony seems to always launch hardware at a loss, although if the estimated costs are correct, Sony would be able to take a small profit even at $399.</p>

<p>As production and release of the PlayStation 6 handheld are expected in 2027, it may be a while until we hear more about the system. Still, we will keep you updated on it as soon as anything comes in, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-does-c9-mean-in-marvel-rivals.1282707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to be one of the most popular games around, and ranked mode can throw up plenty of engagement in chat. If you’ve seen a C9 message and don’t know what it means, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>The Netease title continues to go from strength to strength, with Marvel Rivals developers regularly interacting with the community to explain controversial topics, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matchmaking system</a>, and to provide content updates.</p>



<p>With fast-paced action, players will often use abbreviations and slang to communicate in chat, and the C9 term is a common sight. To help you understand, we’ve got a full explanation.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-c9-mean-in-marvel-rivals">What Does C9 Mean in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A confusing message. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>C9 in Marvel Rivals is a short, taunting message used when a team neglects to capture a control point or objective, when it’s readily available to capture with ease, and loses a round or match as a result.</strong></p>



<p>The term refers to Esports team <a href="https://cloud9.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cloud9</a>, with the meme stretching back to an Overwatch tournament in 2017, where the team lost several rounds due to abandoning the objective on multiple occasions in a single match against the Afreeca Freecs Blue.</p>



<p>Given that Marvel Rivals and Overwatch share a lot of similarities, it’s not too surprising to see the term make its way into Marvel Rivals, particularly in Ranked mode.</p>



<p>Messages containing C9 will most likely be shared by opponents at the end of a round or the match, mocking mistakes made by your team. Common situations where this can occur are neglecting to capture an objective when it’s there for the taking, particularly if pushing for kills on enemy players outside the zone.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-respond-to-c9-messages-in-marvel-rivals">How to Respond to C9 Messages in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p><strong>Don’t respond with trash talk to any C9 messages sent in Marvel Rivals, as it could lead to temporary or permanent bans from the game. Instead, ignore them.</strong></p>



<p>The C9 term can help you improve, however, as it’s a sure indicator that your team made a big mistake in the match. If you’ve seen this message in chat, go back and watch the replay to see where the mistake happened and what you could do better to improve.</p>



<p>Using replays in this way is a great way to improve your performance in Marvel Rivals, particularly in ranked matches, and was one of the biggest tips that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sentinels-aramori-confident-more-women-will-make-marvel-rivals-esports-breakthrough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sentinels pro Aramori gave Insider Gaming in an exclusive interview</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Split-Screen? Local Co-op, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-split-screen-co-op/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-split-screen-local-co-op-explained.1282701/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is making a splash across multiple platforms, including a platform debut on PlayStation, but split-screen co-op availability has caused some confusion.</p>



<p>Released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded has been brought into the modern generation with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features like crossplay</a>, which is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition-gears-of-war-reloaded-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest differences compared to Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>.</p>



<p>While split-screen co-op was commonplace when Gears of War initially launched, the gaming world has changed a lot in the past few decades, so we’ve got all the details on whether the feature is available in the latest version.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-local-co-op-split-screen-on-ps5">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Local Co-Op Split Screen on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Return. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Gears of War: Reloaded offers local co-op via split screen on PlayStation 5 as one of its campaign features.</strong></p>



<p>Split-screen multiplayer in Reloaded on PlayStation 5 supports a maximum of two players, with the main account controlling Marcus Fenix and the secondary controlling Dom Santiago. In fact, there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-gears-of-war-reloaded-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophies to earn</a> from completing the game via co-op, which can also be done online.</p>



<p>Split-screen co-op on PlayStation 5 is launched via the Campaign menu.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-local-co-op-split-screen-on-xbox">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Local Co-Op Split Screen on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, just like the original title and Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, Gears of War: Reloaded on Xbox Series X|S supports local co-op through split screen.</strong></p>



<p>The feature was a core mechanic in the original title over 20 years ago, and while split-screen co-op is becoming increasingly rarer in modern gaming, it remains available in Reloaded. This isn’t too surprising though, as there was no reason for the feature to be removed.</p>



<p>Just like on PlayStation, one player controls Marcus and the other controls Dom. Split-screen co-op is launched in the Campaign Menu.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-local-co-op-split-screen-on-pc-amp-steam">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Local Co-Op Split Screen on PC &amp; Steam?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Gears of War: Reloaded does not offer local co-op and split-screen on PC, which has been a cause of contention.</strong></p>



<p>Initial listings for Reloaded on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523720/Gears_of_War_Reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> listed split-screen co-op as an available feature, though that mention has since been removed. As a result, the Steam version of the game has received a surge of negative reviews, with other issues, including crashes, also being reported.</p>



<p>The Xbox store listing for Gears of War: Reloaded states that local co-op is not available on PC, though it’s unclear whether this has been added recently or has always been there.</p>

            <p>Bethesda has teased an upcoming update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> meant to improve space travel, following a recent bit of data mining from the community that discovered hints of an overhauled "cruise mode".</p>
<p>Now, a hasty patch was uploaded to remove hints of the cruise mode from the files, but since then Bethesda have come forward with its hands up and admitted that yes, cruise mode is real and is on the way somewhat soon.</p>
<p>This came out via a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zknfAghd-s">developer spotlight on Tim Lamb</a>, a senior producer at Bethesda. In this video Lamb states: "We have some exciting things in development, including free updates and player-requested features, as well as a new DLC story."</p>

<p>PlayStation fans finally rejoiced in 2025 with the arrival of Gears of War: Reloaded. It marked the first time Gears has ever been officially playable on a PlayStation console. A glance at Reloaded’s Platinum Trophy suggests we might not be done yet.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> is still one of the most shocking games to me in recent memory. The idea of a core Xbox exclusive that helped Microsoft dominate the console wars in the early 00s to 2010s being on PS5 is unreal. That’s where we are, though. Reloaded is a complete remake of the first Gears title, and PlayStation owners can experience it for themselves.</p>



<p>The Reloaded trophy list features many of the original’s challenges, but the description of the Platinum Trophy is eye-catching.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-gears-of-war-games-potentially-coming-to-playstation-5">More Gears of War Games Potentially Coming to PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’d like more. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-gears-of-war-reloaded-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded’s trophy list</a> has a Platinum Trophy called “Nothin’ Left.” As usual, you earn it for getting every other trophy in the game. This is a tough feat when you consider you need to beat every campaign mission on Insane Difficulty.</p>



<p>The Platinum Trophy description is very interesting: “Your adventure is over, <strong>for now</strong>…”</p>



<p>The final two words are very telling. The Platinum Trophy is exclusive to PlayStation users, and Xbox users don’t have an extra Achievement for getting all the others. It feels like a message tailored specifically to PS fans. There are already rumors that <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> is only the beginning of the ports and remakes.</p>



<p>Initial leaks suggested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-games-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-include/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded was going to be all three</a> of the OG Gears games. Reports indicate that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-gears-e-day-on-ps5-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears E-Day is on its way to PS5</a>. I think whatever happens, there’s a good chance we’ve not seen the last of new Gears content on PlayStation.</p>

			<p>Dead Take doesn’t announce itself with cheap shocks. Instead, it creeps in like a bad memory, pulling you through the corridors of an opulent mansion where every locked door feels like it’s hiding something rotten. It’s less about what jumps out at you, and more about what lingers when the screen goes black.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEAD TAKE | OUT NOW | OFFICIAL LAUNCH TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nx-Adkki9yw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From its opening frames, Dead Take signals a different kind of horror. This is less a sprint through monsters and more a slow walk into moral quicksand. It’s a first-person, FMV-driven psychological thriller about ambition, manipulation, and the way an industry can turn people into raw material. You play Chase Lowry (Neil Newbon), an actor following the trail of his missing friend, Vinny Monroe (Ben Starr), inside the silent mansion of a powerful Hollywood producer. There’s no combat here and precious little hand-holding, just a maze of puzzles, screens, and an awful lot of things you can’t unknow once you’ve seen them.</p>


<p>The single-location setup does the heavy lifting. The house is lavish, sterile, and empty; your only contact with its owner, Duke Cain, comes as disembodied messages and the artifacts he’s left behind. The silence is suffocating, not because anything is chasing you, but because every drawer or projector you touch might peel back another layer of somebody’s performance—on screen and off it. The emptiness matters: you’re never measuring people in the room, only the versions of themselves they’ve recorded for others to see. That distance is the point, and it’s where the game’s nastiest questions live. Cain’s voice, while uncredited in-game but widely identified as creative director Abubakar Salim, adds a smug, omnipresent chill as he needles you from afar.</p>


<p>FMV can be a gimmick, but here it’s the backbone. Newbon’s Chase anchors the story with a weary, probing presence; most of his “acting” is in how you, as Chase, watch others. Starr’s Vinny is the live wire: charming on the surface, then fraying in front of the lens as opportunities curdle into coercion. Watching him unravel, in screen tests, interviews, and clipped “notes”, is more disturbing than any loud sting.</p>
<p>The supporting roster sells the conceit that this is a Hollywood ecosystem chewing people up. Jane Perry turns up as Lia Cane, icily professional and impossible to read, while Alanah Pearce’s Victoria Case is a cooler, more vulnerable counterpoint. There are also cameos from well known figure heads in the gaming industry, such as Laura Bailey, Sam Lake, and Matthew Mercer, each slotted in as faces you “know” from elsewhere, which the game smartly uses to poke at your own parasocial expectations. That extra-textual recognition isn’t a distraction; it’s the horror. Fame is a mask, and Dead Take keeps asking why we’re so eager to trust it.</p>
<p>Crucially, you’re not reading micro-tells across a dinner table; you’re parsing them through an edit suite. The most chilling moments are small—breaths held too long, a line delivered just a bit too clean, an apology that lands like a threat. You are constantly wondering if you can trust anything you see on the screen.</p>

<p>Moment to moment, this is an exploratory puzzle game. You sweep rooms for scrawled numbers, rummage through props and contracts, and, most importantly, collect USB sticks to feed the theatre’s workstation. There an AI-assisted editor lets you splice together found footage – auditions, interviews, B-roll – into “new” cuts that surface codes, unlock doors, and nudge the story forward. It’s elegantly literal: the same manipulations that shape careers and headlines are the tools you wield to progress.</p>
<p>I just wish this feature was utilised to greater effect. You are very limited to what you can actually splice, with the only correct combinations pushing the narrative forward. It would have been great if you could splice other pieces of footage together to get bonus insight into the goings on of Dead Take. Discovering the correct splices usually follows with a knocking on the theater door, which is initially scary, until the fifth time it happens where something magically appears to progress the story. It’s never explicitly explained whether something super natural is going on or if Chase has lost it. Maybe that’s the point though.</p>
<p>And yes, there are jump scares; loud, sometimes very loud. They get you early and occasionally overstay their welcome later, becoming very predictable and way less scary. The scare design is effective in the moment; the audio balance, less so.</p>

<p>Underneath the genre trappings, Dead Take is a character study about what people will trade for a shot at being seen. Vinny wants the role. Chase wants the truth. The house wants them both. The way you assemble clips to get what you need is the subtext made mechanical: stories are built, not found, and the builder always leaves fingerprints. When the game lets you sit with that, when you realize a cruel outburst or a teary confession is both “real” and carefully staged, it becomes properly unsettling.</p>
<p>The industry satire isn’t subtle. It doesn’t have to be. Power flows through gatekeepers; “notes” are weapons; NDAs feel like spells. There’s a particularly sharp sequence where a creative pitch is reduced to a brand deck, and the footage you’re splicing is less a “scene” than a negotiation over who’s allowed to exist inside it. The critique lands because the performances do. The FMV isn’t a novelty, it’s the only way to make these cuts hurt.</p>
<p>Credit to the art and sound teams for making a still, empty mansion feel predatory. The lighting carves the house into little stages – the piano room, projection suite, gallery – while long corridors amplify your doubt. The score is sparing, letting the granular foley work of keys, paper, a projector stuttering to life do the creeping. There’s restraint here. The game wants you leaning forward to hear, not flinching at every corner.</p>
<p>It’s also keenly paced for a shorter experience. I finished it in around three hours, but you can expect about four to five hours on a first run, depending on how often you get lost in the edit bay. That length feels right for the structure: long enough to build a rhythm of explore-watch-splice, short enough that the central metaphor doesn’t wear thin. If anything drags, it’s those occasional lock-and-key detours or an over-eager sting. The loop settles into a satisfying pattern: sweep a wing of the house, find a clue, sit down with the footage, and make a truth you can use.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s release is right around the corner after years of waiting, and we’ve got all the details on a physical release of the game.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, Hollow Knight: Silksong impressed us during our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and excitement levels are through the roof with players eagerly waiting for their chance to get their hands on the game.</p>



<p>Modern gaming is now a mostly digital world, with physical releases becoming increasingly rarer, and we’ve got all the details on whether Silksong will have a physical edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hollow-knight-silksong-have-a-physical-release">Will Hollow Knight: Silksong Have a Physical Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Waiting game. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong will be releasing a Physical Edition, but it won’t be available at launch on September 4. Instead, it will be released in 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Physical copies will first be available on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles in early 2026, before physical versions of the game on other platforms follow later in the year.</p>



<p>Specifics on why a physical release will come months after a digital release have not been stated, though it’s likely to be due to the small team that <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a> has. This has resulted in other changes too, including making up part of the decision <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-hollow-knight-silksong-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to send out review copies</a> to media and content creators.</p>



<p>Pre-order details for a Physical Edition are also not available, though we should see more news in the weeks and months after the release takes place, with the focus understandably on preparing for release.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-hollow-knight-silksong-collector-s-edition">Will There be a Hollow Knight: Silksong Collector’s Edition?</h2>



<p><strong>It has not been confirmed whether Hollow Knight: Silksong will receive a Collector’s Edition, though it could be on the cards in future.</strong></p>



<p>The original Hollow Knight game received a Collector’s Edition, which featured a physical copy of the game, including all DLC, a 14-page comic book, a box case, a metal brooch, and a gold foil art print set. Inside the physical copy, there was also a manual and a fold-out map of Hallownest.</p>



<p>Players didn’t have to wait too long for the Collector’s Edition either, with Hollow Knight initially launching in February 2019, with the Collector’s Edition following in May. However, with the Physical Editions of Silksong not coming until 2026, the wait for a Collector’s Edition this time around will likely be longer.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Kojima parted ways with Konami in 2015 after spending decades as one of the top creative minds in the company. Since that time, Kojima has launched his own company and released two Death Stranding games. Okamura has openly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-producer-would-love-to-work-with-hideo-kojima-on-metal-gear-solid/1100-6524582/" data-ref-id="1100-6524582">shared his admiration for Kojima</a> and expressed his desire to work with him again on MGS.

                <p>While players are still enjoying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">Peak's brand-new Mesa biome</a>, the game's latest patch is here to address some technical concerns--specifically making it easier to run <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> on lower-powered computers.</p><p>The latest patch, which brings the game to version 1.27.a, introduces a new Texture Quality graphics setting. The new option, which Team Peak says has been much-requested, allows players with low VRAM to lower the texture quality, reducing the incidence of low framerates, missing graphics, and potential crashes. The developer notes that the lower texture quality "doesn’t even look much worse," so it's worth checking out for anyone who's been experiencing performance issues in Peak.</p><p>The developer has also added support for DX11 graphics API, alongside existing options DX12 and Vulkan. "It might be better, it might be worse," the patch notes warn, but suggest players who have had issues with the other options give it a try anyway. "We can’t really confirm which exact configurations of graphics cards this will work better with, but if it can improve it for some of you that’s fantastic!"</p><p>The performance-focused update has also made Peak's existing Render Scale options "more dramatic," meaning players who choose Medium or Low options should see a more obvious difference in performance.</p><p>In addition to these changes, Team Peak has added a new accessibility setting in the form of Photosensitive Mode, which dials down a number of visual effects that may impact people with photosensitivity.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiNPum3mLD0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiNPum3mLD0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new performance options make up the bulk of this update, though a few other things have been mopped up with the small patch. In absence of a true map randomizer, the dev says Mesa and Peak will now simply alternate every other day--and because Mesa will appear less often, the secret entrance in the map will now appear 50% of the time instead of 25%.</p><p>The Peak dev has also reintroduced a known issue to the game with The Kiln's lava--the patch notes say they failed to reproduce the issue in-house, so are re-enabling the rising lava in hopes of getting more reports about the bug and when it occurs.</p><p>Check out the full list of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498330460301034111" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> below:</p><h2>PEAK PATCH 1.27.a:</h2><h3>OPTIONS</h3><ul><li>NEW GRAPHICS SETTING: Texture Quality  <ul><li>This is actually huge. You can now lower the texture quality across the game, which is important for players with low VRAM. This can resolve issues with low framerate, missing graphics, and even crashes. Also it doesn’t even look much worse. Check it out!</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>NEW GRAPHICS API: DX11  <ul><li>The game can now be launched in DX11 in addition to our DX12 and Vulkan options. For players who have had trouble with our previous two options, give this a try. It might be better, it might be worse. We can’t really confirm which exact configurations of graphics cards this will work better with, but if it can improve it for some of you that’s fantastic!</li></ul></li><li>Render Scale options are now more dramatic, you should see higher performance gains if you play on Medium or Low.</li><li>NEW ACCESSIBILITY SETTING: Photosensitive Mode.  <ul><li>This mode changes the following:  <ul><li>Dynamite, Flare, and Scout Cannon lit fuse effects are less flashy</li><li>Screenshake is lessened.</li><li>Bright lights from the dynamite explosion are disabled.</li><li>Fullscreen VFX from taking various sources of damage are less intense and more gradual.</li><li>Fullscreen VFX from the Energy Drink, Lollipop, and Heat Pack are less intense.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li>You can now change your sash in the Passport to any you’ve unlocked via ascents!</li></ul><h3>MAPS</h3><ul><li>The ALPINE and the MESA will now alternate every other day.</li><li>A secret entrance in the MESA is now open 50% of the time instead of 25%. Feels fair considering the MESA itself is now open 50% of the time as well.</li><li>The Lava Rises again in THE KILN. Admittedly, we didn't fix the issue with it--but since we weren't able to reproduce the issue on our end, we figured it would be helpful to put it back up and get more reports in. If the lava becomes desynced for you, please send us a video or logs!</li></ul><h3>BALANCE</h3><ul><li>Wait time until the lava rises increased by 1 minute.</li><li>The time for the lava to reach the top once it starts is increased by 3 minutes.</li></ul><h3>MINOR FIXES</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where you could pocket unpocketable items while climbing.</li><li>Replaced bees sounds in Bug Phobia Mode.</li><li>Fog walls raised in height again because apparently you could still do Cannon exploit if you did it just right.</li></ul>

                <p>After a couple of weeks of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-schedule-1-beta-update-brings-rival-cartel-to-drug-selling-game/1100-6533908/" data-ref-id="1100-6533908">testing on the beta branch</a>, the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1 </a>update, Rival Cartels, is now live in the main game. The update introduces competition in the form of Hyland Point's Benzies family, as well as a new property to purchase, a new vehicle, and more.</p><p>Viral hit Schedule 1 sees players build a drug-dealing empire from the ground up, and the new update adds some new obstacles for the player's rise to power--as well as new possibilities. The Benzies family will only be introduced once the player has unlocked a few customers in Westville, and once you're on their radar, they'll interfere with your business through ambushes, theft, robbing your dealers, and stealing your customers. You'll also be able to truce with the Benzies, unlocking new cartel-player deals.</p><p>Once you've completed the rival cartel's full storyline, you'll be able to purchase the new Hyland Manor property. The update also comes with a few new features, including a graffiti system that can be used to reduce the cartel's influence and gain XP. Cartel influence is something you'll have to be aware of as you progress through Schedule 1--different areas on the map will now be locked if cartel influence is too high, and players will have to reduce the influence in order to unlock new regions.</p><p>As well as the new property and mechanics, the update also adds a handful of new items and cosmetics, including the Hotbox vehicle, a pump shotgun, and some new hairstyles for you to customize the player character.</p><p>Despite its runaway success, Schedule 1 is the work of a single developer operating as Tyler's Video Game Studio, or TVGS. Tyler has apologized for recent updates taking longer than initially scheduled, and in the most recent Steam update said that he will no longer be specifying release dates for updates. The solo dev has also said that he hopes to get some office space and bring a couple of full-time developers on board for Schedule 1 soon.</p><p>Check out the rest of the patch notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393722" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Schedule 1's latest update</a> below:</p><h2>Schedule 1 v0.4.0</h2><h3>Additions</h3><ul><li>Added the Benzies family - a powerful rival cartel in Hyland Point. You will first encounter them once you have unlocked a number of customers in Westville. Interactions with them include:  <ul><li>Cartel-player deals (only while truced)</li><li>Ambushes</li><li>Dealer robbings</li><li>Dead drop theft</li><li>Cartel-customer deals</li></ul></li><li>Added new purchasable property - Hyland Manor. Keep in mind that the Benzies' family storyline must be completed before this can be purchased.</li><li>Added new vehicle 'Hotbox'.</li><li>Added graffiti system. You can spray graffiti on various surfaces around the map to reduce cartel influence and gain XP.</li><li>Added spray paint item. Purchaseable at Gas Mart.

This can be used to remove graffiti from a surface.</li><li>Added pump shotgun.</li><li>Added shotgun shell.</li><li>Added 'close buzzcut' hairstyle.</li><li>Added 'Tony' hairstyle</li><li>Added 'long slicked back' hairstyle.</li><li>Added 'setgravitymultiplier' command.</li><li>Added 'setregionunlocked' command.</li><li>Added 'forcesleep' command.</li><li>Added an automatic save game backup feature. This will automatically generate a backup of your save file when you first load it on a new version of the game. This is enabled by default, and can be turned off in Settings -&gt; Other.</li><li>Added some more loading screen hints.</li><li>Added 'Urban Artist' achievement.</li><li>Added 'Finishing the Job' achievement.</li></ul><h3>Tweaks/Improvements</h3><ul><li>Changed how you unlock new regions. Each region now has a 'cartel influence' level associated with it. You must reduce this influence to a certain level before you can progress to the next region.</li><li>Stan now uses a shop interface instead of dialogue for selling weapons.</li><li>In multiplayer, you can view the dialogue of other players talking to NPCs.</li><li>Deals are now cancelled when the assigned dealer is dead/unconscious.</li><li>Unconscious NPCs who drop into the ocean are now killed.</li><li>Dead/unconscious NPCs can now be pickpocketed.</li><li>You can now pickpocket police.</li><li>If you attack a customer, they will not order from you for 72 hours.</li><li>Tweaks the braking properties of all vehicles.</li><li>Non-police NPCs can now use ranged weapons.</li><li>Police and NPCs in combat will now sometimes predict future target position instead of pathing directly to the target.</li><li>Tweaked flashlight brightness.</li><li>Turned off JSON pretty-print for the trash save file, offering a reduction in file size.</li><li>Reduced the resell multiplier of all weapons.</li><li>You can now interrupt an incremental reload (revolver + shotgun) by clicking the LMB.</li><li>Customers now carry the cash that is required to pay for an upcoming deal.</li></ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed various mislabellings in employee tutorial quests.</li><li>Fixed two light beams being visible when the flashlight is equipped.</li><li>Fixed scuffed NPC ragdoll LODs/culling.</li><li>Fixed some missing walls at Hyland Medical.</li><li>Fixed third-person recoil animation for the M1911 and Revolver.</li><li>Fixed the networth calculator algorithm not factoring in some item quantities.</li><li>Fixed vehicle impacts doing too much damage to NPCs.</li><li>Fixed some missing fonts.</li><li>Fixed textured z-fighting on the northern waterfront.</li><li>Fixed dealer/supplier recommendation dialogue starting even if the customer was served by a dealer.</li><li>Fixed a bug where item stock limits could be ignored by using the custom amount selector.</li><li>Fixed missing colliders at the car wash.</li><li>Fixed Tobias' name misspelling.</li></ul>

                <p>Next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will introduce players to Grace Ashcroft, the newest protagonist in the franchise. In the trailers shared so far, Grace has been way over her head in danger. That's how she enters the story, but she won't remain that way forever. According to director Kōshi Nakanishi, Grace's transformation from helpless to powerful may represent the "most extreme gap" in the franchise.</p><p>"We're at the testing phase now in development as we gear up to the February release, and even as we play it internally, putting ourselves in the mindset of the players--I really feel that it's going to be an incredible rollercoaster," Nakanishi told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "They're going to feel like that curve of tension to release is going to be ... it's perhaps the most extreme gap between those two axes. The points on that curve are going to be so far apart from each other that it's going to be incredible."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil 9 Requiem - Official Gamescom Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>To illustrate his point without giving away spoilers, Nakanishi referred to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-explores-the-backstory-of-new-heroine-grace-ashcroft/1100-6534107/" data-ref-id="1100-6534107">the unhinged creature that hunts Grace in the trailer</a>. It's the latest stalker character in the RE franchise, but Grace will have a way to deal with it even if she can't kill it.</p><p>"We're pretty tight-lipped on the details at this stage, but we want to give players a method to overcome the stalker enemy," noted Nakanishi. "What that entails is something that we'll be getting into down the line, but I think that you'll feel like you finally have a chance to turn the tables and deal with the stalker in a way that you haven't been able to in past titles."</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 27, 2026. It's part of Capcom's plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-gears-up-for-resident-evil-30th-anniversary-celebration-with-new-website/1100-6534067/" data-ref-id="1100-6534067">the 30th anniversary of Resident Evil</a>, most of which remain under wraps for now. Weapons director Zach Cregger is also helming the new Resident Evil movie, which is set to debut in theaters on September 18, 2026.</p>
