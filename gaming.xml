		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> Obelisk update is here, and it’s the biggest update for the game to date, bringing a new map for the Operations PvE mode, a new Chaos enemy, and a Dark Angels cosmetics pack for those with the Season Pass. The update is out now across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> (with new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support), <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Obelisk Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gNMrZ7_l9NM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Return to the burial world of Demerium in the new Operation, Obelisk. Here you’ll battle against the new Tzaangor Enlightened enemy, who have fast paced attacks and zip around the world on a flying Disc of Tzeentch. However, they won’t be limited to just this map. As a new Majoris enemy, they can be found in every Operation that features the Thousand Sons from now on.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Season Pass has some new goodies with the Dark Angels Chapter Pack, which includes a new Champion skin for the Bulwak class, and new skins for the Plasma Pistol, Auto Bolt Rifle and Power Sword. You’ve also got a new Storm Shield skin and over 40 unique cosmetics celebrating eight of the Dark Angels Successor Chapters.</p>
<p>The Obelisk update brings some enhancement for PS5 Pro and PC gamers, with the patch adding new maximum resolutions for both the 60FPS Performance Mode and 30FPS Quality mode, using PS5 Pro’s PSSR upscaling technique to hit 4K in both situations. PC players will now also have FSR 3 upscaling support, and DLSS 3 with frame generation support.</p>

<p>Saber is committed to bringing more content to the game through 2025. This will include both free updates that add the Neo-Volkite pistol, more new PvE opeartions, PvP maps and modes, and a new Horde Mode in a later update. The Season Passes will then have more premium cosmetics to unlock for your Space Marines, so you can represent your favourite chapters.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">our Space Marine 2 review</a>, Dom said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

It turned out that the 2022 agreement wasn’t binding, but the 2023 one was, and yet we’ve nearly run out of 2024 and still nothing’s started! We’ve now learned that the intervening time was spent agreeing to “creative guidelines,” which is actually more fun than it sounds—see below. I hope it was done over a game, GW playing Space Marines, Amazon playing Cultists, and Henry Cavill running around the room going “Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”</p><p>Back in 2022, poor, lovely Henry Cavill announced he was leaving Netflix’s adaptation of <em>The Witcher</em> to reprise his role as  Superman, moments before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/henry-cavill-warhammer-40k-witcher-superman-amazon-1849903568&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/henry-cavill-warhammer-40k-witcher-superman-amazon-1849903568"><em>Black Adam</em> bombed so hard</a></span> that it destroyed the entire DC cinematic universe. James Gunn took over the franchise and made clear Cavill wasn’t part of his vision, and the actor was left standing at the altar, droopy flowers in his hands, his former fiancée now hooked up with Liam Hemsworth.</p><p>But then in swooped <em>Warhammer 40K</em> to sweep him off his feet, although it’s been a very drawn-out engagement. While today’s announcement at least confirms that projects can finally go ahead, the GW statement concludes, “Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years.”</p><p>Meanwhile, over on the less corporate face of the company, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warhammer Community</em></a></span>, there’s a story that better details what’s happening right now, and what the last year entailed. They explain,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Well, it means we now have synopsis and ordering for the stories we’re going to tell... yep, we said <em>stories</em>! It might have taken a year but it was a year well spent! And what fun - sifting through the enormity of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, debating characters, story arcs and the thematic grit that underpins it all.</p></blockquote><p>“Enormity” is probably not the right word, unless they <em>really</em> hate it, but what splendid news! It wasn’t all lawyers and eyebrows, but proper planning to get a whole bunch of different shows (and maybe movies?) out of the license. </p><p>Next up, the site says, is scripts. The average time spent in a writers’ room for a prestige streaming show at the moment is around eight months, before anyone touches a camera or a paintbrush, so it doesn’t seem likely that filming would begin before 2026. While Amazon’s speedy turnaround on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-macaulay-culkin-1851693027&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-macaulay-culkin-1851693027"><em>Fallout</em> season 2</a></span> offers some hope we won’t all be living on vast spaceships by the time it’s out, the post also says “It’ll be some years.” It adds,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Of course, as with all carefully crafted things, this all takes time... and trust us when we say, everyone involved is las-focused on getting it all <em>just right.</em></p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Henry Cavill posted on Instagram to say how thrilled he is. </p><p>“My incredible team and I,” the actor said, “alongside the brilliant minds at Games Workshop, have been working away in concept rooms, breaking down approaches to the enormity and magnificence of the Warhammer world.” Again, not what enormity means, but I can rise about this. “Together, we’ve been sifting through the plethora of incredible characters and poring over old tomes and texts. Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop. That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret. Watch this space, though—more to come in time!”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Out June 20, 2025, the movie stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, and a ripped Ralph Fiennes, among others.</p><p>The most effective part of the trailer is a recitation of Rudyard Kipling’s  poem “Boots,” about marching during the Second Boer War in South Africa. “Try—try—try—try—to think o’ something different—Oh—my—God—keep—me from goin’ lunatic!” the voice over goes. “(Boots—boots—boots—boots—movin’ up an’ down again!) There’s no discharge in the war!”</p><p>The biggest mystery about the movie might not be why the rage virus is back, but what Murphy’s role will be. The central protagonist of the first movie, he’s set to appear in the third film but it’s not exactly clear how. In a split-second near 1:47 in the trailer there’s an emaciated zombie body that looks like Murphy, rising out of a field of wild flowers. Maybe he’s infected. Maybe he’s found a way to overcome the virus. A Sony exec <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/05/tom-rothman-streaming-audiences-quentin-tarantino-1235920644/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/tom-rothman-streaming-audiences-quentin-tarantino-1235920644/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously teased</a></span> his return “in a surprising way and in a way that grows, let me put it that way.”</p><p>Murphy was still relatively unknown back when <em>28 Days Later</em> came out in 2002. He later appeared as Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies and the hit series <em>Peaky Blinders</em>. Murphy returns to the zombie franchise after winning an Oscar for his performance last year in <em>Oppenheimer</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s 5.0 update introduces an Obelisk Operation, a new enemy and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-space-marine-2-obelisk-update-details">Space Marine 2 Obelisk Update Details&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Space Marine 2’s Obelisk Operation takes players to Demerium. Here, their goal is to disrupt the flow of energy protecting an Aurora device. To do that, you must rotate a replica of the obelisk. However, the console control of the device is placed deep into the heart of a “tomb plunged into darkness”. The operation is set to occur “parallel to the final events of the campaign.”</p>



<p>Space Marine 2’s Obelisk Update also introduces a new Majoris enemy called Tzaangor Enlightened. This disk-flying, melee/ranged-hybrid enemy will be found in all Operations featuring the Thousand Suns and should be considered a formidable opponent when in great numbers. The way to bring them down is to catch them after a parry or during a long animation; the developers have advised using a Target Lock when facing this enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, the update also brings new Season Pass content with the Dark Angels Chapter Pack. Season Pass owners can grab Dark Angels Successor Chapters cosmetics, including Dark Angels Champion skin (Bulwark) and weapon skins for Auto Bolt Rifle, Plasma Pistol, Power Sword and Bulwark’s Storm Shield.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>FromSoftware's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> expansion Shadow of the Erdtree won't be eligible for BAFTA's Best Game award, as it's reserved for full games only.</p>
<p>There's been plenty of debate around whether expansions should be considered award-worthy, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/expansion-packs-new-game-seasons-dlcs-remakes-and-remasters-are-eligible-for-this-years-the-game-awards">The Game Awards in particular noting they are eligible</a>.</p>
<p>BAFTA has taken a different approach, though, confirming to Eurogamer its Best Game award is only for full games, but DLC and other updates are part of the consideration in the Evolving Game category.</p>

<p>"Our Best Game category specifically recognises full games which have released for the first time in the past year," a BAFTA spokesperson told Eurogamer. "DLC, along with other updates and enhancements made to games originally released before 25th November 2023, are part of the consideration in our Evolving Game category."</p>
<p>The news comes as <a href="https://www.bafta.org/stories/best-video-games-2024">BAFTA releases its longlist</a> of nominated games for next year's awards ceremony, with 58 games on the list up for 17 awards.</p>
<p>All games on the list were released between 25th November 2023 and 15th November 2024. Remasters are not eligible for consideration; full remakes are eligible only in craft categories.</p>
<p>DLC is eligible as part of the Evolving Game category and certain craft categories.</p>
<p>It's a noteworthy choice, considering this week's The Game Awards has Shadow of the Erdtree nominated in multiple categories, including Game of the Year. The Game Awards did clarify to Eurogamer there has been no specific change in rules this year, though the public announcement of DLC eligibility was only recently added to its website.</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree is currently a finalist in the public-voted Players' Voice award, against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-tier-list-best-characters-9436">Wuthering Waves</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a>. Many comments have noted the prevalence of ongoing gacha games and a DLC dominating the category.</p>
<div>

<p>BAFTA will avoid this. From its longlist, 10 are up for Best Game: Animal Well, Astro Bot, Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Helldivers 2, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Metaphor: ReFantazio, Thank Goodness You're Here!, and Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2.</p>
<p>"The BAFTA Games Awards longlist is our opportunity to celebrate a wide range of outstanding games ahead of the BAFTA nominations on 4th March next year," said Tara Saunders, chair of BAFTA's Games committee. "Today we're shining a light on 58 games, as voted for by our wonderful BAFTA members - 1300 industry professionals whose work brings games to life."</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 was the big winner from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">last year's BAFTA Game Awards</a>. Cyberpunk 2077 won the award for Evolving Game, thanks in part to its Phantom Liberty expansion.</p>
<p>Eurogamer will of course have its own Game of the Year list shortly, in which DLC and expansions will likewise not be eligible. Sorry folks!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Black Myth: Wukong patch was deployed today on PC and PlayStation 5, introducing a highly requested feature, new content, PC-specific fixes, improved ray tracing performance, and more.</p>
<p>Patch 1.0.12.16581, which started rolling out on the Epic Games Store version and will gradually become available on other versions of the game, introduces a highly requested in-game map feature, the Journeyer's Chart. The first map will be unlocked when the Destined One first enters Black Wind Mountain and meets the Keeper, while the others can be purchased at the Keeper's Shrine every time a new region is reached.</p>
<p>The new Black Myth: Wukong also introduces new Challenges called Return of the Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends. In the first one, which features three different difficulty settings, the Destined One will be able to challenge defeated opponents again; in the second, the Destined One will fight against opponents in quick succession using customized curses to tailor the difficulty and completing each gauntlet will reward players with new rare treasures. The patch also introduces a new armor set, the Armor Set of Opulence, to celebrate an early Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>Together with a variety of gameplay fixes, the new Black Myth: Wukong also brings some PC-specific fixes that should improve the experience considerably, such as crashing fixes for NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, flickering fixes when using Intel XeSS, a memory leak fix, and more. The new patch also optimizes performance for numerous scenes and boss fights on medium and low-end configurations and enhances the performance of Full Ray Tracing on NVIDIA RTX GPUs. You can head over <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149">here</a> to check out the full patch notes.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-shows-new-trailer-confirms-2025-launch-on-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-shows-new-trailer-confirms-2025-launch-on-steam.1056795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-shows-new-trailer-confirms-2025-launch-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, GFA Games has finally provided a meaty update on their upcoming open world massively multiplayer first person shooter game PIONER. As you might recall, we interviewed the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-new-details-on-the-upcoming-stalker-inspired-mmofps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2021</a> and then a second time <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2023</a>, when the game was supposed to launch a beta testing phase. That never happened, but now GFA Games has confirmed that PIONER will launch next year on Steam<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, where the game is available for wishlisting.</p>
<p>There's a new trailer, too, along with an updated overview of the game's features, mechanics, and content. As previously reported, PIONER is set in an alternate reality inspired by the Soviet era and filled with atmospheric landscapes and unique architecture. The narrative is reportedly influenced by classic science fiction (specifically, we might add, GSC Game World's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER franchise</a>), featuring deep characters, powerful artifacts, and mysterious anomalies shaping the story. It will unfold over the course of a story-driven campaign through several quests that will delve into the setting's lore. Players will be able to align with charismatic factions, each offering distinct characters, viewpoints, and special rewards.</p>
<p>In PIONER, players will increase their influence by completing missions, defeating monsters, and exploring the world. More significant influence makes merchants more inclined to sell you better items, allow higher quality materials to drop, and even allow you to improve your non-combat abilities.</p>
<p>There will be various activities for the players to engage with, such as PvE missions, PvP arenas, events, and even mini-games like fishing and casino games. Moreover, the game includes an extraction shooter experience within the so-called Shadowlands. These are high-reward zones open to unrestricted PvP, where players can attack others freely, except for faction or clan members. The upside is that you'll find plenty of great loot here.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Wish" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hq3Y2uxXHGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>PIONER offers the opportunity to create clans. Members may communicate through chat and/or emotes, as well as competing on clan leaderboards. On the PvE side, there will be six raids at launch that reportedly mix open world and structured missions, providing a challenge that requires teamwork to overcome.</p>
<p>At its core, the game has some survival elements, too. Players must take care to keep hunger and fatigue at bay. There's also a crafting system where players use artifacts, anomalous energy, and scavenged materials to create new equipment. Lastly, there's extensive weapon customization with lots of unique designs and modules.</p>
<p>PIONER remains firmly on our radar. There aren't many upcoming MMOFPS games, and this one definitely looks worth checking out.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-talos-principle-reawakened-coming-next-year-and-its-more-than-a-remaster.1056792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Devolver Digital and developer Croteam have announced&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</em>, a reworked version of the philosophical 2014 puzzler that the two studios promise is "more than a remaster".</p>

<p>Described as the "definitive edition" of the game,&nbsp;<em>Reawakened&nbsp;</em>includes the full original experience, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expansion-announced-talos-principle" rel="nofollow"><em>Road to Gehenna&nbsp;</em>expansion</a> and a brand new chapter titled&nbsp;<em>In the Beginning</em>. This new chapter "explores the origins of the Simulation and the challenges of its first test".</p>

<p><em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>has also been rebuilt with Unreal Engine 5 in the new version of the game, resulting in what Devolver and Croteam call a "more immersive and detailed" world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-puzzle.jpg?itok=TzrhZyrG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-puzzle.jpg?itok=YzkwsE7q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>is getting a fancy remaster next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the visual overhaul,&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>is also promising "modernized quality-of-life updates that maintain the vision of the original classic", although Devolver and Croteam don't go into detail regarding exactly what those updates are.</p>

<p>Rather excitingly, if you're playing on PC, you can also look forward to a new level editor that lets you craft your very own&nbsp;<em>Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>challenges. I'd imagine there will be puzzles several degrees more fiendish than the original game's offerings online in hours after this one launches.</p>

<p>This new version of the game is set to debut sometime early next year for PC and current-gen consoles, so it looks like you're out of luck if you were hoping to check it out on your PS4 or your Xbox One, sadly. Still, there's always the original!</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with the original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle</em>, it's a first-person puzzler with a heavy emphasis on philosophical theming and narrative.</p>

<p>The game sees you tasked with solving puzzles by a mysterious "creator" figure, all while contemplating what your purpose might be in a beautiful but strangely empty world.</p>

<p>You can check out the original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/The_Talos_Principle/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-talos-principle/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-talos-principle/C1TJ5KT8LT9J" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-talos-principle-deluxe-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. There's no word yet on whether owners of the original will get any kind of discount on the new version, which is due to land on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has outlined some of the changes coming to the game in the near future as a result of Early Access player feedback.</p>

<p>The action RPG was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">released last week</a>&nbsp;and despite Grinding Gear's fears that the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning" rel="nofollow">servers may not hold up</a>, it's garnered a Very Positive rating in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam review stakes</a>, with over 32,000 players weighing in with their opinions.</p>

<p>Of course, though the majority of those reviews express positive sentiments, many players are noting areas in which they think&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>could improve, and it's those areas that Grinding Gear Games is addressing in <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a new blog post</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-early-access-xyclucian.jpg?itok=_Np3dB-u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-early-access-xyclucian.jpg?itok=74ju7gR7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>has met with a positive reception, but players are identifying some areas of improvement as well.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Grinding Gear says that there are a number of features raised by user feedback that the studio feels need to be "urgently addressed".</p>

<p>First up, dodge rolling is being changed so that players are "trapped less often", although Grinding Gear notes that it does want players to run the risk of becoming trapped by enemies if they don't use their dodge rolls smartly.</p>

<p>Other changes include the checkpoint system, which is being expanded to reduce the "tedious" nature of retreading maps to return to objectives, as well as changes to items to make&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>more "rewarding".</p>

<p>Various other areas of improvement are in Grinding Gear's crosshairs too, including currency, map mods, and endgame maps. If you don't spot your issue here, Grinding Gear assures players that there are "lots more things coming" as well.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you can probably guess, the sequel to 2013's free-to-play action RPG&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. It adds various new gameplay features and mechanics, as well as new weapons, visual improvements, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

<p>Marvel Rivals’ Trophies and Achievements require you to explore the furthest reaches of the roster to succeed. You need to master magicians and punish purveyors of chaos, so let’s take you through the whole Marvel Rivals list.</p>



<p>A free-to-play hero shooter sounds like a tired concept. Everything now is free-to-play, live service, and rich with cosmetics and microtransactions. Yet, Marvel Rivals has cracked the code: Enticing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in the first three days</a> and teasing a big list of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked characters</a> still to come.</p>



<p>It has game modes galore, a multitude of multiplayer maps, and also a hefty list of extra tasks. The Marvel Rivals Achievement and Trophies list is close to being Galactus-sized, and it needs you to keep your gameplay interesting.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-marvel-rivals">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You need some Magik on your side. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals has 41 PlayStation Trophies and a reduced figure of 40 Xbox Achievements</strong>—meaning you’ve got to be the most super of superheroes to get them all!</p>



<p>Trophy hunters and Achievement hoarders know the Platinum Trophy is the difference between PlayStation and Xbox. Getting every Achievement on Xbox comes with a personal smug look of satisfaction, whereas blue-brand players claim a converted Platinum Trophy. Either way, Rivals’ list is sure to take some time, and there’s a reason.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-achievement-amp-trophy">Every Marvel Rivals Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p>Near enough every Marvel Rivals Trophy and Achievement needs you to achieve an incredible feat using one of the F2P shooter’s many launch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-character-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters</a>. I think it’s a great idea as the objectives are doable and logical, and encourage you to try out every hero.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/corsair-virtuoso-max-gaming-headset-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Gaming audio remains a crucial, but often under-appreciated aspect of the experience. That’s downright criminal when composers like Gareth Coker, Bear McCreary and Masayoshi Soken are bearing their souls, but there is a way to make things right. Buy yourself a gaming headset and make sure that audio sounds as good as humanly possible. If we’re getting serious about things, then Corsair’s latest, the Virtuoso Max, should be on your radar, but if you want a serious headset, you’re going to have to pay a serious price for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing VIRTUOSO MAX WIRELESS - Sounds So Good, It Changes Everything" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bks_UB64Xto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Virtuoso Max is big. I’d even go so far as to say it’s massive. Over the years I’ve tested a multitude of headsets, and alongside Razer’s Nari headset line, this is one of the largest I’ve used. That’s balanced out somewhat by the amount of tech that Corsair have shoved inside the Virtuoso Max, and the extremely premium feel that the entire headset boasts.</p>


<p>That size begins with the included leatherette case. It’s a wonderful thing for keeping your headset free of dust and damage, but it’s going to take up a large chunk of anyone’s rucksack in return. Inside, the Virtuoso Max is snuggly nestled into specially-designed cavities, while there’s also space for the charging cable, and the removable microphone boom arm.</p>
<p>The leather of the case ties into the external surface of the headband, embossed with some Corsair branding, and immediately setting the tone for the rest of the headset’s build. The joints, sizing spacers and the earpieces are all fabricated from brushed metal, cool to the touch, weighty, and practically indestructible. Each earpiece boasts a moveable dial, one used for controlling the volume and the other chat balance, though you can customise these as you choose. These are so smooth and seamless that interacting with them feels… well, powerful. You have absolute control, and there’s no hint of the cheaper materials that you might find in other headsets.</p>

<p>Three sectors of an RGB circle on each earpiece, and you can alter these to a colour or effect of your choice, or, if you’re a major Corsair proponent on PC, you can sync the lighting up with your PC case and its innards. I loved this feature, not least because I’ve got several Corsair components, and it took mere moments to have rainbow effects dancing across my head, and being reflected onto the walls. My partner will tell you that this is both unnecessary, and visually annoying, but I will tell you it’s cool, and I’m pretty sure I’m right on this one.</p>
<p>Those earpieces are adorned with mesh-covered memory foam pads, and here’s where I’m most torn about the Virtuoso Max. We’ll get to how they sound – excellent, if you want a taster – but, the comfort levels aren’t quite where I’d hoped they would be.</p>

<p>The earpieces are firmer than you’d expect, and given that that’s the primary and most obvious point you interact with the headset, I wanted something softer and more forgiving, like the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/18/nacon-rig-600-pro-hs-wicked-cushions-special-edition-review/">Nacon 600’s Wicked Cushions</a> upgrade, or the still-great Astro A50’s incredibly plush ear cushions. It’s not that the Virtuoso Max are uncomfortable, they’re not, but I expected something more luxurious when they’re sitting at the top end of the premium gaming headset bracket.</p>
<p>The headband padding is a lot gentler though, and thanks to this you can wear the Virtuoso Max through many hours of gaming, without pain or weariness setting in. The premium build does mean that they’re weightier than a number of other headsets, so that’s worth considering if you’re particularly intolerant of a heavier pair of headphones, but I didn’t find it an issue.</p>
<p>The Virtuoso Max comes in an Xbox and PlayStation flavour, but you’ll really want the former if you want to use it cross-platform – this will work with basically everything thanks to a simple double tap of the Custom button switching between PC/PlayStation/Switch or Xbox. Connection is via the 2.4 GHz USB-A wireless dongle or over Bluetooth, and as we’re seeing more and more often, you can be connected to both your mobile by Bluetooth and your gaming device via the dongle at the same time. That means it’s much easier to stay in touch with your real-world life, which may or may not be a benefit for you, or to listen to your own music if you’re set on destroying a game developer’s carefully constructed medieval RPG atmosphere with some K-pop.</p>
<p>Via the wireless connection the audio is simply stunning. It is rich, detailed and enveloping, dragging you to the centre of the action with the sheer clarity the Virtuoso Max offers. I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio</a> every day for weeks, and the gorgeous vocal-led soundtrack sounded vibrant and immediately affecting, its unusual tones made all the more striking by the audio delivery. Similarly, I’ve also returned to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/22/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review/">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, experiencing Soken’s dramatic compositions with new-found details thanks to the Virtuoso Max. If you’re looking for top-tier gaming audio, the Virtuoso Max handily delivers it.</p>

<p>That’s made all the better with the inclusion of Active Noise Cancellation. The Virtusoso Max eliminates an impressive amount of external noise – helped in part by its firmer ear cushions and already-good passive isolation – and blocks out a good degree of extraneous noise like dishwashers and background traffic. It struggles a little more with percussive noises, like typing on my mechanical keyboard, but overall it helps you to focus in on your game, or to really appreciate the audio design of the game you’re playing.</p>
<p>It deals well with everything, including music, and I’ve spent a great deal of time with both the soundtrack to Arcane’s Season 2, and the new Linkin Park album, both of which were nailed by the Virtuoso Max. The Arcane-specific reworked version of Heavy Is The Crown simply sounds stunning, Emily Armstrong and Mike Shinoda’s vocals carrying power and precision over the atmospheric instrumentation.</p>
<p>That clarity doesn’t quite carry over to the Bluetooth connection, and there’s a distinct step down in terms of audio quality compared to the bespoke wireless option. That’s not surprising in the scheme of things – listening to high bitrate audio over the two different mediums is always going to leave the Bluetooth side of things suffering, particularly when the Corsair Max can only handle basic SDC and AAC codecs – &nbsp;but there isn’t the buoyancy or life that you find via the wireless dongle.</p>
<p>There’s two microphone options, with an in-built mic perfect for picking up a phone call, while the detachable mic arm offers a huge upgrade in terms of performance. Firstly, the mic arm is strong and flexible, attaching via a bespoke USB-C socket, and once attached there’s no chance of it being knocked out. You can then angle the mic into exactly the position you want, where it will then stay throughout your play session until you push it back out of the way or remove it. Its performance is excellent, with teammates commenting on how clear the audio was in comparison to the ageing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/razer-nari-ultimate-headset-review/">Razer Nari Ultimate</a> that I often grab.</p>

<p>Corsair have given you a huge amount of control over the Virtuoso Max via their iCUE software, letting you customise your audio via the EQ, tinker with the control setup, and alter the RGB lighting. Pushing the microphone performance even further is the inclusion of NVIDIA Broadcast technologies, and once you’ve downloaded the additional software it adds the option of background noise removal from your input, giving you incremental control over the strength of the effect, and letting you pre-record your voice to see exactly how it sounds.</p>
<p>At £279.99, the Virtusoso Max is well priced amongst the top-end of the premium headset market, and if you’re after one of the best-sounding headsets out there, it’s well worth considering. Alternatively, the Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro (£329.99) and the renewed Logitech G Astro A50 X (£319.99) offer similar multi-platform tech while both being arguably more comfortable. There’s also the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro, which, alongside the Nova Pro, share the very cool dual battery option, but when the Virtuoso Max boasts a 60hr battery life (without RGB), it’s not really something that’s a definitive win for either headset.</p>

NetEase’s update doesn’t have any balance changes, instead being focused on bug fixes. However, there’s slight overlap, as one glitch the patch fixes effectively gives the Vanguard Doctor Strange a bit of a nerf. That’s because fans had discovered a way to immediately charge the Sorcerer Supreme’s ultimate ability to full with just one well-placed portal.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full patch notes</a></span> run down all the bugs and fixes squashed in the update, several of which are mundane things like players getting caught in a map’s geometry or graphical hitches. But the big one is a change to Doctor Strange’s ultimate charge that specifically addresses any environmental kills the character pulls off. A common strategy for Doctor Strange players is to create a portal in front of an enemy spawn room and have it open up above a hole on the map so your foes fall to their deaths. Due to an apparent glitch, this would boost Doctor Strange’s ultimate charge to nearly 100 percent.</p><p>As a temporary fix, NetEase is disabling the portals’ terrain kill attribution, meaning that the game will not register these deaths as Doctor Strange’s kills. As such, a Strange player will not receive any of the passive benefits like ult charge or scoreboard kills for this strategy. NetEase says it will be reinstating those benefits in a future update, but only after it has been able to address the ultimate charge bug. It’s a slight bummer, but portals are still effective in getting an easy team kill.</p><p>The full patch notes read as follows:</p><h2 id="h89402"><a id=""></a><strong><em>General</em></strong></h2><p><em>· When playing highlights and recordings, crosshair deviation would be significant, and there was a possibility for lag. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Changing where Highlights were saved would cause the game to crash. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Players joining a Quick Match as a replacement may not be able to see heroes’ equipped costumes. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Mission progress on the Season Event screen would not display correctly. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Fixed some textual errors. More fixes will be coming in a future update.</em><br><em>· After a crash, the game had a chance to freeze for a long period of time before closing. This issue has been resolved, and now the game will close after crashing.</em><br><em>· Fixed some relatively common crash issues. </em></p><h3 id="h89403"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Maps &amp; Game Modes</em></strong></h3><p><em>· On certain maps (particularly Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface), special collisions on the edges would cause the player’s character to become stuck or clip through and enter strange areas. These issues have been largely resolved, but as this affects multiple maps and areas, this bug may be present elsewhere. We will work to continue fixing such issues and develop a solution to thoroughly prevent them.</em></p><p><em>· In the foggy areas of Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Birnin T’Challa:</em><br><em> - Fog would disappear from Hela and Storm’s perspectives when they activated their Ultimates. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - After Jeff the Land Shark was revived while in the fog, his teammates and enemies would not be able to see the special effects of Joyful Splash. This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>· In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven - Frozen Airfield:</em><br><em> - In Competitive, if a player was KO’d while moving near a target area, it would cause the lightings to behave abnormally. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - During matches, disconnecting and reconnecting could cause desynchronization of some doors (i.e., a door looked to be closed, but the player could walk through; a door looked to be open, but the player couldn’t walk through). This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>· Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven - Eldritch Monument:</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Adam Warlock used his Ultimate, his teammates would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Thor or Loki were revived by Hela’s team-up ability, they would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Jeff the Land Shark used his Ultimate to devour characters, they would potentially become stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Winter Soldier hit an enemy with his Ultimate and they landed right on the target area platform, damage may be lost. This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>· When switching between rounds in Competitive, if the destination was not the last stage of a map, it would cause the vehicle’s effective range to not display when it approached the destination, impacting determination of the effective occupation range. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Upon reaching the third round in Competitive Convoy or Convergence, heroes had a chance to carry over their Ultimate energy from the second round. This issue has been resolved, and heroes will no longer inherit their Ultimate energy. </em></p><h3 id="h89404"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Heroes</em></strong></h3><p><em>· When Wolverine had his Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume equipped, no ability voice lines other than the Undying Animal ability’s line would play.

This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· When Iron Fist used pings, the corresponding voice lines would not be triggered. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· The description for ADS sensitivity in Black Widow’s settings was incorrect. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· In certain situations, Black Widow’s Ultimate would not recover energy as intended. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· In certain extreme situations, Captain America’s Ultimate wouldn’t end as intended. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· When Doctor Strange’s portals triggered terrain KOs, they would mistakenly restore Doctor Strange’s Ultimate energy. For now, we have disabled the portals’ terrain KO attribution to temporarily fix this issue (i.e., terrain KOs will not count toward Doctor Strange’s own KOs). Rest assured, this bug will be resolved in a future update, at which time we will restore the portals’ KO attribution.</em></p><h2 id="h89405"><a id=""></a><strong><em>PC</em></strong></h2><p><em>· Using FSR 3 frame generation technology to modify the resolution could cause memory leaks, resulting in blurry models.

That’s because <strong>you can only get Broken Weapons by digging in one of the four areas of the Mythopia biome</strong>.</p><p>Unfortunately, digging is one of <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>’s most tedious jobs, so you’ll be spending a lot of time just holding down your interact button as you watch your character dig holes. And since Broken Weapons share drop rates with coins and other materials that can be found while digging, you could get drops back-to-back or not see a single Broken Weapon after digging 20 times. </p><p>Because of this frustrating drop rate, you’ll thank yourself later if you bring along a digging companion who can make sure you get an extra Broken Weapon each time you find one. This will literally double the speed of your grind.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-recommend-id="image://0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-recommend-id="image://0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Additionally, you can pair this task with building up your collection of cooking ingredients. Snag around 50 of each type of seed in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> and then dig for as long as you need to to score the amount of Broken Weapons you’d like. Afterward, plant and water all of those seeds.</p><p>Two birds, one stone! Now you have plenty of Broken Weapons <em>and</em> a solid start on getting all of the dishes made in your meals collection.</p><p>You’ll definitely want to keep at it and find as many Broken Weapons as you can, as this crafting material serves as an important part of finishing your crafting collection in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> as well. Plus, some of the furniture you can make with the item is pretty cool, and you wouldn’t want to miss out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been officially announced that Conan the Barbarian will join Mortal Kombat 1 on January 21, 2025.</p>



<p>The announcement came from <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1866488904121282808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ed Boon</a> on X (formerly Twitter), which showed a brief snippet of Conan the Barbarian in action.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to leakers, Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2 are some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last characters to be coming to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster</a>. Rumors suggest that Kombat Pack 3 and the second-story expansion for Mortal Kombat 1 have since been canceled due to poor expansion sales. Several Mortal Kombat insiders have since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-mortal-kombat-insiders-say-that-future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-is-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated the claims</a> since the original rumor.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has contacted NetherRealm Studios for comment on the claims.</p>

                <p>After an 11-year gap between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/" data-ref-id="2900-5988">Path of Exile 2</a> got off to a hot start earlier this month with its early-access period. Although fans have responded very favorably to the game so far, Path of Exile 2 developer Grinding Gear Games has already taken in player feedback for some post-launch changes.</p><p>In a post on Path of Exile 2's <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>, the developer noted that some of the most pressing issues have already been addressed with a new update, while others will be fixed in an upcoming patch. One area that Grinding Gear is moving more cautiously on is item-drop frequency. To give players more rewards, the number of rare monsters is being increased, while more valuable drops can be earned from defeating the extra-difficult rare monsters that appear later in the game.</p><p>Some of the adjustments being saved for a later patch include dodge-roll modifications that will make it easier to avoid being trapped by monsters, the ability to teleport between saved checkpoints, the addition of more checkpoints, and a change to the minimap that will make rare monsters appear when there are 200 remaining, instead of 50 remaining.</p><p>Grinding Gear previously announced that Path of Exile 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-on-ps5-and-xbox-will-have-couch-co-op-with-cross-progression/1100-6523835/" data-ref-id="1100-6523835">features cross-play and cross-progression</a> across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The publisher also assured players that the sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-replace-the-first-game-after-all/1100-6516398/" data-ref-id="1100-6516398">isn't replacing the original Path of Exile</a>. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-passes-over-1-million-early-access-players-dev-warns-of-server-struggles/1100-6528281/" data-ref-id="1100-6528281">Path of Exile 2 rushed passed the 1 million players</a> mark in early access.</p><p>The notes for Path of Exile 2's 0.1.0c patch are reproduced below.</p><ul><li>Campaign bosses killed after the first kill will now drop less currency items, replacing them with other items.</li><li>Increased the drop rate of Regal Orbs.</li><li>Significantly increased the drop rate of Gemcutter's Prisms.</li><li>A single Gemcutter's Prism also improves the Quality of a Skill Gem by +5% (previously +1%).</li><li>Lowered the drop rate of Chaos Orbs and distributed it amongst the other more valued Currency Items (Like Regal Orbs, Exalted Orbs).</li><li>Lowered the drop rate of Artificer's Orbs and distributed it to Lesser Jeweller's Orbs.</li><li>Disenchanting Rare Items with 6 Modifiers now provides 2 Regal Shards (previously 1). The value displayed will still show as 1 until a later patch.</li><li>Increased the values of all Prefix Modifiers that can roll on Waystones. We've also adjusted the chances of getting the more commonly powerful Modifiers such as increases to Rarity and Pack Size.</li><li>Monster Modifiers now grant higher amounts of Item Rarity and Item Quantity. This is most common on Magic and Rare enemies, but also affects Unique Enemies if applied through various Endgame Mechanics like the Deadly Evolution Keystone.</li><li>Increased the chance for Rare Monsters in Maps to have 3 or 4 modifiers.</li><li>Rare Monsters in Map areas are now revealed on the minimap when there are 200 Monsters remaining (previously 50).</li><li>Fixed a bug where some Persistent Buff Skills, such as Raging Spirits and Mana Remnants, were not working for the Infernalist when in Demon Form.</li><li>Fixed a bug where you could sometimes be unable to interact with the Map Device in The Ziggurat Refuge.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Monsters Shattered in a Blood Circle Ultimatum Encounter were not contributing blood.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause the instance to permanently stop time (freeze) when trying to revive a Chronomancer.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Rare Monsters could not be found within the Chimeral Wetlands.</li><li>Fixed a bug where "Move only" was name-locking.</li><li>Fixed three instance crashes.</li><li>Fixed a client crash.</li></ul>

                <p>New information continues to come to light about the suspect in the brazen killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, including a connection to the world of video games. The suspect, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, worked at Civilization studio Firaxis Games, a spokesperson confirmed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/493418/uhc-shooter-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-arrest-firaxis-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>.</p><p>What appears to be <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luigi-mangione/details/experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mangione's LinkedIn page</a> states that he worked as a UI programming intern at Firaxis from May 2016-August 2017; he said he fixed more than 300 UI bugs in the game. Also in 2016, Mangione's alleged LinkedIn page says he was the founder and president of <a href="https://pennupgrade.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Upgrade,"</a> a game development and research team at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Following his Firaxis internship, Mangione's subsequent career roles were seemingly outside of the game development scene.</p><p>Mangione was arrested on Monday, December 9, after he was spotted at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was later charged with the murder of Thompson in Manhattan on the morning of December 4. Mangione is currently detained in Pennsylvania; he is expected to be extradited to New York to face charges.</p><p>According to a law enforcement source talking to <a href="https://apnews.com/live/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-updates-day-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Associated Press</a>, Mangione was in possession of a three-page, handwritten letter that said in part, "I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone." The note reportedly added, "I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites had it coming."</p><p>Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said in a court appearance that Mangione had $10,000 in cash when he was detained, including $2,000 in foreign currency. Police said they found a black, 3D-printed pistol and a 3D-printed black suppressor in Mangione's backpack. Police documents said Mangione "became quiet and started to shake" after being asked if he had been in New York recently.</p>

            <p>
A maker of gaming hardware accessories has removed a trailer that showed the blurry outline of what was clearly intended to be Nintendo's under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Accessories manufacturer Satisfye is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">next company to begin selling peripherals for Switch 2</a> - even though Nintendo is yet to formally announce the Switch successor or detail how it'll look. 
</p>
<p>
Product <a href="https://www.satisfye.com/products/zengrip-2-bundle">pages</a> for the ZenGrip 2, a Switch 2 console grip, and a carry case for Nintendo's next console are still live. (Neither specifically use the name "Switch" anywhere, though state they are "Made for Next Gen Console" with the image of a current-gen Switch.)
</p>
<p>
However, a trailer for the products which featured hardware docked into the Switch 2 grip has now been removed - although not before the internet took notice. 
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that the ZenGrip 2's product page states that it is an "Expected Design" and that the accessory "will be tuned to final specifications". That said, now only three months (at most) away from Switch 2 finally being shown, the device's form factor is fairly well known.
</p>
<p>
While some console companies do share product specifications with third-parties ahead of launch to speed up peripheral production, it's likely we've already seen a relatively-final version of Switch 2 via previous leaks. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Purported images of the Switch 2 shell have been floating around online for several months, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">Digital Foundry dubbed as "almost certainly real"</a>. These show a console almost identical in form factor to the current Switch, albeit with a larger screen size, a second small button on the right Joy-Con,  and what look to be magnet attachments on each Joy-Con's side.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-designs-posted-by-3d-model-enthusiast-setting-internets-tongues-wagging">3D-printed plans for Switch 2 based on leaks</a> also exist, which fans have been 3D printing versions of for months just for kicks.
</p>
<p>
Has ZenGrip 2 got insider knowledge? Is it simply trying to get ahead of the competition with a neat stunt to gain attention? Or why not both?
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is yet to announce any details of its next console, other than to confirm it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">will announce Switch 2 properly before 31st March 2025</a>, the end of its current financial year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/astrometica-early-access-preview-empty-space-in-more-ways-than-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Space survival crafting title&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55334a98-ed16-459b-82d9-b2284972d02a" href="https://techraptor.net/games/astrometica" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>Astrometica</em></strong></a>&nbsp;has launched into Early Access, letting us explore what it has to offer the genre. A well-polished game, it centers around a survivor of a large spaceship explosion. Crashing into an asteroid belt, you're looking for other survivors, a way to remain alive, and a way home. There are signs of humanity left behind, but no one else is seen throughout your time floating through space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite part of&nbsp;<em>Astrometica</em>&nbsp;is the music. Going through space and listening to ethereal vibes that brought me back to my childhood days in the 90s really hit a high note. It feels like space, the largeness, being full and empty all at once. I could sit there and just listen to the music for hours as it fully enhances the gameplay experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrometica-mining-tool-space-view.jpg?itok=GmWZfz5C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrometica-mining-tool-space-view.jpg?itok=wje8krdd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That feeling of empty space is prevalent in&nbsp;<em>Astrometica.</em>&nbsp;While this lends itself to the feeling of being alone and without aid, it also works against the game. There's simply not enough to explore or do. You can fully explore the available area, visit the story locations, build a base and vehicles, and still be done in about 10-15 hours. This includes the many, many deaths&nbsp; There are multiple areas labeled WIP, including the two warp locations you discover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even the story feels empty. You've crash-landed in an asteroid belt. There's another group of survivors from the same ship. While you find one of them, you don't find the other two or learn what happened to them. Along with the notes they've left behind, there are logs from the original miners of the asteroid belt. This story points towards a mysterious force and alien invasion. You encounter some of these aliens in one location, but beyond that, there's only one other enemy to watch out for. There's no conclusion to either storyline, no solution to the mystery, nothing. This will hopefully be wrapped up as more content is added during early access.</p>

<p>These logs and messages are left behind in the locations you explore. If you don't pay attention to them, however, you can easily forget there's even a storyline pushing you forward. This isn't that unusual for survival titles that focus on crafting, but crafting in <i>Astrometica</i>&nbsp;is basic, with few variations in modules you can build, vehicles, and crafting devices. There's a single plant you can grow, basic combinations for cooking, and a limited number of upgrades for equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrometica-base-building-build-tool.jpg?itok=iye50Ikd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrometica-base-building-build-tool.jpg?itok=wdwMqPZz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It seems like the focus of BeryMery was on fine-tuning and polishing the experience, instead of shoving in a bunch of content that may be buggy. There was a single bug that I experienced during the course of the preview, where a gold bar turned into a tool. This happened one other time when collecting ore, but it didn't affect the overall gameplay. Music didn't cut in and out, items worked as intended, and crafting was simple and didn't result in a janky base with pieces clipping into one another. There was no clipping, so much so that I died multiple times from running into asteroid pieces, part of my base, and even my vehicle.&nbsp;That polish is great for an Early Access game that's expected to be buggy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm hoping that further development of the title with access to WIP areas will expand upon the story and available activities. As it stands,&nbsp;<em>Astrometica</em>&nbsp;feels like an addition to another title versus a main game. There's nothing that drew me to keep playing, nothing that stands out as a wow factor differentiating it from the competition. It is an extremely well-crafted game, but that's simply not enough for me to consistently follow and play an Early Access title among a sea of games.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><em>Astrometica&nbsp;was previewed on PC over the course of 10 hours using a key provided by&nbsp;RockGame S.A. and BeryMery. Screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Although seasons are ending, there is a silver lining.&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode, which Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-offline" rel="nofollow">confirmed would eventually happen back in December last year</a>, is being introduced today as part of Season 4's seventh episode.</p>

You can check out <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36119520746515-OFFLINE-MODE-FAQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rocksteady's FAQ</a> if you want more info about how&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode will work.</p>

<p>A new playable character is also being introduced in this season in the form of Deathstroke, who has three distinct playstyles: Assassin, Mercenary, and Strategist. As you'd expect, each carries its own Talents to distribute as well.</p>

Back in February, Warner Bros admitted that sales of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">had been disappointing</a>; in fact, it was the major contributing factor to a $200 million writedown for the studio's gaming division.</p>

<p>In September, developer Rocksteady was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;mainly focused on the QA division, with Rocksteady employees reportedly directly citing&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s underperformance as the reason for the layoffs.</p>

<p>As for what Rocksteady's up to now, the studio is apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">helping out with a Director's Cut version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and it's also reportedly looking to pitch a new single-player game. Let's hope it meets with more success than&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>
