			<p>New Battlefield 6 footage leaked online, providing a new look at the impressive destruction elements of the new entry in the series, ground vehicles, massive maps, and more.</p>
<p>The new footage, recorded during a recent alpha playtest conducted via the new testing environment Battlefield Labs, provides a great look at some of the features and mechanics that will be found in the next entry in the series, which has yet to be officially announced. The destruction mechanics, in particular, look quite impressive, as does the jet gameplay set in a map that looks outright massive.</p>

<p>The destructible elements have always been a very important part of the Battlefield experience, and they will be just as important as in the yet-to-be-officially-announced Battlefield 6. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/">Earlier this month</a>, the development team provided an update on them, saying that their goals for destruction are <em>"centered around adding further gameplay depth by allowing you to reshape the environment and transform your surroundings toward a tactical advantage."</em>&nbsp; As highlighted by the new leaked gameplay, destruction is being designed around easily identifiable visual and audio language that will allow players to immediately understand what can be destroyed and altered, creating an intuitive and rewarding environment that players can easily shape.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 is currently in development for unspecified platforms. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>The Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916839982842450100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC system requirements</a> have been revealed today, detailing the system specifications needed to run the game at launch.</p>
<p>As expected for a multiplayer game aiming to get as many players on board as possible, the next game developed by FromSoftware is not going to be particularly demanding, as the developer recommends dated CPUs like the Intel Core i5-11500 and AMD Ryzen 5 5600 and GPUs like the GTX 1070 and Radeon RX Vega 56 to play the game, although it's not specified what resolution and framerate should be expected with the recommended specifications. Elden Ring Nightreign will also not require a lot of free storage space, as the game will only be 30 GB in size.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The minimum and recommended PC specifications for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> are now available. <a href="https://t.co/pgfsTZzO1M">pic.twitter.com/pgfsTZzO1M</a></p>
<p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1916839982842450100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When Elden Ring Nightreign was announced<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/"> last year</a>, I wasn't particularly excited about its multiplayer approach, but the Closed Network Test held earlier this year made me more interested in the game. The experience was extremely easy to get into and fun, especially when all involved players properly worked together, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>The basics of Elden Ring Nightreign are really straightforward. From the iconic Roundtable Hold, players can decide to undertake expeditions with three other players, picking one of four Nightfarers, which will become eight in the launch version, all coming with unique special abilities, before getting thrown into one of the game's maps, where they need to survive for three days. At the end of the third day, the squad will get to fight one of the main bosses and will be rewarded with relics that represent the game's permanent upgrade system, which improves characters with a variety of different perks. Relics can also be obtained if the squad fails to get to the third day and defeat the final boss, so players still get something for taking part in expeditions.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 30th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-bandai-namco-announces.1175421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time once again to cast your gaze to the Lands Between, as publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware have revealed another major&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales milestone has been passed.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916855058097938564" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has managed to pass the 30 million sales mark, which means the open-world Soulslike action RPG has picked up another five million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">since June last year</a>.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this figure refers to sales across all platforms, and it also appears to include both digital and physical shipments. Additionally, the figure doesn't include sales for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">hit five million after just three days</a>&nbsp;on its release last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-sales-30m-cliff.jpg?itok=3_--U5rJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-sales-30m-cliff.jpg?itok=Nbh0jMGK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has managed to cross the 30 million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say that by any metric, this new milestone further cements&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s remarkable success. The figure puts the game in the same league as Warner Bros' phenomenally popular&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">crossed the same milestone back in November</a>.</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s huge success, then, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">create a followup to the game</a> in the form of the multiplayer-focused&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>makes a lot of sense, at least from an intellectual property-focused perspective.</p>

<p>Even if you're not feeling up to trying out&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s formula-departing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-inspired gameplay, though, you needn't fret.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is also making its way to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> this year, complete with the&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>expansion and some special new armor.</p>

<p>The game isn't even the only FromSoftware title in development for Nintendo's new console; it's joined by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, a PvPvE-focused title coming to the new machine in 2026.</p>




<p>While you wait for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>to land on Switch, you can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/elden-ring/9p3j32ctxlrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-dev-says-community-built-on-lies.1175418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular Wii homebrew tool Wii Homebrew Channel has been shut down, and its developers have launched an excoriating attack on the originators of the software on which the channel is (or was) based.</p>

<p>As spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557212509478946" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OatmealDome</a>, the Wii Homebrew Channel <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow/hbc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> has now been archived, and homebrew group Fail0verflow has blamed the shutdown on the discovery that the libogc library, on which Wii Homebrew Channel is based, contains stolen code.</p>

<p>According to Fail0verflow, "large portions of libogc were stolen directly from the Nintendo SDK (software development kit) or games using the Nintendo SDK". The group says it "thought that at least significant parts" of the library "were original", and so "reluctantly continued to use the project".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-github.jpg?itok=WcPtCnIt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-github.jpg?itok=KWi5liHs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is what you'll find if you visit the Wii Homebrew Channel GitHub page (at time of writing).</figcaption></figure><p>However, Fail0verflow says it was recently revealed that certain parts of libogc were "stolen from RTEMS", an open-source real-time operating system for which the library "remove[d] all attribution and copyright information".</p>

<p>According to the group, libogc's developers' actions go "far beyond ignorance about the copyright implications of reverse engineering Nintendo binaries" and stray into "outright deliberate, malicious code theft and copyright infringement".</p>

<p>Fail0verflow says libogc's developers are "not interested in tracking this issue, finding a solution, [or] informing the community of the problematic copyright status of the project", going as far as to say the Wii homebrew community as a whole is "built on top of a pile of lies and copyright infringement".</p>

<p>As OatmealDome further <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557214904430754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a>, libogc serves as "the core of all homebrew apps" when it comes to GameCube and Wii homebrew solutions, so Fail0verflow's accusations aren't small potatoes in this regard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamecube-libogc-homebrew.jpg?itok=0DIBWMLl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamecube-libogc-homebrew.jpg?itok=2n6xU0zE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>libogc also forms the basis of GameCube homebrew.</figcaption></figure><p>The shutdown of the Wii Homebrew Channel, or rather the cessation of ongoing development, is a massive blow to the Wii homebrew scene, but unfortunately, Fail0verflow says it can't encourage further development as it's "impossible to legally and legitimately compile this software".</p>

<p>Some might say Fail0verflow is being hypocritical given emulation is a common usage for Wii homebrew software, but I don't think that's entirely fair. Modding a Wii with homebrew software is far from illegal; it's playing copyrighted games or software that crosses that particular line.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll have to wait and see what impact this has on the Wii homebrew scene as a whole, but it's not likely to be a positive one. Stay tuned for more.</p>

        <p>Hello darkness my new friend.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
At long last, dark mode is finally available on RPS. We’ve wanted to bring a dark mode to the site for ages, and many of you have been politely, passionately, and persistently asking for it for quite a while. Thank you for your patience while we reconfigured our stylesheets.
</p>
<p>
You’ll find a new toggle in the site's footer which allows you to switch between light and dark modes at your leisure. Choose what works best for you. Set it to "Auto" and the site will match whatever colour preferences you have set in your computer or phone's operating system. We'll remember your settings for next time, too.
</p>
<p>
We’ve tested the new theme across the site, from long reads to hardware breakdowns to the blessed comment section, but you might spot the odd bug. If anything looks weirdly luminous or hauntingly invisible, feel free to let us know.
</p>
<p>
As ever, thanks for reading, supporting, and enjoy the new look (and extra battery efficiency).

The demo event only allowed fans 10 minutes to play <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in docked mode, but they could choose from a range of save files located at different points in the game. Naturally,  Ikaboze chose the one near the very end of the game, ditched all of Link’s gear, and marched on Hyrule Castle to defeat Ganon. </p><p>The end of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> can be a brutal gauntlet, but Ikaboze is able to traverse the castle quickly to get inside, dodging the army of Guardians waiting to blast him into oblivion. Once he’s inside the Calamity Ganon battle, the fight ends up taking less than two minutes, thanks to clutch timing and rush attacks. The final phase outside in Hyrule field takes a bit longer, but the<em> Zelda </em>YouTuber still manages to dispatch Dark Beast Ganon in just three minutes. He takes barely any damage during the fight. A crowd that gathered behind  Ikaboze cheered when he hit the ending cinematic. </p><p>This could put  Ikaboze in the running for being the first person to ever beat Calamity Ganon in the Switch 2 version of<em> Breath of the Wild</em>.

            <p>People Can Fly, the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a>, has revealed what Project Maverick actually is.</p>
<p>Project Maverick was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-working-on-new-project-based-on-microsoft-ip">first reported back in June 2023</a>. At this time, it was said People Can Fly's Project Maverick would be fully funded by Microsoft with a budget of $30m-50m, and based on one of the Xbox maker's existing properties.</p>
<p>While details have remained sparse since then, People Can Fly has now revealed what Project Maverick is via its "about us" section in the <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/investors-en/#o-firmie">studio's investor website</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/cars/news/pcf-s-project-maverick-xbox-game-has-been-revealed/ar-AA1DLC3n">XboxEra</a>). And, perhaps unsurprisingly, Project Maverick is actually Gears of War: E-Day. The developer was revealed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio">working with The Coalition on the next Gears of War game in January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>People Can Fly is "currently working on seven projects", the developer's investor website now reads. "Gemini, a new AAA game developed in partnership with global publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>; Maverick (Gears of War: E-Day), in collaboration with Microsoft; Echo, a mode to the existing game developed for Krafton; and projects Bifrost and Victoria (Lost Rift) to be released in the self-publishing model."</p>
<p>In addition, People Can Fly is "also involved in a VR technology project named Project Bison, a new title in the immersive VR action survival genre" and Incuvo - a group subsidiary - is "actively working on the further development of a separate VR project, Green Hell VR".</p>
<p>Incuvo released the rather messy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bulletstorm-vr">Bulletstorm VR</a> port. Eurogamer's VR aficionado Ian Higton took Bulletstorm VR out for a spin on release, and he was left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-bulletstorm-vr-really-as-bad-as-everyone-says-it-is">pretty disappointed by the whole thing</a>, calling it sloppy.</p>
<p>As for Gears of War: E-Day, it's a prequel title for the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizordum-review-an-homage-to-heretic.1175370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/wizordum-review-homage-to-heretic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in a time where remasters for games are a dime a dozen, doubly so for boomer shooters. So why, then, is it the year 2025 and we still haven't seen a remaster for <em>Heretic</em> and <em>Hexen</em>, two of the most influential shooters of all time? Thankfully, Emberheart Games and <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/apogee-entertainment" rel="nofollow">Apogee Entertainment</a> have created a worthy successor to those two with <em>Wizordum</em>.</p>

<p>I'm still going to beg the powers that be to remaster those two absolute classics, but <em>Wizordum</em> certainly tickles that <em>Heretic</em> itch. It's deeply inspired by those titles, of course, but also incorporates modern elements to liven up the gameplay into something more than just an imitation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-spooky-mansion.jpg?itok=Qwk_oBVO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-spooky-mansion.jpg?itok=bvjYi57_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The best solution to killing a ghost is with a giant fireball, of course.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Wizordum: </em>Every Level, an Adventure</h2>

<p>If you pay attention to the retro shooter scene, <em>Wizordum</em>'s been around for a bit. It's an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/wizordum-preview-nostalgic-dungeon-delving-fps" rel="nofollow">Early Access</a> title, but the final episode (and a slew of fixes and tweaks to existing episodes) make this now a complete package. With three episodes, a bunch of magical weapons, and a ton of treasure, expect <em>Wizordum </em>to take you on quite an adventure.</p>

<p>And indeed, if there is one word that comes to mind with <em>Wizordum</em>, it's that: "Adventure." Boomer shooters are often known for their winding paths, getting lost, or hunting for keys.&nbsp;But constantly retreading old paths isn't an adventure. It can feel tedious. That's not the case with <em>Wizordum</em>, thankfully, despite how vast the levels feel.</p>

<p><em>Wizordum</em>'s levels are chock-full of treasure and secrets, and if you're into secret hunting, this game is absolutely for you. If you like running into walls, pressing the action button, and hoping to find a secret area, <em>Wizordum </em>fulfills that satisfaction. Usually, you gain treasure or ammo for your curiosity, meaning exploration is rewarding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-shop.jpg?itok=tN591-G_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-shop.jpg?itok=yzEASQ7a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What are ya buyin'?</figcaption></figure><p>Treasure can then be taken and exchanged for various upgrades at the end of levels. This is one part that I didn't see in Early Access; basically, complete a level, and you can buy secondary actions for weapons, or increase your capacity to fire spells attached to your chosen character. It adds a sense of progression in a genre that doesn't usually have much of that.</p>

<p>And yes, I mentioned characters. There are two, in fact, and they come with different spells and a unique primary weapon. The Cleric with his mace, or the Sorceress with her wand, whatever you choose, means your experience will vary. The Cleric and Sorceress also vary in health, armor, and speed, so pick what fits your play style.</p>

<p>The choice of two characters does merit some replayability, but the gameplay differences aren't so vast that it's a completely different experience. Nonetheless, I could see myself going back as the Cleric in a second playthrough, once more scrounging the world for the vast amounts of treasure I missed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-episode3_1.jpg?itok=ge3fJ-4D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-episode3_1.jpg?itok=3gBrCKDR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nice.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Strong Finish for <em>Wizordum</em>'s Episode 3</h2>

<p>If exploration is so greatly emphasized in <em>Wizordum</em>, one would hope that levels have creative and distinct layouts, and that's definitely the case here. Across <em>Wizordum</em><u>'</u>s three separate episodes, you can expect to fight in monster-infested villages, swampy ruins, spooky mansions, caverns of lava, and so much more.</p>

<p>You can tell, developer Emberheart Games got more confident and creative with level design after each episode. Episode 1 plays it pretty safe, and as such is the most bland of the three. It's not bad by any means, but compared to Episode 2 and especially Episode 3, it takes some time for <em>Wizordum</em> to build up.</p>

<p>Episode 2, then, is better than Episode 1, with more creative level design and elaborate puzzles. One level, for instance, takes place on a ship full of goblins. The ship feels a bit more claustrophobic and smaller in comparison to other levels, but that layout keeps things feeling fresh.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-ep-3.jpg?itok=K8v9GLrT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-ep-3.jpg?itok=FTJ4xRHE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's also gonna get chilly.</figcaption></figure><p>Episode 3 is the cream of the crop, with much larger levels, a higher difficulty curve, and essentially just combines all of what makes <em>Wizordum</em> great into a satisfying conclusion. One level, for instance, takes place in this sprawling, maze-like mine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were numerous approaches players could take in this interconnected network of tunnels. The goal was to find several gems to unlock a certain door in the center, and the path I took to gather all of these likely will look different than yours. Even still, I didn't feel lost, which is a testament to <em>Wizordum</em>'s handy map.</p>

<p>In general,&nbsp;the final episode has a much stronger visual design, too. Episode 1 and some aspects of Episode 2 are repetitive. Episode 1, for instance, has a lot of dilapidated villages and stone buildings to the point where much of it feels like you're walking in circles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-gauntlets.jpg?itok=qOeKNvMX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-gauntlets.jpg?itok=koC1urOq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unlimited powerrrrr!!!!</figcaption></figure><h2>Runnin' and Slingin' Spells in <em>Wizordum</em></h2>

<p>Like any good retro shooter, though, level design is just one piece of the pie. Gunplay, with a diverse set of weapons, is the other crucial component for a good shooter. Thankfully, I don't have much to complain about in that regard. By and large, <em>Wizordum</em>'s gunplay feels satisfying, and players are powerful.</p>

<p>It's easy to make guns sound powerful and intimidating, but spells, that's another story. With the exception of a magic pistol, every other weapon has that wizard flavor to it. Rings that let you cast fireballs, an icicle-shooting staff, or even lightning gauntlets -- I'm a fan of them all.</p>

<p>The ice staff, in particular, makes a satisfying sound when its projectiles impact enemies. The staff freezes them in place, so you can hit them once more with a weapon to shatter them; better yet, freeze a bunch of enemies in a group and shatter them at the same time for a satisfying end to your battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-ice-staff.jpg?itok=yH6tNNuX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-ice-staff.jpg?itok=VRCQP-bv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to freeze, pal.</figcaption></figure><p>You're also armed with a supply of items a la <em>Heretic </em>and <em>Hexen</em>. These all give gameplay benefits in one way or another, be it by healing you, turning you invisible, and the like. As mentioned, characters have specific spells, and those will also come in handy a great deal, especially on higher difficulties.</p>

<p>The Sorceress, for example, can reflect projectiles with one of her spells, which is a godsend when you're being overwhelmed. There's a time-based spell that greatly increases your attack speed, and that's also handy when taking down more powerful foes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-rat.jpg?itok=aB2Q8Z2G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-rat.jpg?itok=M7aC5PzL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes you can find a rat mount, and I just like how this screenshot turned out. Looks like I'm about to run over this stupid little goblin.</figcaption></figure><h2>Wizordum Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Every episode is capped off with a boss. My review build didn't have a final boss, so my opinion could very well change, but the first two were rather dull. Like most boomer shooters, bosses amount to bullet sponges, and that just doesn't do much for me anymore. The second boss had a hint of nuance, but at the end of the day, it's point and shoot.</p>

<p>There were also a fair number of bugs, some of which I hope are fixed upon release. I fell below a level once and had to revert back to a save, for instance. Sometimes, enemies would be stuck in walls. Heck, the first boss just sat there and let me shoot him without any resistance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-screenshot.jpg?itok=HZkLgz83 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-screenshot.jpg?itok=t8td7Bl3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Such ambiance!</figcaption></figure><p>Despite a few flaws, <em>Wizordum</em> is a competent retro shooter with a lot of creativity and charm. The bright visuals serve as a nice contrast to the usual dark-and-gritty shooters, and it has a calming and whimsical soundtrack as opposed to a high-octane, all gas, no breaks sort of deal.</p>

<p>Whether you're diving into <em>Wizordum</em> for the first time or checking out the brand new Episode 3, you'll find this to be quite the enjoyable boomer shooter. No, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but not every game needs to, so with that said, it's hard to go wrong with a bit of spell-slinging action.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-star-wars<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that five more games have joined its Preservation Program, and since May 4th is just around the corner, it's&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>' turn to be recognized this time.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/lets_celebrate_may_the_4th_with_classic_star_wars_games_joining_the_gog_preservation_program" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, GOG says it wants to honor the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>franchise "by adding iconic classics from a galaxy far, far away" to the Preservation Program.</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder, the Preservation Program is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">an initiative</a> through which GOG is pledging to keep certain games updated forever, ensuring that they'll be able to run on any PC hardware whether or not their developers are still officially supporting them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-gog-preservation-program-battlefront.jpg?itok=prBu0gBt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-gog-preservation-program-battlefront.jpg?itok=6d8LCx_S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars: Battlefront&nbsp;</em>is one of the games being added to the GOG Preservation Program today.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the five games that have been added to the GOG Preservation Program today. Bear in mind these are the originals, so remasters for games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-release-date" rel="nofollow">Dark Forces</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Battlefront&nbsp;</i>aren't included here (and in the case of&nbsp;<em>Battlefront</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response" rel="nofollow">that might be a good thing</a>).</p>

<ul><li><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces&nbsp;</em>(1995)</li>
	<li><em>Star Wars: X-Wing Special Edition&nbsp;</em>(1993)</li>
	<li><em>Star Wars: TIE Fighter Special Edition&nbsp;</em>(1994)</li>
	<li><em>Star Wars Battlefront&nbsp;</em>(2004)</li>
	<li><em>Star Wars: Rebel Assault 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>(1993 and 1995, respectively)</li>
</ul><p>To celebrate these games' addition to the Preservation Program, GOG has also slapped a pretty hefty 75% discount on all of them. That discount runs until May 6th, so make sure you pick them up before then if you want any of them.</p>




<p>As for what lies ahead when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>games, the future looks bright for the franchise. Recently, Respawn and Bit Reactor <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow">revealed</a>&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>, a turn-based tactics game set towards the end of the Clone Wars.</p>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2" rel="nofollow">making its way to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Eclipse&nbsp;</em>developer Quantic Dream <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs" rel="nofollow">recently confirmed it was "unaffected"</a> by sweeping <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> at parent company NetEase, so hopefully, we'll be hearing from that game sooner rather than later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/oblivion-to-starfield-bethesdas-20-year-journey-to-elder-scrolls-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's something to be said about the loyalty of <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> fans when Bethesda can re-release a 20-year-old game with no official marketing and it still ends up at the top of Steam's bestseller list. Amusingly, there's even a non-zero chance that some of the people who are currently playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" rel="nofollow"><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a> weren't born when the game first came out.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this loyalty isn't entirely undeserved when you look at Bethesda's history. For all the complaining that people do, and some of it quite justifiable, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-15th-anniversary" rel="nofollow">Bethesda's games are very much one of a kind</a>. For RPG fans, they somewhat literally define a console generation.</p>

<p>There have been no shortage of competitors either. Every so often, an RPG comes out with better mechanics than what any Bethesda game has to offer, yet time and again, people keep flocking back to <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/morrowind-imperial-legion.jpg?itok=tiix8Oa6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/morrowind-imperial-legion.jpg?itok=bFS7P9Ka 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Patrolling Morrowind almost makes you wish for a volcanic eruption."</figcaption></figure><p>After all, it's hard to argue that contemporary games like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence" rel="nofollow">Avowed</a> </em>don't have objectively better role playing mechanics. The <em>Dragon Age</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em> games blow Bethesda games out of the water when it comes to the writing for romances and companions, not to mention actual reputation systems. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a> is in an entirely different league in almost every practical metric if you overlook the differences in sub-genre.</p>

<h2>What's in the Secret Sauce, Todd?</h2>

<p>Indeed, most people would fully acknowledge that <em>The Elder Scrolls'</em>&nbsp;approach to combat has historically been its weak point. The writing for faction quests in particular can be hit or miss too. Throw in the increasingly simplified reputation system and ever present bugs and you might wonder what do <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> games actually offer to deserve their fame.</p>

<p>The answer is that very few games on the market have player-to-NPC interaction, player-to-world interaction, NPC-to-NPC interaction, and NPC-to-world interaction running more or less seamlessly and simultaneously. To put it simply, Bethesda specializes in creating living worlds, and sometimes "it just works."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remaster-spriggan.jpg?itok=5iXcb-8d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remaster-spriggan.jpg?itok=xYvkvINp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>With graphics such as these, it's time for another <em>Skyrim </em>remaster!</figcaption></figure><p>Case in point, <em>Oblivion </em>is a 20-year-old game where NPCs have their own schedules and can react to changes in their environment. They'll walk around, go to sleep, talk to each other, and if you commit crimes, they'll react appropriately. You can then walk up and talk to, rob, murder, or simply observe most NPCs and they'll more or less act logically. The same feature (with some tweaks) has since been a key feature of Bethesda's major RPGs.</p>

<p>By comparison, most developers opt for static NPCs because it's (presumably) easier, faster, and less prone to causing problems. Recently, <em>Avowed </em>was criticized for this as you could literally steal food off people's plates and they wouldn't react at all. Was it easier for the developers? Most likely. Did it bother people who care about such things? Almost certainly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skyrim-riverwood.jpg?itok=m4G9XizD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skyrim-riverwood.jpg?itok=0QEPpxL3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If the NPCs are standing around and doing nothing in a Bethsda game, that's usually a sign that you might want to reload the area or restart the game entirely.</figcaption></figure><p>In purely practical terms, there's no difference between the two approaches. At the very least it seems doubtful that the average player is following <em>Oblivion </em>or <em>Skyrim's </em>NPCs around to make sure that they are eating and sleeping. The difference is that Bethesda's approach maintains an illusion of a living world, and for such games it goes a long way to engaging with players.</p>

<p>A living virtual world isn't created "simply" by having NPCs that can move though. The world itself needs to feel like people lived in it. In <em>The Elder Scrolls'</em>&nbsp;case, that means making up 10,000 years of history. Civilizations rise and civilizations fall, so Bethesda isn't just writing a made up culture for each of the playable races, they're also creating societies that might have gone extinct for peoples who no longer exist or have simply undergone a culture shift.</p>

<p>This means distinct clothing styles, architecture, religions, languages and naming conventions, even literature. While inspiration can be taken from real life, as evidenced by <em>Oblivion's</em> Western European-themed Cyrodiil, you've still got the truly alien Shivering Isles in the eponymous DLC and the planes of Oblivion to contend with.</p>

<p>It's nothing short of a herculean task, and while other game developers can and have produced similarly amazing work, Bethesda remains one of the best in the field for a good reason.</p>

<h2>Did Bethesda Forget The Strength of Their Own Games?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Bethesda seems to struggle once they leave their area of expertise. <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fallout-76-review-total-wasteland" rel="nofollow">Fallout 76's</a> </em>early years certainly didn't do much to disprove this notion. Between the lack of NPCs, live-service multiplayer with no private servers, and PvP where you can lose your loot, it's a small miracle that the game survived long enough to be updated to a more palatable state.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/starfield-review-interstellar-adventure" rel="nofollow"><em>Starfield</em>'s mixed reception</a>&nbsp;only intensified people's concerns regarding the future of <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>. Make no mistake, <em>Starfield </em>had some novel gameplay mechanics, but features like randomly generating the surfaces of 1,000 planets lacks widespread practical appeal. If anything, Bethesda should've realized this when <em>Oblivion </em>was first released, if not earlier with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22320/The_Elder_Scrolls_III_Morrowind_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" rel="nofollow"><em>Morrowind</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eso-content-pass.jpg?itok=_uheZOIT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eso-content-pass.jpg?itok=aLnJr93Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Supposedly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306130/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online/" rel="nofollow"><em>Elder Scrolls Online</em></a> is a decent way to get your<em> Elder Scrolls</em> fix if you don't mind MMO mechanics</figcaption></figure><p>That AAA game development is trending towards greater complexity is not a comforting fact either. Bethesda's games are notoriously buggy as is. One can only imagine the problems that can arise when you add more features, more NPCs, more of everything. Granted, most of the common bugs in Bethesda's games aren't really game breaking, so it's more of an unfounded fear than anything else unless you are diving deep into modding.</p>

<p>The potential for feature creep is a far greater concern. We went from building our own houses in <em>Skyrim </em>to building settlements in<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fallout-4-5-year-anniversary" rel="nofollow">Fallout 4</a></em> to building spaceships in <em>Starfield</em>. It's a very neat feature that can be improved upon in <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>. However, if Bethesda intends to treat the building aspect the same way that they "improved" the settlement system in <em>Starfield </em>by making it needlessly complex and tedious, then it's better to omit it altogether.</p>

<h2><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>- From Oblivion to Skyrim to Hammerfell and High Rock?</h2>

<p>That being said, it seems questionable that anyone genuinely believes that <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>&nbsp;will be literally unplayable at launch. Whether or not it will live up to people's high expectations of both the franchise and the developer is up to debate, which is the real cause for concern.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eso-alliances.jpg?itok=Z0Ae46We 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eso-alliances.jpg?itok=_SbD_7VC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If there's anything that <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> should borrow from <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, it's the fashion styles and transmog system.</figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, the success of the <em>Oblivion</em>&nbsp;remaster should provide at least two bits of good news for Bethesda. The first is that people still love the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> games, warts and all. <em>Oblivion </em>is fundamentally the same game as it was 20 years ago, and if people can overlook the strange quirks of the game today, then that's a good enough baseline for determining the absolute bare minimum of what <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>&nbsp;should feel like.</p>

<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, is that Bethesda should be able to get relatively fresh feedback. Again, it should be pointed out that there is a non-zero chance that some of the people who are playing <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> weren't born when the original was released. Even returning players should be able to provide better feedback with an additional 20 years of context. That there is no release date for <em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>means that time is on Bethesda's side, and they can and should course correct if needed before it's too late.</p>

			<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40353">Famitsu</a>, (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-shares-new-ghost-of-yotei-details-as-the-games-non-linear-campaign-is-explained/">VGC</a>) Sucker Punch's Nate Fox and Jason Cornell, both co-creative directors on Ghost Of Yotei, spoke about the Yotei's non-linear campaign, the game's story, and a bit more about the setting, and the research Sucker Punch did while crafting Yotei.</p>
<p>Last week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">release date trailer</a> provided a few quick story details, like how the game centers around new protagonist Atsu's quest for revenge, which Fox reiterates in the interview here.</p>
<p>"<em>The main theme of this game is revenge. The main character, Atsu, has a big trauma in her childhood and goes on a journey to get revenge,</em>" Fox said.</p>
<p>Fox also described the game's map, saying, "<em>Ghost of Yotei has the greatest freedom and biggest map of any open-world game we have ever made</em>."</p>
<p>More interestingly, Fox and Cornell talked about the immense research they did on the studio's second attempt to capture Japan, how the studio collaborated with experts on Japanese history, and, of course, went to the Hokkaido prefecture, where the game is set.</p>
<p>"<em>We have received cooperation from various advisors regarding the depiction of the Ainu people and Ainu culture of the time. Like with the previous game, we have also thoroughly researched Japanese culture and incorporated it into this project,</em>" said Fox.</p>
<p>"<em>I also went to Hokkaido to research Ainu culture,</em>" Cornell added,&nbsp;"<em>and had people knowledgeable about Ainu culture introduce me to museums and folk crafts, which I incorporated into the worldview of this work. By the way, I also went to the mountains with them and had the experience of picking wild vegetables</em>."</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is due to arrive on PS5 this coming October 2, 2025, and while it'll surely be its own game compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, there are more than a few striking similarities between the two. The plot, for one, sticks out as a considerable similarity as they're both focused on tracking down several people who have wronged the protagonist.</p>
<p>Gameplay will surely be a big differentiating factor, but overall it'll be interesting to see how both games shape up by the time we've played Ghost of Yotei.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656336/skin-deep-review-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Squidge, splodge, splat: <em>Skin Deep</em> doesn’t sound like most immersive sims. It doesn’t sound like most video games. Close your eyes and what it aurally resembles is a slapstick cartoon with a healthy dollop of toilet humor. These sounds, though, bookend chains of effects that are pure video game magic. Take the splodge, produced when you tamp down on the soap dispenser next to a sink, that in turn creates a cloud of flammable petroleum. Toss a lighter close to it and then you get a KABOOM.</p><p>In <em>Skin Deep,</em> you play as Nina Passedena, a secret operative for an intergalactic insurance company. Your job? To save cube-headed cats from a group of marauding space pirates called the Numb Bunch. Each mission plays out in taut, smartly designed spaceships, each just three or four rooms filled with a plethora of objects to play with, like banana skins (perfect for making guards fall flat on their asses) and black pepper (vital for making them sneeze). You sneak through vents (<em>a lot</em> of them) and skulk in the shadows. Should you take out a guard, you can dispose of their popped-off heads (because of a bizarre disembodying technology dubbed “Skull Saver”) by ejecting it from an airlock into the vast, lonely expanse of space.</p><p>If you’ve played a Blendo game, like <em>Thirty Flights of Loving </em>or <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>,, then the tone of this spy caper will feel immediately familiar. It’s silly, eccentric, and brimming with knowing gags. The studio’s lead, Brendon Chung, has spent over 15 years honing a singular style that draws on classic <em>Quake</em> as much as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-27-homages-of-thirty-flights-of-loving">art-house cinema</a>. During <em>Skin Deep</em>’s introduction, Chung delivers a virtuoso synthesis of this vision: a blur of jump cuts between first-person action sequences through a faintly rickety vessel. There are exploded pipes and smashed glass, but wait! — you need to pick the glass out of your bare feet lest you bleed out.</p><p>Having to pick glass out of your feet might make it sound like <em>Skin Deep</em> is interested in realism. It’s not. What Chung and a small cohort of developers at Blendo hone in on are the possibilities afforded by a play space that is aiming for, even more than big-budget immersive sims like the <em>Dishonored</em>, a frankly preposterous level of physical and systemic coherence. They’re doing so using a video game engine, Id Tech 4 — famously used for <em>Doom 3</em> — which is now more than 20 years old. The pleasure comes in testing the pliability of the design, the extent to which the game is able to account for harebrained schemes and foolhardy mistakes.</p><p>At one point, I lured a bunch of goons to a bathroom. I’d already duplicated a bar of soap (using the duplicator gun, naturally), which I then plopped on the floor. Upon entering the restroom, these hapless foes, dressed in lurid purple suits, slipped and slid all over until I eventually jumped on one of their backs, directing them in wibbling, wobbling fashion to smash into their nearby comrades and the surrounding faucets. By the end, the bathroom was a mess of spewing waters, fallen bodies, and mission-critical items like colored keycards. </p><p>There are other ways physicality manifests in <em>Skin Deep</em>. Guns, which arrive a handful of hours in, are modeled in exquisite detail; pop the clip to see how many bullets you have; cock the weapon after firing each round. Each animation is rendered with a satisfying, fidgety snap. </p><p>Yet sometimes, even against the most heavily armed enemies, you may not even need to use your firearm. On a fast-food spaceship, having evacuated my feline friends, a group of higher-level foes docked in a bid to try and take me out (such arrivals are always accompanied by a brilliant <a href="https://ghoulnoise.bandcamp.com/album/skin-deep-original-soundtrack">breakbeat version</a> of sea shanty, “Wellerman”). I was struggling to evade them and ended up hiding in a vent that, unbeknownst to me, was connected to a huge walk-in freezer. There was a big button in the vent, and so when my adversaries walked in, I instinctively hit it. They froze, their heads popping off, leaving me a clear path to the escape pod. I hadn’t planned for this moment, merely stumbling into it. Blendo had engineered it. </p><p><em>Skin Deep</em> has a habit of churning out serendipitous moments like this. For all the careful sneaking it encourages — and this is some of the finest free-form stealth since<em> Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em> — the game soars when your actions go awry. If spotted, the Numb Bunch are liable to unload bullets into you even if you’re standing in front of a window that looks out into the cosmos. Lo, the bullets shatter the window, throwing the entire contents of the room, including you and the idiot who fired the weapon, into zero gravity. </p><p>You can do the same, albeit in a more controlled manner, gliding gracefully around the outside of a ship in serene slow-mo before lining up a shot at a window, thus sucking your enemies into deep space. The options afforded by Chung’s sandbox design are supremely generous.</p><p>The fun is not quite inexhaustible. These ships, for all their distinguishing features (one is a post office; another is a mining vessel), and delightfully oceanic names (like the “Narwhal”), begin to blur as the hours stack up. Enemies, too, are a little uniform visually and not especially smart, following simple patrol paths, which you can easily skirt around. You will likely master these levels; it’s more a question of how much. The results board, which arrives at the end of each excursion, details your time and other key stats, suggesting the game has been partly designed with speedrunning in mind. </p><p>Because of the Id Tech 4 aesthetics and its evocation of foundational immersive sims like <em>Thief, </em>it’s possible to read <em>Skin Deep</em> as a throwback. But that sells the game short. The verve, personality, and breakneck pace of this stealth action feels supremely modern, like a manic hyper-pop reimagining of the classics — now with added sneeze mechanic.</p><p><sub>Skin Deep <em>launches on April 30th on PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-breaker/" data-ref-id="5000-561878">Hyper Light Breaker</a>'s first major content update arrives on April 29 and will bring with it major changes to the core gameplay loop, as well as brand-new content including a new Breaker and new Crown.</p><p>Lead producer Michael Clark introduced the update in a new trailer, leading with the fearsome new Crown called Maw. Maw has already been teased in the game, and her arena is available pre-update, but this will be the first time players can take her on in combat.</p><p>The new Breaker is called Rondo, who has a new SyCom with two new perks: Bladedancer and Reaper. The content update also inroduces two new weapons for players to wield: the Gloom Shiv and the Dreamblade. The update will also add new environments, a new enemy, and more that the devs haven't yet detailed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyqU8OL8Xm8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qyqU8OL8Xm8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new content isn't the biggest part of the upcoming update, however, with Clark revealing that Hyper Light Breaker is getting a major shakeup to its core run structure. Once the update hits, you will have one life for each run, and upon death you will lose all items in your inventory and the Overgrowth will reset. Clark explains that this change will bring Hyper Light Breaker more in line with a traditional roguelike experience.</p><p>Players will now get more chances to extract from the Overgrowth, being able to do so from any Shrine, and will no longer have to defeat enemies to do so. SyComs will now follow a class-like structure where every character will have one dedicated SyCom, which can have a perk equipped to enable a passive ability. Inventory will be streamlined so that players no longer have to spend so much time managing inventory, and vendors' roles have also been changed.</p><p>The update will also add a brand-new onboarding tutorial aimed at making Hyper Light Breaker more approachable to new players. The tutorial will launch for all players post-update, even if they've already sunk a lot of hours into the game.</p><p>Many of the overarching changes made to the game were inspired by player feedback, Heart Machine said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840?emclan=103582791471715977&amp;emgid=528718979655532652" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam update</a>, thanking players for being a part of the process as Hyper Light Breaker makes its way through early access.</p><p>The Buried Below update arrives on April 29 for Hyper Light Breaker on PC.</p>

                <p>Blizzard has released the patch notes for Diablo 4 Patch 2.2.0, set to drop at the start of Season 8 on April 29. The patch includes a huge number of minor balance changes for player characters, items, and bosses, as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">Blizzard's ongoing plan</a> to improve the core gameplay experience throughout 2025. Here's what's new.</p><p>While there aren't many surprises in the patch notes, as Blizzard has spoken <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">fairly extensively</a> about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/" data-ref-id="1100-6530937">Season 8 changes</a>, as well as letting players get hands-on with the new seasonal content in the PTR, a few changes will be made based on PTR feedback. The fearsome final form of Belial, who lends his name to the season, has been made even more challenging than it was in the PTR beta, with higher health, damage, and a few new moves up his sleeve.</p><p>Belial isn't the only boss getting a buff from his PTR form--all the Lair Bosses are getting at least minor tweaks or buffs to up the challenge level. Duriel and Gregoire will get new fight mechanics, Lord Zir is getting a damage buff, and Beast in the Ice has some minor tweaks. Varshan is the only one getting an update aimed at making the fight easier--or at least easier to read, thanks to a change to how Tormented Echo of Varshan functions.</p><p>Season 8 is introducing a new mechanic called Boss Powers, where players can literally wield some of the powers used by endgame bosses, which PTR players may have had a bit too much fun with. The version of this mechanic tested in the PTR was evidently way too powerful, as a good number of Boss Powers are getting significant nerfs from their initial PTR stats.</p><p>In news that many players might be happy to hear, Blizzard will be disabling Conduit shrines "until further notice" as they undertake a rework for the controversial shrines. The patch notes say that the decision was made as a result of player feedback, with many Diablo 4 fans feeling like Conduit shrines have become all but useless with recent patches.</p><p>Alongside the big-ticket boss reworks, the patch notes contain a whole lot of small balance changes and minor but welcome quality-of-life upgrades. These include a minor buff for Barbarians, with a specific focus on Whirlwind, improvements to Party Finder, and the ability to quickly teleport to other party members.</p><p>The detailed <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24196854/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> can be found below.</p><h2>Diablo 4 2.2.0 Patch

Unique items find themselves pulled in two directions. On one side, they are must-find, build-enabling, pieces of gear with one-of-a-kind powers. On the other, they are super rare items to strive for that create moments of celebration once acquired. In previous seasons, Lair Bosses leaned heavily towards supporting the former. In our next season, we want to push more towards a middle-ground, where standard Unique items are readily attainable through Initiate and Greater Lair Bosses, but the path Ancestral Unique items lie directly through defeating the Exalted Lair Boss, Belial, Lord of Lies. Because Belial can reward Ancestral Uniques, we want to give players more freedom on how they get to him. By allowing Initiate and Greater Lair Bosses to have a chance at dropping any Unique item, these bosses should always feel more relevant to fight. Finally, while we like the social element of bossing, the efficiency gained from doing so in a full party is too high. Adjusting the boss summoning flow aims to make the experience more equitable regardless of party size while retaining a small bonus for social play.</em></p></blockquote><ul><li>Common quality items will no longer drop beyond Level 6.

                <p>Fantasy fans are eating well right now, as last week saw the release of not one but two highly anticipated games in that genre. After a few brief leaks, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster</a> was shadow-dropped onto PC and console, and just two days later, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> was officially released on the same platforms. Could both games co-exist in this swords and sorcery space together? It turns out that they could indeed, as both titles experienced solid weekends on PC, particularly.</p><p>While we don't know what their performance metrics were like on Xbox Series X|S--where both Oblivion and Expedition 33 are available via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>--and PS5, the numbers sound positive so far for Expedition 33 and Oblivion Remastered. Developer Sandfall Interactive first reported 500,000 sales of Expedition 33 just 24 hours after launch, and after three days, that figure had climbed to 1 million sales. "This number includes units shipped to retailers, and does not encompass our awesome GamePass players," Sandfall Interactive added in a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1916409444063195168" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow-up post</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/expedition33/status/1916409440011444331" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">And here we are.<br>Three days after launch.<br>One million copies sold.<br>Thank you for believing in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. <a href="https://t.co/92T2qZxcHP" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/92T2qZxcHP</a></p>  — Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (@expedition33) <a href="https://twitter.com/expedition33/status/1916409440011444331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>On Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/" rel="nofollow ">the game reached an impressive concurrent peak of 121,422 players</a>, and combined with players from other PC platforms like the Epic Games Store and Game Pass alongside Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, the overall numbers are likely very high during the game's first weekend.</p><p>In comparison, Oblivion Remastered reached over 4 million players just days after it was released. "We are so grateful to the over 4 million of you that have already ventured into Cyrodiil with Oblivion Remastered," Bethesda said in a post on X/Twitter. In terms of concurrent players on Steam alone, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2623190/charts/" rel="nofollow ">the game reached a peak of 216,784 people on April 27</a>, and similar to Expedition 33, its availability on several platforms, storefronts, and Xbox Game Pass also means that the final numbers are likely even higher.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1915889058024222801" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are so grateful to the over 4 million of you that have already ventured into Cyrodiil with Oblivion Remastered.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-pc-patch-upscaling-broken</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-pc-patch-breaks-upscaling-still-isnt-fixed.1175283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-pc-patch-upscaling-broken<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, publisher Bethesda and developer Virtuos released a patch for&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>on the Microsoft Store "for a few backend tweaks", but it's done a lot more damage than intended, it seems.</p>

<p>The update, which runs about 2GB, wasn't intended to address anything "directly impacting gameplay", according <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7lsaz/comment/mp04r76/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to Bethesda</a>, but as the studio points out, the update has "affected some Microsoft Store players' UI settings for graphical settings".</p>

<p>More specifically, the update appears to have completely disabled upscaling functionality, and although Bethesda says any settings adjusted prior to the update "are still enabled and function normally", that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7lsaz/comment/mp05r7t/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doesn't seem</a> to be the experience <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7lsaz/comment/mp0c65e/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other players</a> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7lsaz/comment/mp099lj/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">having</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remastered-upscaling-patch-field.jpg?itok=tdSl3uKs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remastered-upscaling-patch-field.jpg?itok=ngTkBVzw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oblivion Remastered</em>'s latest Microsoft Store PC patch is causing some issues.</figcaption></figure><p>I can confirm the issue still hasn't been fixed, and that Bethesda's comments about graphical settings that were enabled prior to the update doesn't seem to apply to me. When I booted up&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>this morning, my FSR had been turned off and I was unable to turn it back on.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this problem doesn't seem to be affecting Steam players, but since an awful lot of people are going to be checking out&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass, that's not as much of a salve as you might expect.</p>

<p>So, what's going on here? Well, some players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7lsaz/comment/mp08nz8/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">theorizing</a> that it's possible Bethesda has pushed an update intended for Xbox consoles to the PC version of&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em>.</p>

<p>Resolution scaling is locked, like it would be on console, and it's not possible to change resolution scaling options anymore, which suggests the game "wants to force you to run at 60fps like a console would", as Redditor SnakeHelah points out.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why a lack of resolution scaling might be a problem, scaling is the only way many people with slightly less powerful gaming PCs can play&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em>; it greatly raises frame rates and improves performance for a lot of folks.</p>




<p>If that is indeed what's happening, then it's pretty much par for the course when it comes to Bethesda; this is a studio well-known for technical gaffes, and although the remaster's development was handled by Virtuos, it seems it can't escape the shadow of its publisher.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Virtuos'&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster, it's an updated version of the 2006 RPG that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" rel="nofollow">shadowdropped (i.e. launched without warning) last week</a>, although numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">leaks</a> had already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">pointed to the remaster's existence</a> prior to its official announcement.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it's also on Game Pass, although it might be worth holding off on playing that version on PC if you don't have a supremely powerful rig.</p>

<p>A selection of other humanoid characters that are smugglers are shown. The only two which appear to have specific names are Jotraaaz Kammzzzek and Travis, suggesting that they may play a bigger role in Eclipse's overall story, whenever it finally releases.</p>

<p>Star Wars Eclipse was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first announced at the 2021 Game Awards</a>, where it was revealed it would have a High Republic setting. The affluent High Republic era is set around 200 years before the Skywalker Saga. (It's not to be confused the Old Republic, set thousands of years prior.) Happily, this means Jar Jar himself won't be featuring.</p>
<p>However, since that time, very little else has been heard of the game. In October 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">the studio described Star Wars Eclipse as "simmering"</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière said the studio's teams had not been impacted by cuts made by its owner NetEase. At this time, the company head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">the studio was "continuing to develop our projects at full pace"</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, former lead writer for Quantic Dream's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a> and Star Wars Eclipse Adam Williams revealed he had left the studio after 10 years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-announces-new-studio-working-on-handcrafted-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg">He subsequently announced his new studio, Republic Games</a>, which is working on a handcrafted "dark, mature fantasy RPG".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As revealed by developer Cygames <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1916479480308420635" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on X</a>,&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>'s English version will be arriving on June 26th. Back in June last year, when the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release" rel="nofollow">Western release was first announced</a>, it looked like the PC version wouldn't be joining the mobile versions, but PC has been officially confirmed for the West now too.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>franchise, it's worth explaining what's going on here, at least to the best of my (limited) ability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umamusume-pretty-derby-release-date-special-week.jpg?itok=T67PnC0V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umamusume-pretty-derby-release-date-special-week.jpg?itok=GpUBisEC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>is a singular franchise, to say the least.</figcaption></figure><p>In the world of&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>, famous racehorses have a chance to be reborn into the world as "horse girls", and you've probably already guessed what they are: anime girls with horses' ears and tails, because of course.</p>

<p>Horse girls who distinguish themselves get to go to the Tracen Academy in Tokyo, where they'll learn not only to be racers once again, but also to be Japanese-style idols.</p>

<p>The horses in&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>are real-life animals, too; Japanese horses like T M Opera O, Rice Shower, and Mejiro McQueen make appearances in&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>, although naturally, even the stallions become pretty anime girls.</p>

<p>This game isn't the first&nbsp;<em>Umamusume&nbsp;</em>game to come West, either. Back in August last year, the party game <i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby - Party Dash&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-finally-coming-west-with-party-game-for-ps4-switch-pc" rel="nofollow">launched for PC, PS4, and Switch</a>, giving many their first taste of what can reasonably be described as an unusual franchise.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is a gacha sports sim in which you race the titular Umamusume against one another, training them and trading them as you see fit.</p>

<p><em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3224770/Umamusume_Pretty_Derby/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cygames.umamusume" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/umamusume-pretty-derby/id6480433538" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> on June 26th.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last April, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developers Larian announced that they were working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two new games</a>, neither of which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dd-makers-also-want-a-baldurs-gate-4-but-say-they-wont-rush-to-a-sequel-it-shouldnt-take-25-years-mind">Baldur's Gate 4</a>. Now, fresh from the labour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees">pumping BG3 full of bees</a>, Larian boss Swen Vincke has shared a little more about how Belgium's finest mindflayer-wranglers are organising development of these mystery projects. </p><!--more-->
<p>The idea is that one will spin out of pre-production just as the other completes production, avoiding the familiar problem where lots of animators, modellers and other staff have to sit around aimlessly fondling D20s, while management and the Ideas People work on the direction and schedule. Instead, production staff will work on one game while the other is in pre-production, reducing downtime. Vincke acknowledges that the odds of pulling this transition off flawlessly are low. "In practice, we will probably be miserable," he says, "and there's going to be plenty of stuff that went wrong." Words to live by.</p>
<p>All that's from an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9">Gamespot</a>, as passed on by cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/larian-boss-swen-vincke-says-the-studio-is-deep-in-the-trenches-on-its-crazy-ambitious-follow-up-to-baldurs-gate-3-hopes-to-show-it-off-no-later-than-2030-because-my-wife-will-divorce-me-if-it-takes-longer/">PCGamer</a>. Vincke described the first of Larian's two new things as both "crazy-ambitious" and "shaping up quite well, actually". But he added that working on the first new game alongside the second, later project is "not the easiest thing in the universe, because we make very complicated games, lots of permutations, lots of agency for players."</p>
<p>Still, Vincke thinks it's worth doing to avoid the stop-start pre-production/production issue. "When that very large group is finished," commented Vincke, "and the people at the beginning are not ready, then everybody is fucked, because everybody has to wait. That's what we're trying to avoid."</p>
<p>For context, Larian have around 470 people on staff as of 2024, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larians-new-polish-studio-is-a-match-made-in-heaven-for-the-baldurs-gate-3-developers-upcoming-rpgs">currently operate seven studios</a> around the world. While the craven backlog-expanders amongst you may focus on the prospect of Larian releasing games at a faster rate, Vincke hopes that one outcome of running projects in parallel will be less ambiguity and a better quality of life for the developers.</p>
<p>"I hope I can tell you five years from now: We cracked it. We figured it out," he said. "This is what we're doing now. Here's game one, we're making this completely different thing. Game two, and when game two is going to be ready, we already have another thing that's gonna come. If we can make that work in a really good way, that we enjoy our lives, that's gonna be mission accomplished."</p>
<p>What could Larian's undisclosed somethings be? The boring smart money says that one of them is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-definitely-return-to-the-divinity-series-at-some-point-after-baldurs-gate-3">Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>. Still, "crazy-ambitious" covers a lot of ground. Perhaps they're making an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you play as a large body of water or the concept of Wednesdays. Perhaps they're conjuring a whole, actually new genre of fantasy - something the marketing people can't summarise by cramming "punk" onto the end of a familiar word and acting like they've just discovered penicillin.  </p>

Although the key art certainly suggests it's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn-remastered">Until Dawn Remastered</a> that's coming, rather than the 2014 original, it's not entirely clear; we'll confirm just as soon as we know for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-plus"><u>PlayStation Plus</u></a> is an online gaming service for PlayStation platforms that includes free monthly games, limited-time trials, online multiplayer, and member-exclusive discounts. It also includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/playstation-plus-premium-tier-games"><u>a catalog of hundreds of current and classic games</u></a> for Extra and Premium members, although the monthly free games are available to all players, regardless of their subscription tier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As speculated by some members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1k7lixr/monthly_game_leaked/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation subreddit</u></a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/ps-plus-essential-game-for-may-2025-possibly-leaked-early" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PushSquare</u></a>), this could be a means of promoting the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/until-dawn"><u>Until Dawn movie</u></a>, which released just ahead of the weekend. It didn't particularly impress us; we awarded it 5/10, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-review-david-f-sandberg"><u>writing in IGN's Until Dawn movie review</u></a>: "Until Dawn is more disappointing than deadly, leaving all the promise of the horror game behind for a jumble of horror-movie re-creations." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's the same score we awarded the 2024 remaster, calling the game an "overpriced and under-featured remake that seems less like a must-have bit of moonlit murder and something closer to daylight robbery" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn-remastered"><u>IGN's Until Dawn Remastered review</u></a>. Supermassive's 2015 original fared much better, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-review"><u>getting a 7.5/10</u></a> from us. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulls-first-party-ps3-games-resistance-fall-of-man-and-resistance-2-from-ps5-and-ps4-as-part-of-big-ps-plus-clearout"><u>22 games are set to be pulled from the PlayStation Plus library next month</u></a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>Grand Theft Auto 5</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-2"><u>Payday 2</u></a>: Crimewave Edition, and the last playable versions of first-party titles <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resistance-fall-of-man"><u>Resistance: Fall of Man</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resistance-2"><u>Resistance 2</u></a>.
