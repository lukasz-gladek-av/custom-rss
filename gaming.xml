              <p>Dell has earned its reputation for building business-grade laptops that balance performance with durability. The company rarely discounts its machines by more than 20-25% on its official site, and maintiens premium pricing that reflects the quality. Amazon changes that equation by pushing deeper discounts that Dell would never advertise directly: Right now, the Dell Inspiron 15 3530 <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4854/">with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, and a touchscreen display just hit an all-time low of $779, down from $2399</a>. That’s a <strong>68% discount on a laptop with specs</strong> that typically cost a lot more, and it comes with <strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> pre-installed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4854/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intel 10-Core Processor Delivers Real Performance</h2>
<p>The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor <strong>boasts 10 cores divided into 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores, boosted up to 4.6GHz</strong>. The hybrid design saves intensive workloads for the performance cores and executes background workloads on efficiency cores, keeping you responsive even when you’re multitasking with many apps. Intel’s 13th generation is marked by major efficiency gains over 12th gen which also equals improved battery life and reduced heat under load. Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics <strong>allow for light gaming, video editing at 1080p, and multi-monitor configurations</strong> without an additional GPU.</p>



<p>The 32GB of RAM is a blessing for whoever uses memory-hungry programs or has many programs opened at the same time. It gives you sufficient space to use virtual machines, deal with massive photo albums, use gigantic spreadsheets or use professional software suites like Adobe Creative Suite (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/adobe-photoshop">like Photoshop, etc.</a>) without running into performance constraints. Most laptops in this category come with 8GB, so this 32GB option is a massive plus that makes the laptop still useful for several years to come.</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD offers plenty of room to save with read and write that makes the whole system stay responsive: The<strong> apps start in seconds, files save immediately, and the notebook boots Windows 11 Pro in less than 10 seconds</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen with 1920×1080 resolution</strong> provides crisp images with exact touch response that renders Windows 11’s touch-enhanced interface completely functional. Anti-glare coating diminishes reflections and eye fatigue over prolonged use, and the broad viewing angles maintain colors and brightness even while the device is used sideways. The <strong>60Hz refresh rate creates everyday tasks smoothly as well</strong>. Dell’s ComfortView software also diminishes the blue light emission, without the orange color cast some blue light filters include.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro includes enterprise functions such as BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop, group policy support and Hyper-V virtualization that Windows 11 Home does not have. Such features are worth it to business users or anyone who requires professional-level security and management features. <strong>Microsoft’s integration of Copilot AI</strong> provides intelligent help in Windows itself, assisting with work, research, and productivity.</p>
<p>At $779 for all of these features, this Dell laptop provides performance and build that would be twice or triple the price.</p>

<p>Anime Raid is a tower defense–style <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jump-and-splash-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience where you assemble a powerful team of iconic anime characters and defend various maps to level up. Although simply progressing through the game will give you all the resources you need, a few extra gems and coins will certainly go a long way. That’s where the active Anime Raid codes come in. </p>



<p>You can redeem them to claim free resources such as Coins, Gems, Enchant Crystals, Super Talent Crystals, and more. New players will massively benefit from the free rewards, since the initial grinding can be completely avoided.&nbsp;These codes are usually released through the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MBYGSc5dcq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a>, but bookmark this page for easy access to the latest ones. </p>

            <p>The movie adaptation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> is not only back on track, but the first draft of the script is "done".</p>
<p>That's according to Marvel star Simu Liu, who revealed via a tweet last night that the "Sleeping Dogs script draft" was finished up, celebrating with a picture of his own sleeping dog. Aw.</p>
<p>The Sleeping Dogs film adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sleeping-dogs-film-adaptation-canned-says-star-wars-donnie-yen">was reportedly canned back in January</a>, when Star Wars actor Donnie Yen revealed he'd "spent a lot of time and even invested some of [his] own money" only for the project to stall. Just weeks later it seemed all was back on track, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-star-randomly-reveals-plan-to-revive-sleeping-dogs-movie-project">with Liu revealing his involvement</a>.</p>

<p>When asked if he'd "worked things out" with publisher and IP-holder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, Liu <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1979666037391147276">told</a> a commenter: "They’re absolutely great, it’s the [Hollywood] studios that don’t seem to understand how important this IP is BUT we will get them there."</p> <div>

<p>Liu carefully concealed who the story had been written by and did not reveal who else was involved with the movie, but it'll be good news nonetheless to fans of the cult classic game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-donnie-yen-says-sleeping-dogs-movie-in-production">Yen confirmed the film was in development in February 2018</a>, but we'd heard very little else about the production until he confirmed the cancellation earlier this year.</p>
<p>Released in August 2012, Square Enix's Hong Kong open world game Sleeping Dogs was an enjoyable mix of martial arts combat and mob drama. Developer United Front Games tried to get a sequel off the ground, and then a multiplayer follow-up, Triad Wars, before shutting down in 2016.</p>

			<p>I’ve been told that good things come to those who wait, and I certainly had to wait for my Killswitch to arrive from Dbrand. That seems to be because everyone in the world is nabbing a Killswitch for their handheld, whether it’s a new Switch 2, an even newer ROG Xbox Ally X, or a trusty old Steam Deck. I’ve now had this case stuck on my Switch 2 for the last month, it’s been around the world to the Tokyo Game Show, and it’s had about 100 hours of Hollow Knight put into it, so now seems the perfect time to talk about it.</p>
<p><iframe title="How to Install a dbrand Switch 2 Killswitch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qktt0vkEVN8?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Killswitch for Nintendo Switch 2 is a full-device protection system. The main body of the unit is made from black thermoplastics, and comes with a cutout and stick-on protection plate for the stand. It has gaps everywhere that you would want them, including around the cooling vents and cartridge slot, and the only place where it becomes mildly annoying is around the power and volume buttons. It doesn’t stop them from being usable, but it does mean they’re slightly further inset than my fingers want them to be.</p>


<p>Each Joy-Con 2 then has a rubberised case of its own, with a large ergonomic grip portion that fundamentally makes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck. The grips were a little tricky to fit onto the Joy-Con 2, and initially I had an extra fold in there that meant they didn’t sit properly against the body of the Switch 2, but it was relatively straightforward to diagnose the problem and sort it out. Once in place, the Killswitch massively improves the ergonomics of the Switch 2, particularly if you’re an adult with adult-sized hands.</p>


<p>The rubber isn’t quite of the quality I was expecting. It feels rougher and less pliable than I was expecting, and the texture really picks up muck and dead skin. So much so that I’m considering banning my teenage son from even touching it without having first washed his hands – teenagers are kind of filthy. The longer you spend with the Killswitch, the more you come to appreciate the sturdiness and tough build quality, but I’d have still preferred a more premium feel, especially when the case costs north of £50.</p>
<p>They add a lot of extra girth to the Joy-Con 2, and it just about remains useful if you’re taking them off to play multiplayer games. There’s certainly more there to hold onto, but as the grip only runs 50% of the way up the back of the Joy-Con 2, it does feel uneven when you’re just playing on one. They also make it impossible to use the Switch 2’s included Joy-Con 2 grip, so you’ll have to take the grips off every time if that’s a preferred way to play. Not really an issue if you have a Pro Controller 2 or third party option to hand for your TV gaming.</p>

<p>That does make it feel as though the Killswitch is designed overall for the solo player, and one who spends the majority of their time playing in handheld mode. That said, it also includes one of my favourite innovations for docked play: a revised dock attachment.</p>
<p>There is no way the Switch 2 is fitting inside the regular Switch 2 dock when the Killswitch is attached – it’s just too thick. Dbrand have found an excellent way around that problem with the included dock attachment, that moves the stand and the USB-C connection to the front of the dock.</p>
<p>That means that you can more easily place the Switch 2 on the stand, there’s less risk of scratching the screen on the plastic dock edges, and it becomes more of a display unit. Because my Switch 2 dock sits within a TV stand, it just makes the whole process of docking the Switch 2 easier, and frankly, it almost makes the cost of the Killswitch worth it for this alone.</p>

<p>The Killswitch also comes with a sturdy screen cover that houses a magnetic cartridge carrier for all your games. This slots onto the Killswitch perfectly, and is then secured with an elastic catch that stays resolutely in place. It was great for the long plane rides I had to take in the last month, giving me plenty of confidence that my Switch 2 was going to survive the journey without taking any damage.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Dbrand Killswitch is an excellent choice for the Switch 2. If you’re looking for a grip attachment that also takes the role of a full-body case, the Killswitch massively improves the ergonomics of the Switch 2, while the included dock attachment is arguably simpler to use than Nintendo’s own setup. 	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Resident Evil exploded onto the scene in 1996 and made inventory reshuffling in the face of a zombie outbreak popular, players have been regularly fighting down to their very last bullet. 30 years later, survival horror is the dominant format for those seeking video game scares, as popular now as it’s ever been. And with a fresh batch of nightmares to consider, there’s never been a better time to rank the best games of the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what qualifies a game to be considered as "survival horror"? Many games are often labelled survival horror, but lean much too heavily into action to be truly considered a genuine example of the genre. For our money, survival horror can be boiled down to four key factors, all of which are vital components of the classics that make up our list. </p><ol data-cy="list"><li>There has to be a power dynamic weighted in the enemy's favour. </li><li>You need to explore maze-like environments while solving puzzles. </li><li>There’s often jeopardous resource management. </li><li>Relentless pressure inflicted by either a pursuer or an oppressive space.</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">So with the rules established and out of the way, here are our picks for the 10 best survival horror games of all time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Survival Horror Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Clock Tower</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/clock-tower-1759140885198.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While 1989’s Sweet Home is often considered the progenitor of survival horror, it’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clock-tower-1996">Clock Tower</a>, the 1995, 16-bit survival horror classic that was only ever released in Japan, that perhaps left a bigger mark on the genre. Its fingerprints can be easily found throughout the entirety of this list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as Jennifer, a teenage orphan stranded in a Resident Evil-like manor, point-and-clicking your way through a series of impressively detailed, oppressive rooms. But Clock Tower's defining mechanic, and why it rightfully deserves its place on this list, is its pioneering stalker gameplay. Four years before Resident Evil’s Nemesis spent an entire game shouting “STARS”, Clock Tower had us avoiding the dreaded “Scissorman”, who, much like Mr X, Pyramid Head, and Alien: Isolation’s Xenomorph, is a near-unstoppable force that’s always lurking nearby. Fast forward to today, and the stalker enemy type has become a staple of the survival horror genre. We have Scissorman to thank for all those enduring nightmares.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Silent Hill</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/silent-hill-1-1759141038823.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Capcom was storming the charts in the late ‘90s with Resident Evil’s campy, zombie-focused take on survival horror, Konami’s first stab at the genre saw the studio try something very different. What it created was dread. Pure, unrelenting dread.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a> stars Harry Mason, an everyman who enters a fog-filled nightmare while trying to find his missing adopted daughter in the town of Silent Hill. What follows is an oppressive tale riddled with unseemly horrors, the likes we’d never witnessed in a video game before. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike its peers, Silent Hill provided a true 3D environment to explore, rather than the static, pre-rendered backdrops of Resident Evil. Due to the hardware restraints of the time, which struggled to render long draw distances, the fictional town was caked in a constant thick layer of fog that disguised the tech’s limitations. Serendipitously, this not only became the series’ signature look, but also demonstrated perhaps the greatest marriage of tech and tone we’ve ever witnessed in a video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill pioneered its own psychological corner of the survival horror genre, spawning many sequels and remakes that would go on to be considered some of the most haunting video games ever made.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/resident-evil-7-1759140853486.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a distant memory now, but there was a painful period where the Resident Evil series lost touch with its survival horror roots. While Resident Evil 4 is rightly celebrated, it significantly ramped up the action, which laid the groundwork for both Resident Evil 5 and 6 to practically abandon the genre altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2017 finally saw Capcom return to that classic survival horror feeling with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, but it did so from an entirely new first-person perspective and through the use of a grimier, Texas Chainsaw Massacre-like cast of characters. Our new protagonist, Ethan Winters, is forced to take on the Louisiana swamp-dwelling Baker family, who force him to endure a gauntlet of grisly challenges. Gone were roundhouse kicks, quicktime events, and off-the-charts bombast, and back was delicate resource management, a reestablished power balance in the antagonist's favour, and the long overdue return of a stalker enemy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s impossible not to think of Resident Evil when talking about survival horror, but it’s only thanks to Resident Evil 7’s genre renaissance that they’re still considered synonymous with each other, rather than survival horror being just a footnote in the history of the series. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Outlast</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/outlast-1759140837461.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Often the best survival horror tropes are reflections of the movies that inspired them, and there’s no better illustration of this than 2013’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/outlast">Outlast</a>, a first-person descent into a remote psychiatric hospital that took the found footage movie genre and expertly turned it into a five-hour interactive nightmare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outlast is relentless, and in traditional survival horror fashion, gives you very little to defend yourself with. It does, however, effectively turn vision into a resource; with the majority of the gloomy hospital only visible through the green, grainy lens of your camera's night vision, it's vital you build a stockpile of batteries to keep it powered up. AAs are as important in Outlast as bullets are in Resident Evil, and without them, you’re completely blind to horrors that lurk in the dark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you can see what’s chasing you, Outlast is as scary as any game on this list. When the lights go out, it stands nearly in a league of its own.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Alan Wake 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/12/08/alan-wake-2-ign-best-horror-1702043907206.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Outlast, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake 2</a> also commodifies light, although unlike its more action-led predecessor, it strikes a perfect balance of tense survival horror gameplay and a cinematic, surreal nightmare. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Remedy’s unsettling story follows the intertwined journeys of titular writer Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson. As Alan, you’ll blast ghostly figures and solve Resident Evil-esque puzzles in a nightmare version of New York City. But the further you venture, the stranger things get; you’ll write new pathways through reality, witness a bizarre Finnish horror movie, endure an anxiety-inducing chat show, and take part in the best rock opera you’ve ever gunned your way through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saga’s chapters, meanwhile, see the story transform into a blend of Hannibal and Zodiac, with Silent Hill-like exploration and combat sitting neatly next to police procedural work. As you investigate a chilling chain of ritual murders, you’ll need to arrange clues on your evidence board and drill deeper into the minds of your many suspects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 finds a unique way to combine familiar survival horror gameplay with Lynchian cinematic flair, resulting in a deeply ambitious, frequently disturbing experience that both feels true to the genre and something completely fresh.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Amnesia: The Dark Descent</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/amnesia-the-dark-descent-1759140823720.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to its gameplay innovations that helped course-correct and spur a rebirth of a genre that had drifted too far into action-game territory, almost all modern survival horror games are indebted to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/amnesia-the-dark-descent">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a>, at least to some degree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Frictional Games’ landmark 2010 first-person horror, you play as Daniel, who wakes up alone in the dark castle of Brennenburg with no memory of how he got there. As you explore, you learn of a shadow that’s stalking you, and encounter other creatures that will give chase if they spot you. Armed with nothing but a lantern, your only form of defence is to run and hide, often in the dark. This cat-and-mouse experience is a common survival horror trait today, but back in 2010, it was a stark contrast against more action-oriented horror games like Resident Evil 5, which was released just one year earlier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amnesia: The Dark Descent isn’t just a game of hide and seek, though: it has an extra wrinkle, one that forces you to always be on the move. Stay in the dark too long and you’ll gradually lose your mind. This forces you into maintaining a delicate balancing act, avoiding the darkness that’s driving you insane but frequently using it to hide from your pursuer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amnesia’s multiple sequels all build upon The Dark Descent’s mechanics in smart ways, but perhaps more important to its legacy is how other developers took notice, with Resident Evil 7’s decision to switch to a first-person perspective owing a lot to Amnesia’s success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Descent still holds up today, and its influence runs deep, paving the way for the first-person playstyle to receive equal attention next to the genre’s traditional third-person camera.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Resident Evil</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/resident-evil-1-1759141218301.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to imagine what horror in video games would look like without the arrival of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-1996">Resident Evil</a>. The first in the long-running (and extremely successful) series arrived in 1996, inviting players to explore the zombie-infested, puzzle-riddled Spencer Mansion, and it’s fair to say the survival horror genre hasn’t looked back since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although primitive by today’s standards, Resident Evil set the mold for everything that followed. The isolation, the limited resources, the relentless sense of dread, and the jump scares. Resident Evil pioneered the way for the genre, and without it, modern survival horror simply wouldn’t exist. Yes, Sweet Home outlined the blueprint, but Resident Evil masterfully executed the ideas and propelled survival horror to the masses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the formula has since been regularly improved upon, and many of those games are featured in this list, but every entry in Capcom’s enduring series owes a debt to the first. Resident Evil is arguably weaker than most of its sequels, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-remaster">its own remake included</a>, but none of them would have existed without the progenitor, and its importance to the genre (and this list) is unquestionable. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Alien: Isolation</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/alien-isolation-1759140810528.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">1979’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/alien">Alien</a> is a masterclass in fear, building uneasy tension and suspense with the threat of its single, deadly Xenomorph. On paper, the film’s concept is not easily translated into video game form, and there certainly were many failed attempts until Creative Assembly’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> arrived in 2014. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alien: Isolation abandons pulse rifles, gung-ho Colonial Marines, and gallons of acid blood in favour of survival horror trappings, asking you to outwit an indestructible stalker that hunts you around the sprawling Sevastopol space station.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powered by sophisticated artificial intelligence, the Xenomorph in Alien: Isolation lives up to its silver screen relative, accurately creating a terrifying gameplay experience based on everything we saw in Ridley Scott’s classic. The beast quite literally has a mind of its own, capable of learning your tactics and finding new ways to hunt you. In a list full of games with stalker enemies, it’s still hard to look past the perfect organism as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-isolations-terrifying-introduction-to-the-perfect-predator-art-of-the-level">the greatest hunter of them all</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With only stealth, guts, and a few select tools to help you survive, Alien: Isolation is a terrifying horror simulator that not only instantly became <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-defence-of-alien-isolation">the best Alien video game of all time</a>, but also one of the very best examples of the survival horror genre.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Silent Hill 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/silent-hill-2-1760113907240.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-2001">Silent Hill 2</a> is an increasingly disturbing, psychological journey into the repressed thoughts of its unassuming protagonist and the tortured souls he meets along the way. Emotional tragedy, guilt, anger, abuse, and the horrible ways the resulting trauma manifests are handled with grace and maturity rarely seen in the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 is everything a good survival horror game should be, perfectly balancing a relentless sense of hopelessness with just enough to keep you in the fight. James is a tortured soul, but one driven by the desire to continue his path, despite how unlikely success seems, and although this isn’t the first Silent Hill on this list, it is unquestionably the best. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Silent Hill 2, developed by Konami’s Team Silent back at the dawn of the millennium, is perhaps the bleakest, most sombre game ever made. 23 years later, Bloober Team successfully recreated its miserable magic, crafting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">a remake</a> that is a deeply effective descent into genuinely uncomfortable terror. With this 2024 remake, Team Silent’s nightmarish vision is preserved. It’s a modern reminder not just of an era when Konami was a master of survival horror, but also of the significant power of Silent Hill 2’s timeless misery. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Resident Evil 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/resident-evil-2-1759140781891.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When you think of survival horror, you think of Resident Evil, and although there are many contenders for best entry in the series, our vote, emphatically, goes to the 2019 remake of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2-1998">original Resident Evil 2</a> took everything successful about the survival horror formula established by the first game and refined it. The locations were creepier, the enemies more menacing – this was the introduction of the infamous Licker and Mr. X, the stalker enemy that set the bar for the genre – and the scares were bigger and badder. The adventures of Leon and Claire in Raccoon City not only became a benchmark for Resident Evil but for the genre as a whole.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every way 1998’s Resident Evil 2 improved on its predecessor, the 2019 remake replicated in kind, becoming not only a prime example of how to take an older game and reanimate it for a new generation of players, but also how the original rules of survival horror still stand strong to this day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 2 is everything you want survival horror to be: a game of carefully balancing your resources while always feeling like you don’t quite have enough, enduring relentless pursuits through maze-like environments, obtuse puzzles to solve, and a constant state of unease that makes it feel like you won’t quite survive through the whole ordeal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 2 influenced not one, but two generations of survival horror, and despite being often imitated, it’s rarely equalled. In our eyes, Resident Evil 2 is not only the very best of survival horror’s most famous series, but it also sits atop the genre itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you liked this list and are eager for more survival horror, why not check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-games">25 best horror games of all time</a>, or our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/art-of-the-level-resident-evil-2">Art of the Level episode on Resident Evil 2</a>, discussing how Capcom perfected the RPD Police Station twice. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-survival-horror-games]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/formula-1-cars-are-selling-for-pennies-lego-offloads-remaining-stock-during-the-austin-gp-2000636932</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/formula-1-cars-are-selling-for-pennies-lego-offloads-remaining-stock-during-the-austin-gp.1328878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Formula 1 fans know the thrill of collecting memorabilia, but official F1 merchandise usually comes with hefty price tags. LEGO sets tied to racing deliver that collecting satisfaction while giving you something to actually build and display. With the Austin Grand Prix happening today, LEGO is capitalizing on the F1 buzz by dropping this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/">6-pack of collectible F1 race cars to an all-time low of $20 on Amazon, down from $29.</a> That works out to just over $3 per car which is ridiculous pricing for official LEGO F1 builds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mystery Box Format Offers Collecting Thrill</h2>
<p>The <strong>collection includes 6 randomly chosen mini F1 cars</strong> from a total of 12 different models, and every box is an opening surprise. The roster includes real 2024 F1 teams such as <strong>Red Bull’s RB20, Mercedes-AMG, Ferrari, McLaren, Aston Martin, Alpine, Williams, VCARB, Sauber, and Haas</strong>, along with an F1 car and F1 Academy car. Every model comes with the unique livery and color of its team, right down to the exact team logo and sponsor decals that immediately identify them with anyone who’s a sports fan. The surprise is that <strong>you don’t know what six you’re receiving until you open the box</strong>&nbsp;which introduces the aspect of collecting that kids and adults alike find actually fun.</p>
<p>Every vehicle has a team-specific helmet inside the cockpit, mimicking the actual drivers’ equipment. The wheels even spin, so they are not just for show. Children are able to roll them over surfaces and set up their own racing, re-creating passes and duels they’ve watched on television. The spinning wheels are just a little detail, but it makes these go from flat-out collectibles to toys that invite make-believe play and storytelling.</p>



<p><strong>With 174 pieces in total across all six cars</strong>, the build complexity is exactly between the ages of 6 and older. Each individual car is probably 10 to 15 minutes to build, so they’re all good fast builds without consuming hours of build time. Each car costs about 29 pieces, sufficient to make comprehensible F1 forms with the characteristic halo cockpit cover, front and back wings, and aerodynamic body style that are trademarks of contemporary Formula 1 design.</p>



<p>The small size makes them perfectly aligned to be displayed on bookshelves, desktops, or shelves without taking up much space. Display the six of them to present a miniature grid setup, or combine them with other Lego F1 sets if you are collecting a massive collection. The size is perfectly aligned for dioramas or race environments if you prefer to customize your own display. As the total of 12 cars is available in the full set, there is a clear accomplishment goal completionists are striving for, and double-trading with friends provides a social collecting aspect.</p>
<p>For die-hard F1 enthusiasts who don’t want to expend vast sums of money on diecast models or clothing, this set provides official branding and proper team representation for pennies compared to the cost. As LEGO, it’s something with wide appeal across the board to everyone from young children just getting into F1 to older adult fanatics who are collectors of racing memorabilia. At $20 for a half-dozen cars, <strong>it’s the most affordable means of getting official F1 team merchandise since Austin’s GP puts people in racing mode</strong>.</p>

<h3>"strong reasons" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Saving for a Switch 2, but the release of the Galaxy bundle, I realized. Why do I want a Switch 2 now? I'm still in Pharloom, just defeated the Last Judge and entered the Citadel. I'm still eager to return to Hallownest afterwards. I played, and loved, the Galaxy from 3D All Stars, and always wanted to go for Galaxy 2, but it wasn't available. Hundreds of hours still wait for me, and the Switch 2 has yet to give strong reasons to give hundreds for it. Mario Kart World is cool, but not enough to replace 8. Bananza can't carry a system by itself like BotW did. Right now, considering price price and gaming options, the first Switch is still the better choice.<br>
<strong>Rui Pedro</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could retire now, do nothing but play games eight hours a day, and still never get through my Switch backlog. Software library-wise, it beats even the mighty 3DS as it nears the end of its cycle.</p>
<p>If you're not desperate for the upgrades and speedier menus (which <em>are</em> hard to go back from), and you can live without Bananza and co. for the time being, I'd absolutely sit tight and enjoy the system you've got. It's a winner. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"two pack"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,<br>
With the release of Super Mario Galaxy 1+2, do you think that Nintendo will pursue other “two pack” games in the future? I’m thinking specifically of the very often rumored Zelda: Wind Waker/Twilight Princess and Metroid Prime 2 &amp; 3 Switch ports. I am specifically curious to see what forms MP2 and MP3 could arrive in, if at all. MP2 was a GameCube title, so it could be on the Expansion Pack for the Online service. But what about MP3, which was a Wii title? If Nintendo were to remaster/remake it for Switch/S2, couldn’t they just do the same for MP2 and repeat the Galaxy strategy?<br>
If these games are to be released, what form do you think we’ll see them in and why?<br>
Thanks,<strong><br>
An Anonymous Nintendo Fan</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wind Waker and TP would be standalones, I'd say. For Prime 2 and 3, as straight sequels, I'm imagining a hypothetical 'Metroid Prime Trilogy Remastered' physical three-pack, rather than a standalone Prime 2+3 package.</p>
<p><em>Sure</em>, you've already got Prime 1 on the shelf, but as Nintendo (probably) says, "You'll buy the same game again as part of a $70 package and you'll like it!" <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="b572eb37d6f5b"><a title="Metroid Prime Remastered" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b572eb37d6f5b/metroid-prime-remastered.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>"not true"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Nintendolife<br>
I wonder if Nintendolife have ever reviewed or made more articles about the games by Outright Games.<br>
I have found certain games by them in articles but unfortunately only very very few games by them get highlighted on Nintendolife. I have to create my thread about Outright Games and keep posting new trailers to update the information.<br>
Also, I keep hearing the negativity from other users who prejudge the games as cash grabber games.<br>
That's not true. Kids franchise games can be as great as other games, it's depend on the developer who made them. And not everyone has interest in AAA games. I'm sure there is always the audience who has interest, not only me.<br>
I hope the Nintendolife staff can give more credits to the games by Outright Games. Even adults like me can be interested in kids franchise like Paw Patrol, Bluey, Barbie, Gabby's Dollhouse, etc.<br>

<p>Looking back, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews?title=company%3Aoutright_games">we've reviewed 14 Outright-published games</a> (including Bluey) throughout the Switch generation, and we've touched on plenty more with news articles. We try to cover a wide range of games that will interest readers of all ages and tastes, but personal interest is definitely a factor in our selections. Which, for instance, accounts for our increased Star Trek-related coverage in recent years - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/star-trek-prodigy-supernova">one of which was from Outright Games, in fact</a>.</p>
<p>We'll continue to do our best to cover as broad a spectrum of software as possible. There's just so much out there that, unfortunately, some things have to fall by the wayside. Shining a light on games that don't have the brand power of a Gabby's Dollhouse or Paw Patrol is something we factor in, as well. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"keep things reasonable"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been running a video game club for about two years now. Think of it like a book club, but with games—someone picks one, we all play it, and then meet once a month to talk about it. The tricky part is cost. I try to keep things reasonable by setting a $20 limit, but it still means asking people to buy games they might not end up liking. I really wish there were a library or rental service for games. Do you know of anything like that? Or any tips for sharing a game across 6–8 people?<br>
<strong><em>Alexander Zaitzeff</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting eight copies might be an issue, but despite the odds, public libraries do still exist in some places and they're a real untapped resource. Last year, I was amazed to see the selection of PS4 and Switch games at my local, so definitely investigate and support your libraries, if you've got them.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'd say $20 is a fairly high limit considering how frequent and full eShop sales are. You could probably cut that in half, which should make a dud easier to live with. A quick look at my 'On Offer' wishlist shows Time Flies for 11,19€, Lego Bricktales for 4,49€, Kentucky Route Zero for 9,19€, Blazing Chrome for 4,24€...</p>
<p>Obviously, it's more challenging if you're nominating tentpole first-party titles, but I'd try tailoring your shortlist around discounted games. There's bound to be something, large or small, in the '2,382 games on sale' that'll appeal to whoever's picking this month. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"exploring open areas"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Nintendo Life!<br>
How excited are all of us for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond? I can't wait to get my hands on it! After the latest Nintendo Direct trailer, I'm curious if the Bike will have it's own set of upgrades/power-ups to find? I think it would be cool to unlock different methods of traversal like hovering over water or anti-gravity tracks to drive up necessary walls. Could make for unique combat situations too! I guess it just depends on how much time we'll be exploring open areas like the desert we saw!<br>
You can omit this part if he can't answer but I have to ask: How is Zion's first playthrough of Metroid Prime Remastered going? Hope he's loving it!<br>
Thanks for reading!<strong><br>
MTMike87</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to Prime, I'm not the man to ask. So, let's check in with Team NL, starting with Ollie 'Roid-Boy Reynolds. How excited are we? - <em>Ed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>🫲-------------🤓-------------🫱 - <em>Ollie</em></li>
<li>"Not as excited as Ollie." - <em>Alana</em></li>
<li>"Wait, they’re doing a <em>fourth</em> Metroid Prime?" <em>- Jim</em></li>
<li>"Go away, I'm on holiday." - <em>PJ</em></li>
<li><em>*sleeping in Australia* - Liam</em></li>

<p>As for Zion, he disembarked the good ship NL <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/youtube.com/watch?v=kI4hKbp64UI&amp;pp=0gcJCfwJAYcqIYzv">a couple of weeks ago now</a>. Let me Whatsapp him…<sub>.</sub> <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mike! Thank you for asking, I actually rolled credits on Metroid Prime Remastered a few weeks ago! I really enjoyed the exploration, the music, and the overall discovery. I had a lot of trouble with the platforming and finding the Artifacts towards the end there, but overall I’m really happy to have finally checked this box! I’ve heard Prime 2 and 3 are a bit more straightforward too, so I’m looking forward to giving them a go. I still enjoyed games like Dread and Zero Mission more, but they’re seriously so exceptional at what they do. I also need to be ready for Prime 4! The little I played with mouse mode on Switch 2 has me excited to go through the game with that too! - <em>Zion</em></li>

<h3>"time to game"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, college started for me. This is my first time in college, and I find amongst all the classes and homework and stress I haven't had much time to game. I barely managed to squeeze Silksong into the beginning of the semester, and now that things are really ramping up, I don't know how much free time I'll have in general. Any suggestions on games to play to maximize my gaming time? Also Animal Crossing and once-a-day games like it don't count. They're just not really my thing.<strong><br>

<p>So you're looking for quick-to-start games that don't waste your limited time? Depends on whether you're after short and sweet, complete narrative experiences, or you're happy to jump in for a satisfying run or two in a game where story takes a backseat.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-short-games">Best Short Games</a> list does what it says on the tin, but otherwise I'd consider getting cosy with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-roguelikes-roguelites-and-run-based-games">a quality roguelike</a>. Whether you've got 10 minutes or 10 hours, things like Rogue Legacy or Vampire Survivors are always a great time. You might never play anything else, is the only problem. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"not a website"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Nintendo Life,<br>
As a long time reader, I have always viewed Nintendo Life as not a website, but more of a modern day version of the old print magazines of the 1990's, like; Nintendo Power, GamePro, Electronic Gaming Monthly. Under this context, have you thought about bringing some of that nostalgic back to your "mailbox" and commissioning an artist to create a comic strip each month worthy of "Howard &amp; Nester" from Nintendo Power?<br>
Sincerely,<strong><br>
Luigi Mario</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this idea, although commissioning a comic strip would stretch the budget and I'd rather spend that elsewhere.</p>
<p>But hey, if readers want to send pics of their letter art, I'm more than happy to include it. Family-friendly, obviously. As a 30-ish-year internet denizen, I've seen more than enough material depicting Sonic and friends getting along famously, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Here's my Sonic from memory:</p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

We have a few new folks here, actually, so it’s time to catch up! First up, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/terrence-obrien"><strong>Terrence O’Brien</strong></a>, our not-that-new-anymore weekend editor — I read his work for years at <em>Engadget</em> and have also always enjoyed his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/608609/teenage-engineering-op-xy-review">deep knowledge of music gear</a>, but I had no idea what to expect from his homescreen setup. Maybe he doesn’t have a phone and just carries around some cool Teenage Engineering stuff?</p><p>Turns out I wasn’t <em>entirely </em>off base. Here’s Terrence’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>Pixel 7</p><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>Just the color black.</p><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Calendar, Obsidian, Apple Music, Pocket Casts, Kobo Books, Readwise Reader, Libby, Headspace, Phone, Camera.</p><p>My homescreen is called <a href="https://www.minimalistphone.com/"><strong>Minimalist Phone</strong></a>. I’m trying to spend less time staring at a screen in general, but especially my phone. I wanted to do my best to recreate the experience of a Light Phone or something similar, without having to give up things like RCS or ticketing apps. (I go to a lot of concerts and not having Dice, AXS, or Ticketmaster on my phone is kind of a deal-breaker.) I try to keep my homescreen focused on “productive” apps. Nothing that will encourage doomscrolling.</p><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/"><strong>Obsidian</strong></a> is there for purely reference purposes (recipes, combination lock codes I can never remember, etc.). While the desktop app is incredible, the mobile interface is slow and kind of terrible. For actual note-taking on the go, I much prefer a Field Notes pocket notebook and a pen. I use <a href="https://readwise.io/read"><strong>Readwise’s Reader</strong></a> because it autogenerates time-synced transcripts for YouTube videos and because of its integration with Obsidian, which makes collecting research and taking notes much easier, even though I kind of hate its UI.</p><p><em>I also asked Terrence to share a few things he’s into right now.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-mini-pcs-apple-quietly-clears-stock-of-the-latest-mac-mini-at-a-new-record-low.1328863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple has a reputation for keeping prices locked at full retail, especially on their latest releases. The company never discounts anything directly which makes finding deals on new Apple hardware feel like spotting a unicorn. That’s why the current situation with the 2024 Mac Mini is worth your attention: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">just dropped the latest 256GB M4 model to $499, down from $599</a>, and this is the lowest price we’ve seen on Apple’s newest compact desktop. For this level of performance in such a compact package, there’s really no point looking at Windows alternatives right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance That Matters</h2>
<p>The M4 chip in this <strong>Mac Mini features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU</strong> which means serious computation from an object that’s hardly larger than a coaster. Apple’s chip design means these cores operate differently than standard Intel or AMD processors. The CPU is divided between performance and efficiency cores and uses heavy tasks such as video or 3D rendering on the performance cores and background tasks on efficiency cores without draining power and heat.</p>



<p>The total 16GB of RAM comes into play here as Apple’s architecture divides RAM between the GPU and the CPU instead of having independent ones like in the ancient machines. The <strong>system dynamically allocates memory</strong> depending on what you’re doing in this integrated manner so 16GB is more than enough compared to the same in the case of Windows. You can trim 4K video, have several creative programs open at once, or seriously multitask without the system bogging down. The <strong>256GB SSD offers speedy storage</strong> that’s light years ahead of the hard drives still found in value PCs.</p>
<p>This Mac Mini <strong>coexists nicely with Apple’s ecosystem</strong> in ways Windows mini PCs don’t: The Continuity features allow you to begin writing on your iPad or iPhone and resume where you stopped on the Mac Mini. AirDrop shares files from one device to another in an instant and hassle-free process. You can use your iPhone as a webcam for FaceTime, reply to messages directly from your desktop or even use your Apple Watch to control your Mac by unlocking it.</p>



<p>Wired Gigabit Ethernet is the standard with you getting to enjoy wired network speeds that blow WiFi for massive file transfers or streaming video. WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 wireless connectivity is also available on the Mac Mini. Port alternatives are also ample with various <strong>Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports</strong> providing up to 40Gbps data transmission speeds, up to 6K resolution support for external displays, and speedy charging of devices. <strong>Two USB-A ports</strong> are included for legacy peripherals, and the headphone port is capable of driving high-impedance headphones to provide high-quality audio without an attached DAC.</p>
<p>Its small size allows it to <strong>vanish on a desk or be screwed behind a monitor</strong> with a VESA adapter. It is only 7.7 inches by 7.7 inches and 2 inches in height, occupying less space than most external hard drives. The <strong>fanless design makes it silent to operate</strong> which is ideal for recording studios, bedrooms, or offices where fan noise becomes irritating.</p>
<p>Priced at $499, this Mac Mini offers performance that would run much higher in a run-of-the-mill desktop or mini PC of this size. If you’ve been waiting for Apple to budge on pricing, this is as good as it gets.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s taking you out to Nell's Diner on 11th November.</p>
<p>Announced this weekend during Phasmophobia's fifth anniversary panel at TwitchCon, the retro diner will be the ghost bustin' game's fourteenth map, promising "surprises" for all those who dare stop by there when it launches next month.</p>

<p>The team said it recognised that Phasmophobia's smaller maps tend to be more popular, as they allow for "quicker but intense investigations full of memorable moments", and Nell's Diner will accommodate that, complete with a classic food counter, iconic red leather stools and booths, a kitchen, storage rooms, and "plenty of hauntings to decipher". According to the developer, Nell's Diner will be a tad larger than Tanglewood Drive.</p><p>As the team at Kinetic Games has grown over the last five years and now creates all its own art assets, don't forget that we can also expect some environmental story telling with this map when it goes live, too.</p>
<p>"So far, we've added some really classic horror locations to Phasmophobia - an abandoned asylum, creepy farmhouses, and our more linear lighthouse map, Point Hope. We always thought a diner would fit perfectly, so Nell's was born, and it's been such a fun challenge bringing it to life," said Dan "Dknighter" Knight, director of Kinetic Games and lead developer of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"Alongside the farmhouse reworks from this year, Nell's is an example of how we want all the maps in Phasmophobia to feel going forward. It's unique, and has been meticulously designed to tell more of a story to our players - beyond the immediate ghost they're hunting. We can't wait for everyone to get their hands on it next month."</p>
<p>Bertie recently chatted with creator Knight about Phasmophobia, where he was told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">how The Witcher 3 inadvertently saved the ghost-hunting game</a>. He also got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-will-begin-seeding-lore-to-build-story-for-the-film">a few more details on the recently announced film</a>, and how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-years-phasmophobia-overhaul-will-be-so-significant-it-will-feel-like-playing-a-new-game">next year's Phasmophobia overhaul will be so significant it will feel "like playing a new game"</a>.</p>

            <p>Streamer Emiru has disputed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>'s claim that it "responded to the incident" when she was assaulted during her TwitchCon Meet &amp; Greet, calling the claim "a blatant lie".</p>
<p>In a swift media statement, Twitch said "the safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority", and called the behaviour of the man who pushed past the queue to grab Emiru and kiss her "completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting". It then revealed it had "blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events".</p>

<p>"Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at TwitchCon and even in front of another creator's meet and greet to grab me and my face and try to kiss me. Fortunately he wasn't able to, but a lot of people have pointed out it could have been a lot worse!" she wrote.</p>
<p>"I'm obviously shaken up by what happened and it's not the first time I've dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact."</p>
<p>She adds that "there were at least three or four" TwitchCon security staff "in the area" who "did not react and let the guy walk away, as you can see in the clip since they don't even appear in the frame".</p>
<p>"None of the Twitchcon staff came to ask what happened or if I was okay," she adds.</p>
<p>"My friend who was present told me Twitch security were also behind the booth afterwards joking about how they didn't even see what happened and immediately laughing and moving on to talking about something else. So if no one was checking if I was okay or if I needed anything and they let the guy run away initially, I have no idea what anyone hired to keep the event safe was doing."</p><p>"Twitch's statement they said that the guy was immediately caught and detained, I'm sorry but that is a blatant lie," Emiru continues. "He was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet and I didn't hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because TwitchCon staff present thought it was a big deal."</p>
<p>She finished on confirming that this would be her final TwitchCon, writing: "it saddens me to say as a 10 year off and on attendee of TwitchCon, I think other creators should seriously consider not attending in the future. I did not feel cared for or protected, even bringing my own security and staff. I can't imagine how creators without those options would feel."</p> <div>

<p>Twitch's own statement reads: "The safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority. The behaviour displayed by the individual involved in the incident yesterday involving a high profile streamer was completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting.</p>
<p>"In line with existing TwitchCon security protocols, law enforcement and event security were on site and responded to the incident. We immediately blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events. We are coordinating with the impacted creator’s team and, per our standard protocols, continue to cooperate with any law enforcement investigations.</p><p>"We have increased security at the Meet &amp; Greet attendee check-in point and will have additional security personnel surrounding participating streamers. If you’ve RSVPed for a Meet &amp; Greet, please note that we are unable to accommodate +1s for the remainder of the event," it concluded. "Twitch has zero tolerance for harassment or acts that inhibit the safety and security of our community."</p>
<p>Twitch has not commented specifically on Emiru's claims, and the above statement has been slapped with a community note on Twitter/X claiming "Twitch allowed the assailant to walk originally and was only pressed to apprehend him until Emiru's manager pushed for it".</p>

<p>It was the NSO newbie <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/fatal_fury_special">Fatal Fury Special</a> that got put under the microscope <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-fatal-fury-special-snes">last time</a>, as we matched up two covers for this SNES brawler. Overall, it was a pretty one-sided fight. The colourful Japanese variant walked away with 68% of the vote, leaving the North American design with 32%.</p>
<p>This week, with Pokémon fever in the air, we're taking a look at the series' oft-forgotten spin-off, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hey_you_pikachu">Hey You, Pikachu!</a>. You remember this one, right? It's the N64 game with the microphone where you develop a close bond with Pikachu by repeatedly shouting rudimentary commands into the little yellow plastic sphere. Okay, it rarely worked, and it's hardly a classic, but it's got some regional variety in its box art.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvkrnpj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The game was never released in Europe, so we just have two covers to choose between this week. Let's check 'em out.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/pokemon/related-articles:163800 @ 1760890130 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0b0c9064383d9"><a title="Hey You, Pikachu! - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b0c9064383d9/hey-you-pikachu-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/243-hey-you-pikachu">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American cover is pretty unremarkable. Pikachu takes centre stage, naturally, with a coastal setting stretching out in the background. So why, oh why, can't we take our eyes off of Pika's weirdly detailed little fingers? Are those... knuckles? Don't tell us they're fingernails... Oh god, we can't look away.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6b17408be9abb"><a title="Hey You, Pikachu! - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b17408be9abb/hey-you-pikachu-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/243-hey-you-pikachu">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those horrific, tiny fingers make a return in the Japanese box art, but they're here posed into a cute little 'peace' sign, so we're slightly less distracted by them. The coastal background is replaced by rolling hills, and the vertical formatting means we can see more of Pikachu's frame. Hey, we're just grateful this didn't produce hyper-realistic toes.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-hey-you-pikachu]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a brief Instagram reel <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/?igsh=ZnZzeTczcXQ5bHI5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted by Wired Japan</a> (and <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1978569051963310419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by Culture Crave</a>) following a visit to Kojima Productions in Tokyo, Hideo Kojima shared his thoughts on how to use AI during game creation. The renowned game designer behind the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series believes artificial intelligence to be a 'friend' which will help him remain 'one step ahead' in the future.</p>



<p><em>A lot of people use AI in creative work to come up with ideas, but I think of AI as more of a friend. Since I've been in the digital industry, I would lead the creative part and use AI to boost efficiency. I would like AI to handle the tedious tasks. That would lower cost and cut down on time. It's more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it. I see a future where I stay one step ahead; creating together with AI.</em></p>



<p>Hideo Kojima's stance appears to forego an ideological position, whether in favor or against AI, and adopt a pragmatic mindset. Indeed, lowering costs and cutting down on time are two of the most significant problems that the games industry is facing since both development costs and timeframes are constantly on the rise. Mindful usage of AI technologies without negatively impacting human jobs may be the only way to solve or at least mitigate the issue.</p>



<p>Kojima has, after all, always been at the forefront of exploring new boundaries with technology, and continues to do so. Last month, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-productions-and-niantic-spatial-are-partnering-to-push-the-boundaries-of-storytelling-with-a-new-ar-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an unexpected partnership with Niantic Spatial to create a Death Stranding-inspired Augmented Reality experience. Following the June launch of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for PlayStation 5, Hideo Kojima and his team are now <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainly focused</a> on OD, a horror game in development for Xbox Game Studios, while Physint, the new action espionage game in development with PlayStation Studios, is further away on the horizon. Then there are also the big screen adaptations of the Death Stranding IP: a live action film and an animated film.</p>

<p>Sega celebrated the 'Year of Shadow' in 2024</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="75bcb26d6fd1f"><a title="Shadow the Hedgehog" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75bcb26d6fd1f/shadow-the-hedgehog.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Sega ran a year-long campaign for Shadow the Hedgehog that lined up with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> and the introduction of the "Ultimate Lifeform" in the live-action Sonic movies.</p>
<p>This was generally well-received by Sonic fans, and it's now led to some discussion about how Sega could potentially recreate this magic with <em>other</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> characters in the future. Speaking in a <a href="https://youtu.be/IGVWVq8cJPI">recent interview</a>, Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka said he would like to continue this trend by spotlighting a different character. Characters in the next movie will apparently play an active role in this.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xhvtus&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Takashi Iizuka:</strong> “Last year, we promoted The Year of Shadow, influenced by the movie, but I’d like to choose a theme each year and spotlight different characters. I think we can predict which characters will appear in the upcoming movie, so I’d like those characters to play an active role.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As any Sonic fan would know, Sega has a huge cast of characters it can call on. The most recent game release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> features characters from multiple generations of Sonic. Apart from the main cast, this includes characters like Espio, Zavok, and even Sonic's Werehog form.</p>
<p>In terms of the live-action movies, the post-credit scenes in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 have already put the spotlight on a few classic characters, seemingly setting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/seemingly%20setting%20up%20the%20fourth%20major">the fourth major outing</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/emiru-statement-after-twitch-assault-twitchcon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/emiru-releases-damning-statement-after-twitch-assault-%E2%80%98this-is-definitely-my-last-twitchcon%E2%80%99.1328815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, videos surfaced showing a harrowing assault on Emiru at TwitchCon in San Diego this weekend. While participating in a meet-and-greet with fans, the prolific creator was approached by a man who forcefully embraced her, attempting to kiss her in front of a crowd that included security staff.</p>



<p>It was an event that has been lambasted by attendees and viewers, with Twitch’s management and security of the event coming under fire from numerous angles. In response to the event, Emiru, a cosplay and League of Legends streamer with two million followers, posted a lengthy statement berating Twitch and how the firm handled the assault.</p>



<h2 id="h-that-is-a-blatant-lie-emiru-says">‘That is a Blatant Lie’, Emiru Says</h2>



<p>Emiru was attacked by a man at TwitchCon, and while the Twitch leadership and social teams stressed the incident was handled professionally, Emiru had other things to declare that directly conflict with those claims.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full statement from Emiru</a> following the TwitchCon assault:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at twitchcon and even in front of another creators meet and greet to grab me and my face and try to kiss me. Fortunately he wasn’t able to, but a lot of people have pointed out it could have been a lot worse!</p>



<p>I’m obviously shaken up by what happened and it’s not the first time I’ve dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact. </p>



<p>Like I said, I don’t understand how he was allowed to make it to me in the first place. The security in the clip who reacts is my own security (it’s true my favorite and usual security guard was banned for holding a stalkers arm to bring him to police, at a past Twitchcon)</p>



<p>However, there were at least 3 or 4 other TwitchCon security staff in the area who did not react and let the guy walk away, as you can see in the clip since they don’t even appear in the frame LOL </p>



<p>The woman who is walking me away is my own personal manager, and behind the booth, the only two people who were checking on me and comforting me were her and my friend. None of the Twitchcon staff came to ask what happened or if I was okay. </p>



<p>My friend who was present told me Twitch security were also behind the booth afterwards joking about how they didn’t even see what happened and immediately laughing and moving on to talking about something else.</p>



<p>So if no one was checking if I was okay or if I needed anything and they let the guy run away initially, I have no idea what anyone hired to keep the event safe was doing LOL </p>



<p>In Twitch’s statement they said that the guy was immediately caught and detained, I’m sorry but that is a blatant lie. He was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet and I didn’t hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because Twitchcon staff present thought it was a big deal. </p>



<p>I have a lot more I want to say but I will say it on stream later today instead of writing a book on here. </p>



<p>Thank you guys again, sorry you all had to see that. This is definitely my last Twitchcon, and it saddens me to say as a 10 year off and on attendee of Twitchcon, I think other creators should seriously consider not attending in the future. I did not feel cared for or protected, even bringing my own security and staff. I can’t imagine how creators without those options would feel.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some have compared the gravity of the event to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36506082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shooting of Christina Grimmie</a>, a YouTube star turned professional artist who was gunned down in Florida almost a decade ago during an autograph signing event. It’s impossible to know the intentions of some before it’s too late.</p>



<p>This video shows the moment Emiru was assaulted:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following Emiru being assaulted at TwitchCon, her fans took to social media platforms to hurl accusations and insults at Twitch for their handling of the incident, which has now been revealed as lacklustre at best.</p>



<p>TwitchCon continues to be a source of controversy and ill topics regardless of where it’s held or what Twitch does to keep it as secure as possible. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ve got any horror stories from this year’s TwitchCon event.</p>

Now, a new Nintendo patent filed in April and published this week has ignited rumours about Nintendo DS games potentially returning in the future.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613">Mike Odyssey on social media (via GoNintendo)</a>, the three methods of dual-screen gaming detailed include "Dual Screen (Parent and Child Screens), Single Screen Mode (Picture in Picture) and Switch Mode (Switch between Screens)".

<p>The Nintendo DS library previously appeared on Wii U's Virtual Console service. It featured over 30 games and supported touch interaction on the system's GamePad. Considering this particular collection has already appeared on a Nintendo online service, it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if it did resurface at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a patent, so it doesn't necessarily guarantee anything is in the pipeline for the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' library, and it could just be Nintendo going about its usual business. If we do hear anything else about this latest discovery, we'll let you know.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-18-860-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-861-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-sunday-october-19.1328806/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of another week, but hopefully your streak has made it to the end, too! We’re looking at the latest NYT Connections hints and solutions in this guide, helping you to figure out the fastest way to solve today’s puzzle. It’s not so tough, but if you want to continue your streak quickly and get on with your day, you’ll want to scroll down.</p>



<p>Here are the top NYT Connections hints for today, October 19.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-god-of-war-tv-series-casting-call-has-leaked.1328797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A casting call for Amazon’s upcoming God of War adaptation has leaked online from one of entertainment’s biggest insiders.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s iconic God of War series has entertained players since 2005. Unfortunately, a Hollywood adaptation has never been successfully done or thought of. In 2022, Prime Video announced that the reboot titles would be brought to streaming as a show, with many of the game’s crew producing. Just recently, reports of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring 2026 shooting date</a> have surfaced, meaning production is getting into motion. Now, it seems one of the most anticipated parts is underway.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-tv-series-casting-call-leaked-details-characters-and-plot">God of War TV Series Casting Call Leaked, Details Characters and Plot</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to industry insider <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1979632388855779583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK</a>, notable for his credible movie leaks, Prime Video’s God of War is currently casting for the show. In particular, a casting call for several characters, including descriptions, is available and shows some insight into the show’s direction. We see what the team is looking for for Kratos, Atreus, and other parts. The exact descriptions can be found on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/141416746?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK’s Patreon</a> and on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1oa9013/god_of_war_tv_series_casting_call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a> dedicated to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the Reddit post theorizes which description matches which God of War character, it’s up in the air. Regardless, take the leak with a grain of salt, as always. Still, it’s interesting to note a few things about the casting call. First is the description for series regular Alexander, which sounds a lot like Odin. However, Odin only makes a full appearance in Ragnarok, meaning the show may not follow the games too closely. Another interesting bit is for Joshua, likely Atreus, it lists him as a ‘one-year series regular’. This likely means that the show intends to find another actor to play the part after the first season. Atreus, in the games, does grow up, but they kept the same actor, Sunny Suljic, the whole time. </p>



<p>Given Amazon’s God of War’s upcoming start date, it’s likely we’ll have casting by the end of the year. Still, knowing these descriptions, fans can come up with even better fancasts and speculate. A few weeks back, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kratos-actor-shortlist-outlined-by-movie-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actors for Kratos surfaced</a>, and while some may not fit the description anymore, actors like Dave Bautista and in-game actor Christopher Judge still count. </p>



<p>Are you excited for Amazon’s God of War show? Who do you think would make a good Kratos and Atreus? Any other good casting choices? Let us know in the comments and on the official Insider Gaming Discord!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sleeping-dogs-film-adaptation-gets-exciting-update.1328764/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first script draft for the Sleeping Dogs film adaptation is finished, according to its actor and producer.</p>



<p>Released in 2012, Sleeping Dogs has become quite the cult classic. Following an undercover police officer in Hong Kong, players explore an open world with parkour abilities and martial arts. Despite positive reviews, low sales led to the series being dead in the water. However, Hollywood has gotten its hands on it, now reinvigorated by MCU’s Shang-Chi actor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/">Simu Liu</a>, who’ll star as protagonist Wei Shen. Now, according to the actor himself, it’s farther along than we thought.</p>



<h2 id="h-simu-liu-gives-new-update-on-sleeping-dogs-film-adaptation">Simu Liu Gives New Update on Sleeping Dogs Film Adaptation</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1979664278459388314?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simu Liu’s Twitter/X</a>, the actor posted two pictures, with one being of his sleepy dog, Chopa. The other image was of the official Sleeping Dogs script. In the caption, shown above, it seems it has been completed and likely sent in for feedback. Interestingly enough, the name of the writer is blocked, so it could be a surprise new addition or director. Still, after scripting is casting and, eventually, filming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While out of the blue, it’s good to know Sleeping Dogs is proceeding well with an adaptation. In the past, Donnie Yen of Rogue One fame was set to bring it to Hollywood, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nothing turned out</a>. Fortunately, Simu Liu has been very vocal about his desire to make it happen, even producing it himself. While Sleeping Dogs didn’t sell well for games, it may now get another chance with Hollywood.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
It's a busy week for union organisers at Activision Blizzard. Yesterday, in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), a group of over 100 developers that work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> and the mobile only strategy game Warcraft Rumble voted "strongly in favor of wall-to-wall union representation." This comes after around 400 Blizzard platform and technology workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/around-400-blizzard-platform-technology-staff-are-the-latest-microsoft-workers-whove-voted-to-unionise">voted to unionise</a>, also with the CWA.
</p>
<p>
The union is made up of numerous roles such as quality assurance testers, artists, designers, software engineers, and producers, having been particularly inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> devs that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">voted to unionise last July</a>. Organising committee member and game designer Dominic Calkosz said in a statement, "My coworkers, as individuals, have voiced many concerns over the years, but it is easy for any company to ignore individuals. We chose to organise in pursuit of a collective voice and a force of solidarity that the industry cannot ignore."
</p>
<p>
Not that there's ever a bad time to form a union, but you can easily understand why these devs are putting in the work to do so right now. From <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">entire, massive game cancellations</a>, to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">sweeping layoffs at Microsoft</a>, to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-mass-layoffs-microsoft-exec-insists-return-to-office-mandate-is-not-about-reducing-headcount">policy changes</a> that might as well be more layoffs, it is not a secure time to be a game developer right now. Big solidarity to the newly unionised workers.
</p>
<p>
Also worth mentioning as part of ongoing internal tensions at Microsoft is its offering of its Azure cloud services to the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the country's military enacts its invasion of Gaza. The contracts related to these specific services were <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">recently cancelled</a>, but Xbox <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/microsoft-blocks-israel%E2%80%99s-use-its-technology-mass-surveillance-palestinians">remains a target of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games has revealed a new map for the game, set inside an abandoned restaurant. The location--Neil's Diner--was unveiled during a TwitchCon panel that celebrated the recent fifth anniversary of the co-op horror game, and players can explore it starting November 11.</p><p>Kinetic Games described Neil's Diner as a "run-down, retro restaurant" that's been long-abandoned by staff and diners alike. While this is one of the smaller maps in Phasmophobia, it's still full of authentic details and phantoms hungry for thrills.</p><p>"We always thought a diner would fit perfectly, so Nell's was born, and it's been such a fun challenge bringing it to life," lead developer Daniel Knight said in a press release. "Alongside the farmhouse reworks from this year, Nell's is an example of how we want all the maps in Phasmophobia to feel going forward. It's unique, and has been meticulously designed to tell more of a story to our players--beyond the immediate ghost they’re hunting."</p><p>Phasmophobia will be releasing into version 1.0 next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-dev-is-preparing-to-shake-things-up-again/1100-6535210/">but this is just the start of Kinetic's big plans for its hit game</a>. An upcoming overhaul--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-dev-promises-overhaul-that-will-make-it-feel-like-a-new-game/1100-6533159/">dubbed Horror 2.0</a>--will release alongside the 1.0 launch, and the studio says that the update will make Phasmaphobia feel like a new game. Hollywood is also calling, as production company Blumhouse--Five Nights at Freddy's, Paranormal Activity, The Purge, and Insidious--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-movie-coming-from-blumhouse-to-haunt-theaters/1100-6532047/">is adapting the game for the big screen</a>.</p>
