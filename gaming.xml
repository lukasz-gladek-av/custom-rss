            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a>'s early access release has been shoved back three weeks from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-will-release-in-early-access-november-15th">15th November</a> to 6th December 2024, game director Jonathan Rogers has announced in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2zus8ux73s">a brief Youtube video</a>. The action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> itself will seemingly be ready in time for the original launch date, but there's a load of "server-side infrastructure work" that needs doing.</p> <!--more-->
<p>"One of the key promises we made is that all your microtransactions will work across both Path of Exile 1 and 2," Rogers said in the video, as passed on by charming RPS doppelganger <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/this-really-hurts-path-of-exile-2-early-access-has-been-delayed-by-three-weeks/">PCGamer</a>. "In order to do that, we have to integrate the account systems for not only Path of Exile 1 and 2, but also for the console realms as well.</p>
<p>"This meant changing a lot of things: not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that all the old data is backwards compatible with them as well. And when you start migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons."</p>
<p>Old certainly means <em>old</em>, when it comes to Path Of Exile. The original game launched in 2013.</p>
<p>Rogers detailed a few of the aforesaid "strange demons" - accounts sharing the same email address and steam IDs, and accounts that consist of "random gibberish". Purging them will go hand in hand with additional load-testing to ensure the backend code changes don't screw the game up at launch.</p><p>"I actually believe that we possibly could have made the original launch date, but I'm no longer confident that we could do it without making mistakes, and these are the kind of games we just can't let happen," Rogers continued. "So with that in mind, we've decided to delay. Now this one's totally on me. I just didn't leave enough time to make sure we could get it done."</p>
<p>This is as fine a time as any to say that I played a bit of Path Of Exile 2 at Summer Games Fest and - speaking as an extremely greenhorn POE player, so green that I still giggle like a schoolboy when people call it "peeowee" - found it to be quite fun. I was some kind of necromancer, I think. I basically spent my 30 minutes resurrecting enemy corpses while backpedalling furiously. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-to-expect-from-the-path-of-exile-2-beta-and-how-grinding-gears-are-breaking-their-own-rules">a crossbow-wielding class in POE2</a> which looks like it'll be catnip for the twin-stick shmuppers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grinding Gear Games has announced a slight delay to the early access date of Path of Exile 2. The sequel to the highly popular free-to-play hack 'n' slash action RPG will now debut on December 6 instead of November 15 as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-on-november-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>Game Director Jonathan Rogers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2zus8ux73s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the news in a brief video message and explained that it was caused by server-side shortcomings:</p>
<p><em>I'm really sorry about this one. People plan time off around our launches, but we just have to do it. So what happened? Well, it turns out it isn't really the game itself that we're behind on. It's a bunch of server side infrastructure work that has taken us a lot longer than we expected.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the key promises we made is that all your microtransactions will work across both Path of Exile 1 and 2. In order to do that, we have to integrate the account systems for not only Path of Exile 1 and 2 but also for the console realms as well. This meant changing a lot of things. Not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that only old data is backwards compatible with them as well.</em></p>
<p><em>When you start migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons in there. How do multiple accounts get the same name? How do multiple accounts get the same email address? How do multiple accounts have the same steam IDs? Why is this person’s account name just random gibberish that doesn't even decode? We have to get everything perfect so that nobody loses anything they paid for and nobody has their account broken.</em></p>
<p><em>At the same time, because we're changing all this back-end code, we have to do a lot of load testing to make sure the whole thing doesn’t fall over when they could get the huge number of players that we're expecting at the Path of Exile 2 early access launch. I actually believe that we could possibly have made the original date, but I'm no longer confident we could do it without making mistakes, and these are the kind of mistakes we just can't let happen. With that in mind, we've decided to delay.</em></p>
<p>Rogers ended the message with news of an upcoming live stream that will delve deeply into everything that's going to be in the early access launch. The Game Director said it's going to be like the biggest League announcement they have ever done, and he added he's looking forward to sharing information on the endgame content players will find in Path of Exile 2.</p>

<p>One PlayStation player has spent $2000 on 24 years of PS Plus to avoid future price hikes.</p>



<p>Reddit user /u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1gbag2i/lads_i_did_it_subscribed_to_ps_plus_until_2048/?embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgamerant.com%2Fplaystation-plus-user-subscription-24-years-2048%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On_Reddit_In_Class</a>&nbsp;took to the website to say they they made the plunge to avoid “the absurd price increases the past few years,” which promoted the user to buy PS Plus until 2048. </p>



<p>Users reacted with mixed emotions in the Reddit thread, with some calling it a genius move, but only if the services last for that amount of time. Others morbidly said that it’s only good if he “last that long.” </p>



<p>Sony last raised its prices for PS Plus in September 2023 from $59.99 to $79.99, so who knows how much the service could be in the next two decades. The past two decades has seen the industry change various times, too, but whatever the case may be, it’ll probably work out at being good value for money. After all, if the service is cancelled, he’s almost certainly going to get some kind of refund… Right?</p>



<p>What do you think about buying 24 years worth of PS Plus? Do you think it’s a wise investment or a stupid move? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon.1133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad never felt as fleshed out or high-tier as the PCVR version of the game, but yesterday, that changed. The developer, WarpFrog, has pushed out ‘The End Update’, the full release of Nomad that brings it up to spec and makes it feel like an entirely new game.</p>



<p>It’s not without issues, but this change boosts the game’s graphics, frame rate, performance, and sound effects. It also adds the core progression mode, which gives you something to aim for when you play.</p>



<p>It’s like Cyberpunk 2077’s ‘2.0’ update. It has made Nomad feel like an entirely new game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-overhauled">Overhauled</h2>



<p>Let’s get the downsides out of the way before we talk about Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad’s full release.</p>



<p>When you install The End Update, you’ll lose all your mods as they’ll be incompatible. It’s advised that you hit ‘Uninstall All’ on your mod list before you proceed, as even having them installed could cause issues with your update. That’s a massive hit for anyone like me who previously had dozens of mods installed.</p>



<p>Another issue I have is with the combat – decapitation seems to be bizarrely easy, and simply tapping an enemy with a sword results in their head popping off. I’m not sure why, but it’s irritating.</p>



<p>That’s about it when it comes to issues.</p>



<p>The biggest talking point about The End Update is the addition of Crystal Hunt, which is Blade &amp; Sorcery’s core progression mode. With this mode, you’ll get to pick a path and follow it with a new character, exploring an all-new world, never-before-seen (for Nomad) races and factions, and a gameplay loop that gives the game more of a <strong>point</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s what WarpFrog had to say about the introduction of Crystal Hunt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The addition of Crystal Hunt was sheer madness for us because it was like dropping a new game on top of the established Blade &amp; Sorcery game that you already know. Then trying to make that work for the standalone headset… it was insanity fuel. However, here we are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s a skill tree to work through, a trading system, immense new enemies, and a stack of lore and puzzles to unfold and uncover. The graphical improvements are nothing short of stunning, and as someone who poured hours upon hours into Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad before the update, the changes are <strong>night and day</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Everything from the ambient sounds to the effects of spells, and from the detail on weapons to the way enemies behave mid-fight has been changed for the better. </p>



<p>It took me a good few minutes to get to grips with the changes, including the new inventory menu and journal system, but it was worth sticking to it. I cannot stress how impressive The End Update is. Let’s rattle through some more bonuses:</p>



<ul>
<li>There’s a new stash system and the ‘home’ is persistent when it comes to adding and moving things around</li>



<li>Modders can now take full control of the SDK</li>



<li>Enemy mages are now wild and have immense powers</li>



<li>Enemy AI is much more realistic, particularly in combat</li>



<li>The existing Arena maps have been overhauled</li>



<li>The new armour sets and weapons feel and look superb</li>



<li>For the first time, there’s a voiced and animated NPC shopkeeper</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this monumental change has brought about a sharp price increase. Before, Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad would have run you up a bill of just $19.99, but that has been increased to $29.99 to account for the overhaul update.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>The End Update makes one of the best games on VR even better. I didn’t know it was coming, so it was a <strong>very </strong>welcome surprise, but if you’ve been holding out waiting for the full release of Blade and Sorcery: Nomad, you won’t be disappointed. This feels like WarpFrog has given us an entirely new game, and it’s worth every second you spend exploring it.</p>

data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dead Island 2</a></strong> for $22.49 (was $50). Aside from brutal combat and grotesque enemies, it gives you plenty of stats and gear to manage. It’s a great cooperative game, especially if you're looking for a fun way to spend your Halloween evening.</p><p>Then there's also PlayStation's not-zombie games <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdays-gone&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhorror-game-sale-features-scary-good-deals-on-silent-hill-2-cult-of-the-lamb-and-more%2F1100-6527424%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Days Gone</a></strong> for $11.49 (was $50) and <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fthe-last-of-us-part-i&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhorror-game-sale-features-scary-good-deals-on-silent-hill-2-cult-of-the-lamb-and-more%2F1100-6527424%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us Part I</a></strong> for $32.39 (was $60). Days Gone's fast-moving, flesh-eating creatures travel in massive packs and are technically called Freakers (they are fast zombies). It's one of the weaker games from PlayStation Studios from the last decade, but there's still fun to be had and <em>lots </em>of zombies to run over with Deacon St. John's motorcycle. The Last of Part I, meanwhile, is a great remake of one of the most beloved PlayStation games of all time. It has revamped mechanics inspired by The Last of Us Part II and updated graphics. The Last of Us Part I is on sale for. only $32.39 (was $60), so now's a good time to add it to your Steam library.</p><p>Frightfest also includes some notable deals on hit indie games published by Devolver Digital. <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fcult-of-the-lamb&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhorror-game-sale-features-scary-good-deals-on-silent-hill-2-cult-of-the-lamb-and-more%2F1100-6527424%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cult of the Lamb</a></strong>, which is almost certainly the funniest game about running a cult ever made, is up for grabs for 50% off.

We have to delay early access for three weeks. The new date is the December 6. I’m really sorry about this one. People plan time off and things like that around our launches, but we just have to do it.</p><p>So what happened? Well, it turns out it isn’t really the game itself that we’re behind on. It’s a bunch of server side infrastructure work that has taken us a lot longer than we expected.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Now, one of the key promises we made is that all your microtransactions will work across both <em>Path of Exile I</em> and <em>II</em>. In order to do that, we have to integrate the account systems for not only <em>Path of Exile I</em> and <em>II</em>, but also for the console realms as well. This meant changing a lot of things. Not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that only old data is backwards compatible with them as well.</p><p>And when you start migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons in there. How do multiple accounts get the same name? How do multiple accounts get the same email address? How do multiple accounts have the same steam IDs? Why is this person’s account name just random gibberish that doesn’t even decode?</p><p>We have to get everything perfect so that nobody loses anything they paid for, and nobody has their account broken. At the same time, because we’re changing all this back-end code, we have to do a lot of load testing to make sure the whole thing doesn’t fall over when they could get the huge number of players that we’re expecting at launch.</p><p>I actually believe that we could possibly have made the original launch date, but I’m no longer confident we could do it without making mistakes. And these are the kind of mistakes we just can’t let happen. So with that in mind, we’ve decided to delay.</p><p>Now this one’s totally on me. I just didn’t leave enough time to make sure we could get it done. And I’m really sorry. This one really hurts.</p><p>Now we’re going to be having a livestream talking about all the content you can expect in <em>Path of Exile II</em>‘s early access in about four weeks. You can think of it like the biggest league announcement we’ve ever done. I’m really looking forward to telling you guys about the endgame content that the team have been working hard on.</p><p>Until then, thank you very much for your support.</p></blockquote><p>Listen to the message in video form below.</p><h2><span>Three-Week Delay Announcement</span></h2><p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2 Delayed Three Weeks" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2zus8ux73s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is finally here, and lots of people are liking it. And one person liking it very publicly is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian's outspoken director of publishing, Michael Douse - who's been praising BioWare's new RPG, calling it, among other things, "the first Dragon Age game that truly knows what it wants to be."
</p>
<p>
Douse isn't one to shy away from sharing his opinions on social media, of course, having recently fired shots at Ubisoft following <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>'s underperformance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-director-of-publishing-calls-out-baldurs-gate-3-ce-scalpers-for-making-people-sad">called out scalpers</a> for "making [people] sad", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-blasts-publisher-greed-behind-layoffs">spoken candidly</a> about the games industry's current layoff culture, noting, "None of these companies are at risk of going bankrupt... they're just at risk of pissing off the shareholders." But following the launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Douse is singing a rather more positive tune.
</p>
<p>
"I've been playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard in complete secrecy (behind my backpack at the office in front of a giant window, in the kitchen)," he <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1850949592667590700">wrote on X</a>. "From me, you may be wondering, 'Is this a game compatible with my experience during BG3' so I'll tackle it from that perspective. The answer is yes. It is to a heavy, nine-season-long show what a well-made, character driven, binge-worthy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> series is. It has a good sense of propulsion and forward momentum. The combat system is honestly brilliant (to me, a mix of Xenoblade and Hogwarts which is giga-brain genius). It knows when it needs a tentpole narrative moment, and it knows when to let you toy around with your class and exploit some of its stronger elements."

<p>
"More important," Douse added, "to me, it feels like the first Dragon Age game that truly knows what it wants to be... If you want some character-driven romping with a strong combat system in a universe you know, love, or have heard of, it is much better than the average action game, and much less heavy than the gargantuan RPGs that may intimidate at times. In a word, it's fun!"
</p><p>
"I'll always be a [<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>] guy," Douse continued in a <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1850951012053295168">follow-up post</a>, "and this is not that. But at least it's something it wants to be, and not a mishmash of everything. I respect that. I like action games, like RPGs, I like it when they collide. I like shooting baddies with mage magic. Your mileage may vary!"
</p>
<p>
It's a positive outlook on The Veilguard shared by Eurogamer's Robert Purchese, who slapped Dragon Age's latest outing with five shiny gold stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">his enthusisatic review</a>. "What BioWare has managed to accomplish here," he wrote, "in the face of all the pressure it's faced since Dragon Age: Inquisition came out 10 years ago, is extraordinary. From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling. It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general. This is among the very best of them."
</p>
<p>
But back to Douse for one last observation: "I'm extremely happy BioWare gets to stick around - presumably - in these uncertain (because of moronic corporate greed) times," he concluded. "[The Veilguard is] an existential game, and a fun one at that."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/apple-is-turning-the-oregon-trail-into-a-movie/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Apple will adapt the classic educational game <em>The Oregon Trail</em> into a big-budget movie, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/oregon-trail-movie-apple-1236045454/">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a> (THR).</p>
<p>The film is in early development, having just been pitched to Apple and approved. Will Speck and Josh Gordon (<em>Blades of Glory</em>,&nbsp;<em>Office Christmas Party</em>) will direct and produce. Given that pedigree (zany comedies), it's clear this film won't be a serious historical drama about the struggles of those who traveled the American West.</p>
<p>In fact, the report not only notes that it will be a comedy—it says it will be a musical, too. "The movie will feature a couple of original musical numbers in the vein of <em>Barbie</em>," according to THR's sources. EGOT winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul will be responsible for the original music in the film.</p>
<p>Of course, with a comedy, the writers are at least as important as the director. The film will be written by Kenneth and Keith Lucas—but they're most recently best known for the 2021 drama <em>Judas and the Black Messiah</em>, for which they received an Oscar nomination.</p>
<p>That's all we know about the film so far. As for the game, well, it needs no introduction—especially for folks who were of the appropriate age to play it at school or at home on personal computers from the 1970s through the 1990s.</p>
<p>The game is a major cultural touchstone for a certain generation—to the point that "The Oregon Trail Generation" has been used as a label for many of the people born in the early 1980s. It's long been a thing to joke about the game's morbid content, like the infamous phrase: "You have died of dysentery."</p>
<p>Since the film was greenlit by Apple, it's likely to debut on the Apple TV+ streaming service, but we don't yet know when it will arrive or who will star in it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best SVD Loadout in Black Ops 6]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-svd-loadout-in-black-ops-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-svd-loadout-in-black-ops-6.1021554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-svd-loadout-in-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Currently trying to use the SVD in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, but not sure what loadout to use? While it is true that the gun is among the weaker snipers in the game, it still can be quite useful with the right loadout.</p>



<p>Here is our take on the best SVD loadout in Black Ops 6.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-svd-loadout-in-black-ops-6">The Best SVD Loadout in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Sniping in Call of Duty has always been incredibly popular. However, sniping without modifying a weapon is a fool’s game. The SVD can easily become one of the better snipers with the proper loadout.</p>



<h4 id="h-best-svd-loadout">Best SVD Loadout:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Quickdraw Riser</strong> (Comb)</li>



<li><strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> (Barrel)</li>



<li><strong>Heavy Stock</strong> (Stock)</li>



<li><strong>7.62x54mmR FMJ</strong> (Fire Mods)</li>



<li><strong>Ported Compensator</strong> (Muzzle)</li>
</ul>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-quickdraw-riser">Quickdraw Riser</h3>



<p>Quickdraw Risers are essential for pretty much all snipers. This attachment allows players to ADS faster than normal, allowing for players to quick-scope and more. Make sure to equip one to your SVD.</p>



<h3 id="h-reinforced-barrel">Reinforced Barrel</h3>



<p>The Reinforced Barrel helps with damage range for the SVP while also increasing the bullet velocity. It is a great attachment for long-range weapons. However, it does decrease movement speed while aiming, but having the Quickdraw Riser also equipped should help with that issue.</p>



<h3 id="h-heavy-stock">Heavy Stock</h3>



<p>Especially for snipers, the Heavy Stock is essential. This attachment helps improve aim, making the weapon more stable and accurate. Be sure to equip one to your SVP in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-62x54mmr-fmj">7.62x54mmR FMJ</h3>



<p>The 7.62x54mmR FMJ is easily the best fire mod for the SVP, as it helps make the weapons shot much more powerful. </p>



<h3 id="h-ported-compensator">Ported Compensator</h3>



<p>The Ported Compensator improves the recoil of the SVP. This helps immensely with the weapon’s accuracy, allowing for first-shot kills to happen much more often when using the SVP in Black Ops 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[All Rocket League Ranks]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-rocket-league-ranks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-rocket-league-ranks.1021542/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-rocket-league-ranks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rocket League has become an incredibly popular esport over the years, with the game first releasing back in 2015. Since then, various massive Rocket League tournaments have emerged, including RLCS, Collegiate leagues and more. However, Rocket League also has its own competitive mode. Here are all the Rocket League ranks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rocket-league-ranks">Rocket League Ranks</h2>



<p>Like many other games, Rocket League also has a ranked system that players can play, moving up in levels. Like many other games, Rocket League follows the traditional ranking system, starting with Bronze and moving up the list. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-rocket-league-ranks-in-order-from-worst-to-best">All Rocket League Ranks in Order from Worst to Best:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Unranked</li>



<li>Bronze</li>



<li>Bronze II</li>



<li>Bronze III</li>



<li>Silver</li>



<li>Silver II</li>



<li>Silver III</li>



<li>Gold </li>



<li>Gold II</li>



<li>Gold III</li>



<li>Platinum</li>



<li>Platinum II</li>



<li>Platinum III</li>



<li>Diamond </li>



<li>Diamond II</li>



<li>Diamond III</li>



<li>Champion </li>



<li>Champion II</li>



<li>Champion III</li>



<li>Grand Champion </li>



<li>Grand Champion II</li>



<li>Grand Champion III</li>



<li>Supersonic Legend</li>
</ul>



<p>Moving up in ranks in Rocket League can be quite difficult, and claiming the title of Supersonic Legend is definitely a massive accomplishment. In fact, the game used to end at Grand Champion, but after Epic Games bought the title, Supersonic Legend was added to the ranks.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up">How to Rank Up</h2>



<p>Trying to rank up in the game? Well, luckily, the process is simple: Play ranked matches and win. If you constantly lose when playing ranked matches you will not see yourself move up.</p>



<p>Rocket League’s ranked system also has a decent anti-smurfing system, which works to stop high-ranking players from creating new accounts just to play at lower ranks. </p>



<p>The game also has a new system that evaluates one’s rank early on and moves them up higher in level when officially ranking them. Not everyone will start from Bronze.</p>



<p>What is your rank?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Bungie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a small video developer update for their <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming extraction shooter</a> based on the sci-fi Marathon IP. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Game Director</a> Joe Ziegler (who previously worked on The Saboteur at Pandemic and Valorant at Riot) talked a bit about how the game is going to work:</p>
<p><em>We give you a lot of different tools to do a lot of different things inside the game. There is a ton of loot that you can find: weapons, equipment that you can equip that changes your stats or tweaks some of the things that you can do inside the game. There are utility consumables akin to mines or grenades, and there are even consumables to heal yourself and give you utility in that way.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that, there is also another layer: Runners. They are the template by which you equip all that stuff to. Each Runner has a small subset of abilities and on top of that, you get to customize however you want, thinking about what you want to accomplish. You might equip different types of gear to your Runner and then go on those runs with that gear in mind.</em></p>
<p><em>There's a lot of different ways a Marathon session can unfold with all those different pieces. There are also many objectives and things like that that exist inside the game. But of course, every single one comes with its own risk. And the risk is always present that if you don't get out alive, you will lose the things that you have on you.</em></p>
<p>In the latter half of the video, Ziegler said that Bungie has collaborated with some players and creators to iterate on the game over the past two years. Next year, fans can expect to learn a lot more about the game toward the middle of the year, likely during the regular May PlayStation Showcase. In 2025, Marathon will also greatly expand its player testing with each new milestone.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-streamlining-its-many-battle-passes.1021497/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24282075/fortnite-streamlining-battle-passes-music-lego-festival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23993686/fortnite-og-new-players-lego-fortnite">bigger than a battle royale now</a>, and to help make progressing through the various available battle passes a little bit more streamlined, Epic Games is going to allow XP from any experience apply to any of those passes.</p><p>Currently, XP you earn across various modes in <em>Fortnite</em> doesn’t help you progress through the special passes for <em>Lego Fortnite</em> and the music-themed <em>Fortnite Festival.</em> Instead, you progress by earning “studs” and “festival points,” respectively, by playing those modes.</p><p>Starting November 2nd, however, Epic will begin the migration to let you progress using XP. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience">As Epic details in a blog post</a>, the change will first apply the upcoming Music Pass (renamed from Festival Pass), meaning festival points will go away. On December 1st, the change to XP will go into effect for the “Brick or Treat” Lego Pass and studs will be retired. That same day, the “battle stars” that you earn with XP in <em>Fortnite’s</em> main battle pass will also be removed.</p><p>Epic is continuing to make <em>Fortnite</em> more of a platform with lots of Epic- and creator-made experiences rather than just one main mode. Letting players use XP to all of its various players helps address some growing pains with that transition — especially now that Epic has had about a year since the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/8/23993494/catch-some-air"><em>Rocket Racing</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23756615"><em>Fortnite Festival</em></a><em> </em>to figure out what players want.</p><p>There are a few more changes coming, too. Music and LEGO Passes that release after December 1st will offer one track that has both free rewards and premium rewards exclusive to people who buy them, like how the main <em>Fortnite </em>battle pass works.

		<p>So we'll have more formal details on this ASAP, but the short version is that we're going to be getting together in person in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=872_7q9tqxw&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">New York City</a> next week for another in-person stream. Nearly three full days of streaming across Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And all for a good cause, because we're bringing back Save Point. It's going to be a lot of fun, a lot of things are coming together last minute, but as soon as a few of those things work out, I promise we'll have more concrete info. </p><p>-pk, who scheduled his flight back home just in time for football</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Interview (Home Depot's Skeleton Daddy)</em> – Well, this is it. The big time. I'm so glad I managed to get this interview before I turn 40 next year, because it means I haven't wasted the last four decades. I haven't been able to record as many interviews as I would've liked in recent months, but look, sometimes you make up for all of it in one go. Hope you enjoy this!</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Space Marine 2</em> – We'll probably play a few hours of<em> Space Marine 2 </em>at the live show, too, but we're going to dip our toes back into our favorite co-op game that we love to complain about at the end because of the gear grind.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommend</em>s – OK, I'm excited about this one. The idea of a "staff picks" article came up some weeks back and it hasn't left my head, so we're going to pilot a new regular series where, every month, we recommend a game that's lingered in our minds and hearts as the month ends. (Yes, I still want to do a proper Steam Curator thing, too. Stay tuned.) I think there's a possibility we do one that involves what we're watching/listening/reading, too.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Horror Games</em> – We're still figuring out the <em>what</em> part of this stream, but basically Rob, Patrick, and Cado are gonna get together and get a lil' spooky. Because of my family Halloween obligations, I won't have time to do another nighttime horror stream, but I promise we'll get back to that again.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio </em>– Janet has finished the new<em> Life Is Strange,</em> and according to the review she wrote, uh, it does not finish well. Welp. No thoughts on the new <em>Dragon Age</em> just yet, but I'm going to start it this week.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Rob &amp; Patrick's Letter Series </em>– Still figuring out the topic for this one, because we tend to write it as the week goes on, but we'll have somethin'.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954">reviewed it here at <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>, and despite being jaded toward the series for the better part of a decade, I really loved the long-awaited fourth entry. Right now it sits at a strong 84 on review aggregate site <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a></span>, which is about in line with where these games typically land. The original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> sits at an 86, with <em>Inquisition</em>, the series’ third entry, landing close by at 84. Meanwhile, <em>Dragon Age II</em>, probably the most divisive game in the series, sits at 79. As much as I loved my time with <em>The Veilguard</em>, I knew it would elicit some pretty divergent reactions from folks. There are 10s and there are some more middling scores. You can even find some folks straight-up saying they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-Kd2BBpx8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-Kd2BBpx8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“do not recommend”</a></span> the game, like YouTuber Skill Up does while discussing all his problems with BioWare’s latest entry.

I loved the games when they came out, then replayed them all for a book club-style podcast I do and soured on them all in their own ways over time, largely due to the series’ handling of continuity and its tendency to hand off protagonists’ stories from one to another. <em>The Veilguard </em>pulled me back in when I could not have been more out. The story was a slow burn, but I was genuinely thrilled by its finale. The new cast of heroes won me over pretty easily and ascended to the upper echelons of my own personal rankings of BioWare’s RPG casts. And though it deviates greatly from the series’ tactical roots, I found the action-based combat a blast to play and experiment with. Overall, it’s a game that feels like it harkens to the studio’s heyday, and is a reminder of what it does best.</p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span> sits at the bottom of the Metacritic spread and came to pretty much the opposite conclusions I did on some of those points, in part because what I viewed as a calculated “back to basics” moment for the team felt, to their critic, somewhat archaic.</p><p>“Within the modern action RPG space, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> feels fine,” reviewer Jordan Middler wrote. “It’s a game that is never overtly bad, but it’s also only ever very fleetingly amazing. We particularly enjoyed its cast, but the majority of things you’re asked to do with them are disappointingly repetitive. There are moments of spectacle, and longer main missions that show potential, but overall we were left feeling like BioWare hasn’t evolved with the times.”</p><p>Though I adored the members of the titular Veilguard, others didn’t find the new characters quite so endearing, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.si.com/videogames/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.si.com/videogames/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sports Illustrated</em></a></span><em> </em>drawing a critical parallel to the writing in the MCU.</p><p>“A lot of the dialogue in <em>Veilguard</em> has that same, sarcastic, quippy tone of the Marvel movies,” Kirk McKeand wrote. “It’s like someone crunching an ice pop in your ear. There are rare moments where excellent writing reaches through the screen and makes you consider your mortality, but it’s inconsistent. Compelling conversations about religion, history, and the interpretations of both are juxtaposed against voice lines where people say things like “watch out, these guys GO HARD”, “were they… doing it?”, or “taking the p*ss”. It pulls you right out of the fantasy setting. These characters definitely know what TikTok is.”</p><p>There’s been a lot of pre-release discussion around whether or not <em>The Veilguard </em>feels “like a <em>Dragon Age</em> game.” Skill Up’s video touches on this in the most damning review I’ve seen thus far. It starts off going real hard on <em>The Veilguard</em>’s tone, saying it doesn’t match the same dark tone some have come to expect in previous games, while also just broadly saying the writing is not up to snuff.</p><p>“The writing is, frankly, terminal.” Skill Up says. “It lacks any nuance or wit or wisdom. It cannot communicate ideas except to say them aloud to the camera. It manufactures petty, unbelievable tension because it doesn’t know how to create anything more real and it’s too scared to ever be truly confronting or dark for fear that it might make the audience uncomfortable. Every interaction between the companions feels like HR is in the room and every interaction led by the main character Rook sounds like he’s addressing an under-12 soccer team before a semi-final or teaching toddlers how to properly share toys.”</p><p>Ouch. By contrast, while I wouldn’t defend every line BioWare wrote, as I do think there’s some merit to the MCU comparison, I didn’t feel like the game was compromising on the series’ typical dark fantasy trappings. Sure, the world doesn’t look as gnarly as it did back in <em>Origins</em> because <em>The Veilguard</em> presents it in a more Pixar-esque art style (and with cinematography to match), but there’s still some high stakes and some pretty horrifying lore drops in stories like that of Davrin, the Grey Warden who discovers hidden truths in the faction’s history, or in the big reveals tied to Solas, the <em>Inquisition</em> party-member turned antagonist of <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>But what about the folks on the higher end of the scale? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span><em> </em>gave <em>The Veilguard </em>a whopping five stars out of five. While the pivot to action RPG combat has been a contentious point for those who want to see the series return to its tactical roots, it’s landing for folks who want something more evocative of BioWare’s <em>Mass Effect</em>.</p><p>“...there’s a lot more other stuff going on in <em>The Veilguard</em> combat than has been in <em>Dragon Age</em> games before,” Robert Purchese wrote. “It’s an action game, really, a boundary the series has been pushing towards but never quite passed, always emotionally shackled, as it was, by its CRPG roots. But now it’s stepped over, taking <em>Mass Effect</em>’s lead as an example, and it’s discovered something new and very successful as a result.”</p><p>Another controversial decision that the game’s developers made is just how it implements choice and consequence. Impactful choices have been a big part of BioWare’s portfolio over the years, and when it was confirmed that <em>The Veilguard </em>would only import three choices from previous games (all of which are from 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>), there was a fear that the game would feel detached from the past. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em>’s</a></span> 9/10 review touches on this, saying <em>The Veilguard </em>feels like a soft reboot of sorts, even as it includes the protagonist from the previous game and a conflict that should, in theory, feature them frequently.</p><p>“If you were expecting decisions from previous games in the series to carry over, I’m sorry to say they’ve never mattered less,” Leana Hafer wrote. “[...] things like who you chose to make head of the Chantry at the end of <em>Inquisition</em> never come up. There’s no sign of the Warden from <em>Origins</em>, even though you visit the stronghold of their order. Hawke gets only a passing mention. There are some other cameos from both <em>Origins</em> and <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, but those characters conspicuously don’t reference any important choices you may have made in their presence. This story feels like both a send-off and a soft reboot, in a way, which was paradoxically a bit refreshing and disappointing at the same time.”</p><p>I was of two minds on this in my review. Over the years, I think I’ve learned it’s more important to me that my old choices are not contradicted in future games, rather than that they have some huge effect on the events of sequels. Given that BioWare wasn’t going to do all the admittedly costly and time-consuming work of reflecting your many choices from earlier games in this one, seeing them carefully write around the past was preferable to them making a definitive call about those events that may have contradicted my experience. <em>The Veilguard</em> takes place in lands far removed from those old choices, so it makes some sense that it wouldn’t be constantly referencing the past. However, I couldn’t get behind <em>The Veilguard</em>’s portrayal of the previous game’s protagonist, the Inquisitor, in their brief appearances.</p><p>“Perhaps the Inquisitor’s minimal presence gave me the space to grow attached to Rook and fill in how he would be different from my last <em>Dragon Age</em> character,” I said in <em>Kotaku</em>’s review. “But every time I met up with the Inquisitor, I was reminded that the character who, ten years ago, I imagined would be facing Solas was just a puppet dragged out of a closet, a half-assed fulfillment of an obligation BioWare seems unwilling to completely make good on.”</p><p>While the decision to only have a few choices carry over is iffy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GamesRadar+</em></a></span><em> </em>argues that as a whole, <em>The Veilguard </em>manages to be comprehensible to newcomers through clarity in its writing, while also catering to long-time fans by delivering on so many major mysteries they’ve been pondering for over a decade.</p><p>“<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is about as approachable as it can be for both new players and those that have previously thanked the Maker,” Rollin Bishop wrote. “Appropriate context is given when proper nouns are brought up, going some way to avoid being impenetrable and making it as fine a point of entry as any to dive into. But it also answers many questions that longtime players have had over the years… while introducing even more tantalizing hints at what might come next. My only hope is that we don’t have to wait another 10 years to find out more.”</p><p>From the sound of it, where you’ll land on <em>The Veilguard </em>largely seems to depend on what you come to it looking for. Its action slant has impressed some, while others are still jonesing for a tactical game like <em>Origins</em>. If you want a continuation of your choices from old games you might be disappointed, but if you want a conclusion to years-long threads, <em>The Veilguard </em>offers those in spades. There are a lot of little nuances that might tip a prospective player to one side or the other, or you might just find yourself falling somewhere in the middle like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VG24/7</em></a></span>, who acknowledged that the ways in which people have diverged will make <em>The Veilguard </em>an interesting game to talk about.</p><p>“I expect the divided discourse to be as interesting as - and more varied than - the game,” Alex Donaldson wrote. “One thing that I think is inarguable, though, is that it showcases a BioWare on steadier feet than at any point in the last decade. Where that firmer stance has been planted just means one’s mileage really is going to vary more than the norm, depending on your predilections and tolerances.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Almost exactly a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-delays-destiny-2s-final-shape-expansion-and-marathon">it was reported</a> Bungie had delayed its sci-fi extraction shooter Marathon into 2025, the studio has released a gameplay free developer update saying the game is "on track", albeit a "little early to show" - and that it'll "reveal a lot more" next year.
</p>
<p>
The news comes via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE">nine-minute developer video</a> presented by Marathon game director Joe Ziegler, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">took over the role</a> from former project lead Chris Barrett earlier this year, after the latter was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">reportedly ousted from Bungie due to inappropriate behaviour</a>.
</p>
<p>
In his update, Ziegler began with a brief overview of Bungie's Marathon reboot, outlining the extraction shooter's basic loop (complete quests, find loot to upgrade abilities, then get it out of the extraction zone to keep it), alongside a few other gameplay details. Playable Runners, for instance, are each said to have a "small subset" of abilities that can be further customised with gear, depending on what players want to achieve. That's alongside promises of "lots of tools, "lots of objectives" and lots of ways an individual run can unfold.

<p>
Ziegler also touched on Marathon's connection to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungies-original-sci-fi-shooter-marathon-hits-steam-for-free">Bungie's 90s sci-fi shooter series of the same name</a>, saying the reboot uses a lot of "familiar elements" from the original - including the "mysteries, eeriness, and psychological creepiness" - then layers on elements that help "modernise" it, such as a new story and world Bungie can continue to update.
</p><p>
In terms of progress, Zeigler explained there'd been a "lot of aggressive changes to the game" over the last few years, and that Bungie has been "iterating pretty heavily". As such, there are a "variety of different things in different states" right now; environments, for instance, are said to be "coming together in a really beautiful way", while character models are "coming together but not fully there yet", and enemy models are still "kind of a little bit in an early state".
</p>
<p>
"It's a little early to show you all of it as one piece," Ziegler said, "but all of these things are on-track. They're not all together but when they all do come together, we really are looking forward to showing you what that looks like, especially in play." But while Bungie isn't yet ready to show any gameplay, Ziegler did share a couple of bits of concept art, one showing a Runner with the codename Thief, and another "deception" based character called Stealth.

And while Bungie has nothing else to show right now, it plans to "reveal a lot more... in the midst of 2025". Next year will also see the studio expand its playtesting, with Ziegler revealing the team wants to add a "significant amount of players to each of our milestones as we're going forward". The studio will let the community know "when that happens".
</p><p>
"The interest that you've shown engaging with all the content we've created... really fuels us on a daily basis," Ziegler concluded in his video update. "We're excited to engage with you more in 2025 and beyond as we bring this game to all of you to play."

Today's update is the first time Bungie has talked about Marathon in any real detail since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">unveiling the project in 2023</a>, and the first promotional push since the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">laid off 220 staff</a> - roughly 17 percent of its workforce - back in July.

Though Blizzard has released several variations of its annual spooky event, the original Junkenstein’s Revenge was one of the earliest examples of the potential lurking beneath the competitive surface. It has such a good concept: Reinhardt gathering folks around for a spooky story starring alternate versions of <em>Overwatch</em> heroes in a fight to survive the night. The vibes are immaculate, the actual event is a blast to play with friends, and Blizzard has rolled out some reasonably challenging spins on it over the years. Just don’t think about it too hard or you’ll remember this game was supposed to have a PvE story mode. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-recommend-id="image://619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-recommend-id="image://619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Dates: </strong>October 8 through November 5<br></p><p>Halo Infinite is still around and going strong.

<p>Competitive Call of Duty is being kicked off early in Black Ops 6, but it’s not being backed by Activision.</p>



<p>ZooMaa’s ‘The Flank’ has announced a triple-threat of tournaments that’ll take place between October 29 and November 6, and as a collective, they boast a $100,000 prize pool. It’s a CDL AR &amp; SMG spree that boasts 12 teams made up of four players each, and it comes before the 2025 CDL season has even been formally announced.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-our-own-hands">Into Our Own Hands</h2>



<p>From the moment Black Ops 6 was released, the more competitive players among us were looking for an angle from which they could earn. Wagers sprung up, $8s started running rampant on social media, and amateur kick-off tournaments were set up far and wide.</p>



<p>This is by far the biggest Black Ops 6 tournament to surface, and it comes mere days after the game was released.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Flank has revealed the following schedule:</p>



<ul>
<li>October 29 – $25,000 tournament</li>



<li>November 1 – $25,000 tournament</li>



<li>November 5/6 – $50,000 tournament</li>
</ul>



<p>On tonight’s episode of The Flank, the teams are being picked live, and the expectation is that it’ll be mostly CDL and Challengers players that make the cut, with a few Warzone competitors sprinkled in as cannon fodder.</p>



<p>It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty fan – the off-season and pre-season events hosted by brands like OpTic and The Flank are typically more entertaining than the official CDL events. Don’t tell Activision I said that, though.</p>

                <p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, one of the most popular and best action games of the year, has just received a nice discount on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warhammer-40-000-Space-Marine-PlayStation/dp/B0CVSDJNKS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warhammer-40-000-Space-Marine-PlayStation/dp/B0CVSDK499?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>. Space. Marine 2 released in September with a $70 price point for consoles, $10 more than the PC edition. But now console players can dive into the action for $60, too. Amazon and Best Buy have discounted Space Marine 2 by 10 bucks for both PS5 and Xbox Series X. </p><hr><h2>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Deals</h2><p><strong>$60 (<del>$70</del>)</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4391588-space-marine-2-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391588" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4391588-space-marine-2-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391588"></a><figcaption>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4391588-space-marine-2-1.jpg"></figure><ul><li><strong>Amazon: Space Marine 2 Deals</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warhammer-40-000-Space-Marine-PlayStation/dp/B0CVSDJNKS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warhammer-40-000-Space-Marine-PlayStation/dp/B0CVSDK499?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Best Buy: Space Marine 2 Deals</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1833418344167801903%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2-gets-first-discount-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x%2F1100-6527429%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1833418332697195014%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2-gets-first-discount-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x%2F1100-6527429%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>Like the original game published many years ago, Space Marine 2 goes all in on its action premise and Warhammer 40K setting. The best defense in the game is a good offense, and as a Primaris Space Marine, there's a gratifying amount of ultra-violence here as you carve a bloody path through the Tyranid hordes. The game looks good, feels consistently fun to play, and it has robust PvP and PvE modes to sample after the end credits have rolled on its meaty campaign.</p><p>"Space Marine 2 is a fantastic sequel that builds on its predecessor in every way, bombarding you with an overwhelming enemy and chaotic action that makes you feel like a small part of a much larger war," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/" data-ref-id="1900-6418276">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 review</a>.</p><p>PC gamers aren't being left out in the cold either, as Space Marine 2 continues to be available for a discounted price at GameSpot sister site Fanatical.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-windows-home-experience-is-available-for-xbox-insiders/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Those who are signed up as an Xbox Insider will now have the opportunity to experience the new Windows Home experience in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/">Xbox app</a>. It features a lot of changes and brings forward a new design that shows off the top games on Game Pass and Store tabs, as well as providing you with new games, news, and curated recommendations. For those who may not be able to splurge on new games, it also shows off free-to-play content for those looking for a new experience and game to play but don't want to sink any money into it.</p>
<p>This new experience comes after months of listening to feedback and trying out different designs internally. They have made this new Windows Home experience for Xbox Insiders to test out, hoping to make a faster and easier Xbox app on Windows, allowing those who utilize it to jump between Game Pass and Microsoft Store with ease and without having to flip between tabs constantly.</p>
<p>Walking through the highlights of the new Home experience, the main part is the featured content. This provides an at-a-glance view of upcoming game releases, events, and content that is available via Game Pass and sales. Alongside this, you'll be able to get the latest deals and discounts available to peruse, showing you the best deals and discounts on offer so that you don't have to pay full price for games and new experiences.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will now be curated collections and recommendations for you based on what games you've played previously. The games shown to you will include games from both Game Pass and the Store, depending on which way you prefer to access your games.</p>
<p>Microsoft has also added a 'Jump Back In' feature as part of the Game Pass tab experience. This features allows players in Compact Mode to click on a game card and will send them directly to the game hub, where you can press play and jump back into the game seamlessly. This feature has been in testing since May, and is now available as part of the new Home experience for all Xbox Insiders.</p>
<p>While it isn't widely available for those who aren't Xbox Insiders at the moment, you can join the Xbox Insider Program by downloading the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Insider Hub</a>, which will give you access to new features and previews that Microsoft are working on to improve the Xbox experience.</p>

<p>Popular lifestyle and gaming organization, 100 Thieves, revealed a brand-new Adidas Merch line, which is set to drop this November. The drop, which includes shoes, sweatshirts and more, is another perfect example of how very few gaming organizations are doing it like 100 Thieves.</p>



<h2 id="h-100-thieves-x-adidas-merch-release-date">100 Thieves x Adidas Merch Release Date</h2>



<p>The new merch by Adidas and 100 Thieves is currently set to release on the following date:</p>



<ul>
<li>November 6, 2024.</li>
</ul>



<p>Those looking to purchase the drop can do so at the official <a href="https://t.co/lud7N2Kfep">Adidas website</a> and select retailers. However, 100 Thieves fans will be able to get early access to the new merch at <a href="https://100thieves.com/">100 Thieves’s website</a> on November 2, 2024.</p>



<p>100 Thieves has been dedicated to providing gamers with sleek-designed merch for years now in hopes of combining both lifestyle clothing and gaming.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-report-100-thieves-to-build-cdl-superteam-based-on-scrap-and-hydra">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100-thieves-cdl-superteam/">REPORT: 100 Thieves To Build CDL ‘Superteam’ Based on Scrap and HyDra</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-the-merch-drop">Everything Included in the Merch Drop</h2>



<p>The 100 Thieves x Adidas merch drop marks the second time the two brands have worked together. The drop is being called the Adidas Originals x 100 Thieves Drop 02 and will feature the following clothing items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Long Sleeve Shirt</li>



<li>Jacket</li>



<li>Shoes</li>



<li>Socks</li>
</ul>



<p>The entire drop fits well together, featuring a black, white and red design pattern. </p>

<p>It has become quite common for large brands, such as Adidas, to work with gaming companies and organizations. 100 Thieves, however, continues to put out merch like no other.</p>



<p>Will you be purchasing any of the upcoming 100 Thieves merch? While prices have not been revealed, it will more than likely be a bit more on the expensive end.</p>

They plan to be gaming the rest of their lives so decided it would "save a good bit of money."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A PS Plus Essential subscription cost $79.99 per year, so 24 years worth costs $1,919.76. Then, Sony was kind enough to offer the player an 89% discount to upgrade to a Premium subscription in a bizarre loophole, charging just $199.99 instead of $1,889.75, meaning it came to $2,119.75 altogether,</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Best PS Plus Games (Extra &amp; Premium Tiers)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the reaction to On_Reddit_In_Class's post was a mixture of shock and awe, there is at least some logic behind the move, assuming PlayStation Plus remains a thing into the mid 21st century. Subscription service prices are on the rise, with everything from PS Plus to Xbox Game Pass and Netflix going up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-raises-price-of-playstation-plus-12-month-subscriptions-across-all-tiers">Sony last raised the price of PS Plus in September 2023</a>, from $59.99 to $79.99 for the most basic tier. "This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service," it said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-defends-ps-plus-price-rises">Analysts said this was inevitable</a>, so another increase in the future isn't out of the question. Xbox Game Pass has seen a similar price rise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">doubling from $9.99 at its launch in 2017 to $19.99 now</a>. Buying a subscription ahead of time guarantees the price remains the same, however, so On_Reddit_In_Class may be on to something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

We’ve got some redeemable codes that will load your wallet up with a ton of free cash.

The first is that the code was inputted incorrectly. Make sure you have the code inputted exactly as it is in the Active Codes section above. You can even copy and paste codes directly from this article over to Roblox if you want to make sure you’re inputting them correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other possibility is the code has expired or you’ve already used it. If you’ve used it, you’ll get a message below the bar reminding you the inputted code has already been redeemed. If you’ve inputted it and it doesn’t recognise the code at all, it likely means it's no longer available to use and is expired.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Dandy's World Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to scout out some Dandy's World codes yourself, the easiest way is through the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/8TWD9V9" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Discord</a>. After joining, you’ll be able to hop into the <strong>Announcements</strong> channel to find all the latest codes as they drop.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Dandy's World in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Dandy's World is a mascot horror survival game in the same vein of spooky hits like Five Nights at Freddy's or Poppy Playtime. The major difference is Dandy's World is multiplayer, meaning you and up to seven other friends can jump in, pick a toon with unique abilities and perks to play as, and attempt to survive as long as possible while evading the game's endless supply of terrifying monsters. The longer you survive, the more Ichor you gather, allowing you to buy new toons to help you push further into the nightmare and get the drop on your foes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.
