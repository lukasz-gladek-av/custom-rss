			<p>The rumored Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered collection is real, and it is launching in just a few months, according to new <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain%E2%84%A2-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-psn-december-10-2024.989865/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information discovered on the PlayStation Store today.</a></p>
<p>The collection, which will be released to celebrate the Soul Reaver's 25th anniversary, is being developed by Aspyr Media and will allow players to experience the epic conflict between Raziel and Kain in its original form or with remastered graphics, which are showcased in a brand new set of screenshots. A trailer can also be watched <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

<p>While the official announcement, which is likely to be made in a few hours during the PlayStation State of Play presentation, is rather welcome, it is hardly surprising, as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered was revealed back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered/">July</a> by two statues depicting Raziel and Kain that were on display during San Diego Comic-con with the unannounced remasters branding. Hopefully, the remasters will prove to be successful enough to spur the development of a new entry in the series. Following the release of Legacy of Kain: Defiance, the series has been pretty much dead, not counting the multiplayer game Nosgoth which never saw the light of day after multiple rounds of testing.</p>
<p>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered launches on December 10th. Platforms beside PlayStation consoles have yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded-in-under-an-hour.990105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pathea Games has launched the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, the third major game in the&nbsp;<em>My Time&nbsp;</em>series, and the response has been pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>The studio was asking for a total of £149,777 (forgive my use of British pounds, but I am a Brit) as part of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its campaign</a>, which is set to run for 30 days. That funding goal was met in less than an hour of the campaign going live.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the total amount raised by Pathea for&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>stands at £221,772, and it's rising rapidly; while writing this story, the campaign has jumped another £10,000 or so. Impressive, right?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded-vista.jpg?itok=f6UCa-T9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded-vista.jpg?itok=8faiMcq- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>is definitely going ahead, so never fear.</figcaption></figure><p>The campaign doesn't currently appear to include any stretch goals; Pathea says the funding will be used to augment&nbsp;<em>Evershine</em>'s budget, which the studio expects to reach around $12 million, which is about the same as&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>cost.</p>
<p>Although there aren't any stretch goals right now, there are a number of rewards you can reap for donating different amounts, including a signed artbook, a figurine, and even the chance to become a recruitable NPC in&nbsp;<em>Evershine&nbsp;</em>(although that last one carries an eye-watering $10,000 price tag).</p>
<p>In any case, it looks as though&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>has the built-in audience it wants already, and with 29 days to go on the Kickstarter campaign, the game is likely to rake in a whole lot more money before crowdfunding is through. Hurrah!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-pathea-games">the followup</a> to Pathea Games'&nbsp;<em>My Time at Portia&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>. It takes place in the same world as those games, but features a more realistic art style and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-fully-revealed">new focus on city management</a>.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date or window for&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>yet, but when the game does arrive, it'll launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199500/My_Time_at_Evershine/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">whatever the Nintendo Switch 2 turns out to be called</a>. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

This means, moving about the world organically, you’ll likely miss a lot of the best quests! Some are cleverly hidden, others require special stat checks or certain prerequisites to be met before you can reap the rewards, and it’s all too easy to just walk past them, never even knowing they were there. To address this, I’ve highlighted some of my favorite hidden quests you may have missed on your first playthrough.<br></p><p>Several of these quests begin early in the game and have multiple sections which unfold as the game progresses, which means that missing the beginning in Act 1 locks you out of some good payoffs later on. Others are one-hits that require a bit of extra work. But keep in mind this is a small sample of hidden quests—there are too many of them to write about them all! So keep exploring every corner, speaking to every character, trying every dialogue option, and using every item to find your own surprises.</p><p>But now, click next and let me help you find some of the best secret and hidden quests in the game you might otherwise have completely missed.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5709ba12fba52c3051aaa3c04bb2f4e2" data-recommend-id="image://5709ba12fba52c3051aaa3c04bb2f4e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thay 1" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thay 1" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5709ba12fba52c3051aaa3c04bb2f4e2" data-recommend-id="image://5709ba12fba52c3051aaa3c04bb2f4e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thay 1" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h96329"><a id=""></a>Quest Start Location: Act 1 - Under the Blighted Village</h3><p> To find this hidden extra in the Search The Cellar quest, enter the door next to the Waypoint in Blighted Village and go behind the bar to find a door leading to the basement.

First up we have the heavily rumored Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered, assets for which were spotted on the PlayStation Store before being swiftly removed.</p><p>According to the store description (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain%E2%84%A2-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-psn-december-10-2024.989865/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resetera</a>), Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered is developed by Embracer-owned video game revival specialist Aspyr, and launches December 10, 2024 to coincide with Soul Reaver’s 25th anniversary. There’s even a trailer and a number of screenshots, all lifted from PSN before Sony reversed its mistake.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered screenshots <a href="https://t.co/1GqTzgPlxX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1GqTzgPlxX</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1838561167641387152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“Experience the epic conflict of Kain and Raziel in original form or with remastered graphics,” reads the description. The games included are remasters of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2, both cult classics developed by Crystal Dynamics and helmed by designer Amy Hennig for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 respectively. Crystal Dynamics, the Legacy of Kain franchise, and Aspyr are all currently owned by Embracer Group.</p><p>Here’s the (leaked) official blurb:</p><blockquote>Experience the Legendary Narrative<br>Centuries after your former master, Kain, betrays and executes you, you rise again and embark on a relentless quest for revenge.<br>Wield the Powers of a Wraith. Slay your former vampire brethren with your claws, bolts of telekinetic energy, and the elemental Wraith Blade. Grow stronger by devouring the souls of your enemies.<br>Shift Between Realms. The Elder God has granted you the ability to shift between the Spectral and Material Realms. Traverse the realms to solve puzzles, reveal new paths, and defeat your foes.</blockquote><p>In July, eagle-eyed San Diego Comic-Con 2024 attendees spotted branding for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-sdcc-fans-think-theyve-spotted-a-legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-and-2-remaster-tease-sdcc-2024">an unannounced remaster of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 and 2</a>, so this latest development doesn't come as much of a surprise. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver originally launched in 1999 for the PS1 and PC, while its direct sequel, Soul Reaver 2, was released in 2001 for PS2 and PC. Both games are part of the dark fantasy action RPG series, though the franchise has remained dormant for decades. The last entry, Legacy of Kain: Defiance, was released in 2003 for PS2, PC, and the original Xbox.</p><p>Though the series was neglected for years, hopes for the franchise's return surfaced in October 2022 when Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-asking-fans-new-legacy-of-kain-game">published a survey</a> asking fans if they would like to see a new game from the Legacy of Kain series. A few months after the survey was released, Crystal Dynamics owner Embracer Group revealed it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-legacy-of-kain-looks-likely-as-embracer-receives-strong-fan-response">received 100,000 responses</a>, hinting that a new game could be in development.</p><p>Sony's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-for-september-2024-officially-announced">State of Play broadcast</a> is set for today, September 24, at 3pm PT / 6pm ET, with news on more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PS VR2 games “from studios around the world.” Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered, it seems, is among them.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/peacemakers-animality-in-mortal-kombat-1-is-about-as-patriotic-as-you-can-get<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> expansion Khaos Reigns almost upon us, developer NetherRealm has lifted the lid on its new characters and, in particular, its brand new animalities.</p><p>Animalities, free for all Mortal Kombat 1 players as part of an update released today, September 24, see characters transform into an animal before tearing apart their opponent in the trademark over-the-top style. Animalities return to Mortal Kombat alongside the release of Khaos Reigns, having made their debut in Mortal Kombat 3 all the way back in 1995.</p><p>Now, NetherRealm has revealed Peacemaker’s Animality. Peacemaker, a DLC guest character lifted from the DC Universe featuring the likeness and voice of actor John Cena, transforms into an eagle for a patriotic team-up with Eagly that involves severed legs, machine guns, a grenade, and, finally, the flag of the United States itself.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WTF is Peacemaker's Animality / Friendship 😂This is hilarious<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a><a href="https://t.co/pQYi3T0qzD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/pQYi3T0qzD</a></p>— thethiny 🐰🍉 (@thethiny) <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1838385298209718649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Fans are already comparing Peacemaker’s Animality to the 'WTF Is A Kilometer' meme, which refers to a satirically patriotic American catchphrase sprawled on picture of George Washington with a bald eagle and a minigun.</p><p>NetherRealm has form when it comes to references. Indeed, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghostfaces-fatality-in-mortal-kombat-1-is-a-great-scream-reference">Ghostface’s Fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 is a reference to the Scream movies</a> from which the guest character originates. Noob Saibot’s bone-crunching Animality is a direct reference to the character’s Fatality in Mortal Kombat 9. And fellow DLC character Sektor <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sektors-mortal-kombat-1-fatality-channels-marvels-iron-man-heads-out-of-this-world"><u>has a Fatality that references Marvel’s Iron Man</u></a>.</p><p>And sticking with the patriotic bird theme, Homelander's Animality sees The Boys supervillain turn into a griffin.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Homelander animality (Griffin) Eagle 🦅🦅<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat</a> <a href="https://t.co/LjZ5r9mNc5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LjZ5r9mNc5</a></p>— iScream (@iScreamFGC) <a href="https://twitter.com/iScreamFGC/status/1838238152768520563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Khaos Reigns hits Mortal Kombat 1 after four million sales since launching in September 2023. The expansion adds new story mode chapters available from September 24, along with Kombat Pack 2, which itself includes six new DLC characters: Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot (available on September 24), and guest fighters Ghostface (Scream franchise), T-1000 (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), and Conan the Barbarian (post-launch release timing to be announced at a later date).</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Nintendo has provided fresh details on why Zelda was chosen as the protagonist for the series' latest game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-3/">Ask The Developer blog</a>, series producer Eiji Aonuma discussed the game's development with Nintendo director Tomomi Sano (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-started-out-as-a-dungeon-creator-game">first female director of a Zelda game</a>) and Grezzo director Satoshi Terada.</p>
<p>Initially, Link was to be the protagonist in Echoes of Wisdom, Aonuma explained, but the developers realised that if he still had a sword and shield there would be no reason to use the copy and paste gameplay of the echoes, the game's new concept.</p>

<p>Added Terada: "Echoes plus a sword and shield... They just didn't work well together. There is a wide variety of echoes, so to get the most out of the gameplay, we decided to stick with echoes only."</p>
<p>Aonuma replied: "If that's the case, it must be someone who doesn't fight with a sword and shield, right? Who in the series would be a good fit for these powers and bring their insight to them? Well, that would have to be Princess Zelda."</p>
<p>Aonuma then discussed the courage required to make Zelda the protagonist, given the series' long history.</p>
<p>"Over the years we've been working on the Legend of Zelda series, many people have often asked us, 'Will Princess Zelda ever be the protagonist?' and said, 'I'd like to play as Princess Zelda'," said Aonuma.</p>
<p>"When asked this question, I've always thought, 'Of course, as long as it makes sense for the game and does justice to her as a character to be the protagonist,' and answered that way. I had been trying in vain to figure out what would really do justice to her. But when I saw the team struggling to identify the ideal protagonist for this game, I thought, this is exactly the game for her!"</p>
<p>However, the development team then struggled to come up with a suitable story to send Zelda on an adventure. She's a princess after all!</p>
<p>"Just having monsters roaming around Hyrule wouldn't be enough to motivate Princess Zelda to directly fight them," said Aonuma. "We tried brainstorming all sorts of ideas for what kind of situation would necessitate that the princess take matters into her own hands."</p>
<p>In fact, the game's story was only completed last summer during a nine day boot camp.</p>
<p>Lastly, Aonuma discussed the difficulty of developing a new story in the Zelda series while honouring its history and timeline.</p>
<p>"These days, even for us, it's not easy to touch on the lore of the Legend of Zelda series," he said. "When you address the history of the Legend of Zelda, you naturally have to be conscious of how things have been expressed previously in the series.</p>
<p>"But when we think about a new game, we need to think about new developments while being mindful of the past games in the series, so the scope of what you can do becomes increasingly narrow if you think in the same way every time. On top of that, because the series has been running for a long time, players are interested in its history and lore.</p>
<p>"So, when we've adopted a game plot that was not in line with the other games in the series because we prioritised the gameplay, we've been told by our fans that it didn't make sense. We realised that even if the developers didn't intend to make nonsensical changes, players could interpret otherwise."</p>
<p>He continued: "Even with this title, we had no intention of establishing any new theories in the series' lore. Link goes on an adventure every time and experiences many things. But Princess Zelda has always had to take a step back in the Legend of Zelda series. But this time, Princess Zelda is on her own adventure, so the story takes on a different perspective than before. I think that's why we were able to create something new in terms of the story as well."</p>
<p>It's perhaps this reasoning that led to Nintendo placing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-places-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-outside-series-established-timeline">Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom outside of the Zelda series' established timeline</a>.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will release later this week on Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>In July remasters of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 and 2 were leaked by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/27/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-leaked-by-merch/">a statue at Comicon of all things</a> and the games have now popped up in back end of the PlayStation Store, presumably ahead of a reveal in tonight’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/state-of-play-is-taking-place-tomorrow-september-24th-confirms-sony/">State of Play.&nbsp;</a>You can ever watch the trailer, which is nice.</p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-453250-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4">https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>Here’s the blurb from the website</p>


<div>
<p>Celebrate Soul Reaver’s 25th Anniversary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience the epic conflict of Kain and Raziel in original form or with remastered graphics. Included Game Titles: Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2</li>
<li>Experience the Legendary Narrative: Centuries after your former master, Kain, betrays and executes you, you rise again and embark on a relentless quest for revenge.</li>
<li>Wield the Powers of a Wraith: Slay your former vampire brethren with your claws, bolts of telekinetic energy, and the elemental Wraith Blade. Grow stronger by devouring the souls of your enemies.</li>
<li>Shift Between Realms: The Elder God has granted you the ability to shift between the Spectral and Material Realms. Traverse the realms to solve puzzles.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see the remastered graphics are, well, nicer than the original, but it doesn’t look the polygon count has been increased that much and the lighting, effects and animation still look very similar to original game.</p>


</div>

<p>The two games are sequels to The Legacy of Kain, both featuring the vampire wraith Raziel in a quest to kill Kain, the star of the first game.&nbsp; Both titles picked up excellent reviews when they were released between 1991 and 2001, not surprising when they were directed by Uncharted’s Amy Hennig.</p>
<p>Two of the games in the series were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-return-but-probably-not-in-the-way-you-wanted/">recently announced for the Evercade console.&nbsp;</a> Soul Reaver and Blood Omen are direct ports of the original titles without any new features and were released this month for the princely sum of £24.99.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-via-psn-listing.990042/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A now-deleted PlayStation Store listing has apparently confirmed the existence of remastered versions of the first two&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>games.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1838560114745172409" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to a PSN listing quoted by Wario64 on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the remastered package, which is being developed by Aspyr, will contain&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>and its direct sequel&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver 2</em>. The bundle will launch on December 10th as part of&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>'s 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>The PSN listing says that you'll be able to play both games either with their original graphics intact or with "remastered graphics", presumably akin to those found in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered">this year's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>remasters</a>, which were also handled by Aspyr.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-cliff.jpg?itok=FTkys8QX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-cliff.jpg?itok=zZV4WNp3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like those&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters are pretty much a certainty now.</figcaption></figure><p>From the sound of the leaked trailer, it seems as though the remasters will keep the superb voice work of Michael Bell, Simon Templeman, and Tony Jay (voicing Raziel, Kain, and the Elder God respectively) intact.</p>
<p>The PSN listing doesn't make any reference to Aspyr putting any content that was cut from the original games back in, but the trailer seems to show some things that weren't in the original games, so we'll have to wait and see if the developer's plans extend that far.</p>
<p>The existence of these&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters was first leaked as part of merchandise that was available at this year's Comic-Con; cards bearing text referring to the remasters were spotted at the show.</p>
<p>Additionally, a&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>prequel graphic novel that tells the story of the events leading up to the original&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-prequel-graphic-novel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was recently Kickstarted</a>, so these remasters are part of what appears to be a wider revival for the property.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-altar.jpg?itok=-hPufzmO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-altar.jpg?itok=IU6KDJof 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Soul Reaver 2&nbsp;</em>is getting a remaster as well.</figcaption></figure><p>It's likely that the&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters will be announced during <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1838254671456018525" rel="noopener" target="_blank">today's PlayStation State of Play showcase</a>, which is due to air at 6pm Eastern (that's 3pm Pacific).

SteelSeries is upgrading its Hall effect switches, adding dampening foam, improving its switch stabilizers, and even factory lubricating each key in an effort to create a thockier sounding board.</p><p>SteelSeries is moving to new OmniPoint 3.0 switches on the Apex Pro Gen 3 lineup, which includes a full-size board and TKL (tenkeyless) wired and TKL wireless variants. SteelSeries says it’s the “most technically advanced switch on the market,” and it has improved sensors that are designed to reduce noise.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Apex Pro Gen 3 lineup also includes a full-size option.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>Hall effect gaming keyboards are increasingly becoming popular because they allow gamers to adjust actuation points from 4mm down to just 0.1mm. Traditional Cherry MX-style switches use a copper mechanism to register a press with a board at a set actuation point of around 2mm, but Hall effect switches use a magnet instead to speed up keypresses.</p><p>These magnetic switches also enable features like Rapid Trigger, the ability to press the same key without waiting for it to return. SteelSeries is offering both Rapid Trigger and Rapid Tap, its own take on Razer’s controversial Snap Tap mode. It allows you to perfectly counter-strafe in games like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224261/valve-counter-strike-2-razer-snap-tap-wooting-socd-ban-kick">Valve recently banned</a> similar features from Razer and Wooting.</p><div><figcaption><em>SteelSeries is using dampening foam to improve the sound and feel.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>SteelSeries has also improved its stabilizers to eliminate keycap wobble, so both the switches and stabilizers should reduce the overall rattling sound you can often find on Hall effect boards.&nbsp;SteelSeries has also added three layers of sound dampening foam to improve the sound and feel, alongside per key lubrication. SteelSeries is using Poron and silicone rubber here, but we’ll have to try out the boards to see how much of a difference it all makes.</p><p>It wouldn’t be a SteelSeries keyboard without some interesting software features. The new OmniPoint 3.0 switches also allow for 2-in-1 action keypresses, allowing you to combine two actions into a single keystroke. You could walk and then run, pull a grenade out and then throw it, or execute combos. It’s essentially a macro mode for your keyboard.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Apex Pro Gen 3 lineup also includes the OLED smart display.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>GG Quickset is also available on these boards, which lets you use presets for games much like SteelSeries does for the audio settings of its headsets. SteelSeries has also added a protection mode, so you can lock keys against accidental fat fingering. </p><p>The Apex Pro Gen 3 also continues the tradition of the OLED smart display at the top of the keyboard, which allows for the adjustment of settings and profile changes or just a handy way to see your CPU and GPU usage.</p><p>The $199.99 Apex Pro Gen 3, $189.99 Apex Pro TKL Gen 3, and $249.99 Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3&nbsp;are all available today from retailers worldwide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These apparitions and portents, Crystal Dynamics - what game are you playing now? It turns out the game they are playing is: a remaster of amazeballs vampire odyssey Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, together with its less amazing but sturdy sequel. Said remaster project was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remasters-on-horizon-if-a-comic-con-plaque-is-to-be-believed">rumoured earlier this year</a>, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website. 
</p>

<p>
All this comes care of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain%E2%84%A2-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-psn-december-10-2024.989865/">Resetera</a>. My initial reaction to the screens is a hot blend of enthusiasm - because the first Soul Reaver is one of the most treasured games of my childhood - and revulsion - because they've properly given this one the Vaseline treatment, and turned all those gloriously grotty PS1 textures and contours into slick Bluepointy figurines that look clean enough to eat off.</p>
<p>"Ghastly past, insufferable future - are they one and the same?" intones Ariel, wraithlike prisoner of the corrupted Pillars of Nosgoth, in an early scene. No, Ariel, they are not the same at all, because I can see my farkin' face reflected in nu-Raziel's grossly protruding ribcage, and what have they done to Dumah? He used to be a tragical hummock of biomechanical hinges and soupy pixellation, the lowest-born of Kain's children fallen even deeper into ruin. Now, he just looks like a midboss from Doom Eternal.

"What have you done with my clan, degenerate?" I cry out unto apparent co-developers Aspyr through the amber prisms of the internet. "You have no right!"</p>
<p>"Oh quit whining, you old goat," you interject. "I didn't play Soul Reaver back in the day and I don't understand any of the references you're dropping and I don't want to play this while feeling as though I'm eyeballing a plate of rotten porridge."</p>
<p>"Look what they've done to the plane-shifting effects," I beseech, ripping at my clothes in a frenzy. "They used to be miracles on PS1, twisting the geometry in such a way as to suggest two worlds without actually building them. Now it just looks like effing screen-tearing."</p>
<p>"What would you know about the ins and outs of remastering classic games?" you sneer. "Only when you have felt the full gravity of choice should you dare to question their judgment."</p>
<p>"That's a line from Soul Reaver!" I squeal, pointing a shaking finger. "This whole exchange is a rhetorical farce!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, it just came to me on the spur of the moment," you sniff. "And anyway, I'm not going to sit here and bandy words with some so-called 'journalist' who never even played the original Blood Omen games. I'm going to read this here set of leaked bulletpoints instead."
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Experience the Legendary Narrative
</p>
<p>
Centuries after your former master, Kain, betrays and executes you, you rise again and embark on a relentless quest for revenge.
</p>
<p>
Wield the Powers of a Wraith. 
</p>
<p>
Slay your former vampire brethren with your claws, bolts of telekinetic energy, and the elemental Wraith Blade. Grow stronger by devouring the souls of your enemies.
</p>
<p>
Shift Between Realms.
</p>
<p>
 The Elder God has granted you the ability to shift between the Spectral and Material Realms. Traverse the realms to solve puzzles, reveal new paths, and defeat your foes.</p> </blockquote>
<p>One thing they haven't (it seems) meddled with is the voice-acting, and I am sagging with relief, because come on, show me a modern-day game that can chew scenery like Soul Reaver can. I can only think of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battleblock-theater">Battleblock Theater</a> and that came out over a decade later.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Elder Gods at Sony will hopefully be along with a proper announcement at some point soon. In the meantime, here's <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4">a link to the trailer</a> which may have been taken down by the time you read this. I think that, on the whole, the balance of enthusiasm and revulsion in my head tips in the direction of the former, because look, here I am writing about Soul Reaver again in the year 2024, and besides, it <em>might</em> lead to the creation of new Legacy Of Kain games. Perhaps they could plunder the crypt of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-dead-sun">Dead Sun</a>.

<p>Ubisoft has cancelled its scheduled appearance at Tokyo Game Show, just two days before the event is set to get underway.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1838504341289783532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement released</a> by Ubisoft Japan, the company says the decision was made due to “various circumstances”.</p>



<p>“We regret to inform you that due to various circumstances, we have decided to cancel our online participation in Tokyo Game Show 2024 which was scheduled to start at 3:00 PM on September 26th,” the statement reads.  </p>



<p>“We apologize for the short notice. We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to the broadcast.”</p>



<p>The company did say that the “currently ongoing giveaway campaign” will continue despite the broadcast no longer happening. </p>



<p>Ubisoft’s pulling out of the event comes during a time of turmoil for the company. While the highly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows releases in November, the company has been feeling pressure from other areas. </p>



<p>First, there is the concern about the state of XDefiant where, despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-not-dying-ubisoft-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims to the contrary</a>, is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in real trouble due to</a> falling player numbers. Then there is the continuous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-price-falling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling of stock prices</a> as well as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push from at least one investor</a> to make executive changes and take the company private.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has made multiple attempts to contact Ubisoft for more clarification on the “various circumstances” claim. As of publishing, however, a response was not received.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE 10am ET</strong>: Ubisoft has told Insider Gaming that they have “No Comment” on the cancellation.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft cancelling its appearance at Tokyo Game Show 2024? Join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/376/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

One of the new features in the game will be a base-building mode, allowing players to construct their very own headquarters and customize it to their needs.</p><p>In a video that was uploaded by <a href="https://www.ign.com.cn/assassins-creed-codename-red/51099/video/ci-ke-xin-tiao-ying-kai-fa-zhe-ri-zhi-di-er-ji" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN China</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-sim-like-base-building-where-you-manually-place-houses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) and has since been removed, Ubisoft described how players will have an acre of land to establish their base on. The mode doesn't look too complex, as you can easily place buildings and paths on it, rotating and customizing them for when the game's protagonists Yasuke and Naoe need a moment of respite.</p>

                <p>2025 is going to be a big year for Minecraft fans. Not only does the Minecraft movie finally premiere on April 4, 2025, but Dark Horse Comics just announced a new Minecraft graphic novel, Minecraft: Out of Order, which will also launch in early 2025. Minecraft: Out of Order is an original story written and illustrated by cartoonish Josh Hicks, whose previous works include other graphic novels like Glorious Wrestling Alliance and Hotelitor: Luxury-Class Defense, as well as the animated short Spectre of the Bear. While it's not directly tied to the Minecraft movie, the first volume of Minecraft: Out of Order launches a few weeks ahead of the film on March 18, 2025, and fans can preorder the graphic novel now.</p><div title="6526642 - Minecraft: Out of Order vol. 1 graphic novel preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2684" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526642 - Minecraft: Out of Order vol. 1 graphic novel preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Preorder Minecraft: Out of Order Volume 1</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$11</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Minecraft: Out of Order follows Riley, a farmer who lives a quiet life in the countryside until their town is demolished and turned into building materials by the Province of Perfect Sameness--an evil kingdom led by identical twins Paula and Prentice who seek to impose "perfect sameness" on the whole world.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-laden-holy-horror-mansion-announced-by-professor-layton-developer-level-5-coming-to-secret-platforms<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Level-5 has revealed its "heartwarming" Ghost Craft RPG called Holy Horror Mansion, which the company describes as the "next concept for Yo-kai Watch".</p>
<p>The release platforms for the game have been described as "secret". Considering Level-5's support for Nintendo consoles, it seems likely the game will eventually make its way onto Nintendo's next, yet-to-be revealed console, tentatively dubbed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Holy Horror Mansion was announced during Level-5's Vision broadcast, which it hosted earlier today. Along with updates on the likes of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time (which now has an April 2025 release window), Level-5 also gave us a first look at what it calls its largest cross-media project to date.</p>

<p>Holy Horror Mansion looks to be a bombastic evolution on Yo-kai Watch. It features a young boy named Ten Lordland who lives in a large apartment building which happens to be a gate to the underworld. He finds a mysterious camera within the building, which does something strange to one of his nose hairs. Cue plenty of spectral beings and ghostly shenanigans (see above).</p>
<p>During the presentation, Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino said the theme for Holy Horror Mansion is "family", and the team hopes the whole family can and will enjoy it. He also said a showcase for the project will take place in the spring of next year, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>And, that is about all the information we have on the upcoming ghost game for now. Its release date is simply said to be "not sure" but maybe "soon", while its price will be "fair".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has said it will make an announcement about the successor to the Switch "within this fiscal year"</a>. We'll at least learn more official news of Switch 2 before 31st March, then.</p>
<p>Unofficially, a major leak earlier this month of what seemed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-designs-posted-by-3d-model-enthusiast-setting-internets-tongues-wagging">prototype components for the upcoming console</a> gave us an idea of the form the machine may actually take.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-review-codes-wont-be-available-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-shattered-space-review-codes-won%E2%80%99t-be-available-before-launch.989982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-review-codes-wont-be-available-before-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Don't expect to find reviews for Starfield: Shattered Space when the sci-fi action RPG's first expansion launches on September 30. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danstapleton.bsky.social/post/3l4tkqhestp2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to IGN's Dan Stapleton</a>, review codes won't be released to any member of the press or any content creator ahead of that date.</p>
<p>Usually, this would cause some concern about the expansion's quality, but Bethesda is not new to such practices. For example, 2016's DOOM reboot also <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-review-codes-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not offer review codes before launch</a>, which was an excellent game. It earned an 8.6 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Wccftech from Dave Aubrey</a> and sold millions of copies, securing the development of DOOM Eternal (also a great title, by the way).</p>
<p><em>So, is DOOM worthwhile? Well, if you’re the kind of gamer who wants a brilliant 10-14 hour campaign where you’ll shoot and listen to metal breakdowns, then yes, 100%. DOOM in 2016 is possibly the best single player experience you can have with an FPS on modern consoles and for that alone, it is deserving of praise. Oh, and also you don’t aim down sights. That’s probably the best part of it all, actually.</em></p>
<p>Whether Starfield: Shattered Space will be as successful remains to be seen, but fans can stay hopeful for now. So far, Bethesda has <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-gets-official-deep-dive-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> all the right things, claiming that it will be a return to the studio's traditional form of exploration focused on a single environment rather than countless planets.</p>
<p><em>We love Starfield's massive open galaxy, but from early on in our planning, we knew we wanted to introduce some more secluded and handcrafted locations, similar to what you've seen from our past expansions. There's so much mystery to House Va'ruun, and because they've so thoroughly isolated themselves, it made them the perfect faction to explore in a completely self-contained experience.</em></p>
<p><em>From the minute you arrive on Va'ruun'kai, the story never sends you off-planet. You're free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va'ruun homeworld. Everything you discover, every location you visit, every side mission you seek out, it all tells the story of what happened here and how the Va'ruun people have survived being cut off from the comforts of the Settled Systems and the rest of humanity.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-decapolice-delay-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/level-5s-woes-continue-with-huge-decapolice-delay-to-2026.989979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-decapolice-delay-2026<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Level-5 has announced a massive delay to its investigative JRPG&nbsp;<em>Decapolice</em>, with the game now not scheduled to arrive for a good couple of years.</p>
<p>Per a new trailer shown during today's Level-5 Vision 2024 showcase,&nbsp;<em>Decapolice&nbsp;</em>is now scheduled to arrive sometime in 2026, which represents a huge push back for the game given that it was originally planned for launch sometime this year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this also isn't the first delay&nbsp;<em>Decapolice&nbsp;</em>has suffered. Originally, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-reveals-new-decapolice-trailers-showing-features-gameplay">scheduled for launch in 2023</a>&nbsp;before being delayed to 2024, so it's unfortunate that Level-5 has had to delay the game once again, although this hopefully means we'll get a better game when it's released.</p>

Last month, the company announced that its upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely">had been delayed indefinitely</a> (although there's some good news on that front today).</p>
<p>That delay itself comes after Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-vision-ii-showcase">announced in November last year</a> that projects originally planned for release in 2023 had to be pushed back to 2024, and it's likely that some of those games now won't see the light of day until next year or 2026 as well.</p>
<p>There is a small ray of light if you're waiting for <i>Decapolice&nbsp;</i>to arrive, though; Level-5 confirmed today that the game will be getting a PC release in addition to hitting PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<h2>Other announcements during today's Level-5 showcase</h2>
<p>It's not just&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Decapolice&nbsp;</em>delay that was announced during today's Level-5 showcase, though, and some of the other reveals during the show could give some more hope to Level-5 fans.</p>
<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, for instance, is now slated for an April 2025 release. Of course, there's every chance that Level-5 will delay the game again before it sees the light of day, but let's hope that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Additionally, the company announced a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven</em>, titled&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven RE</em>. It's currently in development for PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch, although it's probably still pretty early on in development right now.</p>
<p>The remake should make a nice companion for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-beta-release-date">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em></a>, which will serve as the next mainline title in the long-running soccer RPG series.</p>

<p>We'll bring you more on all things Level-5 as soon as we get it. Stay tuned.</p>

With three boss fights against the Benevodons down and only five to go, you can choose to take on the next four elemental demons in any order you like. It’s a vaguely <em>Mega Man</em> style structure, since each boss will unlock valuable upgrades for your party that will help subsequent bosses go down easier.

These bosses and their respective dungeons will scale in level with you, so you won’t get in over your head by picking the “wrong” Benevodon first. That said, you will be locked in to whichever Benevodon you choose until you defeat it, so you can’t change your mind and chase down another Benevodon if one dungeon is giving you trouble. While Chapter Seven is one of the longer chapters in the game, each of these dungeons isn’t terribly time consuming on its own. You’ll be back to riding on Flammie and picking your next opponent to fight before you know it.</p><p><strong>That said, if you’re looking to optimize your progression, you <em>should</em> pick certain Benevodons to defeat over others.</strong> Read on for all the details explaining why that is.</p><h2 id="h96266"><a id=""></a><strong>Each Benevodon will unlock the next tier of each characters’ Elemental Plots</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="bab52c2734ffda5b930fab2ff73b11e0" data-recommend-id="image://bab52c2734ffda5b930fab2ff73b11e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Our character looks into a chest full of gold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our character looks into a chest full of gold." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bab52c2734ffda5b930fab2ff73b11e0" data-recommend-id="image://bab52c2734ffda5b930fab2ff73b11e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Our character looks into a chest full of gold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Looking at the four elemental Benevodons you can pick, you may have noticed that your choices all correspond to the places where you first encountered each of your party members. This is no coincidence. Once you pick a Benevodon, you’ll also see the resolution of that corresponding character’s personal story arc. Additionally, upon defeating the Benevodon, you’ll receive a valuable Tonic that unlocks that character’s third tier of their Elemental Plot. You’ll also find a Chalice to increase how many Ability Seeds that character can equip.</p><p>To say the obvious, this means you’ll want to prioritize whichever character you use the most. Here’s where you’ll want to go to upgrade each character:</p><p><strong>Careena</strong> - Longren, the Vale of Wind</p><p><strong>Morley</strong> - Etaern, the Moonlit Parish</p><p><strong>Palamena</strong> - Illystana, Capital of the Deep</p><p><strong>Julei</strong> - Sanctuary of Mana</p><p>Don’t worry, Val doesn’t get left out of this equation. His story comes after all the above story arcs have been resolved. He’ll also receive his Tonic before you clear Chapter Seven.</p><h2 id="h96267"><a id=""></a><strong>There are a few other factors that might influence your first Benevodon, too.</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="36d932f81974ecfb220e580208807ad3" data-recommend-id="image://36d932f81974ecfb220e580208807ad3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Biffing some crab baddies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Biffing some crab baddies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36d932f81974ecfb220e580208807ad3" data-recommend-id="image://36d932f81974ecfb220e580208807ad3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Biffing some crab baddies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You presumably use at least two of the four characters listed above, but are there any other factors to help narrow down your choice? Yes, in fact! Here are a few observations I recorded throughout Chapter Seven.</p><p><strong>1:</strong> After completing the story arc in Etaern, you’ll unlock a new suite of shop vendors. Here you can purchase some new weapons and armor, all of which will help you throughout the rest of Chapter Seven. Morley is arguably the strongest character in the game thanks to the sheer power of his Nightblade class, so I’d rank this as the best starting point overall.</p><p><strong>2:</strong> In the Sanctuary of Mana, you’ll find chalices for both Julei <em>and</em> Val, granting both characters extra Ability Seed slots. If you’re using both Julei and Val, make this your first or second stop. If you don’t use Julei but still use Val, you should probably make this the third stop on your list.</p><p><strong>3:</strong> When visiting Illystana, one battle arena in this section’s corresponding dungeon did <em>not</em> level scale up for me when I encountered it. This frankly could be a glitch, but if not, this location may be <em>slightly</em> easier if you save it for later. I hardly think this should matter in your decision making process, but I’m not here to withhold information from you!</p><p>Again, there’s no real <em>wrong</em> order to complete Chapter Seven in—you’ll hit all these locations before the end of it. It’s all about finding the <em>right</em> order that works best for you, and the party you’re using.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Behaviour Interactive, the studio behind Dead by Daylight, <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1838533897698603388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced</a> that it has purchased Darkest Dungeon developer Red Hook Studios. </p>



<p>The acquisition was for an undisclosed amount.</p>



<p>“”It’s a privilege to welcome a developer of Red Hook’s calibre,” Behaviour CEO and co-founder Rémi Racine said in a statement. “Earlier this year, we established an ambitious goal for our future as a publisher – to make Behaviour synonymous with horror, and surround Dead by Daylight with a library of similarly exceptional horror games. </p>



<p>“Our acquisition of Red Hook is another emphatic step towards this objective, with more to come.”</p>



<p>As part of the deal, all 29 members of Red Hook Studios will be kept with the company. The plan, as of now, is also for Red Hook to work independently under Behaviour Interactive.</p>



<p>Said Red Hook Studios co-founder Tyler Sigman, “Joining forces with Behaviour is exciting on multiple levels. They have demonstrated a commitment to allowing our team to continue developing Darkest Dungeon in the manner we know best, but with the benefit of their considerable knowledge and resources. We are stronger together than apart.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The news of the acquisition comes just a week after Behaviour Interactive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-cancelled-due-to-poor-reception/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Dead by Daylight spinoff Project T</a> and s<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/behaviour-shuts-down-midwinter-entertainment-after-project-t-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hut down Midwinter Entertainment</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resigns-from-the-company-report/1100-6526463/">Annapurna Interactive lost the entirety of its staff</a> after all 25 members collectively resigned and walked out. The news came as a shock to some, as Annapurna has published a number of highly praised games (including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stray/">Stray</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/outer-wilds/">Outer Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-artful-escape/">The Artful Escape</a>) and is currently in the process of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blade-runner-2033-labyrinth-coming-from-annapurna/1100-6515572/">developing a Blade Runner game</a>. So what happened?</p><p dir="ltr">A recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation" rel="nofollow ">report from IGN</a> sheds some light on the issue. According to the report, changes in leadership played a major role, but the tale leading up to the mass walkout is a complicated one that requires a quick history lesson on the company's past to truly understand.</p><p dir="ltr">Annapurna Interactive was founded by Annapurna Pictures owner (and daughter of billionaire Larry Ellison) Megan Ellison in 2016. At the time, Annapurna Pictures was struggling financially, and Ellison handpicked ​Nathan Gary, Deborah Mars, and Hector Sanchez--who had all previously worked for Sony--to help guide the new gaming studio's path forward. Sanchez left the team in 2019, and Capybara Games co-founder Nathan Vella joined the team shortly thereafter. 2019 also saw <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/megan-ellison-annapurna-scott-rudin-temper-1234951651/" rel="nofollow ">Ellison effectively disappear</a>, effectively leaving Annapurna Interactive to its own devices, but the billionare movie mogul returned to a more hands-on role in 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">The same year, Nathan Gary was given the title of president of Annapurna Pictures, though the anonymous sources in IGN's report claim Gary's attention remained, for the most part, focused on Annapurna Interactive. In early 2024, Gary was either fired (according to IGN's anonymous sources) or resigned due to issues he had with other changes to Annapurna's staff and a recent demotion (according to an Annapurna spokesperson). Other staff members quit in protest, but Ellison later held a video call in which she allegedly expressed a desire to keep the whole team together, including those who had resigned--and apparently, it worked. Gary and other who had left returned.</p><p dir="ltr">Gary and Ellison later began discussing ideas regarding creating a spin-off studio that would still be connected to Annapurna Pictures. This studio was to be called Verset, and would effectively consist of Gary and the Annapurna Interactive staff members. Verset would be responsible for all currently in-progress Annapurna Interactive projects, and ownership of Verset would be split between leaders of both Verset and Annapurna Interactive.</p><p dir="ltr">According to IGN, some Annapurna Interactive employees were concerned by both the idea of Verset (which would effectively create a competitor for Annapurna Interactive) and some of Ellison's other moves, like the decision to rehire Hector Sanchez as Annapurna Pictures' "president of interactive and new media," fearing it could create even more competition within the Annapurna Interactive team.</p><p dir="ltr">Other concerns cited by IGN's sources include a deal Annapurna Pictures struck with Remedy for publishing rights on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-officially-in-development-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6509106/">Control 2</a>. Sanchez negotiated the deal himself, and Annapurna Interactive employees reportedly only heard about the Remedy deal the day it was announced to the public.</p><p dir="ltr">Fed up with the lack of transparency and Ellison's overall decision-making, Annapurna Interactive employees told IGN they gave Ellison two weeks of notice prior to the mass-walkout on September 6. Ellison reportedly showed no interest in negotiating with the Interactive team, and she evidently failed to warn Annapurna's other development partners of the impending walkout and the effect it could have on production.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Annapurna Pictures staff are reportedly filling in the gaps at Interactive to ensure the publisher's outstanding commitments are fulfilled and deadlines are met, but one game is still hanging precariously in the balance--Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, which is being developed internally as opposed to via a partnered studio.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Annapurna Interactive's take on the events, a spokesperson for the company called the situation "a baffler" and said that the company is now "focused on moving forward."</p><p dir="ltr">"We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership," the spokesperson told IGN. "If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. P.S. We're hiring."</p>

The widely-expected Legacy of Kain: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> 1 &amp; 2 remaster has popped up in a now-deleted PlayStation Store listing, ahead of Sony's State of Play broadcast tonight. 
</p>
<p>
That listing included a trailer for the game, which has now been reuploaded to social media, below. There's a release date, too: 10th December 2024.

"Experience the legendary narrative," PlayStation's store listing for the Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 remaster stated. "Centuries after your former master, Kain, betrays and executes you, you rise again and embark on a relentless quest for revenge. </p>
<p>"Wield the powers of a Wraith. Slay your former vampire brethren with your claws, bolts of telekinetic energy, and the elemental Wraith Blade. Grow stronger by devouring the souls of your enemies. Shift between Realms. The Elder God has granted you the ability to shift between the Spectral and Material Realms. Traverse the realms to solve puzzles, reveal new paths, and defeat your foes.
</p>
<p>Back in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remaster-hints-surface-at-comic-con">branding for the Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 remaster was spotted at San Diego Comic-Con</a>,  included on display plaques accompanying statues of game characters Kain and Raziel. </p>
<p>There's been other activity for the Legacy of Kain brand, too. A Soul Reaver graphic novel prequel, The Dead Shall Rise, was published last month by Dark Horse Comics. This month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-legacy-of-kain-games-will-be-re-released-for-evercade-next-month">a Legacy of Kain Collection including both Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> arrives on retro handheld console Evercade. </p>
<p>Crystal Dynamics has hinted at plans for a Legacy of Kain revival since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-hears-legacy-of-kain-fans-loudly-and-clearly-following-huge-survey-response">2022 survey asked fans about their interest in the franchise making a comeback</a>. Over 100,000 people responded positively, to which Crystal Dynamics boss Phil Rogers replied: "Rest assured, we hear you loudly and clearly."</p>
<p>Tonight's PlayStation State of Play broadcast goes live at 11pm UK time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>What would you do if you were transported to another galaxy moments before Earth is unexpectedly destroyed? That is the scenario Doug and his pet guinea pig, Boom Boom, face in the Beyond Galaxyland. This part turn based RPG, part creature collector, is filled with various quests to undertake, from taking photos for people to trying to tear through space and time itself to save Earth. You know, your standard RPG stakes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beyond Galaxyland | Gameplay Overview Trailer | Pre-Order on PC, Playstation, Xbox &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3_H7SZFDBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Galaxyland is a pocket of space where sentient beings from all over the universe have been transported over hundreds of years when they walk through portals on their home planets. Some have, like Doug, arrived as their planet faces annihilation, while others stumbled across the portals when no threat was present. Most of the aliens live together on the core world of Neo, though Erros is primarily the home of humans, and a few other planets around have their own people too, and little hubs to visit.</p>


<p>Each of these planets provides Doug with places to rest, allies, shops to pick up consumables like health tonics, and artifacts to help improve attributes for battles. Beyond Galaxyland also features crafting allowing you to put together the tonics along with making artifacts, as long as you have the correct blueprint and ingredients. It is a simple process to craft, but you can only do so at save points. In fact, you can only save at save points too and there is no autosave. Helpfully, there are plenty of these dotted across the galaxy.</p>


<p>The core of Beyond Galaxyland is battling, and there is quite a bit to it. You can sneak up on an enemy and get in a preemptive strike, before your party of three characters – Doug and two companions of your choice – settle in for the fight.&nbsp;Each character has their own unique abilities. For example, Doug can scan enemies to learn more about them, such as their health and type, while Boom Boom can restore some HP for the whole party.</p>
<p>Abilities use ability points that are in a group pool, so you do have to think about which one will benefit in the moment. You can regain ability points using basic attacks, but some enemies have their own moves that can take away ability points. In addition to ability points, each character has their own summon points, which is where the creature capturing comes in.</p>
<p>Doug can capture enemies, including some of the bosses, and once captured they can be assigned to characters. Each character can equip up to four summons, and each of those summons can level up. Summons also have types, which have strengths and weaknesses against enemy types. For example, it is not a great idea to use an electric type against an electric enemy as you are more likely to heal it than hurt it.</p>

<p>As you battle, your main characters will level up too, opening more areas for them to adventure in without getting killed in one hit. You will move back and forth between the planets of Galaxyland a fair bit as more quests become available, and the quest log will show you the minimum level you should be to try and attempt a quest. The quests themselves follow a generally similar pattern in that your party needs to go somewhere to retrieve an item or speak to someone, with the questline finishing with a boss battle. The boss designs are very good too, as are the various enemies, and the different attacks can make fights interesting.</p>
<p>Outside of the battles and creature collecting, Beyond Galaxyland falls down a bit in various ways. First, there are numerous bugs. For example, on the planet of Arcos using the lift to get from the first floor to the top floor would see Doug fall through the surface. The only workaround I found was by going down to the lower floor and then using the lift to go to the top floor. There were also a few occasions where Doug and co would fall from a platform and end up in the background, making it impossible to interact with the foreground.</p>
<p>The platforming itself is not fun either, and the game would flow much better without it. It feels like, on the course to include so many different elements, there has been a bit of quality loss in some areas. The game includes racing and that could be better as it does not have any real feedback to it and the navigation can be cumbersome when moving.</p>

<p>The story of Beyond Galaxyland is serviceable, but feels familiar despite its setting. It is the classic fish out of water tale, facing off against insurmountable odds. The characters are decently written, though there isn’t a lot of depth to them. Boom Boom could become a fan favourite due to his backstory, while Pablo kind of appears and you learn very little about him through the story.</p>
<p>The visual design is a real strength, though, even if some effects are a bit heavy handed – I turned some off so that just walking around didn’t look so blurry. The world designs are each distinctive and the various peoples you meet and creatures you face all look great too. The soundtrack is very good too, and some of the tunes are a properly good vibe, especially some of the boss tracks.</p>
<p>Beyond Galaxyland is a game you could get through in a few days. Completing the story and the majority of side quests took me approximately 15 hours.</p>
