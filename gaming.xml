			<p>Today, publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Cyanide Studio</strong> announced that there is a limited-time free <strong>Styx: Blades of Greed demo</strong> available for download on PC via <strong>Steam</strong>. The demo is approximately <strong>17GB</strong> in size and includes <strong>the full first hour</strong> of the game from its beginning. </p>



<p>Players will <strong>infiltrate a massive golem</strong> attacking Styx to destroy it from the inside and also experience Styx's first real mission, <strong>a high-risk zeppelin theft</strong> under the ever-watchful eye of the Inquisition in the first open environment of the game, The Wall. According to the developers, it's a 'focused taste' of the tone, systems, and level of freedom that will be in the full game. There's an extra bit of good news: the demo's save data will carry over to the full game, so you won't have to replay the first hour if you don't want to.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nacon has also <strong>kicked off pre-orders on all platforms</strong> (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X). The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> with Pre-order Bonus includes the base game and the Master of Shadows Skin from the first installment and is available for purchase at a price of <strong>€49.99</strong>, <strong>$49.99</strong>, and <strong>£44.99</strong> <strong>on consoles</strong>, and <strong>€39.99</strong>, <strong>$39.99</strong>, and <strong>£34.99</strong> <strong>on PC</strong> via Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>The pricier <strong>Quartz Edition</strong>, on the other hand, includes the base game, two days of early access, the Greedy and Legacy skin packs for Styx and his weapons, a Starter Pack with two talent points and some crafting resources, and 5 additional taunts to lure enemies. The Master of Shadows Skin pre-order bonus is also included. If you want the Quartz Edition for Styx: Blades of Greed, it'll set you back <strong>€59.99</strong>, <strong>$59.99</strong>, and <strong>£54.99</strong> on consoles and <strong>€49.99</strong>, <strong>$49.99</strong>, and <strong>£44.99</strong> on PC via Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>Finally, there's a new <strong>Styx: Master of Stealth Collection bundle</strong> that brings together the whole stealth series: 2014's <strong>Styx: Master of Shadows</strong>, 2017's <strong>Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong>, and the new Styx: Blades of Greed in its Quartz Edition. This is available for <strong>€69.99</strong>, <strong>$69.99</strong>, and <strong>£64.99</strong> on consoles, and is also available on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/65163/Styx_Master_of_Stealth_Collection__Prepurchase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>, albeit at a higher price of <strong>€85.50</strong>.</p>



<p>Our own Francesco De Meo played the demo in advance as part of a press event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed cautious optimism</a>:</p>



<p><em>While I don't expect Styx: Blades of Greed to set the market on fire, as its hardcore stealth approach is still going to leave anyone who isn't a stealth game fanatic frustrated, the new entry in the series by Cyanide seems to evolve the series' formula considerably, providing a sandbox stealth experience that works incredibly well with its wealth of options.</em></p>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed launches on <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>.</p>

              <p><span>In a move that will surprise absolutely no one who has paid attention to </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>in the past five years, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><span>very expensive Lego sets</span></a><span> featuring </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904"><span>Pikachu, Eevee</span></a><span>, and the Kanto starters are selling out pretty fast. When Pokémon merchandise sells out, it inevitably ends up on reseller sites like </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=charizard+lego&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2332490.m570.l1313"><span>Ebay</span></a><span> for astronomical prices. What do you get when you scalp already expensive toy blocks? Prices that’ll cost you enough to buy multiple game consoles and video games.</span></p> <p><span>The set featuring Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur is supposed to run for $649.99, but now that pre-orders are selling out, resellers are listing the 6800+ pieces of Lego blocks for anywhere from </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Lego+pokemon+badges&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1313"><span>$800 to over a grand</span></a><span>. Some of the listings include the Kanto Badges set that is being offered to those who bought the starters, while there are others that have only one of the three monsters for sale, despite them not being sold separately by Lego itself. I guess despite the reseller markup, if you really only wanted one of them, this would be cheaper than buying all three at retail price. Live your truth.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though that’s the most expensive of the sets, it’s not the only one that scalpers got a hold of to flip and turn a profit. The </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/257306955329?_skw=pokemon+lego&amp;itmmeta=01KEW627JW5AGPJKXJZ60CN4GG&amp;hash=item3be8b08e41:g:lnkAAeSwn0VpZm0T&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQALAAAA8O7PUuNWmJ%2B%2BUShgI9tQz%2FpNjcghLv%2BTt%2FEVUa7n%2BFKBL3oQ%2BSztckicHbIHKISlddEAhuGmBnxMjo0MNMFFWsHQKGE3fQ6%2Bk94YIwi28ayFOVrzfonRqCks5ykLmQY8zsw60phy2xhRnY%2BCeqasoyUR3ZK%2B9hT3pqDCx%2B3Lly7uxDfgI93mX%2B4NkWiiVl6caiC8OqhC8sPU22%2FjDgWq3vrU2ZBGcrGj82jQVPb96lsqdRQ2bJdcIZcW%2BGd1nQ5VA8yrjS2KHllSMOwrbcr%2FAnsNGqlG4eG1MEBrXvydhlFpwXrepxxc5K%2BrcjjwNUMkqA%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9r5iIb3Zg"><span>Pikachu</span></a><span> model is also popping up, though it is much, much cheaper than the Kanto trio. Before you hop on that one, though, do keep in mind that pre-orders for the Pikachu and Eevee models haven’t sold out in the U.S. yet, so you can still get those (very expensive) blocky boys for their original price.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>Lego sets will be available in stores on February 27, which marks the series’ 30th anniversary. We’ll also be expecting some major announcements from the company’s annual “Pokémon Day” stream, which usually covers games, toys, and pretty much every other facet of the franchise. </span></p>

<p>Developer 34BigThings has released a new gameplay trailer for the upcoming Carmageddon: Rogue Shift.</p>



<p>Announced back in early <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/carmageddon-is-back-with-carmageddon-rogue-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 2025</a>, Carmageddon: Rogue Shit releases on February 6 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>







<p><strong>“Carmageddon smashes back with brutal roguelite vehicular‑combat mayhem,”</strong> the game’s description reads. <strong>“Adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on post‑apocalyptic zombie hordes. The legacy lives on, reinvented and unforgiving.”</strong></p>



<p>The game sees players go through a roguelite campaign with branching event maps, dynamic challenges and permanent progression between runs. There will be 15 upgradeable vehicles that range from tanks to hot rods with 13 weapon classes and over 80 perks to equip to your vehicle.</p>







<p>With it being a roguelite game, 34BigThings say that every run through the campaign will offer a “unique journey through a randomly generated graph.” There will also be branching patches, a variety of objections, and dynamic time of day and weather to make sure each run is different.</p>



<p>You can check out the gameplay trailer for yourself, below, and leave your thoughts down in the comments and over at the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>God of War composer Bear McCreary has said he would consider returning to the series, following his previous comments about how his work on the Sony series was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1jyxlmw/god_of_war_composer_says_his_work_on_the_series/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"complete."</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-composer-says-he-would-be-open-to-revisiting-the-franchise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> asked McCreary if he might be interested in returning, and he replied, "If there were an opportunity to expand upon it, I would be open to that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzcqvPneP0k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qzcqvPneP0k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-show-casting-now-underway-as-high-profile-director-comes-aboard/1100-6536621/" data-ref-id="1100-6536621">new God of War TV show in the works for Prime Video</a>, while the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-god-of-war-spin-off-pushed-back-to-2026m-according-to-insiders/1100-6532551/" data-ref-id="1100-6532551">God of War game series is expected to continue</a>, so there could indeed be an opportunity for McCreary to work more in the franchise, if he was asked back.</p><p>Whatever the case, the composer said he's proud of the music he's written for the God of War games, adding that the games are "so expansive" and enjoyed by fans.</p><p>Beyond the God of War series, McCreary said he is "always looking for interesting projects" and "interesting people" to collaborate with.

</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="cc9747870d3b1"><a title="Split Fiction" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc9747870d3b1/split-fiction.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p>AI is absolutely bloomin' everywhere these days; doubly so if you kept an eye on CES 2026 earlier this month. There's no getting away from it, and folks are particularly keen to see what game developers think of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Josef Fares, founder of Hazelight Studios and director of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, recently caught up with Chrisopher Dring at <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>. The subject of AI naturally cropped up, and while Fares is keen to highlight the technology's advantages in game development, he doesn't see it taking over completely anytime soon, and firmly believes that having someone with a "vision or idea" for a game is vital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have been working with AI for a long time in game development. The problem is the generative AI. If [an AI tool] is helpful to get your vision out there, I don’t see why we shouldn’t look into it. But… it’s the generative AI that people are a bit like…</p>
<p>“It’s really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn’t gone up much. Maybe this is the limit of it.</p>
<p>“You get someone generating a game concept and saying, ‘oh look what might happen in five years?’ But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, you still need someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is. I don’t see AI taking over. I don’t. But it’s really hard to answer. Who knows what happens in the future?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, we think it's worth pointing out that developers do, in fact, have a choice in the matter. Mentioning the idea of AI "taking over" makes it sounds like an inevitability, but we're not quite sure that's entirely accurate. Here's hoping Hazelight doesn't let itself get too dragged into the weeds, anyway.</p>
<p>A recent image for Nintendo's own 'My Mario' collection was scrutinised for potentially using AI, however the company had since come out and clarified that it did not use the technology in producing the images.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196052,195736 @ 1768325403 -->
<p><em>Are we doomed to accept that AI might inevitably become a key part of game development in the future? Or are you hopeful that devs take a stand and refuse to use it extensively? This topic isn't going away, so let us know your thoughts with a comment.</em></p></section>

            <guid>1404868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A report from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html">New York Times</a> on Monday revealed that <strong>Meta</strong> would be <strong>laying off 10% of its Reality Labs</strong> division, the branch of its business under which it works on products like the Metaverse, and also houses its internal VR teams under <strong>Oculus Studios</strong>, including <strong>Deadpool VR</strong> developer <strong>Twisted Pixel Games</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/asgards-wrath-ii-hands-on-impressions-vrs-breakout-untethered-rpg/">Asgard's Wrath 2</a></strong> developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/facebook-acquired-sanzaru-games-asgards-wrath-for-its-oculus-studios/">Sanzaru Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Today, as developers began sharing the news that they had been impacted by the cuts, we learned that at least two whole studios, the aforementioned Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games, <strong>would be shut down</strong>, with the entirety of their teams laid off.</p>



<p>The first signal came from <strong>Andy Gentile</strong>, a designer at Twisted Pixel, who shared on his <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">X (formerly Twitter) account</a> that not only had he been laid off, but the entire studio, along with Sanzaru Games, had been shut down.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unclear how many people have been impacted by the cuts, but more developers have come forward to confirm the news of the two studios shutting down, including a senior level designer at Sanzaru, Ray West, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared on his personal LinkedIn page</a>, "<em>Welp. As many will hear soon, several Meta game studios were closed today, including Sanzaru.</em> <em>It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I'm really glad to have gotten to know everyone there.</em>"</p>



<p>Twisted Pixel is known for titles like Deadpool VR, 'Splosion Man, and Path of the Warrior, while Sanzaru was highly regarded for its Asgard's Wrath titles, the second of which is commonly known as one of the best VR titles to release in recent years. </p>



<p>Sanzaru also has a place in the hearts of many longtime PlayStation fans, as it was also the team that ported the first three Sly Cooper games to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, and even developed the fourth entry in the franchise, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time. Sanzaru was also responsible for ports of the God of War Collection and Secret Agent Clank.</p>



<p>Both studios were founded in 2006, which means that Meta is shuttering them just as they were set to hit their 20th anniversaries. A milestone that not many studios get to hit anymore in today's unstable video game industry. It's altogether an unfortunate start to 2026, and a sign that the mass layoffs that have plagued the industry for the last few years aren't going away anytime soon.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-hytale-mods/</link>
            <guid>1404856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Modding is a huge part of gaming, and instead of concentrating on the default content, Hypixel Studios encourages the community to download and install the best Hytale mods to make the game even more wild.</p>



<p>Some games actively discourage modding and do their best to avoid having the base game assets be manipulated in any way. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> is the complete polar opposite. Hytale wants you to mod, it wants you to create mods; whatever funky ideas are flowing around in your brainwaves need to be used to create fun and original content.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to mess around with Hytale and implement the best mods to make the game easier, better, or even more entertaining, this guide has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-8-top-hytale-mods-to-install">8 Top Hytale Mods To Install</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios and CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hytale has partnered up with <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CurseForge</a> to deliver official mods. The game’s long-awaited launch was accompanied by well over 80 mods to download and install. Insider Gaming has picked out our favorite ones so far, and keep checking back as the list is updated with new mods to add. </p>



<h3 id="h-advanced-item-info">Advanced Item Info</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is comfortably one of the most (if not <em>the </em>most) downloaded Hytale mods—and for obvious reasons. It tells you much more information about the items and materials you pick up. There’s a certain level of ambiguity when it comes to survival games about the resources you collect, leaving it up to you to decide what they’re for, or discover their main purpose(s). This mod eliminates a lot of the mystery and gets straight to the point.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/advanced-item-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Advanced Item Info mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-ymmersive-foliage">Ymmersive Foliage</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hypixel Studios and founder Simon Collins-Laflamme have been hard on themselves at times in the build-up to launch. It’s in early access, and the team has said that it needs a lot of work. It’s probably true, but the game’s early access launch looked spectacular. However, if you want to spruce and juice up the environment with extra color, depth, and detail, the Ymmersive Foliage mode does that in Hytale.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/ymmersive-foliage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Ymmersive Foliage mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-lucky-mining">Lucky Mining</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>A good way to think about this mod is like hacking away at a material in Fortnite. You get rewarded for consecutive good hits, and it’s kind of the same here. If you keep mining the same material in a row—Ores, in this case—you get more of it. It can make the grind easier, and stock up your inventory with enough Ore to start a new country.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/lucky-mining" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Lucky Mining mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-yung-s-hydungeons">YUNG’s HyDungeons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>This mod might not be for beginners, but if you fancy a devious dungeon-based challenge and upgrade, consider checking out the YUNG’s HyDungeons mod. It adds new dungeons with “procedurally generated dungeon instances.” You do need to hit 100 Memories first, but there will come a point where you can enjoy this fabulous mod.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/yungs-hydungeons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the YUNG’s HyDungeons mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-thorium-furnaces">Thorium Furnaces</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes, a good quality-of-life feature can go a long way. It doesn’t have to be a wild mod that breaks the game. The Thorium Furnaces mode adds 11 new furnaces, and they speed up the smelting process, saving a lot of time. The rarer the furnace, the faster it gets the job done, allowing you to go exploring quicker.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/thorium-furnaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Thorium Furnaces mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-wan-s-wonder-weapons">Wan’s Wonder Weapons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you are after a wild mod that is just plain fun, look no further than Wan’s Wonder Weapons. When you think of ‘Wonder Weapons,’ you might think of Call of Duty’s Ray Gun, but here, you get special weapons like the Maelstrom anchor, Frostburn sword, or Chromatic Cleaver—the final one looking like it was pulled straight from a unicorn. If a pickaxe or regular sword just isn’t cutting it, download and get yourself Wan’s Wonder Weapons.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wans-wonder-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Wan’s Wonder Weapons mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-ymmersive-melodies">Ymmersive Melodies</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can “Annoy your friends with custom melodies” using the Ymmersive Melodies mod in Hytale. Does more need to be said? If you’re <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-invite-friends-join-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing with friends in Hytale</a>, why wouldn’t you want to upload custom melodies to make them want to throw Wild Berries or Dark Feathers at you?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/ymmersive-melodies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Ymmersive Melodies mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-wayback-charm">Wayback Charm</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As we come to the home stretch, it makes sense to end with a mod that aptly takes you home. CurseForge says this about the mod: “The Wayback Charm is a magical tool that can help you find your way back home. Simply press the use key (F) while holding the charm, and you will be teleported to the nearest respawn point. Respawn points can be created using blocks like beds. If you do not have a respawn location, or the respawn location is considered invalid, you will be sent to the world spawn.” Sounds good, right?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wayback-charm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Wayback Charm mod here.</a></p>



<p>Have your say on Hytale modding. Have you found any must-have lists that have been left off this list? If so, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let the staff know, as the mod might end up on this list!</p>

<p>Meta is scaling back its gaming presence with a round of layoffs. A report on Monday from the New York Times said that the company was set to let go roughly 10% of staff from the Reality Labs side of the company. </p>



<p>One day later, and it appears <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that those layoffs</a> have begun with a number of studios being hit. </p>







<p>Reality Labs, if you didn’t know, houses Meta’s Oculus Studios division. Oculus Studios is responsible for managing the various first party studios and teams that develop games for the Meta Quest VR headsets.</p>



<p>Two studios known to be impacted by the layoffs are Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games. In a <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Twitter</a>, designer Andy Gentile revealed that he had been let go. In his post, Gentile added that <strong>“It appears the entire Twisted Pixel games studio has been shut down. Sanzaru Games too.”</strong></p>



<p>Over on LinkedIn, Sanzaru senior level designer Ray West <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also confirmed that Sanzaru</a>, along with “several Meta game studios” were shut down.</p>



<p><strong>“It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I’m really glad to have gotten to know everyone there,”</strong> he said.</p>







<p>Prior to the layoffs and studio closures, Twisted Pixel Games recently released Deadpool VR for Meta Quest 3. For Sanzaru, they developed the highly regarded Asgard’s Wrath and Asgard’s Wrath 2.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Meta for comment on how many jobs were lost and all of the studios hit as part of these layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

This edition includes all 26 episodes with English audio, the original Japanese audio with subtitles, hours of bonus features, and two films. The first Evangelion film, Death (True), is essentially a clip show that recaps the series, and The End of Evangelion is a retelling of the final two episodes.</p><p>Anyone who's familiar with the series will want to check out the four Rebuild of Evangelion movies. Released in four parts from 2007 to 2021, the project began as an almost shot-for-shot remake of the early episodes before introducing major changes to the established story, introducing new plotlines and characters. Shout Factory has released all of them to date, both as standard and limited-edition Blu-rays.</p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FJMQ34H9,B0FJMR1VDP,B00GS1EOJS,B0CC4JV5XJ,B0D136B49L,B0CC4GFWDF,B07GQ8VXZ5,B0012V4WSM,B004EC5IV6,B00GS1DM2S,B0BS1P8LFN,1421550792,1421553058,1421553627,1421553635,1421586541,1974707032,1421507676&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FJMQ34H9,B0FJMR1VDP,B00GS1EOJS,B0CC4JV5XJ,B0D136B49L,B0CC4GFWDF,B07GQ8VXZ5,B0012V4WSM,B004EC5IV6,B00GS1DM2S,B0BS1P8LFN,1421550792,1421553058,1421553627,1421553635,1421586541,1974707032,1421507676&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neon Genesis Evangelion &amp;

                <p>Tom Clancy's<em> The Division</em> is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/" data-ref-id="5000-479459">The Division 2</a> players are the ones who are getting a gift. An update coming this March will add a Realism Mode to The Division 2, giving fans a new way to experience the game.</p><p>Realism Mode is only available for players who purchased the Warlords of New York expansion. The mode itself is a stripped down version of the game that drops or modifies some of the series' traditional elements, like the HUD, the map, and hitmarkers, as well as XP and leveling progression. Instead, players will have to adjust to a completely rebalanced arsenal and a reality where shooting a foe in an arm or a leg isn't very effective anymore. But headshots still work, which is good news considering that ammo will be much harder to find in this mode.</p><p>In the announcement video above, the Ubisoft team revealed that the upcoming anniversary season will feature a collaboration with another Tom Clancy creation, but further details about that particular collaboration weren't shared. However, it sounds like outfits and gear from Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six Siege, and Ghost Recon will be added to the game.</p><p>Following the anniversary season, Ubisoft has plans to add even more content to The Division 2. But according to the video, the publisher won't share those details until March.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-definitive-edition-spotted-in-the-wild/1100-6537325/" data-ref-id="1100-6537325">a definitive edition of The Division</a> was spotted in Japan, but it's unclear when or if Ubisoft will announce that project. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">The Division 3</a> remains in development and franchise executive producer Julian Gerighty recently said, "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-boss-hasnt-left-ubisoft-and-more-updates-are-coming-soon/1100-6535549/" data-ref-id="1100-6535549">It’s shaping up to be a monster</a>."</p>

                <p>Those discontent with their current <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> housing neighborhood may soon have another option at their disposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, those participating in WoW's recently added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/" data-ref-id="1100-6536160">player housing feature</a> have two options when it comes to joining a neighborhood. The first is to join a public neighborhood that is open to anyone, while the second is to be a member of a guild and join a neighborhood that only fellow guild members can live in.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhshcr68CJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nhshcr68CJ0?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Soon, however, it looks like there will be a third option to choose from. The ability to create invite-only charter neighborhoods recently appeared for testing on the beta for WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion. The feature doesn't appear to be fully functioning just yet, but there is an option for naming and purchasing a charter neighborhood, implying that the feature is indeed on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">This charter option lets the owner invite whoever they want to the neighborhood, including players from an opposite faction, allowing Horde and Alliance players to live side-by-side. This option also allows for players from different servers or guilds, as is the case with public neighborhoods.</p><p dir="ltr">Exactly how much it might cost to create a charter neighborhood is still unknown, but if it's relatively cheap, it could have some side effects. If players are easily able to create their own private neighborhoods, more public neighborhoods could start to become abandoned. However, players can easily pick up their house and move it to a new, more populated neighborhood with little effort.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether character neighborhoods will go live with WoW's Midnight pre-patch on January 20 or with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">expansion proper on March 2</a> (or sometime later) is still unclear. However, players have already wasted little time coming up with all kinds of awe-inspiring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-world-of-warcraft-player-housing-creations-so-far/2900-7370/" data-ref-id="2900-7370">player housing creations</a>, so giving one person or a small group the keys to an entire neighborhood could create some even more impressive results.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what is definitely coming in the Midnight pre-patch, the update will introduce class talent tree changes, a new Demon Hunter specialization, major user interface updates, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pricey-wow-transmog-changes-have-players-angry-and-confused/1100-6536391/" data-ref-id="1100-6536391">overhaul of WoW's transmog system</a>, and a controversial new policy towards <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-killing-part-of-the-game-before-its-ready/1100-6535418/" data-ref-id="1100-6535418">player-made add-ons</a> that will see many related to combat no longer function.</p>

            <p>Styx: Blades of Greed is probably one of my most anticipated games this year, so I am pleased to let you know that there is now a demo available to try out.</p>
<p>This demo will give you the chance to play the first hour of Styx: Blades of Greed, which (I am 99 percent sure) will plop you down at The Wall. This is one of the areas I got to explore during a preview session with developer Cyanide last year.</p>

<p>While this Styx: Blades of Greed demo is only available to try out on Steam, the game itself will be launching across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, as well as PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. As for when, that would be 19th February, so in a little over a month's time.</p>
<p>Cyanide has said that demo save data will be transferable to the full version on Blades of Greed's release. If this all sounds good to you, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">check out the demo via Steam</a> now. </p>
<p>As well as this nugget of demo news, the studio has also released a new trailer for Styx: Blades of Greed, which hands narrative duties over to Styx himself. Here, the caustic goblin explains his love of Quartz (a powerful and precious substance), as well as showing off some of his new gear such as the glider.</p>
<p>You can check it out below.</p>

<p>Blades of Greed all kicks off after the events of Styx: Shards of Darkness, though the developer has said you won't need to have played any of the previous entries to still enjoy the upcoming release.</p>
<p>Like I said already, I got to go hands-on with Styx: Blades of Greed last year, and while I wasn't very good at it (in fact, I was terrible), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/styx-blades-of-greed-managed-to-impress-with-its-stealth-gameplay-despite-my-attempts-to-do-the-opposite">I had an absolute blast playing as the titular goblin and causing all sorts of chaos</a> for those that got in my way.</p>

<p>Down 33% in 5 months</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7ecc99f80aabf"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7ecc99f80aabf/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's share price has been on a downward turn over the last several months, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;sq">currently sitting at 9,950 yen</a> following an all-time high of 14,795 yen in August 2025.</p>
<p>Fluctuations are inevitable in this business, but according to <a href="https://kantangames.com/">Kantan Games</a>' CEO Dr. Serkan Toto, Nintendo's investors are "spooked" by the prospect of price rises along with the lack of any major first-party titles in 2026 (so far!).</p>
<p>In a post on X (via <a href="https://xcancel.com/serkantoto/status/2011080382108913781#m">XCancel</a>), Toto states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo stock in Japan is sliding: All-time high of 14,795 yen in August 2025, and closed at 9,950 yen today.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"So -33% in 5 months: Investors are spooked by possible price hikes, lack of 1st-party hits and US/EU hardware discounts during the holidays."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, we're not sure what the heck is going on with that last point. Was anyone really expecting to see a console discount within the first year of sale? Christmas or not, that just seems bonkers to us.</p>
<p>Either way, it's a noteworthy downturn, but we're not worried at the moment. The Switch 2, despite some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-sales-reportedly-struggled-over-the-christmas-period">apparent struggles over the Christmas period</a>, is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">still the fastest-selling console of all time</a>. Furthermore, we're confident Nintendo will have some more big games up its sleeve for the latter half of 2026. <strong>Pokémon Gen 10</strong>, anyone?</p>

			<p><strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was one of the biggest commercial successes in 2025, not just for <strong>EA</strong>, but across the video game industry overall. It was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">best-selling games on Steam by revenue in 2025</a>, and as of November 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">it was the best-selling game in the US overall</a>. But while EA has been enjoying its commercial success, the players around the game have begun to feel the lack of new content, with concurrent player numbers (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">at least on Steam</a>) practically falling off the map compared to where they were when the game launched.</p>



<p>That's why, when EA announced in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update">today's January Update blog</a> that the next major batch of content, <strong>Season 2</strong>, wouldn't arrive until <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>, one of the first comments, which sums up community sentiment quite well, was, "<em>Is this a joke?</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">October 10, 2025</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Season 1 and its highly anticipated REDSEC battle royale mode launching on October 28, 2025</a>. Since October 28, there have been content updates for the game as part of Season 1, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-now-live/">with the introduction of new maps and limited-time modes</a>, but the launch of Season 2 arriving in February means that players will have gone almost four months without any major new content.</p>



<p>To a certain vintage of player, it may seem ludicrous for this to be an issue the community is complaining about, but that's simply the world we live in when it comes to modern-day live-service titles. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">Marvel Rivals</a></strong>, for example, doesn't let its community go a single month without new content, with a new season every two months and new characters and maps introduced at the halfway point. </p>



<p>Like it or not, that is the pace of modern live-service games, and while Battlefield 6 and Marvel Rivals offer different experiences to players, if EA hopes to keep up with free-to-play games like Marvel Rivals, it can't keep players waiting months for new maps.</p>



<p>In fairness to EA and Battlefield Studios (DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect), the team is aware that this is a longer wait than players would have expected, and claims the decision was made "<em>in order to keep our promise</em>" to the community to deliver the best possible experience. </p>



<p>"<em>During our ongoing development, we've continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2</em>," the team writes. </p>



<p>"<em>Season 1 will be extended past its in-game end date of January 20, and we will launch Season 2 on February 17. The Season 1 extension update to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will be released on January 20, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season 1 Battle Pass until the start date of Season 2</em>."</p>



<p>As part of Season 1 getting extended, EA is adding new cosmetics, free rewards, and XP bonuses for players, including a Frostfire Bonus Path that players will be able to complete alongside the Season 1 battle pass rather than having to choose between them, which is how players currently work through the several battle pass paths. There will also be a Valentine's Day update arriving later, with double XP weekends, login rewards, and more. </p>



<p>It's a nice attempt from EA to try and hold players over until Season 2 is ready, but it's doubtful community sentiment will change until we start to see what Season 2 will bring. Hopefully, it's enough to bring the players who have dropped Battlefield 6 due to a lack of content back to the game. Otherwise, EA and Battlefield Studios may be in for a rough 2026.</p>

              <p>Developers at two of Meta’s virtual reality game development studios are posting online that massive layoffs have happened and that the studios might be shutting down completely.</p> <p>On January 13, multiple developers from Twisted Pixel and Sanzaru Games posted online that they had been laid off from the studios. Many of the affected staff have suggested that both studios, and others owned by the company formerly known as Facebook, might be completely shutting down. Meta has not confirmed this. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to the company for more information about the future of the VR studios and the publicly confirmed layoffs.</p> <p>“Welp. As many will hear soon, several Meta game studios were closed today, including Sanzaru. It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I’m really glad to have gotten to know everyone there,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs/">posted senior-level designer Ray West on LinkedIn on Tuesday.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p><span>“I’ve just been laid off. It appears the entire Twisted Pixel </span>games studio has been shut down.<span> Sanzaru Games, </span>too,” <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">posted another developer on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, I was part of the layoffs today at Meta, and will be seeking a new role,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kathrynyu.com">said Twisted Pixel VR gameplay designer Kathryn Yu on Bluesky</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-reality-labs-vr-horizon-worlds-teams-2026-1">This follows reporting on Monday</a> that Meta was looking to pivot away from VR and the metaverse to AI and augmented reality tech after that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/29/meta-earnings-report">part of the company lost $4 billion.</a> Meta is reportedly looking to cut 10 to 15 percent of Reality Labs, its VR sector, which includes 15,000 employees as well as numerous game studios like Sanzaru. These teams were developing exclusive Meta Quest games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514">like last year’s <em>Deadpool VR</em></a>, which was developed by Twisted Pixel.</p>

 <p>Sanzaru was acquired by Meta in 2020 following the release of<em> Asgard’s Wrath</em>, a popular and critically acclaimed RPG, in 2019. It developed a sequel that launched as a free pack-in game with the launch of the Quest 3 in December 2023. Twisted Pixel previously worked on games like <em>Splosion Man</em> and <em>Lococycle</em> before being bought by Meta in 2021 to work on VR titles.</p>

Those changes will include a one-second spawn cooldown, with only one sword spawning instead of multiple when killing groups of enemies with Executioner all at once. Blizzard will also remove the tracking period of the swords themselves, which will instead fall as soon as they reach the player. That should make them easier to predict.</p><p dir="ltr">For a full look at what all changed in Diablo 4's leaderboard update, make sure to check out the full <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24244466/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> didn't cause a commotion when it launched last year, but it quietly became a compelling alternative to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>'s offerings, which many felt were on the simpler (albeit extremely polished) side. Now, a little over a month since the native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version arrived digitally, we've got confirmation the physical release is coming in March.</p>
<p>Sega dropped the long-awaited news on 13th January, confirming the date you need to mark on the calendar is 26th March. The suggested retail price is $69.99 / £64.99, same as the digital version of CrossWorlds. Perhaps more convincing is the fact the complete base game will be on a regular cartridge versus a game-key card. Mind you, patches and content updates still need to be downloaded, but we know many of you will celebrate.</p>
<p>Though some developers have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">gone on to explain</a> game-key cards enable them to do true physical releases (better than codes in boxes for sure) while avoiding the "data streaming" limitations of the Switch carts, which are slower than Switch 2's internal SSD and microSD cards, there's been a vocal crusade against third-party releases that aren't 100 percent physical.</p>
<p>This has reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-dev-says-nintendo-has-cheaper-cartridges-coming-as-alternative-to-game-key-cards-then-backtracks-but-either-way-its-title-will-now-be-a-proper-physical-release">pushed Nintendo to look into alternatives</a>, but for now, you can lend and sell game-key cards without issue, as they're rather similar to PlayStation and Xbox discs that only come with part of the games on them. It's more of a distant future-proofing issue.</p><p>In any case, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds' sales should see another boost with this physical release, as many fans of the off-beat racing series were waiting for a Switch 2 release they could add to their physical collection. (It's me, I'm fans.)</p>
<p>Since its September 2025 release, the game has welcomed free crossover characters like Hatsune Miku (really), Joker from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-30th-anniversary-boxing-fitness-more-announcements">Persona</a>, Ichiban Kasuga from Like a Dragon, and even NiGHTS from the underrated series of the same name. Paid content has included Pac-Man, Minecraft content, and even SpongeBob SquarePants. Up next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-mans-finally-making-a-comeback-but-his-first-big-game-in-years-is-still-a-while-away">Mega Man</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and Avatar (the Nickelodeon one) will be making a splash too.</p>

<p>The demo will give you a small taste of what the co-op horror title will have to offer, with Tarsier Studios previously stating that solo players will have no problem experiencing the game if you can't find anyone to join you.</p>
<p>Reanimal is somewhat of a spiritual successor to <strong>Little Nightmares</strong>, which Tarsier Studios worked on before development passed over to Supermassive Games for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">third entry</a>. It looks to be an altogether more disturbing experience as the story follows two siblings to work to escape a hellish environment full of grotesque creatures.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ourvtp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964"><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>, the ill-fated loot shooter</span></a><span> from BioWare that marked a detour from the studio’s usual RPG output, shut down yesterday. Whether you downloaded it digitally or bought it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-gamestop-used-game-penny-bioware-ea-mass-effect-1849194814"><span>on a disc for a penny</span></a><span>, you can never play it again. Its servers are down, and BioWare and publisher EA didn’t give the game an offline mode before tossing it into a chasm.</span></p> <p><span>While many of </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s fans had long since hung up their javelins and bid farewell to Fort Tarsis, in the lead-up to the game’s shutdown some began scrambling to fire it up once more, wanting to fly around its world a few more times, snag some trophies they’d previously left unclaimed, and soak up the game’s lost potential one last time.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the years since </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>‘s</span> <span>launch in 2019, the game</span> <span>has been seen by some as a poster child for ill-advised pivots into live-service forever games, with studios making the shift in the hopes of creating the next </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span>, a game that could grab millions of players and hold onto them for years with constant updates, paid expansions, and microtransactions, a cash cow with a long lifespan. BioWare’s pivot away from producing its usual character-driven RPGs and into making a loot shooter was questionable at the time, but even if it ultimately failed to draw in the playerbase it would have needed to succeed commercially, there was a time when BioWare fans and newcomers alike were drawn in by its potential.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>“</span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>looked like the answer to a question nobody had successfully answered yet,” Vinny, an </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>fan, tells </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “I’ve played </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span> and had a clan for years. </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> seemed like it could be the ‘</span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span> killer.’ What if Iron Man could fly but also loot things and occasionally scream while free-falling into a canyon? The trailers sold this idea of freedom, power, and mystery. It felt ambitious in that reckless way where you think either ‘this will be incredible’ or ‘it will explode on the launch pad.’ I bought a ticket anyway and pre-ordered it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even though a live-service loot shooter seemed outside of BioWare’s wheelhouse, long-time fans of the RPG studio were still willing to give it a shot in hopes that those live-service trappings might still contain another dense, character-driven story from the studio. Vinny says that </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> had earned the studio possibly “too much trust” for him, and that buying </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> was “like loaning your car to a friend who once returned it clean and with a full tank. You do not ask questions. You just hand over the keys.” Before </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>launched, Vinny says he was “cautiously optimistic, which is gamer speak for already emotionally invested but pretending I am not.”</span></p>

   <p><span>WordsMaybe, another long-time BioWare fan who had been playing the studio’s games since 2003’s </span><i><span>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</span></i><span>, tells </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>he was open to the company breaking off from its usual role-playing bread and butter, and that the switch-up in genre wasn’t as concerning to him as it might have been to others.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I’m fine with developers [changing things up] if they genuinely have an interest in trying out new things,” he said. “I think that’s healthy. As someone who does creative work myself, I know that it can feel like doing the same thing all the time. A lot of those people who have been there for decades like doing something different.”</span></p>

 <p><span>That willingness to see the studio work on something new and a hope that what the studio always did best would shine through overcame some of his concerns.</span></p> <p><span>“Obviously, there was stuff that came out like, there’s not going to be a romance, there’s not going to be big choices in the same way, but I was like, ‘okay, well it’s still BioWare writing in terms of world building,’” he says. “Which is a really compelling thing about their writing; the lore of the world, all the factions and types of people, and how that stuff interacts, and you know, sometimes it has lots of baggage that comes with it, but it’s always interesting.”</span></p> <p><span>For some, the hesitation wasn’t about BioWare changing genres, but its shift into the live-service market, known for its reliance on microtransactions and sometimes-predatory monetization schemes. Pimpy Shortstocking, a moderator for the </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> Discord and owner of the now-defunct fansite </span><i><span>Fort Tarsis</span></i><span>, remembers hoping the game could dethrone </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span>, but having reservations about whether BioWare would employ the same predatory practices that some other live-service developers do.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I was worried that they would take some of the wrong lessons from the industry and heavily monetize it,” he tells </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “I was more worried about the monetization part of it, not so much the loot shooter part of it. I was worried about it being EA and BioWare’s first foray into that kind of space. I thought [the monetization we got] was fine, all the stuff in the shop wasn’t egregious, I guess. It was relatively standard fare for what we had at the time.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000282745" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000282745"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000282745">© BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>BioWare tried to communicate to its single-player RPG fans that </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>might still have something for them, but as WordsMaybe points out, a lot of </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s initial fans were people who weren’t interested in BioWare’s RPGs at all. That’s because ultimately, as much as BioWare claimed the game offered a solid experience to solo players&nbsp; with its “Strong alone, stronger together” tagline, it was a multiplayer game first and foremost.</span></p>

 <p><span>IJN-Atago, an </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>fan who had only recently started playing video games when the game launched, says they have fond memories of the game because it was one of the first they purchased with their own money as a teenager.</span></p> <p><span>“This game was something right up my alley,” he says. “It has flying robot suits, an open world, and fighting against unknown enemies. Piloting an Iron-Man-like suit was the best part.”</span></p> <p><span>All that excitement came crashing down when the game finally launched. The promise of a cooperative Iron Man simulator collided with repetitive missions, a lackluster story, an underdeveloped cast, and a nagging feeling that </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>was caught between several conflicting design philosophies, ones that often felt at odds with what BioWare did best, and were outclassed by the game’s live-service contemporaries.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <h2><b>Shock</b></h2> <p><span>Pimpy Shortstocking recalls a wave of server issues on day one, with people’s PlayStations crashing and a sense of “dread” overtaking any excitement he and the friends he was teaming up with initially felt.</span></p> <p><span>“The people around me don’t have the same patience I do, which is understandable,” he says. “I don’t feel like I’m the average person in terms of letting games slide by with technical issues. A lot of them dropped off immediately, and so I was like, ‘Okay, well, this co-op game I wanted to play with my friends is now a co-op game I have to play with strangers.’”</span></p> <p><span>Even those who wanted to give </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>a chance based on BioWare’s past accomplishments expressed disappointment in the writing and weren’t drawn in by the loot shooter loop.</span></p> <p><span>“I was like ‘This really feels like </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span>, but less compelling,’” WordsMaybe says. “I [wasn’t] feeling the writing. Not that BioWare hasn’t had quippy writing throughout its history. It absolutely has, but like, your assistant character in the game…he very much felt like a Joss Whedon sort of whipster, with snarky and irreverent dialogue all the time. Nothing felt like it was being taken that seriously, so even on the tonal level of writing, it just wasn’t hitting for me.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“I would say it’s probably my least favorite experience playing a BioWare game,” he continues. “Well, even saying ‘least favorite’ is probably giving it too much credit because ‘favorite’ being in that sentence is probably unearned.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000282748" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000282748"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000282748">© BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But it wasn’t all disappointment. For players like Vinny, </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s launch was an imperfect spark of something that could have been much greater.</span></p> <p><span>“There was genuine excitement,” Vinny says. “The first flight was magic. For a moment, I thought, ‘Okay, this might actually work.’ Then the cracks started showing. But that initial feeling was real. </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> could feel incredible minute to minute, even when everything around it was [held together by] duct tape, crossed fingers, and empty promises ultimately.”</span></p>

 <h2><b>Bargaining</b></h2> <p><span>Though many players had already moved on by the time it came out that BioWare was planning a complete revamp of </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> at the end of 2019, some fans like Vinny felt “real honest hope.” Games like </span><i><span>No Man’s Sky</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XIV</span></i><span> had already enjoyed their own dramatic redemption arcs, and it seemed like </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>, which some players felt had strong fundamentals but just needed more shaping, was an obvious candidate for such a comeback.</span></p> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> had such a strong core that a rework felt justified,” Vinny said. “It felt like the game was being taken into the back room for surgery instead of being quietly wheeled out to the dumpster.”</span></p>

   <p><span>Pimpy Shortstocking remembered feeling optimistic at the time as well. BioWare gave players a few pre-release updates about what </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>2.0 had in store, helping to put him at ease. Whether it was in new factions like the Pirates of the Blood Wind group that would help fill out the world, or in smaller quality-of-life features like a mass salvage function to more easily manage your inventory, the 2.0 update held a lot of promise. But as a moderator of the </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>Discord, he saw firsthand just how rabid fans were getting over what they perceived to be unmet promises, and when it became clear that none of this would see the light of day, he recalls a lot of drama and anger.</span></p> <h2><b>Anger</b></h2> <p><span>On February 24, 2021, BioWare announced that it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-says-it-s-giving-up-on-anthem-1846347391"><span>would not be moving forward</span></a><span> with its plan to reboot </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>. This shift had a ripple effect within the studio, with the company reportedly pivoting its planned live-service </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/after-anthems-failure-dragon-age-4-will-reportedly-be-1846356951"><span>into a single-player RPG</span></a><span>, which would eventually launch three years later. While </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans had plenty of reason to rejoice, whatever remained of </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s fans were not happy to have waited two years for nothing.</span></p> <p><span>“It was just a mess,” Pimpy Shortstocking says about the official Discord reaction. “We dealt with death threats, not just towards the devs but to the moderator team, even though again I want to be clear, the moderator team on that Discord did not work for BioWare.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Pimpy Shortstocking was part of a team of moderators that helped the team in the Discord by collecting community feedback, and despite repeated pleas from the mods to be civil, “gamers be gaming,” he says. The game’s subreddit, meanwhile, he says, was “not as bad,” though there were plenty of players expressing disappointment or wanting their money back. “Then it just kind of died. Nobody posted on the Reddit anymore.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“That one hurt, and it wasn’t surprising,” Vinny says. “It felt like watching someone give up halfway through an apology, then insult you again. There was disappointment but also resignation. At that point, it was clear </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>was not going to get the second chance it deserved. I felt let down, honestly.”</span></p> <h2><b>Depression</b></h2> <p><span>Eventually, what was left of </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s community scattered to the winds, and the game became </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-5-years-later-1851294156"><span>a warning</span></a><span> for other studios looking to jump onto the live-service trend. For many years, it felt like </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> was only ever brought up if it was being propped up as an example, but some fans still kicked around Fort Tarsis every now and then, posting on subreddits and trying to excise water from the stone.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s changed, however slightly, in the past few weeks. BioWare announced last year that it would be shutting down </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s servers on January 12, with no plans to offer an offline version of the game to those who bought it on vibes and a promise seven years ago. Finding themselves with just hours left before it disappears forever, fans have been booting the game up for one last ride.</span></p> <p><span>“[I’ve felt] mostly nostalgia mixed with frustration,” Vinny says. “I have been jumping back in more lately just to soak it in before it’s gone. Flying one last time, taking screenshots, remembering what could have been. It feels like visiting a place you loved that is about to be demolished.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Pimpy Shortstocking, meanwhile, was mostly “fine” when the announcement came that the game was being well and truly wiped out, even if it did pick at old wounds from every other game he’s liked that’s been canceled.</span></p> <p><span>“I could just move on,” he says. “It’s just a video game, that happens. All these games that I’m excited for usually get canceled because it’s ‘not the market’ or ‘the market’s not there for it.’ Which I understand, but at the same time, can I like something without it being thrown away?”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000265544" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000265544"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000265544">© BioWare</figcaption></figure> <p><span>WordsMaybe said he wasn’t surprised by the shutdown, though he is opposed to it on the grounds of preservation.</span></p> <p><span>“Even successful games eventually run their lifespan for online service games, even though I disagree with the general notion for the sake of preservation,” he says. “It’s sad to think about because there are certain games that I have wanted to play [but can’t]. Even though </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>‘s not a good game, I still think it deserves some life and people being able to still check it out, [to say], ‘I’m curious about BioWare stuff. I’m curious about the historical value of what </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>was,’ and now people just won’t get that.”</span></p>

 <p><span>When I conducted these interviews, I asked everyone if they had something to remember </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>by, as the game would disappear forever, and for most of these players, the answer was their memories. Pimpy Shortstocking mentioned that he had an</span><i><span> Anthem</span></i><span> shirt with a tanky Colossus Javelin on it, an art book, a soundtrack, messages he sent about his fan site, and the friendships he made with the developers while working as a mod. Some of these things are tangible proof that </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>was here, but by and large, when a video game is wiped from existence, all we have are the memories we made, and the haunting truth is that memories fade.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Acceptance</b></h2> <p><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>has officially shut down, and at the moment, BioWare hasn’t said a word about it since the original announcement. It seems that the studio and EA are willing to let the game go quietly into the night without so much as an acknowledgement. So players had to create their own.</span></p>    <p><span>Since the announcement that BioWare and EA would be shutting down </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>, players like IJN-Atago have been logging onto places like the game’s subreddit and dedicated Discord for another trip to Fort Tarsis and posting goodbye messages showing their freelancers in the game’s world one last time. IJN-Atago posted a clip of them earning the game’s Platinum trophy on PlayStation, which is unlocked by completing every other trophy in the game. Once the game is shut down, no one will be able to acquire that Platinum again, which will make it rare among trophy hunters.</span></p> <p><span>WordsMaybe, meanwhile, is one of the players documenting the game’s final hours in video form. It will only be from his perspective, but he and others plan on being there when the sun finally sets.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I’m sure other people will do the same thing,” he says. “I’m sure I’m not the only person that had this idea, especially with the current conversation around game preservation being a lot more active than it was 20 years ago. Even if it’s just that, I want to record that from my perspective and have some degree of preservation of that moment.”</span></p> <p><span>Though WordsMaybe says there may be a point down the line when fans are able to reverse-engineer </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> and get it running on private servers, , for now,&nbsp; the moments that players have captured during the game’s lifespan will be all that’s left of it. Though the BioWare community at large may not have taken to it, and several prominent creators in the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> communities have been pretty silent about the game, those who saw potential in what BioWare was building have logged on to pay their respects.</span></p> <p><span>“You can’t ever really recreate that moment with these online games,” WordsMaybe continues. “You can’t recreate the experience even if you theoretically get some sort of single-player version of the game up; it’s never going to be </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>as it was. So how do you give people more than just, ‘here’s a video of what it was like’? Obviously, [the] only [thing in my] ability right now is just ‘here’s a video,’ but at least it’s something.</span></p>   <p><span>To some subsets of the general gaming community, </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>has been a laughingstock, a symbol of both the live-service crash and of BioWare having seemingly lost its way. WordsMaybe says that he believes the hate for the game and BioWare feels indicative of a larger, more toxic attitude toward the studio and the oddly smug attitude people have toward games they don’t like or were never going to play in the first place.</span></p> <p><span>“The industry right now is just such a mess,” he says. “It kind of pains me a little bit to see more general outlets or people on social media like </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mcazi32wxa2x"><span>[Wario64]</span></a><span> who post ‘Hey, </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>‘s being shut down,’ and you’ll see in the replies, ‘good riddance, blah blah blah, who cares?’ I still think we need to have a degree of care for even the bad games that are going through this stuff. It’s the same thing that happened with </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>. That was somebody’s life for a long time. It’s sad to see stuff go and people gloating about it. Especially considering the state of online discourse, which is very right-wing leaning or made up of reactionary people. The views on BioWare as this ‘horrible woke company that deserves whatever fate it gets’ right now are just sad.”</span></p> <p><span>WordsMaybe takes it a step further and says he believes that the narrative of </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>as an entirely uncharacteristic pivot for BioWare is </span><a href="https://medium.com/@WordsMaybe/applying-the-bioware-formula-to-baldurs-gate-4fc0ad88985e"><span>ignorant of the studio’s history</span></a><span> and is “misguided,” considering its history of including multiplayer elements in its games as far back as the original </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“It wasn’t just, like, this deeply cynical thing of EA just being like at gunpoint, ‘no, you must make a live-service game, RPG developer,’” he says. “I think a lot of the narrative around BioWare and so many things is deeply misguided and doesn’t really fully understand the big picture of things sometimes, and that’s such an instance.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">PS4 Coaster is $9.96 on Amazon <a href="https://t.co/i56Kfr4cGN">https://t.co/i56Kfr4cGN</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ad?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ad</a> <a href="https://t.co/TGUUKaMI0I">pic.twitter.com/TGUUKaMI0I</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/2010831642126946744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>While some fans are taking steps to preserve its final moments as best they can, ultimately, </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>has concluded as what Vinny calls an “unfinished promise.”</span></p> <p><span>“In the end, </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> will be remembered the same way we remember that one friend who could do backflips but never showed up to work on time: incredible talent, but questionable follow-through,” Vinny says. “We loved it anyway. We will miss the flying, the chaos, and the brief moments where it felt like the future had arrived early. </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>did not crash and burn. It hovered beautifully, ran out of fuel, and gently face-planted into gaming history with style. </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>left us let down, not because of the game, but because they had something special and just quit. </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>deserved better, and fans deserve better. </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>will not be remembered for what it was but for what it almost became, and that might be the most heartbreaking legacy a game can have.”</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367]]></content:encoded>
