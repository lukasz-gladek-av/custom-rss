It wasn’t a huge hit compared to other <em>CoD </em>games, not least because the Vita itself wasn’t a big seller. But despite the Vita being a portable console from over a decade ago and<em> Black Ops: Declassified</em> being a oddball spin-off from 2012, there are still enough people playing the FPS in 2025 that you can reportedly boot up a Vita right now and find a match in seconds. </p><p>On January 4, PlayStation content creator Radec posted on Twitter that they were able to boot up a PS Vita and find matches “instantly” in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/realradec/status/1875686080378499148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1875686080378499148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The tweet went viral</a></span>, likely because a lot of people were surprised to hear that <em>Declassified</em> was still popular and being played in 2025. And I bet some people were just shocked to hear about a PS Vita <em>Call of Duty</em> even existing. </p><p>Radec isn’t the only person reporting this. In the replies to the tweet you can find other players sharing stories of how they just recently booted up the game on their own PS Vita and also found matches quickly. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/David_Jagneaux/status/1856836194526695884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/David_Jagneaux/status/1856836194526695884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another player shared how they found matches quickly</a></span> in <em>Declassified </em>in November, saying it only took about 20 seconds to find a full lobby. </p><p>“Legit. Like last month I connected my Vita to my mobile hotspot and checked <em>Black Ops Declassified </em>multiplayer and there were almost full lobbies with all kinds of players,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RicksterLPs/status/1875813935200530823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RicksterLPs/status/1875813935200530823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said another user in response to Radec’s tweet</a></span>. “The best part about the whole experience was there were no hackers. Just people who wanna unwind and play.”</p><p>Declassified isn’t the only old <em>CoD</em> game still being played in 2025. You can still boot up most <em>Call of Duty </em>games released on PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PS4 and find players instantly. Some people just don’t want to move on. Be warned though, as someone who has done this, the people still playing these older <em>Call of Duty</em> games are veterans who know the maps and weapons incredibly well and you’ll likely get stomped over and over. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft is continuing to expand Xbox Game Pass, with new LG Smart TVs coming later this year set to support the service via Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox App on their new LG TV, no Xbox required. A select few games, around 50, will also be streamable via the new LG TVs for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers who own them. Microsoft announced the ability to stream owned games in November, with titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/" data-ref-id="5000-519019">NBA 2K25, Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and others supporting the feature. </p><p dir="ltr">Currently, those looking to stream Xbox Game Pass titles without an actual console or PC can do so via their phone, Amazon Fire TV, or on newer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-support-coming-to-2021-samsung-smart-tvs/1100-6509215/" data-ref-id="1100-6509215">Samsung Smart TVs</a>. Microsoft said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> it will reveal more details about how the service will work on LG Tvs "in the coming months." It's currently unclear if support for the service will eventually come to some older LG TVs.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Cloud Gaming and Game Pass heading to LG TVs comes as part of Microsoft's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">"This is an Xbox" marketing campaign</a>, where the company has looked to expand the idea of what it means to play on Xbox by highlighting how players can play "Xbox" on their PC, phones, or even TVs.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a message Microsoft has been using for a while now. In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">the goal was to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but that didn't necessarily mean selling more consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">"It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," Spencer said.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to allowing players to stream Xbox Game Pass titles from a variety of devices, Microsoft has continued to offer many of its first-party titles on competing platforms. Xbox's most recent big console exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-discusses-bringing-indiana-jones-to-ps5-we-run-a-business/1100-6526011/" data-ref-id="1100-6526011">coming to PlayStation 5 in the spring</a>.</p>

                <p>Despite the fact that the second game in the Citizen Sleeper series hasn't been released yet, the creator said that he's already working on the third entry.

Citizen Sleeper 2 has an ending of sorts. I’m working on developing a tabletop game, which will be Citizen Sleeper 3."</p><p>Martin adds that he wants to take what he's learned from developing the two Citizen Sleeper games and apply it to something new. "The thing that drew me to making indie video games was that people are so welcoming and excited about new ideas," he explained. "I’m always wanting to propose something new and see how people react, so this will be my next step."</p><p>The series draws inspirations from tabletop RPGs and has action-economy gameplay based on rolling dice, so it's no surprise that the third entry will go back to its roots as a tabletop game.</p><p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector launches on January 31 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-for-xbox-compatibility/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyperkin-is-remaking-the-ps5%E2%80%99s-dualsense-but-for-xbox.1075095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-for-xbox-compatibility/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hyperkin has revealed a new Competitor wired gamepad for Xbox, and you’d be forgiven for thinking it looks rather familiar. In fact, it’s basically a PlayStation 5 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/06/dualsense-review-feeling-the-future-of-gaming/">DualSense</a> controller remade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox</a>.</p>
<p>Hyperkin absolutely plays up to this, with the announcement blurb saying, “If you prefer PS5’s DualSense controller but want to play something on Xbox or PC, then this is probably going to be the controller for you.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyperkin's Redesigned Competitor Xbox Controller Teaser (DualSense-Style Gamepad for Xbox)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Competitor comes with the striking two-tone white and black design of the DualSense controller or in an all-black version, but absent the rectangular touchpad, has a bit more of an X-Men vibe as the white panels continue in to meet a white and black Xbox button. Everything else looks very DualSense as well, from the D-pad design (which we really hope nails the feel and muted sound of the PlayStation D-pad), to the analogue stick placement, and the shoulder buttons and triggers.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a pro controller, so there are back buttons, and on the whole, the controller does look a bit chunkier than the DualSense – perhaps just from the flattened bottom below the sticks, which Sony has more moulded.</p>

<p>At this time there’s no details on pricing or availability, but if you’re a PlayStation fan suffering in the land of Xbox, this could be for you. The symmetrical analogue sticks will do a huge amount of the heavy lifting on that front, though it’s a shame that this is a wired controller and not wireless.</p>
<p>Hyperkin has made a lot of headlines over the years for their recreations of historic Xbox controllers, updating them for modern machines. That started with a recreation of the ‘<a href="https://hyperkin.com/hyperkin-duke-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-20th-anniversary-limited-edition-black-officially-licensed-by-xbox.html">Duke</a>‘ controller from the original Xbox, continued on with a ‘<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/23/hyperkin-is-remaking-the-xbox-360-controller/">Xenon</a>‘ recreation of the Xbox 360 gamepad, and most recently they revived the smaller ‘<a href="https://shop.hyperkinstore.com/products/hyperkin-duchess-wired-controller-white-officially-licensed-by-xbox">Duchess</a>‘ controller that Microsoft made to cater to smaller hands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-lg-smart-tvs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LG and Xbox have announced that they're teaming up in order to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG smart TVs via an all-new Xbox app integration.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2025/01/lg-and-xbox-partner-to-expand-cloud-gaming-experience-on-lg-smart-tvs/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement on its official website</a>, LG says you'll soon be able to access the Xbox app via its new Gaming Portal, although it also notes that said Gaming Portal's availability "can vary per TV model", so you'll probably have to pick up a newer smart TV to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>If you are lucky enough to own one of the LG TVs that supports the Gaming Portal, you can look forward to accessing "hundreds of games" via Xbox Cloud Gaming, though you'll need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to take advantage of that feature as well.</p>

<p>The app will be powered by LG's webOS, and it sounds like it might be just one of several cloud gaming apps available via the Gaming Portal; LG says the service provides a "comprehensive overview with an app list that includes cloud gaming apps, webOS app games", and more.</p>

<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is, of course, already available on Xbox consoles and web browsers, as well as in several other places, including Samsung's own smart TV line.</p>

<p>It's the cornerstone of Xbox's "This Is an Xbox" <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a>, which seeks to paint any device capable of running Cloud Gaming via a browser or the desktop Xbox app as an Xbox device.</p>

<p>Xbox boss Phil Spencer also confirmed that an Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away" rel="nofollow">handheld device</a> is currently being prototyped, although it's likely years away.</p>

<p>It's also unlikely you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>on that device if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">producer's comments</a> are anything to go by, although hey, maybe you'll be able to stream it via the cloud by then.</p>

<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls update is more star-studded than an all-star Avengers movie line-up, and we’ve got everything you need to know about the free-to-play shooter’s first major content injection.</p>



<p>Season 0 is coming to an end, sparking the beginning of a new chapter. Marvel Rivals has got off to a start so sharp even Blade would cower—joking, he would never do this. Rivals is the new kid on the block looking to stay and make its presence known until it matures into a wise Doctor Strange-esque figure. The first few weeks firmly established the hero shooter’s impressive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player count</a>, but Season 1 is the first real test.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls isn’t make or break, but it could shape the F2P title’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-release-date">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fantastic. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>January 10 is the start date for Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls</strong>, neatly coinciding with the end of Season 0.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals X</a> social media channel posted a <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message</a> on January 6 saying, “Season 1: Eternal Night Falls begins on Jan 10, 2025.”</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with any live-service shooter—Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Overwatch are common contemporaries—you’ll recognize the Battle Pass formula stays the same. Each pass has a counter showing you how many days are left. The final day allows the title to execute a seamless transition to the new season.</p>



<p>Some downtime or maintenance might happen, but otherwise, in this circumstance, we expect Marvel Rivals Season 0 to end with its timer on January 10, and Season 1 to get underway.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-start-time">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Start Time</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-arrives-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1’s Eternal Night Falls</a> commences at <strong>1 AM PST / 3 AM CT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, the verification comes straight from the same X status cited above. Check out the start time specific to you, make sure everything is updated and ready to go, grab some chips, and be heroic.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-heroes-in-marvel-rivals-eternal-night-falls">New Heroes in Marvel Rivals Eternal Night Falls</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-dropping-a-fantastic-4-trailer-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> featuring <strong>Mr Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and The Thing</strong> are the confirmed names making a spectacular entrance in Season 1. Also, <strong>Dracula</strong> has been outed as another potential character to use in the shooter.</p>



<p>We know this for definite as the Season 1: Eternal Night Falls Official Trailer&nbsp;showed off the fab foursome. </p>

<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Doom</a> teased for weeks now, you feel it’s all coming to a head in Eternal Night Falls. The reveal also strongly insinuates Dracula as a villain: “The Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. <strong>Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals!</strong>“</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if it’s just the Fantastic Four, or if Doctor Doom and Dracula are out for blood too.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-leaks">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Leaks</h2>



<p>Popular leaks suggest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron</a> is another character set to join the fray, and a host of <strong>buffs &amp; nerfs</strong> to key heroes are coming.</p>

<p>A bunch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals leaked character rumors</a> are in the wild, but Ultron could be sooner rather than later. Renowned leaker <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals – Leaks &amp; Info</a> thinks “Ultron releases Season 1 and he’s a Strategist.” Additionally, their <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1869869444455117276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1869869444455117276%7Ctwgr%5E1bb1dd9231dc5324b962d40043263ee880ea27c0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fmarvel-rivals%2Fmarvel-rivals-season-1-update-3022179%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leak</a> also has a full look at <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1869868212927524964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ultron’s abilities and difficulty rating</a> of <strong>Two Stars</strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick look at the characters expected to be reworked in Season 1—for better or worse.</p>

          <p>Last month, we asked readers to donate to a couple of good causes in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/win-hardware-collectibles-and-more-in-the-2024-ars-technica-charity-drive/">our 2024 Charity Drive sweepstakes</a>.

With the drive now complete and the donations all tallied, we can report that Ars Technica readers <strong>gave an incredible $39,047.66</strong>&nbsp;to <a href="https://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> in this year's drive. That doesn't set a new record, but it nearly matches last year's total and raises our lifetime Ars Charity Drive donation haul since 2007 to <strong>over</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$540,000</strong>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-8nm-soc-ampere-efficiency-goals/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-8nm-soc-is-more-likely-due-to-ampere-architecture-good-performance-and-battery-life-are-a-challenge-but-the-chip-was-likely-design.1075053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-8nm-soc-ampere-efficiency-goals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 T239 could be an 8nm chip, and while this could make good performance and battery life a challenge, there's a good chance this process node won't significantly impact the system.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the leaked system's motherboard, focusing on the T239 SoC, as most of the other components found on it aren't particularly interesting. While it is currently difficult to pinpoint the exact size of the chip due to the angled picture, Digital Foundry's experts think that the Samsung 8nm process node was more likely used for the chip over other rumored process nodes for a few reasons.</p>
<p>For starters, the chip is somewhat of an offshoot of the T234 chip, which uses the Samsung 8nm process node. Additionally, NVIDIA Ampere architecture was designed for this process node, and porting it to a different process node like 4nm would be a waste of time, as it would have made more sense simply to go with the Lovelace architecture, which was built with 4nm in mind. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">A Samsung 5nm process node</a> could still be possible, but it would still require porting Ampere over to a different process node. Also, the Samsung 8nm process node is quite cheap, as it has never been extremely popular, and Samsung likely doesn't have that many customers for it right now, so its low cost would definitely fit Nintendo's approach.</p>
<p>Even if the Nintendo Switch 2 is powered by a Samsung 8nm chip, the process node may end up not being as big an issue as many are speculating. While 8nm is not particularly power-efficient, and achieving good performance and battery life on it may be a challenge, all the current power measurements are likely way off the mark, as they are based on the T234 chip, which is much bigger than the T239 and requires a certain amount of power even with reduced clock speeds. Additionally, the T239 chip may have begun development as some sort of offshoot of the much bigger and more power-hungry T234 chip, but the two chips have been designed by different teams, have different CPUs, and the Nintendo Switch 2 chip has some additional features, such as a file decompression block required for fast loading and asset management, so it's not a cut-down version of the chip used in the automotive segment. Having likely been designed from scratch on the 8nm process node with certain power-efficiency goals in mind, which are suggested by the small battery cavity seen in the leaked motherboard, there's a very good chance that the chip's process node is not going to impact the system in any significant way.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 motherboard leak was only the first one to surface online in the first few days of 2025. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/">Yesterday</a>, pictures showcasing the new Joy-Con controller emerged online, and some of the additions from the original controller suggest that the controller could be used as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-mill-joycons-as-pc-mice-no-mans-sky-on-the-way/">PC mouse</a>. Will this be the new gimmick of the system? Hopefully, it won't take much longer to get the answer to this question and every other that fans have been asking themselves for a few months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-hyperkin-controller-revealed-ps5-style-for-xbox-named-the-competitor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the years, there have been a variety of PS5-style Xbox controllers, none of them causing quite as much of a stir as the Hyperkin controller. During the<a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2025-ceo-jensen-huang-keynote-live-here/"> CES 2025</a>, Hyperkin announced a brand-new Xbox controller, which is called "The Competitor" and seems very similar to that of the PlayStation 5 DualSense. Much like the DualSense, the thumbstick on the left has now been moved down to be parallel to the right thumbstick, and the D-pad is moved above to replicate the design of the DualSense. While it has an Xbox-style design in terms of pattern, the colors are that of the DualSense, in a classic white and black design.</p>
<p>Hyperkin is well known for making controllers and other accessories that have a retro vibe, with many of the controllers they created being similar to the original Xbox controllers. <a href="https://hyperkin.com/full-product-list.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Their website</a> is a safe haven for those who want a hit of nostalgia, as they have items that pertain to every type of popular console on the market. This ranges from the PlayStation One to the PS Vita and even a Nintendo DS, for example.</p>
<p>Compared to other controllers on the market, the brand-new Hyperkin controller is a wired controller that can be used on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. While PC gamers commonly use Xbox controllers over DualSense controllers, this new Hyperkin controller contains something that is incredibly beneficial to the longevity of a controller. That is the Hall Effect sticks. For those just hearing about these for the first time, Hall Effect Sticks use non-contact magnetic sensors to detect movement, which should prove to be beneficial in making sure that the thumbstick lasts longer than that of a typical Xbox controller.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't many details about this new Hyperkin Controller other than the name of it and a trailer that was released on the IGN YouTube channel. Here, you can see the aesthetic they went for with the controller and the sleekness of the design. By the looks of the trailer, it seems you can either get the controller in black and white, or just fully black, depending on your preference in aesthetic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyperkin's Redesigned Competitor Xbox Controller Teaser (DualSense-Style Gamepad for Xbox)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The video is only short and doesn't provide any details about the Competitor, but it's very obvious that they have taken heavy inspiration from the DualSense, even in the styling of the D-Pad and the buttons.</p>
<p>Those who have seen the controller now wish it had the option to be wireless, but that is proprietary tech belonging to Microsoft, and thus, it's not possible for Hyperkin to do so without getting permission from the company. While some are delighted with this new option, there is also an outcry from those who dislike using symmetrical thumbsticks, with some even saying that it will cause issues in the hands later on down the line.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no sign of how much this Hyperkin controller will cost, but we will keep you updated when the information arrives.</p>
<p>Will you be getting The Competitor controller by Hyperkin?</p>

<p>Microsoft has announced that it is bringing Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG Smart TVs. The <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company says</a> that the deal will bring the feature to new LG Smart TVs later this year. </p>



<p>With Xbox Cloud Gaming, LG Smart TV owners who are Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will be able to stream games from the library within the gaming portal. In addition to games in the service, players will also be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-of-own-games-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream their select games</a> that they happen to own on the TVs.</p>



<p>“This gives players even more choice in how they enjoy their favorite games,” Corporate Vice President of Xbox Lori Wright said. “We’ll share more details on the Xbox Cloud Gaming experience with LG TV in the coming months.”</p>







<p>It’s currently unclear if any older models — those released in 2024 and sooner — will get access to the feature in the future.</p>

<p>As promised, Marvel Rivals released their Season 1 trailer today, January 6. We now know that Eternal Night Falls and the Fantastic 4 will arrive on January 10, 2025, at 1 AM PST.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> is, unfortunately, a cinematic one, so we do not get to see gameplay for the Fantastic 4. However, we do learn about the overarching plot. With the arrival of Season 1, darkness will cover New York, with Doctor Strange trapped in an Entangled Astral Plane. Dracula and Doctor Doom are making their moves, disrupting the moon’s orbit and releasing an army of vampires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as things start looking grim for the heroes, we see the new additions to the Marvel Rivals roster take charge and protect the work against the evil forces of Dracula. On January 10, we will see the likes of Mr Fantastic, Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, and The Thing join the battle in Marvel Rivals Season 1. If luck is on our side, we might receive a gameplay trailer showcasing these characters in action before they arrive later this week.</p>



<p>In other news, recent leaks have claimed that characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-claims-deadpool-and-more-are-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool, Emma Frost and Modok</a> are coming to the game. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details about loot boxes</a> have leaked online.

                <p>CES 2025 has kicked off, and amidst all of the new tech reveals, Hyperkin has unveiled a new Xbox and PC controller that appears to borrow heavily from the design of the PlayStation DualSense controller. Dubbed the Competitor, this is a wired controller that features some premium hardware inside of it, like Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers. Official pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed, but we'll update this post with preorder links as soon as Hyperkin makes those details public.</p><p>Like the DualSense, the Competitor features a similar layout of face buttons, symmetrical analog sticks, and a familiar placement of face buttons (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ces-2025-hyperkin-unveils-dualsense-style-xbox-controller-called-the-competitor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>). The D-pad is also heavily influenced by the DualSense with its transparent buttons and placement, and for extras, two additional inputs on the gamepad's rear can be found. There'll be two variants available for purchase when it launches: a regular black Competitor controller and one with white face-plates to create a two-color tone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6rko8BbWgw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the Competitor looks like a DualSense controller, it remains to be seen if it'll <em>feel</em> like one. The overall ergonomics look almost identical to its primary inspiration, but the DualSense does feature nuanced haptic feedback features that aren't present in an Xbox controller.</p><p>While it can be used on a PC as well, so can a DualSense controller. The caveat here is that accessing DualSense features in a PlayStation game ported to a PC typically requires the controller to be tethered to your PC via USB-C, whereas on a PS5 console, you can still experience these features wirelessly. Anyone looking for something with more of a retro flair can also check out a previous collaboration between Hyperkin and Xbox, as the peripherals manufacturer revived the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited-x/dp/B09FYJF6XY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iconic Duke controller for modern Xbox systems</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, NetEase Games teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-teases-four-new-heroes-coming-to-the-game/1100-6528615/" data-ref-id="1100-6528615">the debut of the Fantastic Four</a>, the first post-launch heroes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a>. Now, the trailer for Marvel Rivals Season 1 has arrived, and it reveals that Marvel's first family of superheroes are facing an unexpected battle with the Lord of the Vampires, Count Dracula. It also appears that the FF may be among the few heroes left who can oppose him.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg2ea9O95bA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xg2ea9O95bA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As seen in the trailer, Dracula has personally taken Dr. Strange out of the picture. More alarmingly, Avengers Tower has fallen, and the familiar A logo on the side of the building has been turned into a V. Each member of the Fantastic Four is also showcased as they push back against Dracula's influence, but the FF won't have to hold back the darkness alone.</p><p>The story seems similar to Marvel's recently concluded Blood Hunt crossover, which also left the world enshrouded by darkness as vampires attempted to take over. In the game, Dracula and Doctor Doom achieved this result by disrupting the moon's orbit. New York City has already fallen, and the remaining heroes will stand "together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science."</p><p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will begin on January 10. And while Dracula doesn't appear to be playable, the FF will be added to the Marvel Rivals roster with more characters coming in the future.</p><p>Before the launch of Season 1, NetEase is giving away a free in-game chibi Galactica <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">to celebrate hitting 20 million players</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tejo-valorants-newest-agent-has-been-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Riot Games and VALORANT released information regarding the latest agent to be joining the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valorant-lands-on-consoles-soon-no-pc-crossplay-but-theres-cross-progression/">incredibly popular title</a>. Their name is Tejo, and he is a veteran intelligence consultant from Colombia who has a variety of abilities revolving around ballistics. If you want to see Tejo in action, make sure to check out the gameplay trailer below where you can see everything he has to offer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tejo Official Gameplay Reveal // VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRuRID5JoQY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, the commentary regarding the latest agent for VALORANT seems to be pretty positive, with many saying that he feels like he is a mix of pre-existing agents rolled into one as a powerful killer.</p>
<p>Like every other agent, he has four abilities which includes his Ultimate. These abilities are all showcased in the trailer above. However, we're going to run you through the abilities and what they do, so you can get confirmation on their functionality.</p>
<p>First up is Special Delivery, where you can equip a sticky grenade and fire it at your desired position. The grenade will then stick to the surface and explode after a short time, where any targets caught in the blast will become concussed. You can also alt fire the grenade so that it launches with a single bounce, rather than sticking in place.</p>
<p>Next is the Stealth Drone. You can equip and fire the drone to throw it forward, where you can then take control of its movement. Firing again allows you to trigger a pulse from the drone that Suppresses and Reveals any enemies that were hit by the pulse.</p>
<p>After that is the Guided Salvo, which allows Tejo to equip an AR targeting system. Firing allows you to select two locations on the map, with alt fire launching missiles on the target locations, and detonating as soon as they get to the planned spot.</p>
<p>Finally, Tejo's ultimate. He can utilize a tactical strike targeting map, where he can choose the origin point of the strike and then fire to unleash a heavy wave of explosions in his chosen destination.</p>
<p>However, Tejo is not the only thing coming to VALORANT, as a brand-new content type is being added to the game. This content is called Flex, where players can begin collecting handheld objects to show off their flair in battle. This is similar to the Spray Wheel, and can be equipped via Collections. As Flex is new <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the game</a>, players will receive a free Flex, with a second one becoming available in the upcoming Act I Battlepass.</p>

<p>The first new VALORANT agent of 2025 is <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1876282811667112298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">veteran ballistics expert Tejo</a>, who becomes the 26th agent to join the Riot shooter’s roster. Tejo is also the seventh agent under the initiator role, equipped with an explosive kit that overwhelms the opponent with ordinance. </p>



<p>Billed as a “veteran intelligence consultant from Colombia,” Riot says that the newest VALORANT agent Tejo is designed to “[pressure] the enemy to relinquish their ground – or their lives.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-tejo-s-abilities">What are Tejo’s abilities?</h2>



<p>The themes of Tejo’s ability kit are suppression and explosiveness. Like Fade and Sova, he doesn’t have a flash ability. But while those two are geared toward maximum information gathering, Tejo is a disruptive force who can wreak havoc on enemy setups.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Guide Salvo in action. Image credit: Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s how each of his abilities work:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Guided Salvo: </strong>Equip a tactical map, and like you’re placing Brimstone smokes, select two spots on the map. Activating the ability will send a self-guided missile to each of the two spots, detonating on arrival with a three-pulse explosion. Great for flushing enemies out of corners and hiding spots, and great for post-plants.</li>



<li><strong>Stealth Drone</strong>: Deploy a drone that you control for a limited time. The Drone controls like one of Skye’s Trailblazer tigers, and you can manually detonate it near an enemy to both suppress and reveal them.</li>



<li><strong>Special Delivery</strong>: Equip a sticky grenade that sticks to the surface and explodes, concussing enemies caught in the vicinity. You can normal fire the grenade to stick to the first surface it hits, or you can alt-fire with right-click to make it bounce once first.</li>



<li><strong>Armageddon</strong>: Tejo’s ultimate ability effectively calls in a super destructive airstrike that travels along a long corridor. Players bring up a tactical map, select a starting area, then use the mouse to choose the direction that Armageddon travels.</li>
</ul>



<p>Tejo will officially arrive in VALORANT on Tuesday, Jan. 7. Riot is also debuting a new cosmetic type called FLEX, which are unique handheld objects that players can interact with. There will be two available starting Jan. 7: one for free, and one in the paid track of the next battle pass. The next VALORANT act will start on Jan. 8.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Images of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons have allegedly leaked online, providing new details about the successor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/523194/article/rumor-leaked-joy-con-2-pics-confirmed-via-serial-number-and-it-fits-nexthandhelds-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NintendoSwitch2</a> subreddit features a post that has leaked images of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons from the Chinese online forum, Baidu Teiba. At first glance, players can spot several obvious changes, such as the larger SL and SR bumpers and new connectors. It seems the successor to the Switch will be ditching the rails for a new connector that will allow players to pop their Joy-Cons in instead of sliding them in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if you look closer, you will find a new addition to the Switch 2 Joy-Cons. The latest addition looks like some kind of sensor next to the new connector. Many players on the r/NintendoSwitch2 subreddit have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1huvbt9/the_mouse_theory_doesnt_seem_so_unreasonable_to_me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">theorised</a> that this might be a sensor that will allow players to turn their Joy-Con into a mouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, the overall Joy-Con is much bigger, with larger joysticks and triggers. Regarding the colour, the Joy-Con is covered with a matte-black casing and has a patch of blue near the connectors. The new images of the Joy-Con also match the Christmas Leak by <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NextHandhled</a>, where the alleged Switch 2 console also had connectors instead of rails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Nintendo Switch has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-passes-ps2-in-total-us-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed PlayStation 2 in total US sales</a>. Also, check out the Switch 2 design <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-dbrand-give-players-another-look-at-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was leaked earlier by Dbrand</a>.

As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wwe-2k24-now-the-only-game-in-the-series-with-online-functionality-as-2k23-servers-go-dark" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a>, WWE 2K23 goes dark today, January 6, 2025, when the servers are discontinued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. Players will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point. However if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes. The game itself and all VC (Virtual Currency), as well as DLC/Add-Ons, were pulled from sale in November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This also means WWE 2K23's PS5 and PS4 Platinum Trophy is unobtainable, the latest to fizzle out of existence with a server shutdown. Gamers have long called on the platform holders to mandate achievement and trophy changes upon a server shutdown so customers can still complete those challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k23-review">WWE 2K23 review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Though the Showcase mode isn’t as super as its subject, John Cena, the sharp focus on refinement instead of reinvention helps keep WWE 2K23 as the gold standard of wrestling sims."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">WWE 2K23’s server shutdown leaves last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</a> as the only game in the series with online functionality. The expectation is WWE 2K25 launches around March this year, but some fans are now debating the value in investing time in these games if they fail to last even a couple of years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher 2K has form when it comes to shutting down its sports games in the immediate years after release. 2022's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k23-next-gen-version">NBA 2K23</a>, for example, shut down in December 2024. Rival sports video game maker EA tends to keep the online portion of its games running longer than 2K, with FIFA and Madden servers often up and running years after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>"Darkness engulfs New York as the Timestream Entanglement leaves Doctor Strange trapped in the Entangled Astral Plane, scattering the Darkhold pages. Dracula and Doctor Doom disrupt the moon's orbit, plunging the city into eternal night and unleashing an army of vampiric creatures," reads the official blurb.</p><p>"With the world on the brink, the Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science.

<p>"NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-claims-2025-as-the-year-of-eevee<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
2025 will be the Year of Eevee, according to the Pokémon Company. 
</p>
<p>
Branding showing <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/year-of-eevee">Pokémon's Year of Eevee</a> is now live on the franchise's Pokémon Center site, alongside an array of merchandise featuring the cute creature and its many evolutions including plushies and action figures. 
</p>
<p>
The gimmick follows Nintendo previously declaring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-nintendos-year-of-luigi-continues-until-18th-march">2014 to be the Year of Luigi</a>, and Sega last year dubbing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-declares-2024-the-year-of-shadow-the-hedgehog">2024 to be the Year of Shadow the Hedgehog</a>.
</p>
<p>
On the surface, the Year of Eevee seems to be just a merchandise range, but the Pokémon Center often taps into themes for the coming year with merchandise that ties into the wider franchise.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>It's past time for a new Eeveelution. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Pokémon</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
So, what's in store for Pokémon fans this Year of Eevee? So far, all we know of 2025 is that it will see the launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the next mainline Pokémon game that will return to Kalos, the region based on Paris first seen in Pokémon X and Y. (And hey, that's where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> Fest is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2025-to-be-held-in-paris">being held this year</a>! How's that for brand synergy?)
</p><p>
Could the Year of Eevee finally see a new Eevee evolution announced, perhaps set to debut in Pokémon Legends: Z-A? It's now been 12 years since Eevee's eighth evolution option - the Fairy-type Sylveon - was announced, and fans have long hoped for more. A Dragon-type Eeveelution, perhaps? Or how about a Ghost-type?
</p>
<p>And what else could be on the way? C'mon, Pokémon - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-film-franchise-surpasses-1bn-in-global-box-office-revenue">Sega gave Shadow a movie</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
