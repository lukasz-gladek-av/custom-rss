			<p>Epic Games is preparing to launch Fortnitemares 2024, this year's edition of the Halloween event inside Fortnite. The latest gameplay trailer has provided a glimpse at the many collaborations featured in this event, leaving fans very excited about what will go live shortly.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Fortnitemares 2024 begins tomorrow morning after the server maintenance. The event will go live alongside version 31.40 and introduce playable characters from horror movies such as Leatherface from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-never-gonna-give-you-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a> and Billy from Saw. Moreover, Edward Scissorhands (from Tim Burton's 1990 masterpiece film) and a couple of Marvel characters (Venom and Mephisto) are also seen. Speaking of gameplay additions coming with Fortnitemares, players can look forward to an explosive pumpkin launcher weapon and Billy's Tricycle vehicle.</p>

<p>Over seven years after its debut, Fortnite Battle Royale continues to run strong, in addition to side games like LEGO Fortnite. Of course, it also helps that the Epic Games Store successfully <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on mobile, with Fortnite once again available in Europe to iOS players.</p>
<p>During the recent Unreal Fest, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-our-company-is-now-financially-sound-gamers-gravitate-towards-live-service-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<p><em>I'm happy to tell you that Epic is financially sound and that Fortnite and the Epic Game Store have hit new records in concurrency and success. Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users last holiday, an all-time peak. And this is all happening in the context of a game business that's rapidly changing in a way that we've only seen a few times in our lifetimes as game developers. It's a generational change. One of the manifestations we're seeing right now is a lot of games are released with high budgets, and they're not selling nearly as well as expected, whereas other games are growing incredibly strong. </em></p>
<p><em>When you look at what's happening in the world of Fortnite, it's new and it's exciting and it's something that's never happened at this scale in the history of entertainment, with an original story that's evolving with original content and also all the world's brands participating. Musicians reaching users, Disney and Star Wars, and others all coming together to create a world-class entertainment experience that's ever-evolving and live, and that's that's really what we think that the future of gaming is about.</em></p>
<p>Fortnite will be a key component even in the upcoming Disney-themed persistent universe that Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested</a> $1.5 billion in. Epic Games EVP Saxs Persson <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> a few days ago that players will have the opportunity to move seamlessly from Fortnite to the Disney 'metaverse' and vice versa.</p>

            <p>After a hard day's editing articles about three Disco Elysium spiritual successors - each <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">more</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">politically</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">outspoken</a> than the last, in a kind of Sophisticated Pooh collage of escalating Marxism - I like to kick back with a nice chill game about Lovecraftian space monsters. </p>
<p>That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.</p><!--more-->
<p>In Starless Abyss you play a Proxima, the possibly-human agent of a motley crew of scientists and occultists called Counter Horror. There are five Proximas in all, each with different skills and attributes. There are over 160 cards to discover, divided between six faction groupings, and each campaign run spans three acts with several randomly selected bosses. Visually, it's a writhing pixelart buffet of toothy tentacles and flying eyeballs and spacetime rifts, set to menacing chipset. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>And here's a touch more detail on how you'll and expand and tune up your fleet. This being a labour of Lovecraft, it's of no huge surprise to learn that you can prevail over the monsters by driving yourself absolutely mad.</p>
<blockquote><p>Start your run playing 'Lucid Proxima' and command a fleet of ships through battle across the universe. Successful missions reward you with new artifacts to upgrade your ships, D.I.C.E to help sway pivotal moments between missions or cards from different factions, which can be collected, combined and combo-ed to help destroy the eldritch beasts. Beware though! The closer you get to the ultimate Outer Gods, the more your Proxima's sanity depletes. Or embrace your insanity and harness the power of the occult using annihilating Ritual Cards to take down your opposition. </p></blockquote>
<p>It's out in 2025 - here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167970/Starless_Abyss/">the Steam page with more</a>. I'm kind of burned out on sci-fi deckbuilders after Breachway, but as a Homeworld: Cataclysm cultist, I do like me some cosmic body horror in space. If you like the cut of these screaming entrails, may I also recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2169930/Rtype_Tactics_I_o_II_Cosmos/">R-Type Tactics</a>?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Tuulik was part of the punk collective that grew from this group of friends to the studio that delivered <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/disco-elysium"><u>Disco Elysium</u></a> to critical acclaim and commercial success almost five years ago to this day.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/disco-1728654712065.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Disco Elysium. Image credit: ZA/UM.</figcaption></figure></output><p>But Tuulik left ZA/UM in acrimonious circumstances after being laid off in February amid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaum-reportedly-cancels-disco-elysium-expansion-at-risk-of-lay-offs">what was reportedly the cancelation of a Disco Elysium standalone spin-off</a>. On his way out, Tuulik alleged "incompetence and injustice" at the studio.</p><p>Tuulik told IGN he’s starting a “revolutionary new RPG studio” and has got a number of key disco Elyisum developers to join his cause. Here’s the makeup of the studio as it stands today, October 11, with more people said to be coming on board in the coming weeks.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina, who were among the five writers of Disco Elysium</li><li>Lenval Brown, a voice actor known for his voice work on Disco Elysium</li><li>Dora Klindžić, who was a principal writer in ZA/UM</li><li>Anastasia Ivanova, who was a senior concept artist in ZA/UM</li><li>Michael Oswell, who was the graphic designer at ZA/UM</li><li>And Aleksandar Gavrilović, who was the managing director of game developer studio Gamechuck</li></ul><p>It’s worth noting that neither Robert Kurvitz, the lead writer and designer of Disco Elysium and founding member of ZA/UM, nor Aleksander Rostov, who was art director on Disco Elysium, are currently involved with either Summer Eternal, Dark Math Games, Longdue Games, Red Info (see below), or ZA/UM itself. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-developers-involuntarily-left-zaum-responds"><u>Both were fired from ZA/UM</u></a> in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct, and are now reportedly making a new game of their own at a studio called Red Info, which is backed by Chinese internet company NetEase.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Often forgotten in this money lust are the creatives themselves...</p></div><p>“We must be living at the dawn of a cultural Golden Age, when like mushrooms after rain the companies promising ‘the next Disco Elysium’ are popping up every hour on the hour,” read a statement from Summer Eternal.</p><p>“It’s a sure sign that the fifth anniversary of the release of this monumental game is approaching and every corporation wants a piece of the fortune.</p><p>“However, often forgotten in this money lust are the creatives themselves, first instrumentalized for press releases and afterwards underpaid, silenced, bullied, sued, abused… But it is all of us – the creatives, the workers, the players – who should be holding control over the means of our creation and who should be celebrated on this day.</p><p>“Therefore, we announce today our own vision of a worker-owned co-operative, a complex structure that will ensure that not only moneylenders but every worker, every creative, even every player, has a seat at the table.”</p><p>Summer Eternal has opened the doors to its <a href="https://summereternal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, which contains a manifesto for game development that wouldn’t be out of place in Disco Elysium itself and word of an incoming crowdfunding campaign.</p><p>“I believe that the last time around we made something genre-breaking,” Tuulik said. “Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that. The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged — for five fucking years I've been waiting to put them to use. So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind — let's do it fresh from the start, but this time let's not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Let's do it fresh from the start, but this time let's not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops.</p></div><p>That choice quote above is a reference to ZA/UM’s high-profile collapse following the release of Disco Elysium back in 2019. Some background for the uninitiated: Disco Elysium is a narrative role-playing game developed and published by controversial studio ZA/UM. Gameplay revolves around navigating dialogue trees rather than combat, with each of the 24 skills representing a different aspect of the amnesiac detective protagonist's abilities and thoughts. The player is free to support or suppress his ideologies as they work through the story. Disco Elysium is considered by some among the greatest video games ever made.</p><p>It went on to enjoy enormous success, winning numerous game of the year awards and selling millions of copies. A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-tv-adaptation-announced-from-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-producer"><u>TV series adaptation deal</u></a> followed, as did the release of an expanded version of the game featuring full voice acting and new content subtitled The Final Cut. A follow-up seemed all but guaranteed, but after high-profile staff exits and subsequent messy legal tussles brought ZA/UM to its knees, what might have turned out to be a Disco Elysium sequel was canceled.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>XXX NIGHTSHIFT Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Fast forward to today, October 11, 2024, and the cusp of Disco Elysium’s five-year anniversary, and we now have multiple spin-off studios laying claim to the spiritual successor throne. One of these, Dark Math Games' XXX NIGHTSHIFT, is a 'true detective RPG' that looks remarkably similar to Disco Elysium, even down to the isometric perspective and dialogue text that moves up the right-hand side of the screen as the player makes choices and hears voice actors bring a narrator and the protagonist’s internal monologue to life.</p><p>When asked how he felt about this rapid-fire emergence of new Disco Elysium spin-off studios all saying they're making spiritual successors, Tuulik told IGN: “You know the scene from Lord of the Rings, where Arwen is taking Frodo to Rivendell with the ringwraiths giving chase horseback and right before the river scene you finally see all nine ride together to stop Frodo? It's kind of like that.”</p><p>So what, exactly, is Summer Eternal building? Tuulik says it has a complex structure involving co-operatives with not only full time workers but also freelancers and part-time collaborators, and even a player-ownership of a game studio aspect. It will take some time to set up, he said. There are no assets for the video game Summer Eternal is working on, but Tuulik did tell IGN about it in vague terms. In short, it's "definitely not a Disco Elysium sequel," but it will be a role-playing game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/screenshot-2024-10-11-151300-1728656077537.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Summer Eternal's website presents visits with a clip of a prairie fire. Image credit: Summer Eternal.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"What I can say is that here in Summer Eternal we share a belief that role-playing games are the pinnacle expression of current human culture - something every other discipline can contribute," Tuulik said. "Art-form of the century. And we have found a way to combine role-playing with serious, funny, moving, narratives in a way that allows us artists to express ourselves in a unprecedented way. When one day I'll come to you with news of something, it will be a role-playing game."</p><p>"It will definitely not be a Disco Elysium sequel!" Tuulik continued. "It is time to break away from the past and start a new chapter. It will be a completely new setting and story with new mechanics. But end of the day we are who we are and RPGs are what we will make - do what you will with it :)"</p><p>Tuulik even had a message for his former colleagues (“comrades”) at ZA/UM, including Kurvitz and Rostov:</p><p>“To all other former respected comrades (Kurvitz, Rostov, everyone) – long time no hear, but we would love for you to join the struggle as well: time to roll up our sleeves and start building communism!”</p><p>As for ZA/UM, it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaum-reportedly-cancels-disco-elysium-expansion-at-risk-of-lay-offs"><u>reportedly canceled a standalone expansion for Disco Elysium back in February</u></a>, leaving several staff members at risk of losing their jobs.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
Ahead of new California legislation requiring storefronts to make it clear customers are only buying a license for digital content rather than outright owning it, Steam has implemented a message at the point of purchase doing just that.
</p>
<p>
California's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/buying-digital-games-means-youre-just-purchasing-a-license-california-will-force-storefronts-to-admit">new legislation</a>, which was signed into law by governor Gavin Newsom at the end of September, is intended to make consumers more aware of the sometimes-temporary nature of digital ownership. It explicitly prohibits sellers from using the words "buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good" - instead requiring them to display a "clear and conspicuous statement" explaining the nature of their transaction.
</p>
<p>
And while the legislation, officially known as <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426">AB 2426</a>, doesn't formally comes into effect until next year, Valve has already tweaked Steam's shopping cart to highlight customers are buying a license - with the changes being displayed internationally, including in the UK. Steam's shopping cart now features a short message below the 'Continue to payment' button, reading, "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam." That's followed by a link to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, containing additional information.

<p>
California's new legislation doesn't apply to games offered as part of a subscription service, to games "sold" or given away for free, or to games that can be downloaded and played permanently offline. That hasn't stopped GOG, a storefront known for its commitment to DRM-free games, from getting a bit cheeky in light of Steam's changes.
</p><p>
"Since checkout banners are trending," the company wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435">post on social media</a>, "we're thinking of putting one up ourselves." It included a GOG shopping cart mockup appended with a new message of its own: "A purchase of a digital product on GOG grants you its Offline Installers, <strong>which cannot be taken away from you</strong>."

Legislation AB 2426 follows several high profile instances of games being yanked from owners' libraries in recent times. Ubisoft made headlines earlier this year after it began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">quietly revoking players' licenses to The Crew</a>, and PlayStation opted to withdraw access to PS5 shooter Concord (albeit while providing refunds) after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">announcing it was shutting servers down</a>.
</p>
<p>
The controversy caused by Ubisoft's decision in particular led to revitalised discourse around video games preservation, and the establishment of Stop Killing Games - an initiative aiming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">mount political and legal challenges</a> to the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable. And while legislation such as AB 2426 doesn't fix the issue at its root, it does at least seek to better inform consumers ahead of a purchase.

The shop updates with new items as you increase your player level, and that includes new characters. <strong>Every unlockable fighter should be in the shop once you’ve reached Player Level 20</strong>.</p><p>One of the quickest ways to increase your player level is to wish for it when using a Shenron summon. This boosted me up to level 8 and updated the Shop quite a bit. You can also wish this with a Super Shenron Summon for an even bigger boost, but there’s arguably a better use for that dragon that I’ll be going over soon.</p><p>I also want to reiterate that although you can just buy them all in the shop, there’s always an alternative. Aside from the eventual DLC characters and Goku (Mini), the latter of whom is exclusive to the pre-order pack, you can unlock everyone through other means.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-recommend-id="image://3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A results screen after clearing the Saiyan Arc Chapter in Episode Battles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A results screen after clearing the Saiyan Arc Chapter in Episode Battles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-recommend-id="image://3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A results screen after clearing the Saiyan Arc Chapter in Episode Battles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you don’t want to grind out money for the shop, your next best option is to unlock them through the Episode Battles. That’s right,<strong> you can acquire a bunch of these fighters for free just by playing through <em>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</em>’s version of story mode.</strong><br></p><p>This is certainly the most efficient method to get more characters. You’ll unlock them naturally as you progress through the story, all the while increasing your player level and earning Zeni to use at the shop for even more characters. Unless there’s someone you immediately want to unlock and use, I suggest getting most of your roster this way. It’s better to save your Zeni for any extra Costumes or Ability Items.</p><p>Be prepared to dive into some branching path fights as well. What-if battles have been a hallmark of this series for a long time so of course they’ve returned for this entry.

That can only mean one thing: It’s October, the spookiest month of the year. And soon Halloween will arrive and, as in past years, that means creepy characters, horror icons, and other villainous baddies will be arriving in <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1844747650731479348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1844747650731479348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On October 11</a></span>, Epic posted a new trailer for Fortnightmares 2024, showing off some of the new skins, locations, and items that will be a part of this year’s spooky event. Here’s the trailer: </p><p>Some of the characters in the new trailer, which leaked earlier today, had previously been datamined and reported on before the official reveal. For example, we knew Leatherface and Billy The Puppet (from the <em>Saw </em>movies) were coming to <em>Fortnite </em>as Epic had teased them before and leaks had indicated such earlier this month. </p><p>However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844654208730943909&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844654208730943909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Scissorhands</a></span> was a surprise. The eponymous star of Tim Burton’s classic 1990 film is seen briefly in the trailer carving some ice, indicating that they will be available to buy and play as in the update. </p><p>Also new this year are the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844643370141979053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844643370141979053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playable chainsaw</a></span>s. These appear to be melee weapons that can also be used as pseudo-vehicles by carving into the ground and scooting around at high speed. The chainsaws will go perfectly with this year’s new Leatherface skin. <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> killer loves a good automated chain with saw blades. </p><p>This trailer also gives us our first real look at three Disney villains appearing in <em>Fortnite</em>: Cruella DeVille, Captain Hook, and Maleficent.

                <p>The biggest digital store for PC games on the planet, Steam, has updated its interface to include a disclaimer warning people that buying a game doesn't mean you "own" it in the traditional sense.</p><p>A new banner on the site states, "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam."

The law comes as questions have arisen in recent years regarding what "ownership" means in a world increasingly dominated by digital products.</p><p>"As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important," California Assembly member Jacqui Irwin said <a href="https://a42.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240916-assemblymember-irwin-urges-governor-sign-legislation-increasing" rel="nofollow ">in a press release</a>.</p><p>California's law is set to go into effect in 2025, but it appears Steam is getting ahead of it by issuing the disclaimer now. Presumably other digital storefronts for games will follow at some point in the future.</p><p>The new law aims to help consumers better understand how digital licenses operate--but it doesn't prevent companies from yanking access to content people already purchased. For example, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed The Crew from players' libraries</a> after the servers shut down.</p><p>Developers often close servers for older games as player populations fall, but it's less common for games to be removed from libraries entirely.

It was a free game, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4s-with-pre-installed-pt-listed-on-ebay-for-as-m/1100-6426971/" data-ref-id="1100-6426971">some believed they'd be able to play it forever. </a></p>

"The documentary asks what is this space? How do we use it now and what else is possible inside it? Can we transport this ancient story inside a brand new one? And will it still make sense? The cinematic potential of Los Santos is immediately apparent, with its glittering, mind-blowingly detailed cityscape and surrounding countryside, the ray-traced rendering of light, ever-changing weather systems and intricate sound design."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4383219-goodnightsweetprince.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383219" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4383219-goodnightsweetprince.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383219"></a><figcaption>'Wasted'?

        <p>With a worker's co-operative structure that includes a "voice of the gamers"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">two</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> "spiritual successors" you read about today were but filthy pretenders, or at best, the thesis and antithesis resulting in this afternoon's triumphant synthesis.* The <em>real</em> Disco Elysium spiritual successor is whatever they're making at Summer Eternal, a just-announced "art collective/RPG studio" founded by a group of, once more with feeling, former Disco Elysium developers.</p>
<p>The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The former Disco Elysium devs in question are writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina. They're joined by several other ZA/UM alumni: former principal writer Dora Klindžić, former senior concept artist Anastasia Ivanova, and former graphic designer Michael Oswell. Confirmed as not involved are former Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov, who aren't involved with at least one of the other "spiritual successor" studios either.</p>
<p>Summer Eternal don't have a named game project yet. Rather, they're currently looking "to gather authors, writers, designers who previously worked together on Disco Elysium, as well as new talent, all of us who have yearned to work together on something completely fresh and original, and create a liberating space for us and other veteran RPG developers to finally, after many years, collectively start innovating again in this game space". 
</p><p>
Whatever their eventual RPG project proves to be, Summer Eternal are broadly aiming to do what they feel Disco Elysium did, and smash all precedents to pieces. "I believe that the last time around we made something genre-breaking," writes Argo Tuulik on <a href="https://summereternal.com/">the studio's site</a> (which, let me tell you, is <em>really hard to read and digest at short notice</em>). "Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that.</p>
<p>"The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged - for five fucking years I've been waiting to put them to use," he continues. "So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind - let's do it fresh from the start, but this time let's not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad."
</p>
<p>
The website has a blogpost about Summer Eternal's internal structure written by Aleksandar Gavrilović, who is also managing director of Gamechuck. It begins by outlining how Summer Eternal will compromise with capitalism's many vultures, while pursuing their own vision for a socialist co-op. "The dream is simple to explain: create games, push boundaries, and reinvest the fruits of our artistic labour back into the creation of more art, the thing we are alive for on this earth," Gavrilović writes. "However, to be able to work on games, these labour intensive works of art, we need capital, in droves. 
</p>
<p>
"On the one hand, private capital (sometimes in the cloak of "patrons of the arts") has been the preferred shortcut to funding the riskier segment of the arts," he continues. "On the other hand, capital will always prioritise profit over sustainability and artistic expression, leading to various budgetary and creative conflicts. Thus, the question of organisation becomes a question of the balance of power in this dangerous dance."</p><p>Long story short: Summer Eternal plan to open a shareholding company on 1st April 2025, which will distribute shares between four entities within the studio - each with the power to call assemblies and vote on policy, and each with its own revenue-share model. The full-time creative team for their first game will get 50% of the shares, "managed equally" among co-op members, rather than distributed individually. Workers who aren't part of the above "creative co-op of full-time workers", such as outsourcers, will get 25% of shares, distributed according to a structure that permits "capital returns by a system of individual capital accounts".  
</p>
<p>
A further 20% of shares will go to a limited liability company for investors: once Summer Eternal's game is released, this LLC will have a revenue-share model, similar to standard publishing contracts. And the final 5% of shares? That'll go to a non-profit organisation that accepts membership from people who buy Summer Eternal's games. This in-house "voice of the gamers" will be able to use its share of revenues "to organise events, support union-work, or whatever their assembly (comprised of all members) decides on", in addition to being able to summon general assemblies with the other three groups to discuss Summer Eternal's direction.
</p>
<p>
In case you missed this morning's write-ups, Summer Eternal's founders have had their thunder stolen by the early announcement of two other Disco Elys'um ups - Longdue's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">untitled "psychogeography RPG"</a> and Dark Math's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xxx-nightshift">XXX Nightshift</a>. The press release makes bracingly salty mention of this. It suggests that one or both of the other, would-be claimants to the Disco throne are just corporate parasites attempting to cash in on the legacy.</p>
<p>"We must be living at the dawn of a cultural Golden Age, when like mushrooms after rain the companies promising 'the next Disco Elysium' are popping up every hour on the hour," it comments. "It's a sure sign that the 5th anniversary of the release of this monumental game is approaching and every corporation wants a piece of the fortune.
</p><p>
"However, often forgotten in this money lust are the creatives themselves, first instrumentalized for press releases and afterwards underpaid, silenced, bullied, sued, abused..."  it goes on. "But it is all of us - the creatives, the workers, the players - who should be holding control over the means of our creation and who should be celebrated on this day."</p>
<p>The part about mistreating creatives may also refer to the bitter battle between ZA/UM studio management and key staff like Kurvitz and writer Helen Hindpere after Disco Elysium's release. Nic has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">a summary for you here</a>. And with that, I am officially calling a moratorium on Disco Elysium spiritual successors until next week at least.</p>

Given how people hate being surprised by romance, whether because they’re forced into a relationship or accidentally stumble into one, you should know <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> does have some romantic storylines that sneak up on you.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For much of its run, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a pretty sexless game. Most of its relationships are platonic and built upon a shared cause, learning its many fantasy cultures, or helping folks through political turmoil. But there’s not a lot of smooching. In fact, I’m having trouble remembering if there are any scenes in <em>Metaphor</em> in which lips are locked. But that doesn’t mean love can’t bloom— whether you like it or not.<br></p><p>There are two follower bonds that gesture toward romantic interest between your protagonist and the woman involved. Junah, the songstress companion you’ll recruit around midway through the game, and Eupha, the summoner who you’ll meet shortly after. Junah’s is mostly flirtatious, whereas Eupha’s has a full-blown confession of love (albeit couched in the lore and culture of her people, the Mustari). To be clear, you don’t have to play into either relationship if that’s not how you want to roleplay. However, Eupha’s story specifically did end in a way that felt more forced, with an interaction between me and her protective brother nudging my protagonist as if there was a budding flame between me and the summoner despite my not leaning into it earlier in the game. Again, I played dumb to the best of my ability, having headcanoned that my hero had been holding a crush for the swordsman Strohl the whole game, but it does seem like <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> has a relationship in mind, and doesn’t let you outright turn it down. You can still headcanon this as an awkward interaction with her brother who knows Eupha has feelings for you, whether you’ve reciprocated or not. But the implication remains.</p><p>If you don’t want to mess with that at all, you could always just not finish Eupha’s follower bond. This was how many people handled <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-romance-social-yukari-mitsuru-fuuka-1851206843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-romance-social-yukari-mitsuru-fuuka-1851206843"><em>Persona 3</em>’s relationships</a></span> when the original game wouldn’t let you finish any social links with female characters without entering a romantic relationship with them. It’s not as overt as those, but it does harken back to that same weirdness that I thought we’d gotten past. Suppose you wanted to make Eupha or Junah the canon love interest, would it not have been easier to codify it somehow in the story, not shove it into optional relationships that can take a player by surprise? Do with this information what you will, I just didn’t want everyone to be ambushed by an unexpected romance like I was if they didn’t have to be.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-now-shows-that-you-dont-actually-own-the-game-youre-buying/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The next time you buy a game on Steam, it’ll be clear that you won’t actually be buying the game. A recent update on Steam now shows players that instead of buying a game, all they are purchasing is a license.</p>



<p>“A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam,” the message reads along with a link to Steam’s subscriber agreement.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The update comes just after <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">California signed a bill into law</a> that requires digital storefronts to clearly state when media being purchased  is only a license to access. The new law applies to all digital works such as music, movies, TV shows, ebooks, and video games.</p>



<p>“As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important,” California Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin said in a release at the time via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>. “I thank the Governor for signing AB 2426, ensuring the false and deceptive advertising from sellers of digital media incorrectly telling consumers they own their purchases becomes a thing of the past.”</p>



<p>The law goes into effect in 2025. </p>



<p>As of writing, Steam is the only storefront to show this disclaimer. Neither the Xbox Store, nor PlayStation Store, nor Epic Games Store display this same notice when going to purchase a game from the stores. It’s unclear when that update will come, but it should be expected to happened.</p>



<p>What do you think of Steam telling players that the game they are buying is just a license and doesn’t constitute ownership? Let us know below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/923/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

Melee.</h2></div><section><p>In one of his final videos as part of the "Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games" YouTube series, Smash Bros. Masahiro creator offered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2wYKkqhkG0&amp;t=94s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">touching tribute to his friend and former boss Satoru Iwata</a>, who served as Nintendo president from 2002 until his death in 2015.</p><p>"It wouldn't be right to end this channel without touching on this topic," Sakurai wrote on X/Twitter.</p><p>Sakurai, who opened the channel to talk about his experiences developing games, worked with Iwata at HAL Laboratory before the latter moved to Nintendo in 2000 as the head of corporate planning. Sakurai shares several touching memories over the course of the 10 minute video, including their first job interview, how Iwata helped come up with the title of Super Smash Bros., and the last time they saw one another.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light">— 桜井 政博 / Masahiro Sakurai (@Sora_Sakurai) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1844695310091841666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While Iwata's management role typically kept him far away from development, he nevertheless played a key role in Smash Bros. Melee's development by contributing his expertise as a programmer and solving numerous bugs. Sakurai also remembers how Iwata came up with the "brothers" part of Super Smash Bros., which was meant to convey that the characters weren't actually fighting, but friends solving a little disagreement.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Mr. Iwata was truly the person who understood me best</p></div><p>Sakurai goes on to recall his shock at Iwata succeeding Hiroshi Yamauchi as Nintendo president, calling it "frankly unimaginable" that a comparative outsider should take over what had been a family-owned business for generations after just two years with the company. Nevertheless, he said, Iwata proved to be a major force at Nintendo, contributing numerous ideas such as the Iwata Asks series, the concept of the Nintendo Direct, and more.</p><p>Sakurai finishes by remembering their final drive together, and how they had planned to meet again later that year before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/nintendo-ceo-satoru-iwata-has-passed-away">Iwata suddenly passed away in July</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/mr-iwata-grab-bag-youtube-0-8-36-1728659112340.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Masahiro Sakurai recalls the last time he saw Satoru Iwata. Image source: Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Mr. Iwata was truly the person who understood me best," Sakurai said. "He was full of virtue, relentlessly hardworking, committed to service, and a man who changed the games industry. If I hadn't met Mr. Iwata at the start of my career, I'd probably be off doing something completely different." </p><p>Iwata's influence continues to be felt in games even now, close to a decade after his death. Just this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-latest-in-long-line-of-weird-nintendo-hardware-some-failed-hard">Nintendo released Alarmo</a>, an idea that was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-has-a-fascinating-connection-to-late-nintendo-president-satoru-iwata">near and dear to Iwata's heart</a>. An Echoes of Wisdom easter egg also seemingly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/reggie-incredibly-touched-by-apparent-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reference-to-friendship-with-satoru-iwata">paid tribute to his friendship with former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>, </p><p>Sakurai's tribute to Iwata is one of his final videos as he winds down his YouTube channel, which started in 2022 and has 589,000 subscribers. He says that he continues to make games for the time being, but his next project is currently unknown.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/devil-s-terminal-how-we-made-one-mystery-have-many-answers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What are we working on?"><span>What are we working on?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Devil’s Terminal</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a mystery coming of age story about a loser teen plagued by a controlling voice. The story takes place at Guidance Spiritual Retreat, a camp that promises to exorcize the problem out of “problem children.” The MC (Main Character) meets four fellow troubled kids, the camp's shady owner, a lively counselor, a quirky medium, and an omniscient computer that promises to guide the MC out of their loserdom.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Soon (like 30 minutes in), it becomes obvious that the camp is not what it seems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There was some sort of cult here…</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The computer seems to accurately predict the future….</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The five kids weren’t brought here by accident…</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These are just a bunch of “objective” facts. We wanted the player to decide what those facts mean to them, because, in our opinion, facts never stay “objective” for long.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We made the MC have “filters”—lenses through which they experience the world. Much like in real life, perception shapes the MC’s understanding of reality. This means the challenge now wasn't just tracking what the MC knows, but also how that knowledge is interpreted. This makes our concept uniquely cool to us, and, unfortunately, a unique pain in the ass to write.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is our goal?"><span>What is our goal?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sweet spot between a gripping, guided narrative and an open-feeling structure is an elusive thing that many games never find. We want the best of both: tons of freedom, but every piece of content has to hit hard and feel relevant. We want the player to choose the experience they would want and then give it to them the way they want it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we entered the active writing phase, it became clear that manually tracking the multitude of available facts was insanely hard. The MC keeps uncovering new clues; each clue can be interpreted differently depending on the MC's perspective; the reactions to the same clues can vary for each character; what the MC knows and believes constantly reshapes the paths available to them. Trying to manage all those branches manually wasn’t just impractical, it would also lead to a worse game overall.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is where our attempt to design a new Detective System came in. It would help us curate the experience of each player while hiding the puppet strings behind the curtain. The system had three key goals:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Accounting for perspectives:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The same fact will mean different things to different players. The same falling brick can be a result of a curse, an unfortunate accident, or even an attempted murder. We wanted the players to interpret things through different lenses—like skepticism or mysticism. It’s unsatisfying to tell a skeptic that they are up against supernatural demons, and for a mystic, it would suck to learn that their spells are stupid and don’t fit inside a realistic setting. So we let our player pick a lane and then make the story fit them, not the other way around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Structuring the clues:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We had to organize all the facts the MC gathers into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Threads</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—groups of related clues or questions they’re curious about. Then we need to track which facts are known to which character at which point. Every one of those threads needs to fit into each possible theory. You can learn everything there is to know about a person, and then you can decide if what you’ve learned points to them being a lunatic or a prophet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Making writing manageable:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> To keep the writers sane (in reality, it still makes ‘em crazy), we needed a system that would track all available story branches, what the MC has learned, how they decided to view it, and how the arcs of other characters were affected by those choices. When the MC learns something, the player decides how they will view it and who they will tell about it—all that needs to be tracked.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now let’s look at one example of an “objective” fact and track its transformation throughout the plot. “What is the connection between the camp and the cult that used to be here?” This seems like a good question to start with.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Accounting for perspectives"><span>Accounting for perspectives</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The MC’s perspectives:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Players view facts through different lenses, which then shape the conclusions they draw. This adds flexibility and lets the players mold the story with their own spicy or minty takes. We call these perspectives </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rails</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rails</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Occult:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The occultist sees everything as a spiritual journey. They are one with the universe. The universe is observing itself. From this observation, things manifest into our lowly physical world. People and things are just as real as demons, gods, and magic spells. But also, nothing is real. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Occultist</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> embraces all things weird, understands the world deeply, and also not at all. This is the path of enlightenment and cosmic horror.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To an occultist, any connection between the camp and cult is a certainty.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has launched to the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' highest Steam player count ever, and it's not even a close call.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco and Spike Chunsoft's latest&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighter launched just yesterday, but at time of writing, it's already hit a Steam player count <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">high of 122,554</a>, and that's with the weekend yet to come.</p>
<p>That's easily enough to dethrone its nearest competitor in the franchise,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>, which has an all-time Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/678950/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">player peak of 44,303</a>. That total is not to be sniffed at, but&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has left it in the dust.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-highest-steam-count-series-goku.jpg?itok=qj-RTmBB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-highest-steam-count-series-goku.jpg?itok=zT-8vH3G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Picture Goku as&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>and his opponent as every other&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>game on Steam thus far.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>also comes out ahead of other&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>games like&nbsp;<em>Xenoverse</em>, its sequel, and ill-fated&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>-style mobile game&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: The Breakers</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, according to SteamDB,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is currently Bandai Namco's third best-performing game of all time on Steam, second only to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>
<p>It's pretty close between&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>, too, with the latter achieving a peak Steam player count of 129,975 across its entire lifetime. I'm betting that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>beats that total by the time the weekend is through.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>pulls out pretty far in front with almost a million concurrent players, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">staggering popularity</a> of that game, I don't think&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>should feel too worried about its success.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, it's actually the fourth game in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>series, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/yakuza-like-dragon">pulling a&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/yakuza-like-dragon">Like a Dragon</a>&nbsp;</em>by adopting the Japanese title (since the games were released in Japan under the name&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z: Sparking!</em>).</p>
<p>The game boasts more than 180 playable characters, "heart-pounding, high-speed 3D battles", and a feature by which you can create your own&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>battles and share them with like-minded fans around the world.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790600/DRAGON_BALL_Sparking_ZERO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/9N7XMJJHNFC3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<p>The Axis Unseen launches on October 22 for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-axis-unseen-439821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>, and Insider Gaming has an exclusive first look and walkthrough at never-before-seen gameplay.</p>



<p>The gameplay comes from our interview with The Axis Unseen creator Nate Purkeypile. It takes place in a region in the game called “The Darkness” about halfway through the game, and features a couple unique monsters, including one you can only see out of your player’s peripheral vision. It’s also terrifying as it has teeth for eyes.</p>



<p>Check out the gameplay below. You can also check out the full interview for yourself. In the interview, Purkeypile talks about the game’s development, a potential console release, future updates, and more.</p>



<p>A demo for The Axis Unseen is available on Steam.</p>

<h2 id="h-about-the-axis-unseen">About The Axis Unseen</h2>



<p>“The Axis Unseen is a heavy metal horror game,” the game’s description reads. “Hunt nightmarish monsters from ancient folklore in a mysterious open world, collecting their enhanced sense powers and discovering elemental arrows. Beware, the hunter is also the hunted.”</p>



<p>There is also an original heavy metal soundtrack composed by Clifford Meyer of the post-metal bands Red Sparowes and ISIS.</p>



<p>Other features of the game include, per Just Purkey Games:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unique Arrow Types</strong> – Your bow and arrow keeps you alive. Upgrade your bow or even find different arrow types such as fire, wind controlling or time distorting arrows. Experiment to see all of the different ways the arrows can interact with each other, such as wind arrows making the fire spread faster.</li>



<li><strong>Improve your senses</strong> – Upgrade your senses with the powers of the creatures. See scent particles. Feel the warmth left behind on their tracks. See colors that no human has ever seen.</li>



<li><strong>Uncover the secrets of the hunters</strong> – Find out what happened to the hunters who came before you and what secrets they uncovered by inspecting their journals and drawings. Where did this world come from? How do you stop the creatures from escaping into your world?</li>
</ul>

Check back later to take your own deep dive in the Fat Babies archives.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hello dear readers. Chris is out this month for some well-deserved R&amp;R, leaving the pilot's seat open for me to come in and steer the good ship </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/patch-notes-4-strange-scaffold-rejected-a-culture-of-hope-to-resurrect-i-am-your-beast">Patch Notes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Today, we're going to take a strange trip through game development history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was working on a completely unrelated story a couple weeks ago when a source I was speaking with casually asked me "you remember 'Fat Babies,' right?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fat Babies? The name was so outlandish I thought for a moment I was being played. But nope. I dug through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001019024348/http://www.fatbabies.com/">The Internet Archive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and discovered there was indeed a game developer's gossip hub called Fat Babies, and it was incredibly unhinged.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How else could I describe it? Where in 2024 would you find a website where bloggers spilled industry gossip, developers argued viciously on forums, and the site hosts took regular swipes at Democrats? The site appears to have sprung up in late 1999, meaning Game Developer (née Gamasutra) was up and running by that point, but this was an entirely different beast. One part Perez Hilton, one part 4chan, one part job board, this was a site fully of its day and age.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our goal is to be the premier site for gaming gossip," wrote anonymous contributor "FatSlicky," whose real identity is still unknown to this day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have a number of 'insiders' within the industry who are eagerly reporting back here with their gaming news—everything from slipped release schedules, cancelled projects, budget overruns, internal team conflicts, and key personnel hirings and firings."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tab over to the "musings" section of the site though and you'll see why developers like Playable Worlds co-founder Raph Koster have "bad memories" of Fat Babies. He explained in an email to Game Developer that a site contributor put him in their crosshairs and reached out to his coworkers in search of "dirt," later posting personal attacks about his character. "I got a pile of emails from coworkers saying 'Fatbabies sucks, you’re not like that,' he said highlighting that the site's toxicity didn't represent everyone in the video game business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not hard to dig up other vicious messages shared by the site's operators—some elevated from the forums (which weren't preserved by The Archive), giving us a snapshot of what some of the gossip looked like. The attacks on designers like Ion Storm level designer Stevie Case by contributor "FatMamaCita" feel particularly gross now that she's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/10/stevie-case-vs-the-world-gaming-industry-sexism">told her story</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about the sexism that sent her out of the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, for all the bile, Fat Babies was a rare source for developers to hear about the industry from other developers. "We didn't have any way of keeping in touch—there were no subreddits, social media leaks, Linkedin, Blind, any places that insiders could talk or share info anonymously," recalled former Wargaming and Sony Interactive Entertainment executive Scott Hartsman. "There was no such thing as ambient internet information yet."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "rumors" tab is filled with loads of single-sourced rumors, many of which didn't age well. That's because they either turned out to be not true or because they were tinged with drive-by racism. It's also the tab that documented a spree of layoffs at companies like Sierra Online, Electronic Arts, Eidos, etc. There's a good chance that was the only way for some developers to hear about that kind of news—and Hartsman said sometimes it was the only way you'd learn about goings-on at your own employer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine being a worker at Westwood given the chance to see </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010910023513/http://fatbabies.com/story_ww-email1.jpg">your boss's emails</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> discussing why they're releasing "junior or weaker members on the team." Access to that kind of information would definitely make the toxicity bearable for some readers, wouldn't it?</span></p><p>Image via Fat Babies. Names blacked out to protect identities.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers like Trevor Stricker of Pixel Disco told me they remember at first thinking Fat Babies was brilliant. "It felt like somebody else saw through the bullshit and publishing [the rumors] felt heroic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But he, like many we spoke with, became disillusioned by the personal attacks on developers. He recalled a piece targeting Visual Concepts founder Greg Thomas that made him see Fat Babies in a different light. "My opinion started to shift, like [the writer] was using his anonymity as a bully pulpit just to denigrate. he just hated on everyone and everything but...why? It was actually a fertile time for the industry. All this guy had to offer was bile."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I admit to speedrunning through Thomas' experience. When I first clicked through Fat Babies, my jaw hit the floor. Old gossip! Trashy blogs! Random asides about Iraq War protestors being paid by Democrats! Tragedy plus time equals comedy, and boy has there been enough time to find the comedy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as I dug the ruins of Fat Babies, I saw all the familiar toxic flaws of the game industry laid bare by those working in it. The low pay, the tales of crunch, the sexism, the racism, the homophobia...it's easy to see what Case meant when she wrote to FatMamaCita "and people wonder why there aren't more chicks in this industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game industry is now much more diverse, much more inclusive, and far more likely to push back against the attitudes you'd find on Fat Babies. Games journalism has become more robust, and our peers at Polygon, IGN, and GameSpot are now as capable of doing in-depth reporting as they are previews and reviews, reducing the need for dive bar gossip.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But progress isn't linear. Minorities in the industry are still well...minorities, with gender and racial parity in pay and employment still a distant dream. Women and LGBTQ developers are still liable to face harassment in and out of the workplace, and companies like Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games are reportedly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-cloud-imperium-enacting-temporary-seven-day-work-mandate-for-star-citizen-devs">making devs work 7 days a week</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Developers spilling workplace gossip and chat logs to put coworkers in the path of an online horde is a phenomenon that's still with us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's plenty of time to lose all the progress we've gained. If we're going to learn anything digging through the ruins of this once-well-trod website, it's that this is a world we could easily return to.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The headlines that matter">Status Report: The headlines that matter</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A big thanks to Tom Regan for stepping into our AM news slot while Chris heads abroad.

I can't help but wonder if using snappy domain names from other nations is its own kind of digital colonization, another example of how the West exploited a territory known for its self-sustaining abundance. The stakes are far lower, but we certainly should consider the needs of island residents and the global diaspora over our humdrum game marketing needs.</span></p></div></li><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/firaxis-working-with-shawnee-tribe-to-deliver-accurate-representation-in-civilization-7">Firaxis strikes up partnership with Shawnee Tribe for 'sincere representation' in Civilization VII</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>// </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Let's all tip our caps to Firaxis for aiming to do better with including Native American tribes into Civilization. It's a fine line to walk, as the Civilization series often embodies the expansion are values that led to the devastation of people like the Shawnee. But games about history are a fantastic way to introduce players to new historical figures and people, and omitting them entirely would be its own kind of erasure. I'm curious to see what the final results will be like.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Feature Creep: Originals and interviews for the discerning reader">Feature Creep: Originals and interviews for the discerning reader</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-washington-state-is-doing-to-juice-local-game-development">What Washington State is doing to juice local game development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>// </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">So long as the United States Congress deadlocks itself into doing nothing thanks to the filibuster we will not get federal support for the video games industry over here.
