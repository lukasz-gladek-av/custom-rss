            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It was the Christmas of 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/svcznf9cxtY?si=XFI81dUw7IU_LgNC">Mr Blobby</a> was the funniest thing on television (according to your parents), and <a href="https://youtu.be/3JWTaaS7LdU?si=X88fExf5WKFM4q0D">Whitney Houston</a> had been tricked into singing a love song about everyone's favourite sentient cardigan, Kevin Costner (I feel like I'm having a war flashback now).</p>
<p>And me? Well, I was having a great time despite all of this, actually. Because Santa had done me a massive solid.</p>
<p>Now, two things. Firstly, Santa hadn't done a toilet in my lounge. That's not what I mean at all.</p>
<p>Secondly, I was 14 years old in 1992, so I shouldn't have been asking my bewildered and frightened parents (Mr Blobby-loving fools) to send a rather bullish letter to the North Pole requesting — demanding — a Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>
<p>With the arrival of this tour-de-force into to the sitting room of my Dickensian home on 25th December 1992, I, for the first time ever, was experiencing graphical and gameplay parity (<a href="https://youtu.be/BiufDI8cBkU?si=8WK4Z9utZUC-3ee2">after a lot of trying on my beloved Commodore 64</a>) with the local arcade version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">The World Warrior</a>, where I had previously been spending all the money I could steal from my Mr Blobby-loving dad to feed my addiction to Eddie Honda's big shiny chest. (Don't worry, I never paid him back.)</p>

<p>This was my first Nintendo console! My first console of any kind that was mine, in fact, and as a result of this, and because it was the first game that really made me feel as though the home experience could indeed match the flashy side of the arcade one, Street Fighter 2 has — and always will have — a very special place in my heart. It was a bonus, really, that it was also phenomenal to play as well as to sit and stare at.</p>
<p>In a way that it's hard to convey today, when we're drowning in deep and meaningful gaming experiences, and when gamers have grown up with home consoles that give them the best of everything at their fingertips, Street Fighter 2 awakened me to the possibility that, for me, gaming might not, like a puppy for example, be just for Christmas.</p>
<p>And this is the serious bit, the 'science bit' if you will. Because I grew up in a time and place that happened entirely before the internet (and possibly before Jesus, but that's another Christmas story for another Christmastime), it was very easy to feel cut off and left behind in matters technologic. Such was life in rural '80s and '90s Ireland; lots of cow s**t, not so much of the latest high street cool s**t.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3cc5bfd3621c5"><a title="Street Fighter 2 SNES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3cc5bfd3621c5/street-fighter-2-snes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Street Fighter 2, though, with those fancy arcade-perfect graphics and noises and music, well, that was what everyone who knew anything was playing and talking about that particular year's end (in my young mind), and I was now playing and talking about it, too. Mostly to myself, but you can't win 'em all.</p>
<p>It seems like nothing, and it is! But that little glimmer of feeling as though I was involved was, for a wee guy who was yet to meet any other real-world gaming pals, and for someone who lived quite remotely, it was a big deal to be riding the latest wave of excitement. You couldn't just hit someone up in their DMs back then, y'know. Connections hit different.</p>
<p>And so, because I'm a legit saddo (as you'll now know and understand), every Christmas <em>to this very day</em> I still boot up the old Street Fighter 2 on my SNES (not my OG machine, unfortunately) and dig into one or two runs of its fabulous arcade mode. It's a game that's never aged in my mind; it looks as good as it ever did in its detailed pugilists, atmospheric environments and delightful little background animations. And complaints about the awful frame rate will get you banned from my Xmas party punch bowl, I'm afraid.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fcb98f3984af0"><a title="Street Fighter 2 SNES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fcb98f3984af0/street-fighter-2-snes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It ties a bow on my festive period, it drowns me in just right volume of intoxicating nostalgia, and it reminds me of more innocent times. All of that guff.</p>
<p>But it also marks a point where I remember vividly having shifted from loving games and playing games for what they were to wanting to keep them in my life as a thing that helped me connect and feel connected. And I guess that's what I'm still doing to this day.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to show my sons how red and trembly my face goes when I can't reliably pull off Vega's wall dive. Merry Christmas and that.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-outage-addressed-epic-games-ceo/</link>
            <guid>1392049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hours ago, the gaming space went into a downward spiral as several major titles went offline. In a global network issue, the likes of Fortnite, ARC Raiders, Steam, Rocket League, and Marvel Rivals suffered, and of course, gamers took to social media to vent their frustrations.</p>



<p>In a quickshot post on socials, Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic Games, lamented the issues with an apologetic message of sorts.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-servers-are-melting-down">The Servers Are Melting Down</h2>



<p>Fortnite was one of the most heavily impacted games in the recent server outage issue that knocked multiple games offline. The blip took down countless top-tier titles, leaving players stranded on Christmas Eve.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2004019861807374671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post</a> acknowledging the issues, Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The servers are melting down, sorry fam.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He followed that up three hours later with a much more encouraging comment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s back, and Merry Christmas everyone!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The simple message was a nice note to indicate that even the top-most individual at Epic Games has his finger on the pulse, even at the height of the festive break.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been documented what caused the issue, but given the widespread nature of the blip, it’s safe to assume it was related to the global network infrastructure that seems to be so shaky these days. The issues impacted a diverse array of titles, and this is a problem that’s becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly this year.</p>



<p>As the world becomes increasingly reliant on networking and the likes of AI, connected living, and cloud computing become much more important, we’re going to see these problems surface much more often.</p>



<p>Which is a shame, given that gaming is almost inherently dependent on good internet these days.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#928)—Clues and Answers for Thursday, December 25]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-25-928/</link>
            <guid>1392046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s finally here! It’s the ultimate festive day of the year, but before you start tearing open your gifts and scoffing down a Christmas lunch, you need to complete one of the final NYT Connections puzzles of 2025. Below, I’ve provided the top NYT Connections hints and solutions so that you can complete the puzzle as quickly as possible, keep your streak going, and get back to the festivities.</p>



<p>Read on for today’s NYT Connections answers!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-25">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 25)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #928:</p>



<ul>
<li>EXCESSIVE</li>



<li>COIN</li>



<li>FLOWERY</li>



<li>FASHION</li>



<li>MELODRAMATIC</li>



<li>HATCH</li>



<li>PURPLE</li>



<li>MAKE UP</li>



<li>CHERRY</li>



<li>LAREDO</li>



<li>FLOWER</li>



<li>MIRE</li>



<li>MUSICAL NOTE</li>



<li>RETIRE</li>



<li>WINE GLASS</li>



<li>SOLTI</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Why be plain when you can go over-the-top?</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Be inventive with this group</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Hopefully the answer <strong>stems </strong>from this hint</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Think singing scales and warming up your voice</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 25:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-25-928">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 25 (#928)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– EXCESSIVE, FLOWERY, MELODRAMATIC, PURPLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COIN, FASHION, HATCH, MAKE UP</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHERRY, FLOWER, MUSICAL NOTE, WINE GLASS</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – LAREDO, MIRE, RETIRE, SOLTI</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-wants-play-fallout-5-600-hours-rookie/</link>
            <guid>1392037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone knows that Fallout games are designed to be played for a <strong>very long time</strong>. In the case of Fallout 76, the last major release in the post-apocalyptic series, there’s an infinite number of hours waiting to be explored. In a recent interview, the team at Bethesda Game Studios revealed that these concepts are being built into Fallout 5.</p>



<p>One of the lead developers working on Fallout’s next major iteration revealed that the goal is <strong>600 hours</strong>, in an ideal world. It’s not the kind of game that can be played for just ’20 hours’, but players are going to be given enough meat on the irradiated bones to play for an extremely long time.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-we-expect-from-fallout-5">What We Expect from Fallout 5</h2>



<p>Being honest, we expected nothing less from Fallout 5. With each new release in the series, Fallout has gotten increasingly expansive and ambitious. Fallout 76 (2018) is a live-service MMORPG that has never stopped evolving, so it stands to reason that Fallout 5 will be similarly impressive.</p>



<p>While we know very little about the game, Bethesda’s Todd Howard did recently confirm that it’ll be tied in with the ongoing television show.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/23/bethesda-talks-fallouts-future-and-lessons-learned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, several members of the Bethesda Game Studios leadership team spoke about the future of the franchise. Emil Pagliarulo, one of the most notable developers on the team and the studio’s design director, dropped a tidbit about Fallout 5’s ideal duration:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I would be happy with a game that is as successful as the previous Fallout games that continues to give fans what they love, you know, and to give them a story that they can get into and systems that they love and really just an experience that they play not for 20 hours and not for 100 hours, but an experience they can play for 200, 300, you know, 600 hours, because that’s the kind of games we make. That would be my hope going forward: Keep doing what we’ve done, and also to evolve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For some, those are rookie numbers, as Fallout is the kind of series that can keep providing new experiences 1000+ hours into a run. With the implementation of mods, Creation Club content, expansions, and regular updates, Fallout games have been kept alive and kicking for <strong>decades</strong>, in some cases.</p>



<p>Fallout 5 doesn’t have any kind of a release window, but at this rate, and with the ambitions of the studio, we’d expect it to be 2030 before we even have a teaser trailer released.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Update Adds Long-Awaited Quality-of-Life Feature]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-update-quality-of-life-feature/</link>
            <guid>1392034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov players are loading into the game after the most recent patch (1.0.1.0) to find a quality-of-life feature that they’ve been needing for years. When you deploy into your next raid, you’ll notice a UI upgrade that includes a progress bar that represents how long it’s going to take for you to load into your session.</p>



<p>This means it’s no longer based entirely around guesswork as to how long it’s going to take to load into your game. The progress bar shows you exactly where you’re at in the queue, how long the estimated load time is, and how long you’ve already been waiting (which isn’t new, of course).</p>



<h2 id="h-small-tarkov-change-big-impact">Small Tarkov Change, Big Impact</h2>



<p>For the longest time, fans of the pioneering extraction shooter that is Escape from Tarkov have been left wanting when it comes to loading into raids. In the worst cases, it can take double-digit minutes before you get into your raid, and you’re left to sit there and let the clock run up.</p>



<p>This latest update, introduced with the 1.0.1.0 patch that also brought about the winter event, ensures that players have a UI upgrade that fixes that to some extent.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: AirwingMarine on X</figcaption></figure>







<p>It doesn’t address long load times – that comes later. Instead, it gives players a mostly accurate representation of how long it’s expected to take for them to get into their raid. This means that players no longer need to sit in their queue ad infinitum. If they see there’s an estimated load time of 10 minutes, they can just back out and try again.</p>



<p>It <strong>has </strong>been reported by players on socials that it’s not entirely accurate right now. One user wrote that their estimated deploy time was over six minutes, and they were in their raid in three.</p>



<p>It’s a minor change for some, but for those who have been playing Escape from Tarkov for a lot longer, it’s a no-brainer addition that is long overdue.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see the UI upgrade in Escape from Tarkov’s latest update? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

		<p>Merry Christmas, everybody!</p>
<p>For all of you gathering together with family and friends, opening presents, gorging yourselves on a bit too much dinner, and all the other trimmings that come with Christmas Day, we hope you have a wonderful time today and through the rest of the holidays that mark the end of the year.</p>
<p>So, on&nbsp;behalf of all the writers here at TheSixthAxis, I want to wish you, your families and your friends Happy Holidays and a very Merry Christmas!</p>

<hr>
<p>Once again, 2025 has been a years filled with challenges for people all through the country and the world, and we want to take this time to also remember those who are experiencing hardship, hunger, war, or simply fear for what the future can and will bring. With the deep impact of wars continuing to be felt in Ukraine, in Gaza, civil wars in several African countries, and more conflict elsewhere, we can only hope for peace and resolution and an ending to the bloodshed.</p>

<p>If you have spare money please consider giving it to support civilians caught up in these conflicts. <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/">War Child</a> is a charity that specifically focuses on the impact that war has on children.</p>
<p>On a more personal level, while Christmas is a time of cheer for many people, it can also bring up difficult memories. If you find yourself needing help or support at this time, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">Mind</a>, <a href="https://giveusashout.org/">Shout</a>, and <a href="https://www.childline.org.uk/">Childline</a>&nbsp;are all charities in the UK that focus on mental health, awareness and crisis support.

<ul>
<li>Samaritans – call 116 123</li>

                <p>I prefer to play my games without mods or console commands to get as close to the intended experience as possible. But sometimes something breaks and you need to reset your character, you have an accessibility need, or maybe you're just 1,000 hours into your game and aren't worried about doing stuff in-engine anymore. That's what console commands are for. Like any big crafting game should, Satisfactory has a variety of console commands available. Continue on for how to use those commands, and what cheats are available.</p><p dir="ltr">Before we dive in, cheating in Satisfactory isn't as simple and straightforward as we might hope. There are a variety of console commands available, but most of them pertain to user preferences. To use actual cheats, you'll have to install a mod.</p><h3 dir="ltr">How to use Console Commands</h3><p dir="ltr">Look at the upper-right corner of your keyboard. You should see a key that has one or more of these characters: ~, `, or §. That last one is pretty standard on a lot of European keyboard layouts. Pressing this will bring up the console.</p><h3 dir="ltr">How to use Cheats</h3><p dir="ltr">We have a full list of Console and Debug commands further down, but we would be remiss in not mentioning our favorite command: Cheats.</p><p dir="ltr">For Cheats to work, you'll need to download and install the <a href="https://ficsit.app/mod/SML" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML)</a>, with additional information in the <a href="https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/SMLChatCommands.html" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory Modding Documentation</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of our favorite Cheats include: NoPower, NoCost, TurboProductionMode, and Teleport. NoPower still requires that you wire up your machines, but you don't have to actually power them. NoCost makes machines and the like free to place. TurboProductionMode turns crafting at the bench into an instantaneous affair. Finally, Teleport puts you wherever you like on the map, which is great for when you manage to get yourself into a precarious position between a big drop and some predators who haven't noticed you just yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Below, you'll find listings for all console, debug, and cheat commands, per the Satisfactory Modding Documentation page and the <a href="https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Console" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory wiki</a> on Fandom.</p><h3 dir="ltr">All Console, Debug, and Cheat commands</h3><p>Console Commands</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col"> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>?

When enabled, no items are required to build things with the build gun. Crafting stations still require ingredients.</td></tr><tr><td>NoPower &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Enables or disables the NoPower cheat, which is saved in the save file, and persists even when mods are uninstalled. When enabled, buildings still require a power connection, but they require no electricity to run. Vehicles also do not require fuel.</td></tr><tr><td>TurboProductionMode &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>When enabled, all items craft instantly in the workbench and workshop. Buildings are unaffected.</td></tr><tr><td>GiveItemStacks &lt;Blueprint Path&gt; &lt;Number of Stacks&gt;</td><td>Adds a number of full stacks of an item to the player’s inventory. If the inventory isn’t big enough to hold it all, extra slots will be granted as well. You can find an item’s Blueprint Path on the Satisfactory Wiki, finding the content on a reference list, or via searching around for it in FModel. You can also use it to give yourself additional inventory slots via GiveItemStacks "" numberOfSlots</td></tr><tr><td>GiveItemsSingle &lt;Blueprint Path&gt; &lt;Number of Items&gt;</td><td>Adds a number of individual items to the player’s inventory. Unlike GiveItemStacks, if the inventory can’t hold the items, the inventory will NOT be expanded.

Does not affect how many points it takes to earn the next coupon.</td></tr><tr><td>Slomo &lt;Multiplier&gt;</td><td>Speeds up or slows down the entire game by the given multiplier. This includes player movement, particles, animations, etc. It has an effect on building operation rate, but not as pronounced as one may expect. For example, 10.0 makes Copper Sheets craft in around 3.5 seconds instead of the 6 seconds they take at 1.0.</td></tr><tr><td>SetTimeOfDay &lt;Hour&gt; &lt;Minute&gt;</td><td>Sets the world time of day in 24 hour time format.</td></tr><tr><td>SetTimeSpeedMultiplier &lt;Multiplier&gt;</td><td>Sets a world time of day speed multiplier. Set it to 0 to freeze the day/night cycle altogether.</td></tr><tr><td>EnableBuildableTick &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Enables/disables AFGBuildable ticking, which controls if buildings are animated.

If you’re upright already, it will flip you upside down.</td></tr><tr><td>ResetAllFactoryLegsToZero &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Makes the support legs on all buildings reset to their default height. The boolean argument controls if it should "repopulateEmptyLegs," presumably if they were deleted somehow.</td></tr><tr><td>RebuildFactoryLegsOneTileAroundPlayer</td><td>Recalculates the support legs on buildings near the player. If the gap is too large, they will just reset to zero.</td></tr><tr><td>FillAllFreightCars &lt;percent full, float&gt;</td><td>Fills all freight cars in the map with a nameless, descriptionless placeholder item.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> was, coincidentally, one of 2022's <em>sleeper</em> hits.

<p>It will come as no surprise, then, that we were rather excited to see a sequel on the way. Announced in June 2023 and confirmed to be coming to Switch at the June 2024 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/tabletop-inspired-rpg-citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-gets-january-release">PC Gaming Showcase</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> promises more of the same deep space dilemmas, but with an expanded dice system, clean-cut job roles and multiple environments to explore, we were keen to learn more about its new recruits before liftoff.</p>
<p>Sitting for a chat with Gareth Damian Martin (of the game's one-person team, Jump Over The Age), we aimed to do just that. Our conversation covered an intergalactic range of topics, including the pressure of making a sequel, the game's TTRPG roots and their plans for the future.</p>
<p>So, don your space suits and buckle up, Sleeper, it's time to talk spaaaaace...</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Citizen Sleeper was a huge success back in 2022, but you’ve said in the past that a sequel wasn’t the natural next project for you. What was it that made you want to come back to this universe for Citizen Sleeper 2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gareth Damian Martin, Jump Over The Age:</strong> I’m a big fan of making experimental projects, and inventing new designs within games, which means a sequel isn’t always my first instinct. But with Citizen Sleeper, I felt there was still so much more of the experiment to do! The first game was fairly modest in terms of system and scale, so it left plenty of space for new systems and ideas. In particular, I’m a big fan of “ship and crew” sci-fi series like <strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong> and <strong>Farscape,</strong> but I have always felt games never quite got the genre right. So it was exciting to try to make one of these stories within the Citizen Sleeper universe, which I felt was ideally suited to this kind of storytelling.</p>
<p>In the end, I felt like there was an opportunity to build on the first game while also offering something equally fresh and different so that the two games could sit alongside each other as a pair.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2246b1082effe"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2246b1082effe/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Citizen Sleeper 2, like its predecessor, is about a lot of different things: capitalism, humanity, survival, loneliness, etc. What are the biggest challenges of balancing so many themes when it comes to writing a story like this?</strong></p>
<p>I have to be honest, I don’t really write “thematically” when I’m telling a story. I’m not really focused on making statements. Instead, I am very interested in my characters and the different paths they can take through the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really hope players enjoy connecting the dots between the two games</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I start writing, I often have a lot of situations in my mind that feel interesting or exciting. I might have an idea for a contract where you instigate a mutiny on a ship in the middle of a general strike or an idea for a group of characters who are all pursuing the same long-lost interstellar drive. I select and invent these based on my own interests, so the reason Citizen Sleeper has these themes is because that’s what interests me in the world! That’s when I really set up the subjects of the story, and from that point on, my mind is focused on who the characters are, how they speak, how the world works, and what might make for a compelling plot.</p>
<p>Some stories are compelling because they are tense and pacy, others because they are introspective and heartfelt. For me, the beauty of Citizen Sleeper is that the game can contain all these atmospheres and stories at once, so I don’t worry too much about balancing. If it interests me and seems like a strong story, I try to get it in!</p>
<p><strong>Despite sharing some narrative DNA, this sequel feels like it can be played by those unfamiliar with the first entry. How important was it for you to create something that continues the Citizen Sleeper universe, but also works as a standalone?</strong></p>
<p>I think this is always an important part of making a sequel, you have to assume that this is the first game for players. But rather than see this as a limit, I saw it as an opportunity. I have always been a big fan of time skips in stories. When done well, they mix all the existing ingredients of the story, and then the reader or player gets to feel smart and curious as they piece it all back together and tell their own story of what happened in the missing time between.</p>
<p>What is especially fun with a time skip is they often allow for the prequel/sequel order to be read in either way, as discovering where a character came from is as compelling as discovering where they end up. So this was a big focus when making the game, and I really hope players enjoy connecting the dots between the two games and being surprised by the often unusual journeys characters may take.</p>
<figure data-uuid="ebd649438a817"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ebd649438a817/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The sequel appears to be much more rooted in the RPG genre, with clearly defined class skills, missions and expanded dice mechanics as just a few additions. Were there any other games (video or tabletop) that inspired these mechanics during development?</strong></p>
<p>As with the first game, Citizen Sleeper 2 was massively inspired by designs and concepts from pen-and-paper TTRPGs. <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel">Blades in the Dark</a> was the first tabletop game I ever ran, and it remains my favourite. It inspired the first game, and with the sequel, I saw the opportunity to adapt more of its systems into a video game. Citizen Sleeper 2’s “push” mechanic, where you accrue stress to gain a bonus to or reroll your dice, is a direct inspiration from that game, and its systems are designed around asking the player to “push their luck”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>stress quickly became a very useful tool to represent all kinds of systems in the game</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the stress systems I added to Citizen Sleeper 2, I took inspiration from the myriad of stress systems appearing in tabletop games over the past five years, but especially <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gerdling/mothership-sci-fi-horror-rpg-1st-edition-boxed-set">Mothership</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart:_The_City_Beneath">Heart: The City Beneath</a>. There’s so much good and exciting game design happening in the tabletop scene, and I find it a constant inspiration for my own work.</p>
<p>On the video game side, my main touchstone was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/mass_effect_2">Mass Effect 2</a>. I wouldn’t say I was attempting to replicate anything from Mass Effect 2, however, more that I wanted to make a game that approached similar ideas in a different way. I often find this is a way I like to work in games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/in_other_waters">In Other Waters</a> was my own take on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>, refocusing it on scanning and xenobiology. In the same way, Citizen Sleeper is my own take on the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> series, shifting the focus from saving the galaxy as a supercop to learning to live and survive in the margins of an interstellar society.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8285810a21037"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8285810a21037/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>With community and home being such an important part of the first game, how does this theme play into the larger setting of the Starward Belt in the sequel, and what challenges do the new hubs pose for the Sleeper?</strong></p>
<p>Ideas of home play out a little differently in Citizen Sleeper 2: rather than having a massive urban megastructure as the location, the game plays out over a series of scattered habitats of varying size and style. Because of this, your home really becomes the Rig, a ship you have stolen and that expands and changes over the course of the game. I really want to capture that slow and subtle process of transformation as the ship gains crew and becomes more familiar, and often in writing the game, I found that to be in contrast with the Hubs, which ultimately, you always have to leave.</p>
<p>So I think at the heart of the game is a tension between moving on and settling down, which feels very important to the Citizen Sleeper series in general.</p>
<p><strong>There were many stressful moments in Citizen Sleeper, and now Stress is a mechanic in the sequel. Why did you decide to implement this, and what effect will it have on your relationships in-game?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Citizen Sleeper 2 ties up some of the ideas nicely, while also opening up the possibility of more stories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stress systems are a fairly popular and well-battle-tested element in many contemporary TTRPGs, and I think that’s because they offer an abstract form of harm vs Health Points. You might take stress from a heist, a difficult negotiation, or babysitting a child, but you hopefully wouldn’t take HP damage! This allows for a broader range of challenges for players and also consequences. I was really aware of the possibilities this opened up for telling a broader range of stories from running TTRPGs, especially ones that aren’t focused on combat. So this was one of the first things I wanted to add to the sequel.</p>
<p>As I developed these ideas in Citizen Sleeper 2, stress quickly became a very useful tool to represent all kinds of systems in the game. It represents the stress your body is under and the possibility that the pressure might turn into real and permanent harm. It represents your crew’s eagerness to continue working on a contract when things don’t go well. It also represents more abstract ideas, like how quickly a derelict ship is falling apart, or the opinions of a disgruntled crew turning against their captain. So stress bars of various kinds will have a huge effect on your path through Citizen Sleeper 2, and I think managing them is one of the most compelling and tense parts of the game.</p>
<p>This time around, I really wanted the game to be stressful, compelling and filled with emergent stories of success and failure. Stress is the tool that allows me to achieve that.</p>

<p><strong>You recently told</strong> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-will-be-the-last-citizen-sleeper-video-game"><strong>Eurogamer</strong></a> <strong>that Citizen Sleeper 2 would be the last video game in the Citizen Sleeper universe, but a tabletop adaptation is still on the cards for the future. How does it feel to be thinking about returning the game to its tabletop roots and is there anything you feel will be lost/gained in the process?</strong></p>
<p>I’m very early in the process of making a Citizen Sleeper TTRPG (as you might imagine, I’ve been busy with the sequel!), but I have a very clear objective with it. I’m really happy with the two games and the story they tell in this universe. I think Citizen Sleeper 2 ties up some of the ideas nicely while also opening up the possibility of more stories. My aim with the TTRPG is to hand the tools to tell those stories over to the player and to let them carry whichever threads catch their interest forward with their friends (or start totally new ones).</p>
<p>What gets left behind by doing that is, of course, my own presence as the narrator of those stories, but I think after two games, there are a lot of references for people to go to if that’s what they want. What is gained is the radical openness of a tabletop system, the chance for players to fill in the gaps in a meaningful way and really explore their connections to the universe’s characters and ideas. Which, in a way, is what these games have been about all along.</p>

You play as Hazel--a Weaver who can see ghosts and learn from the past through memories. Hazel helps address and heal others' emotional wounds through a bit of magic and a lot of understanding. As the details behind characters' hardships unfold, their trauma transforms into pieces of music that reinforce the game's themes and live on long after the credits roll.</p><p dir="ltr">I spoke to

I brought this up when speaking to them, trying to understand how the game sounds the way it does despite that fact. Derivière shared a similar confusion when he was first asked to work on the project.</p><p dir="ltr">"At first, I was like, 'Why are you hiring me? I'm French.' I'm not from the South. This is not my culture," Derivière shared. "And they were like, 'We know that. We know that, but we don't want you to be accurate. We want you to be authentic.' And so when they said this, I was like, 'Oh, I understand.' You don't want to create something that is from the South--like, accurately from the South--because it's a fantasy. But it's inspired by the South."</p><p dir="ltr">Derivière and Fox are both European, but creative director David Sears is from the South, and the same goes for many of the musicians and vocalists featured in South of Midnight's music. Derivière explains this point, saying Compulsion didn't want him to "mimic" anything, but create something authentic in their fantasy world.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've worked with amazing musicians from Nashville, some Americans in Paris, [and] of course, London, for the orchestra," Derivière said. "I would come with my version of the song... And this is where authenticity came in, because they're from there, you know, either New Orleans, [or] Nashville, wherever. And they look at the charts, they look at the melody, and they're like, 'Alright!' And they start playing, and boom! It's culture. It's art."</p><p dir="ltr">He spoke a bit more about the culture involved, saying, "We are in a sort of blend of cultures--African cultures, European cultures. And this is the good part [about] this music. It created a cultural background for America, but it comes from everywhere."</p><p dir="ltr">Fox mentioned that he even had a playlist of music from the Deep South for Derivière to listen to, but decided against sharing it to allow for more creativity.</p><p dir="ltr">"My job is to create an environment where he can be the most creative and have the most freedom to make something original that would stand out. So I didn't give him that playlist because of that," Fox explained. "But if you say, 'I want something like this.' You're going to get a carbon copy of that thing. So, you know, Coke becomes like Coke Light. You have to be happy to possibly fail in the process--it's a risk. But I thought, with Olivier, it was definitely worth taking that risk, and the chances of hitting gold were much, much higher."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll say one other thing that was important, I think, is what a lot of people say--especially people from the Deep South--is that it really sounds like the Deep South," Fox added. "I think that was really down to the sound recordings that were done/taken in the swamps, and in the different mountains of Tennessee and Kentucky. That sound design also really grounded everything, so that you could go a bit wild with the music and go somewhere different."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624042-south-of-midnight-hazel-catfish.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624042" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624042-south-of-midnight-hazel-catfish.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624042"></a><figcaption>Hazel sitting on top of Catfish in a swamp.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624042-south-of-midnight-hazel-catfish.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That creativity Fox spoke of shines through with the use of childrens' voices throughout the game, in both gameplay and the soundtrack. One of the most notable pieces of audio in South of Midnight plays when you use the Guiding Strand--a ghostly line that directs you to your next objective.</p><p dir="ltr">You hear a child's voice whisper "Hazel" in the direction you need to go, and it happens every time you use that navigational tool. The game also features singing children in a lot of the music. They feel like supernatural entities that inform, motivate, guide, and fight alongside you on your journey.</p><p dir="ltr">"We didn't want to call them spirits. We didn't want to call them ghosts. We didn't want to call them magic. We wanted [them] to be free of all these, sort of, clichés," Derivière said. "It's like an energy around you, you know--the strands. Using the kids was the key for the voices--the vocals. The key to, all of a sudden, make those strands real. And that was because you see some ghosts, of course… There is this connection. But this is through the strands. And the strands are the kids."</p><p dir="ltr">Derivière often mentioned that the kids are "the stars of the show." Explaining that they're with you from beginning to end, no matter where you are or what you're doing. Fox echoed this statement, going deeper into how the children--five girls from a Gospel church in Nashville--are used in the audio design.</p><p dir="ltr">The five girls recorded audio for a wide variety of gameplay moments, in addition to their singing for the soundtrack and musical roles. The audio team sampled giggling, whispers, yelling, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">"They were this amazing group of five girls from the local Gospel church. That's why [Olivier] said [they're the] stars of the show, to go back to that, because they really are everywhere," Fox explained. "This is the genius of Olivier. When you come close to an object or space, there's a value that gets more intense or less intense, to give you that feeling of you're approaching something of power. So it's really great. It was a great project to work with Olivier and see what could be done with voice."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624035-south-of-midnight-molly-child.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624035" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624035-south-of-midnight-molly-child.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624035"></a><figcaption>One of the ghostly children in South of Midnight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624035-south-of-midnight-molly-child.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Music and songs with vocals are such large parts of South of Midnight, but it almost didn't start out that way, according to Derivière.</p><p dir="ltr">"At the beginning of the project, we didn't have any idea that there would be songs in the game--not at all," Derivière said. "At some point, David Sears, the creative director, said, 'I don't want music.' And that was like, oh, okay, so he's talking to the composer right now, and he says, 'I don't want this.'"</p><p dir="ltr">"And so the more we're discussing, the more it was like, 'Okay, we need songs.' Because, number one, it's traditional from the South. You know, songs are very embedded into the culture there. But also, we wanted the songs to be part of the overall narrative. And so this is where David and the team, over there, the narrative team came with some lyrics."</p><p dir="ltr">These conversations came during the year-long planning process that took place in the very early stages of development. Fox added a few more details about the team's thought process during those times as well. He revealed that the songs were complete long before other aspects of the game.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">At the beginning of the project, we didn't have any idea that there would be songs in the game--not at all.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">"Definitely a challenge because, for us, we wanted to create 2D art to inform 3D level art. We were like, 'Could we make songs that could inform level music?' Which is a bit of a novel way of thinking," Fox explained. "For a long time, all we had was the songs, because we were waiting for the game to be finished enough that we could start integrating. [It] was really important to work with the narrative team. And the narrative team actually contributed to some of the lyrics, and David Sears also contributed to the lyrics."</p><p dir="ltr">The idea of making songs that informed level music was implemented successfully through the unique way in which South of Midnight delivers its songs in pieces as you move through a level. As you learn more about a creature or character's trauma, lyrics are added to an incomplete song a few lines at a time. Then, at the end of the level, you hear the full song for the first time, creating an impactful moment.</p><p dir="ltr">This happens several times throughout the game to explore different themes with several creatures or characters who are central to the plot. We get guilt with Benjy, anger with Two-Toed Tom, and so on. It's incredible when the incomplete tunes build to eventually become the boss's theme song at the end of a chapter. But it's equally impressive that the songs aren't too on the nose when it comes to transforming each character's story into music.</p><p dir="ltr">"We didn't want the song to be like, 'The story was that, and it happened like this,' you know? It was not like that," Derivière said. "It was more like, okay, we want the song to be sort of abstract, but connected with what was going on."</p><p dir="ltr">"We rearranged the songs so [that] it's the kids singing when you're in the level, and at the end, it's the creature [or person]," Derivière explained. "So the kids singing is sort of a corrupted version--a weird version of the song. You have an idea, and it feels like it's disturbing, because David is a very, let's say, dark person [laughs]. You don't want the song to be beautiful whatsoever in the levels, because the levels themselves are scary in some parts.</p><p dir="ltr">Fox adds to this explanation, saying, "I had this idea of--I don't want to say dark and light--but corrupted and uncorrupted. And I was like, would it be really interesting, when [starting] the level, you were obscured from any understanding of the trauma of this zone or creature? But then, as you go through, and you do these narrative events, you would get a bit of a melody."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624076-south-of-midnight-benjy-tree.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624076-south-of-midnight-benjy-tree.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624076"></a><figcaption>Hazel looks up at the Benjy tree.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624076-south-of-midnight-benjy-tree.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Talking about these standout junctures in South of Midnight with Christopher Fox led to a discussion of what makes music memorable in games. I shared that, oftentimes, I don't really notice a game soundtrack unless it's attached to a notable event or evokes emotion.</p><p dir="ltr">"I know what you mean," Fox said. "It's like [the] Ashtray Maze in Control. And then you've got the balance. [If] it's happening all the time, is it special anymore? So you know there's [a reason] why those bits pop out in those Remedy games where they're really memorable because it's not all the time. But I think we somehow managed to make something that didn't get tiresome, because it was always changing."</p><p dir="ltr">South of Midnight's musical formula didn't get tiresome, in my eyes (and ears), because each big song is tied to a completely different form of hardship that comes from separate backstories. At a certain point, it was the mystery of what happened to the creature or character, mixed with what the music represents, that kept me wanting more.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the [music] represented the trauma of each creature," Fox said. "So each creature had something like ravenous guilt, loss. There were main themes that were established early for each creature. Hopefully, the [music] represents that."</p><p dir="ltr">A few of my favorite tracks in South of Midnight were Huggin' Molly, Rougarou, and Altamaha-Ha because of how they enhanced the stories behind those creatures. This is especially true of Altamaha-Ha, whose tale is about an enslaved woman who lost her child when escaping from captivity. The vocalist, Stacy Subero, sings it beautifully. Fox echoed similar sentiments.</p><p dir="ltr">"My favorite song is the Altamaha-Ha song because it's just... I feel like quite a few people cry at the end of that one, which is an amazing feat for someone who's involved with audio," Fox said. "When we got that song in particular that Olivier wrote, and then [it] was performed by Stacey, the lead singer, and all the backup vocals… I never thought [that] in a video game I would get a song like that."</p><p dir="ltr">Derivière praises the performances for both Rougarou and Altamaha-Ha. I asked about studio sessions, and he shared what it was like hearing Joey Richey for Rougarou and Stacy Subero for Altamaha-Ha.</p><p dir="ltr">"For instance, you're talking Rougarou. You know, that was an amazing performance, because at some point, you know, he goes super loud like, 'I break my bones!' Oh, my God, and he didn't have the orchestra yet," Derivière said. "He didn't know. It was just the piano. He was alone with the piano. And I was like, 'You need to give it all because this is the moment.'</p><p dir="ltr">"It was the same with Altamaha-Ha with Stacey. I mean, my God, how amazing she was. And then we had the choir--the adults. They were amazing--super dark and warm. You can feel it when you listen to them, but it's just happening in real time. And this is when you hope that the engineer didn't forget to press record. You're like, 'Please, tell me you have the take!'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1775/17752664/4624032-south-of-midnight-bones-guitar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624032" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1775/17752664/4624032-south-of-midnight-bones-guitar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624032"></a><figcaption>Shakin' Bones plays a tune for Hazel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1775/17752664/4624032-south-of-midnight-bones-guitar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Compulsion Games developed a soundtrack full of soulful performances and meaning that works perfectly for South of Midnight, but also extends beyond the confines of a single game. The music strengthens the game's themes of loss, hardship, hope, and more, in combination with wonderfully creative audio design, to create a wholly fantastic listening experience that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025s-biggest-snubs/2900-7272/">didn't receive the recognition it deserved</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I hope that many, many more players get to experience South of Midnight's auditory feast when it comes to PS5 and Switch 2 in Spring 2026.</p>

              <p><span>The Pokémon Company seems likely t</span><span>o reveal the upcoming Generation X games in February on the series’ 30th anniversary, but if leakers have anything to say about it, Game Freak might not have much new information to give us by the time that showcase arrives. On December 24, a series of new leaks about the games, allegedly titled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>, began spreading online. We’ve gotten a few waves (sorry) of information since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-wind-wave-pikachu-leak-generation-10-redesign-2000635674"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> in October, but now we know a little bit more about the games’ map, battle gimmick, and have even our first look at the new region’s professor.</span></p> <p><span>The latest info was posted on X early today by self-described <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2003786462651932797">Pokémon detective Moot Monthly</a>. All of these new images, animations, and illustrations are reportedly from this existing leak, so it’s entirely possible they aren’t indicative of the final games that will eventually ship on Switch 2. But they do give us some interesting insight into what Game Freak has been working on for the next mainline entries.&nbsp;</span></p>

Looking at what this shit does to Pikachu in the leaked animation, I’m not immediately onboard. But hey, it’s leaked in-development footage from a hack.

      <p>It is once again, depending on who you ask, the most wonderful time of the year. Presents are under trees, lights are looking downright strewn, and snow is on the ground where climate change still permits that to happen. To celebrate the occasion, we got ourselves a little gift: two weeks of blissful (mostly) rest.&nbsp;</p><p>From now until January 4 or so, things are going to be a little quieter than usual around here. We’ll still be running the odd blog, but it’s been a long – and for Aftermath, <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/"><u>eventful</u></a>! – year, and we’re planning to recharge so we can come out swinging in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to everyone reading for making all of this possible! We literally could not be here without you, nor would we want to. We had no idea what to expect when we kicked off this experiment what feels like two eternities ago, but against all odds in an era of layoffs and site closures, our little slice of internet persists – and continues to grow!

            <link>https://wccftech.com/steam-currently-down-no-word-from-valve/</link>

			<p><strong>Update 24/12/2025 3:36 pm EST - </strong>The Steam store and website are back online. Altogether, the store was only offline for a little over an hour. You can go back to redeeming those gift cards and squeezing every cent out of them during the Winter Sale.</p>



<p>That said, we may not be entirely out of the woods yet, so if you're still having issues, maybe just give it a little more time.</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>If you're sat at home trying to peruse the Steam Winter Sale, but can't get anything beyond a black screen on the Steam app or an Error message on the website, fret not - it's not your family home's poor WiFi. <strong>Steam is currently down,</strong> and it's unclear as to when it'll be back online.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's been no notice from Valve as to what is causing the issue, as Steam and the website have been down for the past hour. Thousands of reports have been flooding <a href="https://downdetector.ca/status/steam/">DownDetector</a> since the issues started, and the <a href="https://steamstat.us/">unofficial status on SteamDB</a> shows that over 250K people have visited the site to see what's happening with Steam.</p>



<p>It's an unfortunate time for the digital storefront to be offline, as surely there are millions of players around the world excited to redeem their gift cards for the digital storefront and see what they can knock off their wishlist at a supreme discount.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thankfully, the Winter Sale doesn't end until January 5, 2026, by which time you can expect Valve to have fixed whatever is causing the issue. In the meantime, if you haven't already, you can head over to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">the Epic Games Store to redeem today's free game, The Callisto Protocol</a>. </p>



<p>And once you're done that, you can continue waiting for Steam to be back online, since, <a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/">as <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong> explained in a recent interview,</a> the Epic Games Store isn't a home for PC players, but Steam is.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>People are not, basically, using EGS as their home, it’s not home to them. I don’t know if it’s deliberate or not, but EGS doesn’t have written reviews. They don’t have the forums. There’s nothing to do there but to buy. So that will always lose to a shop that is also emotional and you can basically engage with the shop</em>. <em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll update this article if Valve provides any notice as to why the store is down and how long it may take them to fix the problem, or if the store just magically starts working again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When it comes to single-player games, 2025 offered no shortage of memorable experiences. Big sequels, ambitious new IPs, and long-anticipated releases all took turns dominating the conversation, making it one of the more competitive years in recent memory. With so many strong options on the table, the Insider Gaming community had plenty to consider when casting their votes.</p>



<p>In the end, one game stood above the rest. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been voted the Insider Gaming community’s Best Single Player Game of 2025.</p>







<p>In a poll hosted on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>, Clair Obscur finished first with 22.6% percent of the votes. Sandfall Interactive’s RPG edged out a packed field that included Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Dispatch.</p>



<p>The result also lines up with the game’s wider reception. Clair Obscur has been universally acclaimed by fans and holds a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">9.6 user score</a> on Metacritic.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-the-votes-shook-out">How The Votes Shook Out</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the poll was filled with worthy recipients. Dispatch finished second with 14.8% of the vote, while Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 followed at 12.2%. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Death Stranding 2 each earned 11.3%, highlighting just how divided the community was among several games.</p>



<p>What ultimately pushed Clair Obscur ahead was how strongly it resonated with players. Rather than leaning on spectacle or familiar franchise beats, the game delivered a focused, self-contained experience that trusted its atmosphere and presentation to do the heavy lifting. Its distinct visual style and deliberate pacing helped it stand out in a year crowded with massive releases.</p>

		<p>As tradition, the PSN January Sale has kicked off before Christmas so it can tempt you to spend those PSN Gift cards straight away.&nbsp; Also as tradition, the savings depend on where you are in the world so there’s no easy way to collate them all but hopefully this should give you an idea of what’s on offer.</p>
<p>The final tradition is that the banner adverts on the store lie, you can actually save up to 90%, not 75%.</p>


<p>There are some really good offers this time, especially if you are picking up older games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-ultimate-edition/">Control: Ultimate Edition</a> is cheaper than a pint and under £6 so if you have not played that, then you really should grab it, and I can also recommend <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes The Deep: The Complete Edition</a>, which is a few pennies over £13. You are also completely mad if you don’t pick up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/limbo/">Limbo</a> AND Inside for £2.19.</p>
<p>A word of warning, the store is still packed full of rubbish shovelware, but if you really want to jack up your Platinum trophy count then Beanball is on sale for seven pence – yes, 7p – and you can get the Plat in 5 mins.</p>
<p>More recent games with savings include <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-f/">Silent Hill f</a>, <span><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a>, and ARC Raiders. I think I am going to grab <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dispatch/">Dispatch.</a></span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nikita Tells Us What He Wants from Tarkov on Console: ‘The Same Frustrating Experience’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-interview-tarkov-console-frustrating/</link>
            <guid>1391839</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We recently sat down with Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, creator of Escape from Tarkov. Amongst other things, we took a dive into the concept of Escape from Tarkov coming to consoles, which is something that the developer teased at the recent Tokyo Game Show event.</p>



<p>In his own words, Nikita has stressed that an Escape from Tarkov console port wouldn’t be made ‘easier’. In fact, it would be ‘the same frustrating experience’ that players have been experiencing on PC for many years, retaining that hardcore, unwelcoming vibe.</p>



<p>It’s his mission to make players break controllers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-would-escape-from-tarkov-on-console-look-like">What Would Escape from Tarkov on Console Look Like?</h2>



<p>Many have surmised that Escape from Tarkov on PlayStation or Xbox would represent a slimmed-down, ‘lite’ version of the tough-as-nails extraction shooter. But after catching up with Nikita Buyanov on the most recent episode of Insider Gaming’s Access Granted, we have gathered a different picture entirely.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure that it would be a ‘lite’ version of EFT. The main goal is to create the same experience for the consoles, so there won’t be any kind of aim assist, any simplifiying of the gaming features.</p>



<p>I really want to get the same frustrating experience for the consoles, to bring on this hardcore feeling to a wider audience.</p>



<p>We don’t plan to conquer something, we just want to create something new for the consoles, something new, a new experience, because they’ve never had that before, I mean the true hardcore experience that will break their controllers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Nikita made the ‘frustrating experience’ comment with a chuckle! </p>



<p>Nikita explained what the challenges are. It’s a discussion mostly centered around the complexity of Escape from Tarkov, which features inventory and health management, survival mechanics, and most importantly, <strong>stacks </strong>of keybinds that only a keyboard and mouse player can realistically handle.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It won’t be something simplified or a casual version of EFT. It will be the same EFT, but of course it needs to be optimized for the current-gen consoles.</p>



<p>The main challenge will be to put in all the controls. It will be the main challenge for us, but in general, I think it will be pretty interesting to do.</p>

<p>Given that Escape from Tarkov only hit ‘full release’ in November, it might be ambitious to believe that Battlestate Games will muster up a console version any time soon. The only thing to go on is Nikita’s mention of ‘current-gen consoles’ for any kind of a timeline.</p>

But TL;DR, <strong>Story of Seasons</strong> is the OG – the original farming game series that sparked thousands of copycats hoping to carve out a slice of that cosy game pie.</p>
<p>And who can blame them? The farming game genre is a fantastic, strange little thing, and for a long time, Story of Seasons was the absolute King. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_the_river_king"><em>River</em> King</a>, if you will. That's just a fun little Harvest Moon joke for the fans.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly... they weren't. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> kicked down the door in 2016 and began eating original developer Marvelous' lunch, it was suddenly open season for farming game developers, and everyone was grabbing guns. Everyone, that is, except Marvelous.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytylLGp-DIVlY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436vqrglh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>While other studios were riffing on the formula with dinosaurs, corpses, slimes, witches, and queer relationships, Marvelous faltered, releasing mid-tier <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doraemon_story_of_seasons">Doraemon</a> tie-ins, remakes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_friends_of_mineral_town">Friends of Mineral Town</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_a_wonderful_life">A Wonderful Life</a> (which were admittedly good, but a little geriatric compared to modern farming games), and the only original release, the empty grind-fest that was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_pioneers_of_olive_town">Pioneers of Olive Town</a>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3aceb35044bde"><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aceb35044bde/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was starting to seem like the glory days of Story of Seasons games were long behind us. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/story_of_seasons_trio_of_towns">Trio of Towns</a>, the last SoS game made in a pre-Stardew world, was one of their best. It seemed like Marvelous was spooked by their competition, and worse, like they were trying to <em>copy</em> it – Pioneers of Olive Town cribbed heavily and clumsily from Stardew's homework rather than remembering what made them the genre trailblazer in the first place. Even Natsume's <strong>Harvest Moon</strong> spinoffs started getting better than Story of Seasons, which is like watching a pug with three legs outrun a greyhound.</p>
<p>So by the time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_grand_bazaar">Grand Bazaar</a> was announced – another remake, this time of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/harvest_moon_ds_grand_bazaar">much less popular Story of Seasons game</a> (albeit one with a cult following) – I had already grown jaded. It would probably be <em>fine</em>. It couldn't possibly be worse than Pioneers of Olive Town's deserted towns and dull mines.</p>
<p>But they did it! They actually did it! Marvelous dug deep, went back to the drawing board, found an ember of their old magic hidden at the back of a cupboard, and nurtured it into a roaring flame.</p>

<p>Grand Bazaar's remake is deep, detailed, <em>gorgeous</em>, and as a delightful surprise, fully voiced. No longer is Marvelous looking over its shoulder at the other farming games on the market. No longer are they trying to keep up with the cool kids. Instead, Story of Seasons is finally getting back in touch with its roots, focusing on characters, a sense of community, and that signature supernatural silliness that brought us things like Vinnie the talking plant and the Harvest Sprites.</p>
<p>Even better, I feel like you can tell that the developers themselves are happier. Pioneers of Olive Town felt like a game that struggled to find its identity – often the result of over-iterating on the design with no clear vision, or more simply, just not having a ton of money or time – whereas Grand Bazaar practically <em>glows</em> with personality. There are small touches of care and detail everywhere, from the flags and window shutters flapping in the wind to the post-game addition of the Happy Bingo system, just to give players more to do.</p>
<p>There are tons of additions to the original game, including new characters, villager requests, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>-inspired gliding system, voiced dialogue, character customisation, and the all-important same-gender romance – all of which show a great deal of knowledge about what the farming game community likes to see in these sorts of games.</p>
<figure data-uuid="735fdb0231920"><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/735fdb0231920/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And then there's the Bazaar itself. I never played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/harvest_moon_ds_grand_bazaar">the original</a>, but from what I understand, it was a much simpler thing, which has been entirely reworked and expanded, with deeper systems. It also does away with some of the frustrations of its predecessor, like customer questions. It's an insightful way to bring the game up to modern tastes without losing the flavour that made those old games successful in the first place, and I can't wait to see them channel these learnings into a new, original game.</p>
<p>We probably won't get any insight into what it was like to develop Grand Bazaar, but I wouldn't be surprised if Marvelous did some drastic reshaping of the studio and its development processes to make Grand Bazaar as good as it is. It's not just pretty – because Friends of Mineral Town and A Wonderful Life were pretty – it's a game that finally stands up to others in the competitive farming game genre. I just hope that it's not a fluke.</p>
<p>I really, really want to see Marvelous continue to prove why they've been around for so long, and Grand Bazaar is, at last, a step in the right direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has revealed the design for Da Red Gobbo 2025 miniature. The tabletop studio continues its tradition of making a Christmas-themed miniature for <em>Warhammer</em>. This year's miniature brings good cheer and a robot suit to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>.</p><h2>Da Red Gobbo 2025 Miniature Announcement</h2><p>In a recent <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/qskksauw/grotmas-calendar-day-24-da-red-gobbos-big-heist/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop announced Da Red Gobbo 2025 miniature. Much like past Christmas-themed gobbos, this year's miniature is packed with <em>Warhammer's</em> distinct visual excess. In this case, a goblin in a Santa outfit in a freshly stolen experimental suit of armor.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The miniature includes a free battleplan to use in your game. Your army either helps or hinders the jolly goblin from escaping the workshop of Niklozzar of the Ashen Beard. The "nice" player will get a defense boost while protecting Da Red Gobbo. The "naughty" player gets weapon buffs to help them shoot the little guy down.</p><p>As for the gobbo himself, his behavior on the battlefield is random. The reason? He doesn't know how the suit works. This means every turn, he pushes random buttons on the suit, causing different effects. Units might turn invisible. Hit and wound rolls might get re-rolled. Who knows? Certainly not the guy working the suit.</p><p>Da Red Gobbo 2025 is the latest announcement as part of Games Workshop's Grotmas Calendar event. This Advent Calendar-style string of holiday announcements has encompassed all of the studio's popular series, including <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, and the grimdark world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>.</p><p>The overall quality of these announcements has been mixed at best. They range from short fiction, seasonal painting tutorials, the introductions of the Helsmiths of Hashut faction to <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, new army detachments,, and new missions.</p><p>Nevertheless, Da Red Gobbo 2025 is a great reminder that, for all of the excessive violence, authoritarian nightmares, and existentially terrifying cosmic horrors that live in the <em>Warhammer</em> franchise, Games Workshop knows how to keep things light and fun during the holiday season.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Shelter is Getting a Reality Show Adaptation, It’s Claimed]]></title>

<p>If you thought the Fallout television show wasn’t enough and you wanted more live-action adaptations, you won’t have to wait too long. It has just been claimed that Prime is assembling a new reality show (‘MrBeast style’) that will plant contestants in a live-action representation of <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong>.</p>



<p>It has been reported that production will start in 2026, and that those taking part in the show will need to build and manage their own vault, keeping their vault dwellers ‘alive’.</p>



<h2 id="h-mixed-responses-surface-about-the-fallout-shelter-show">Mixed Responses Surface About the Fallout Shelter Show</h2>



<p>In an exclusive report from <a href="https://www.theinsneider.com/p/fallout-reality-competition-series-amazon-prime-video-jonathan-nolan-lisa-joy-apply-2026-production" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jeff Sneider</a>, it was claimed that Prime is working on a Fallout Shelter reality show produced by Jonathan Nolan, executive producer on the core Fallout show.</p>



<p>Last year, Fallout emerged in live-action form with an all-new television series tied into the game’s central universe. With an original story, Bethesda Game Studios, Prime Video, and Kilter concocted an authentic representation of the post-apocalyptic world that millions of fans know and love.</p>



<p>It seems that the teams involved aren’t content with just that show, as another one is claimed to be in the works.</p>



<p>Working with a ‘Squid Game’ or ‘MrBeast’ operating model, it seems that Prime Video is eager to assemble a Fallout Shelter adaptation. The purported show will see contestants build and run their own vaults, which are pivotal to the story in the Fallout franchise.</p>



<p>In these vaults, survivors live underground and outlast the nuclear annihilation of the world above, but it’s unlikely Amazon will green-light the destruction of the planet to accommodate a Fallout Shelter show.</p>



<p>Let’s hope not, anyway.</p>



<p>Fallout’s second season is unravelling as we speak, with the second episode having dropped yesterday, December 23. It’s an award-winning series with a brilliant cast, and it’s well worth a watch.</p>
