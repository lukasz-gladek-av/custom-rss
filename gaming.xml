		<p>Following its early access release for PC and Xbox last year, Maximum Entertainment has confirmed that the city builder with superpowers Overthrown will launch on October 16th for PS5, and exit out of early access on PC and Xbox Series X|S the same day. Overthrown lets up to six players work together to build a world, and whoever wears the crown wields the powers of super strength and super speed to find resources and place buildings.</p>

<p>When Overthrown begins you are put in a world where there is no city, just wildlife and bandits stalking the wilderness. Armed with your crown, you are tasked with building a town and attracting people to come live in your town, making it grow from a small village to a bustling town. Of course, that kind of growth has it danger and can attract attacks from the wild. You can wishlist <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012237">Overthrown</a> on the PS Store, or get it in early access for £20.99 on Steam and Xbox Series XS now.</p>

<p>In our Overthrown Early Access review, I said, <em>“Overthrown certainly has potential but after just a few hours I felt like I had seen all I could see in the Early Access stage, at least until the next batch of new content is added in January. It doesn’t take long to unlock all the research available and once you have the town starting to thrive you’re waiting for raids to hit or explore a big but rather sparse world. Regular content updates will be needed to keep people invested in their worlds, otherwise the inhabitants will face more than a harsh winter.”</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-chapter-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deltarune-chapter-5-not-coming-in-2026s-first-half-chapter-6-officially-confirmed.1298079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>creator Toby Fox has revealed that the game's fifth chapter isn't going to be ready until at least the second half of next year, but there's some good news as well: a sixth chapter has officially been confirmed.</p>

<p>As part of the game's <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/autumn25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fall newsletter</a>, Fox says that he "[doesn't] think that the game will be released in the first half of 2026", presumably referring to&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s fifth chapter rather than to the game as a whole.</p>

<p>He says that as of September 8th this year, Chapter 5's early areas are complete but in need of polish for some optional areas, while the last 40% of the chapter is in a "rough first pass" state, with the final 10% currently being prototyped.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-sans.jpg?itok=s5szU5gM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-sans.jpg?itok=r3oxRAbs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>Chapter 5 won't be along until the second half of next year at the earliest.</figcaption></figure><p>The newsletter also contains the first official confirmation of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>Chapter 6; Fox says that "one programmer is already working on the regular enemy bullet patterns of Chapter 6", with regular enemies in Chapter 5 being "mostly done".</p>

<p>It was already fairly obvious that&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>would have at least two more chapters following Chapter 5. The game's chapter selection screen shows space for seven chapters, but this is the first time Fox has overtly referred to a sixth chapter for&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, he doesn't provide any kind of timeline for Chapter 6's release; since Chapter 5 doesn't have a release date yet, it would perhaps be strange if Fox knew when its followup would arrive.</p>

<p>In the case of Chapter 5, Fox says he and his team will release it "when it's done", and that he'll continue to update expectant fans on the progress of the chapter as it's made. Hopefully, it won't be too long until the next update.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-battle.jpg?itok=HD6mVzkg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-battle.jpg?itok=V19o4CWl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A sixth chapter of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>is officially in development.</figcaption></figure><p>Fox has traditionally been pretty transparent about&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s development. Back in October last year, he promised that the game's third and fourth chapters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025" rel="nofollow">would definitely release this year</a>, which was subsequently confirmed during a Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct show.</p>

<p>He's also pledged in the past that&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-update-promises-smoother-development" rel="nofollow">development would be "smoother"</a> following relatively lengthy waits for the game's first few chapters, so hopefully, Chapters 5 and 6 will arrive in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s first four chapters on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/deltarune/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both</a> Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">consoles</a>.

            <p>
I'm not sure the just-released Troublemaker 2: Beyond Dream is one of those "good games" you're all so bloody obsessed with. My working summary, based on 30 minutes with the demo, is that it's an unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">Like A Dragon/Yakuza game</a> developed with a fraction of the budget, and set in "fictionalised" Indonesia. That's to say, it's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> comedy beat 'em up with a bunch of other genres haphazardly stirred in. 
</p>
<p>
I compared it to Rockstar's work and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saints-row">Saints Row</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-dying-light-a-martian-themepark-sim-a-glossy-rpg-remake-and-some-cuddly-lego-co-op">this week's Maw</a>, which was Mostly Wrong. This is a predominantly on-foot experience, for one thing, and you can't grievously assault people at random. There are designated gangs of hoodlums you're permitted to punch out, and as far as I can tell, you have to wait for them to Make Trouble first. It seems very polite and passive for a brawler. Also, you get to transform briefly into a dying cow.

<p>
I'm writing up the demo partly because "Troublemaker" is a brilliant name for an urban sandbox brawl-me-do. Such boisterous Beano energy. Petition to call the next Call Of Duty "Bang Street Kids" and the next Doom "Marine the Minx". The previous Troublemaker from 2023 (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1498740/Troublemaker/">which was pretty well reviewed</a>) took place in a high school - and what is a city, I guess, but a larger school with fancier social dynamics and also, roaming delinquent students called "cars" that waste you instantly on contact. I'm interested to see how far they can extend this "troublemaking" concept. Could we perchance Make Trouble in outer space?</p><p>I'm also writing this up because while I'm not very sold on the button-mashy core combat system, I'm quite struck by the setting. The demo map is a believable jumble of spaces, their disorder amplified by film grain and pop-up. There are neon sculpture trails, pavements lined with scooters, courtyards roamed by lonely broom pushers, half-constructed concert stages, and noisy backstreets where random guys stand on crates twerking. That last one could be a bug.</p>

<p>It feels like a celebration of somebody's neighbourhood. Sadly, you can't enter all the shops and coo over local brands of fast food - often, you're treated to an anime illustration of a shopkeeper. I sound like a massive stinking tourist, I know. I've only ever been to Indonesia in videogames, the last one being the very different <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/afterlove-ep-review">Afterlove EP</a>.
</p><p>
One early hurdle to overcome is the humour. I'm not sure if it's innately awful or poorly localised in English. Possibly, it's both. Example: dropping straight into one of the demo's free roam modes, I approach a man fishing from a bridge. We've barely exchanged hellos when his wife runs up and castigates him for fishing all day. She makes unflattering reference to his "pole" and bullies him back to work with the threat of withholding "our nightly spicy time". I am left alone on the bridge with nothing but questions. And a pole. I try my hand at some fishing myself, but lose interest when I fail the QTE.
</p>
<p>
The jokes do improve in the course of my demo, however uneven the English translation. Subsequently, I meet the aforementioned dying cow, slumped on a corner with a gaggle of onlookers. I moo at the cow sympathetically. The cow tells me that I'm rubbish at speaking cow. This cow, it turns out, has been "gifted by God with critical thinking", and yet now its sorry fate is to be butchered and cooked into rendang. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / indie.io</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I ask whether the cow has any final wishes, and it asks me to pass laws punishing corrupt government officials who steal money intended for 5G towers, or something to that effect. I sense that there may be a joke I'm missing here about Indonesian politics (for context: the game's start-up disclaimer puts the word "fiction" in air quotes). I am unable to pass any laws in the demo, so the cow settles for asking me to help it go on a rampage. There follows a minigame in which <em>I</em> am the cow, barging through cars that conveniently burst like soapbubbles.
</p><p>
Aside from brute catharsis, the tragic bovine encounter also furnishes me with some important background knowledge. Shortly afterwards, another sidequest sees me answering trivia questions posed by a couple of blokes doing a vox pop livestream of some kind. What's rendang made of, they ask? Aha! I know this! That cow was complaining about it earlier!</p>
<p>I somehow score full marks on the quiz, or at least, that's what the NPCs tell me. I celebrate by getting into some lumbering and disconnected brawls with mysteriously hostile dudes in vests, involving light and heavy attacks and parries when I can be bothered. Then I decide that it's time to report back with my findings. It's a deflating end to a demo in which I got to rampage through not-Jakarta as a cow.
</p>
<p>
Troublemaker 2 won't be toppling the likes of Yakuza Zero anytime soon, but it has a similar sense of abandon and generosity. Going by the demo, at least, it's a joyfully ungainly Xmas panto of a game, all glitter and gags and wonky stage punches. Creators Gamecom Team started out as a high school project in 2014, and have also made a bunch of Troublemaker games for mobile. I think I've Made enough Trouble for the foreseeable, but I'm rooting for them. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479770/Troublemaker_2_Beyond_Dream/">Read more on Steam</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>With action-RPGs, it's not uncommon for players to discover character builds that do a little <em>too much </em>damage than initially intended. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-patch-will-fix-one-of-the-most-broken-builds-in-the-game/1100-6531392/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 players leveraged the power of the Stendhal build</a> to wipe the floor with enemies until developer Sandfall Interactive toned down the damage, and Bungie has nerfed numerous Guardian builds over the years, much to the annoyance of the game's fanbase. Borderlands has often been an exception to that school of thought, as players have discovered killer combos between weapons, gear, and skills that have helped them overcome tough fights. These have rarely been patched, as additional difficulty modes have helped keep players on their toes instead.</p><p>Borderlands 4 is out right now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and while the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-blasts-off-on-steam-with-record-breaking-results/1100-6534670/">has reached an impressive number of concurrent players</a> on Steam, it has also been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/">slammed with negative user reviews</a>. The game's performance on PC has been heavily criticized alongside <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/borderlands-4-is-a-premium-game-made-for-premium-gamers-is-randy-pitchfords-tone-deaf-retort-to-the-performance-backlash-if-youre-trying-to-drive-a-monster-truck-with-a-leaf-blowers-motor-youre-going-to-be-disappointed/" rel="nofollow ">Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford's response to various complaints</a>.</p><p>If you're planning to play through the performance and optimization issues, you can check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-guides-hub/1100-6534629/">Borderlands 4 guides hub</a> for several helpful features, as well as our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/">updated list of Shift Codes</a> so that you can quickly power up your arsenal.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-xbox-series-s-technical-limitations-made-battlefield-6-a-better-more-stable-game.1298040/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-series-s/">Xbox Series S </a>version of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> was challenging due to the console's technical limitations, but optimizing the game for the system ultimately made the game better and more stable.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">Kotaku</a>, Technical Director Christian Buhl commented on the challenges of developing the sixth entry in the series launching next month on the Microsoft system, saying that the biggest challenge was dealing with the console's limited memory, which was less than that of the studio's mid-spec PCs, and that caused crashing issues in a lot of the levels. Due to these issues, the team focused on optimizing memory usage in Battlefield 6, and these improvements were also applied to the other versions of the game, resulting in a better and more stable game. The specific optimizations made for the Xbox Series S version also didn't take a very long time, as the memory issues were reportedly fixed in one month or two, according to Buhl.</p>



<p>Although the Battlefield 6 developer managed to find an opportunity in the development challenges the Xbox Series S poses with its technical limitations compared to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S, many more developers have found these challenges to be a serious issue not easily solved. One of these developers is Saber Interactive, which hasn't managed to make the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-cant-run-turok-origins-60-fps/">Turok: Origins</a> run at 60 FPS on the system. Memory limitations were one of the reasons why <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-low-ram-black-myth-wukong/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-split-screen-xbox-series-s-challenge/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> took a long time to release on Xbox systems. For the latter to launch on Xbox systems, Microsoft had to amend its parity clause and let Larian launch their games without split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S, which was later added to this version of the game with a patch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has been paying attention to comments about&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance since it launched this past Friday, and he's got a characteristically brusque suggestion for you if you're dissatisfied.</p>

<p>As part of a very lengthy <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">string of posts</a> on social media platform X over the weekend (which also included multiple threads and responses to other users), Pitchford told one user who suggested&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>should "look good without relying on AI upscal[ing]" to "code [their] own engine".</p>

<p>Pitchford suggested the user "show [Gearbox] how it's done", sarcastically suggesting that those currently working on the game's technical side are "clearly dumb and don't know what they're doing", and that "the world's greatest" technical staff "don't seem to know what [the user seems] to know".</p>

Randy Pitchford reckons you should "code your own engine".</figcaption></figure><p>For context,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-forward-report" rel="nofollow">launched on Friday</a>, has attracted a Mixed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">user review score</a> on Steam, with the majority of negative reviews pointing to sub-optimal performance as their reason for scoring the game negatively.</p>

<p>Some users are suggesting that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>runs poorly on hardware that's pretty new in PC terms, although others say that features like DLSS and frame generation alleviate the problem significantly.</p>

<p>Pitchford himself <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424849653236055" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recommends</a> that players use DLSS, since&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was "built to take advantage of it", dismissing criticisms of input latency and describing&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance on PC as "pretty damn optimal". He suggests PC gamers should "tune to [their] preferences using the tools available".</p>

<p>Despite these comments, it is worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>did receive <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an update</a> over the weekend, and that said update was intended to address "stability for a wide range of PCs", so it does look like Gearbox and publisher 2K intend to address these performance issues.</p>




<p><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game to come under fire for lackluster PC performance in recent years.</p>

<p>Others include the likes of Capcom's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-statement" rel="nofollow">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, as well as indie titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>, although none of these games are built on Unreal Engine 5, which some&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players are blaming for the game's issues.</p>

Within the first Galaxy game, Rosalina's backstory is revealed through pages of a storybook, with her journey through the stars explained as her searching for her long-lost parents. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rosalina's parentage is kept vague, with her mother pictured but kept largely obscured. But Nintendo is said to have once planned a more concrete backstory that linked Rosalina and the Mushroom Kingdom, with her being related to Princess Peach in some way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Years later, eagle-eyed fans spotted a mysterious tease within 2023's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, in a scene which sees Peach discuss her origins, and reveal how she first arrived in the Mushroom Kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You don't seem like you're from here," Mario says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't know where I'm from," Peach replies. "My earliest memory is arriving," she continues, as a flashback shows her, aged as a toddler, turning up in the Mushroom Kingdom via a warp pipe. Dressed in a skirt decorated with stars and moons, she is quickly found by a group of Toads. "I was so lucky they found me. They took me in, raised me like one of their own, and when I was ready they made me their princess."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/peach1-1757935750838.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Peach arrives in the Mushroom Kingdom, wearing a skirt featuring stars and moons.

Mario suggests, though Peach seems to disagree. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's a huge universe out there, with a lot of galaxies," she hints, as the camera pulls back to focus on the night sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a moment some fans believe is a nod towards Peach's own galactic origins — and with it, the link between her and Rosalina that Nintendo ultimately shied away from confirming long ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario games are not known for their story, and Super Mario Galaxy's director Yoshiaki Koizumi has admitted he wrote Galaxy's storybook in secret each evening, after other developers had left the office. Ultimately, he surprised even Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto with the idea, and an adapted version of his plans was ultimately included. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/peach2-1757935750839.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"There's a huge universe out there, with a lot of galaxies." Image credit: Nintendo/Illumination/Universal.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Without further detail on that link between the two characters, and with Nintendo seemingly keen to keep things vague, fans have been left to debate whether Peach might have once been planned as Rosalina's mother (or even the other way around), or alternatively if the pair were intended as siblings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Has Nintendo now softened its stance on keeping Rosalina's story a secret? Last week's Nintendo Direct also provided some clues. Koizumi and Miyamoto both appeared, with the former announcing a physical version of Galaxy's storybook as a tie-in product, and that additional storybook pages would be included for the first time in the Switch 2 re-releases of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Super Mario Galaxy Movie headed into space next year, fans may finally get some answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nitendo-switch-2-held-back-cpu/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unreal-engine-5-games-on-nintendo-switch-2-are-likely-held-back-by-the-system%E2%80%99s-cpu.1298019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Games powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> are likely held back by the system's CPU, and some engine updates, taking the system's specifications into account, will be required to implement some of the engine's trademark features on the console.</p>



<p>In a new analysis shared on YouTube, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tPvLuU_JxQ">Digital Foundry</a> take a look at the Unreal Engine 5-powered games now available on Nintendo Switch 2, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Fortnite, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a>, highlighting how all three games do not sport the engine's headline features like Lumen and Nanite. The fact that they are missing in Fortnite, in particular,  is rather telling, as it heavily suggests how the engine doesn't yet have a good preset to make an already released game run with these features at acceptable performance on Nintendo's new system. Having a high lower-level barrier to running high-level features like Lumen, Naninte and Virtual Shadow Maps, Cronos: The New Dawn and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/">Borderlands 4</a>, which will only launch on Nintendo Switch 2 next month, struggle to run smoohtly on a CPU like the Ryzen 5 3600, leading to a variety of issues, including traversal stuttering, which would be a lot worse on a slower CPU like the Switch 2's.</p>



<p>How the Nintendo Switch 2 CPU holds back Unreal Engine 5 games is made clearer by how Fortnite runs on the system. As highlighted in the Digital Foundry analysis, there are some sort of "transition zones" used to load new elements into the game, which show some frametime issues that would be significantly worse if the most demanding UE5 features were in. As such, at the current stage, there's likely no way to scale down these features to a level the Nintendo Switch 2 could handle them, having been developed with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S specs in mind, especially their CPUs, which are much faster than the Switch 2's. Like in the other consoles' case, it will take some dedicated work and some updates to create a good profile to run games with Lumen and Nanite on Nintendo Switch 2 at acceptable performance.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although it was suggested before release that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/">Nintendo Switch 2 CPU shouldn't have been a problem for games</a>, it looks like it is the most challenging aspect of the system, and not only in Unreal Engine 5 games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">The state of the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition Gamescom demo</a> also suggested how the system's CPU is impacting performance significantly, requiring more optimization work to make games run at acceptable, playable framerates.</p>

              <p>The Find My app makes keeping track of all your able stuff real simple. I’ve relied on it the time I left my iPhone behind at a restaurant, when I left a MacBook under the table at a coffee shop, and even when my Apple Watch fell into a river That one I never found, but hey, at least I knew it was in the river (I should really be taking better care of my things). The Find My app’s usefulness is undeniable, even if you’re just using it to track friends when at an event together or when traveling to a new city. Gee wiz, wouldn’t it be great if you could use that awesome feature on more than just an iPhone and other Apple stuff?</p>
<p>AirTags, people. That’s what you need. Amazon’s got a pretty stellar deal happening right now on a four-pack right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Normally going for $99, or about $25 each, the online retail giant has them for just $75</a>. The 24% discount shave’s $24 off the price, making them each average out to a a bit under $19.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keep Track of Everything</h2>
<p>These quarter-sized discs can be attached or placed inside of any amount of your belongings to make tracking them just as easy as it is for your iPhone. You can place on on a keychain so you don’t ever misplace your keys again. Stick one inside your wallet to that stops going missing around the house. Through one in a case with your Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck. The big brain move is for when you travel. Place one in each of your checked bags. I’ve had my luggage go missing before and just having one of these could have save days of headaches.</p>



<p>Setting up the Apple AirTags couldn’t be any easier. With just one tap, they will be paired with your iPhone or iPad. Once connected, they will each populate in the Find My app next to any Apple devices you may have. You can then give them individual names so you know what exactly you’re tracking. Name the one you put in your purse, “Purse.” Name the one on your keys, “Keys.” Name the—oh, you get.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Let’s say you know your keys or wallet or whatever the AirTag is in is somewhere in the house. You’re just not sure where exactly.</a> In the Find My app, you can initiate the AirTag to play a sound. They each have a built-in speaker so you can easily locate your belongings among your clutter or through various rooms of your home.</p>

Hell is Us creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête called the surprise release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> "a little callous", believing it had an impact on his game's sales.
</p>
<p>
Rogue Factor's adventure game was already locked in for its release ahead of Team Cherry's announcement, but the two games eventually released on the same day.
</p>
<p>
"When you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like – wow," said Jacques-Belletête on <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/">Skill Up's Friends Per Second podcast</a>. "As the '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> of indie'... to shadow drop something like this is a little callous."

<p>
After Team Cherry's announcement, the Hell is Us development team discussed with publisher Nacon whether to change the date. "It was a real thing," said Jacques-Belletête.
</p>
<p>
However, the "real pain in the ass", Jacques-Belletête explained, is that changing release date means refunding pre-orders. And while that wasn't a deciding factor, the team believed they could weather the storm.
</p>
<p>
Still, Jacques-Belletête admitted Silksong's release did impact the launch of Hell is Us. "I don't have any specific numbers,"he said, "at least not at this time. But for sure it did."
</p>
<p>
Above all, Jacques-Belletête highlighted the difficulties of finding an appropriate release window in the current climate.
</p>
<p>
"That's the thing nowadays, honestly – getting a window where you're pretty much alone is almost impossible," he said. "15 years ago, the mid-end of the summer was always a dead period. But there's no such thing anymore. It's just constant madness."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">Plenty of games did change their release date in the wake of Silksong's launch</a>, including Demonschool and Baby Steps.
</p>
<p>
"Hell is Us is an absorbing, nightmarish meditation on the horror of war, but divisive design choices prove tedious," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hell-is-us-review">Hell is Us review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It feels like ages since I’ve played a proper Japanese dungeon-crawler. Back in the 3DS and PS Vita era, we were spoiled for choice – a new&nbsp;<em>Etrian Odyssey&nbsp;</em>entry was always around the corner, the&nbsp;<em>Persona Q&nbsp;</em>spinoffs were coming out at a steady clip, and there was a horde of dungeon crawlers to choose from on the iconic PlayStation handheld. As the visual and content expectations for modern games has grown, it’s kind of outpaced the lo-fi and scrappy nature of a traditional first-person dungeon crawler. The only reason I’m diving into a new one now, that title being&nbsp;<em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster,&nbsp;</em>is because it’s an updated release and first-time localisation of a game that came out over 15 years ago. Diving into it now is a delightful blast from the past that I had no idea I was in such dire need of.</p>
<p>youtube.com/watch?v=kzICEVJisBU&amp;themeRefresh=1</p>
<p><em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> is a dungeon-crawler RPG that’s set against a school-setting backdrop. When you boot the game up, you’re given three different schools to choose from for your playthrough. While the flavour text makes it seem like this is just an aesthetic choice, the ramifications here are surprisingly huge. Your starting school not only dictates your character uniforms, but it also entirely changes the region you start in, the teachers you train with, the roles your characters can take on, and the quests you’re doing. </p>


<p>These changes in quests and locations also inherently lead to major differences in difficulty across the 3 schools. It’s a surprisingly inventive approach to “difficulty settings” that feels akin to the way an MMO will give you different starting regions based on your chosen race – and it’s something I’m surprised more games haven’t done.</p>
<p>Once you’re enrolled in school, the loop of the game is deceptively simple. You’ve got some barebones narrative reasons for going out into an escalating series of dungeons. As you explore, you’ll level up your characters, get money and materials to acquire new gear, run into incredibly difficult monsters, and acquire more levels and more gear until those monsters are milquetoast. Much like the&nbsp;<em>Disgaea&nbsp;</em>series, this game is built around giving you a sandbox to grind in, a massive amount of gear and unlockables to grind for, and leaving you to your own devices. As a result, it’s an incredibly love-it-or-hate-it kind of game.</p>


<p>Some quality-of-life features you might expect from a JRPG, for example, are entirely absent here – but they’re kind of absent on purpose. Battles can be repetitive and lengthy, yet there’s no way to speed them up or automatically squash lower-level foes. For a masochistic dungeon-crawler fan, that’s music to your ears. But if you’re someone who ends up bouncing off that kind of purposefully repetitive dungeoneering, there isn’t much else on offer in <em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> to occupy your time or make those encounters any less taxing. </p>
<p>One refreshing feature is the ability to swap your character classes at any time. This doesn’t lead to any sort of exciting dual-class or skill-inheritance systems, though – you can no longer use abilities from your previous class once you swap to a new one. Still, it’s nice to be able to make the mistake of leveling a class that isn’t working out for you and have an instant way to remedy that without feeling like that character is useless now.</p>

<p>Additionally, there’s a fun relationship-chart system in <em>Class of Heroes 3 Remaster</em> that I appreciated a lot. As you build your adventuring party, you’re also tasked with setting up a connective web of relationships between all of them and deciding which characters like each other or dislike each other. These connections can lead to buffs or debuffs in battle, and often times one character liking a different one can lead to another person in the party having negative feelings for someone as a result. </p>
<p>It’s all framed like one of those relationship charts out of a bonus manga chapter, and I love how it helps add an extra layer of self-driven roleplay to the experience. One of my favorite parts of an open-ended dungeon crawler like this is getting to craft my own stories and personalities for each character, and the game giving me a tool to cook up inter-party relationships on top of that is so fun.</p>

<p>Ultimately,&nbsp;<em>Class of Heroes 3&nbsp;</em>is an incredibly simple but dauntingly dense dungeon-crawler. There’s a massive amount of classes, enemies, gear, and skills to grind for and acquire. The grind to get all of those is going to be absolutely repetitive and mechanical, but that’s the kind of thing that makes a game like this so satisfying to dump time into.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="undertale 10th anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ab24f5e410d85/undertale-10th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to believe that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> is 10 years old, innit. A game that released just a year after the birth of my eldest son, and two before my youngest arrived on the scene. What is time? It's all going so quickly.</p>
<p>I bring my kids up here, not to be one of those tiresome people, but because Toby Fox's masterpiece (and you better believe that's exactly what it is) is a game that has the honour of being the first I was introduced to and drawn into entirely by the efforts of my terrible offspring.</p>
<p>Rather than the usual occurrence in our house, where I scream excitedly at them both that they simply must play the latest Very Shiny Thing™, as well as all of the classics — what kind of an education misses out on the classics? — that sit at the top of their respective genres. You know, a bit of the old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Mario</a> to cover platforming, a shot on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_ridge_racer">Ridge Racer</a> for everything they'll ever need from a driving game, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/battle_arena_toshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a> just for the hilarious graphics patter...all that sort of stuff that dads like me need to help us through our days.</p>

<p>I've always stuck to the safe bets, trying to gently introduce my sons to things they'll get a handle on quickly and then actually enjoy so they're not put off the hobby, but this has proven to be an idiotic approach. Yes, as it turns out, funnelling your kids through stuff that's deemed cool by you, or "appropriate" for kids by the industry, is perhaps preventing them from chancing upon something that genuinely, in real time, could have a positive effect on their lives.</p>
<p>What on earth am I talking about? Well, Undertale, if you haven't played it, is the sort of game that doesn't perhaps grab your attention straight away, hence why I had totally missed it back at release. I will also admit that I still wasn't really bothered, even when I caught a glimpse of some seriously good-looking review scores. It just didn't seem like my sort of thing. What an absolute balloon animal I have been in my previous life.</p>
<p>Because now, 10 years down the line, I can't really remember a time when my eldest hasn't been either talking about Undertale, making little Undertale projects on his PC, or quoting the game in every situation he can get away with. Even more pleasingly for me, he's taken up piano and keyboard (and has been eyeing up my incredibly dusty guitar), all thanks to his love affair with this game's masterful soundtrack. Did you know Undertale has one of the greatest soundtracks in video games? No? Well, my friend, now you do. Indeed, I reckon we're looking at a top-five spot without any issues. Fight me.</p>

<p>Toby Fox's chiptune masterpiece takes in a crazy amount of influences and spins them into gamified bangers. There's acid house here, jazz, choral, hardcore breakbeat...and I know, I know, with so many influences surely the end result is some fine-but-watered-down tributes. Wrong! These songs, songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ9XtKJHvjQ">Heartache</a> (the first where I was like "Okay, this actually slaps"), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKAiUtWZ4xY">Bonetrousle</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEbHopRL0OA">Stronger Monsters</a> (incredibly hardcore stuff) and on and on.</p>
<p>You gotta go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BR7-AzE2dQ&amp;list=OLAK5uy_l6pEkEJgy577R-aDlJ3Gkp5rmlgIOu8bc">check this album out</a> if you haven't already heard it. It's important. That is a fact. It has significant cultural importance, I feel, and part of this, besides the obvious popularity of the game, is how I have watched this music positively affect and inform my children.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna talk about the story of Undertale here, it's a game I've played a bunch of times now, but always in fragments; repeated, never in order, broken up with kids' arguments or other things to do in the house. It's also something you should just go away and play and experience on your own for maximum effect without having any information relayed or spoiled. But as much as it's fully suitable, in my opinion, for kids, it also doesn't shy away from some weird, weird s***.</p>

<p>Neither does it step back from dark themes and real-life stuff. Death and all that crap. Eating too much and feeling sick afterwards. Y'know, the big things. There are lessons, lessons that stay with you — and I've watched them stay with my eldest as he'll still reference the game or a character (Sans is a constant in our house) in discussions — about violence and where it leads to, about greed, about making the right choice at the right time, about having to live with the consequences of the things you've done.</p>
<p>I mean, <em>steady on</em>, that's a bit much for the kiddies, no? Maybe take a break and play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/race_with_ryan">Race With Ryan?</a> Let's never do that.</p>
<p>As much as things can get a bit edgy at times, it's these aspects of Undertale, and especially if you are playing it with younger gamers present, that makes almost every screen a delight, because you've now got the onscreen puzzles (top tier across the board) sat alongside the real world mental puzzle of explaining things delicately to your children as they crop up. I mean, a father threatens his own son at one point in this game. How do you think that went? It's fun to learn together!</p>
<p>It's not hard to see how it's got such a cult following, considering all of this, and how it gives younger gamers so much to chew on and come back to time and again.</p>

<p>Finally, and another delightful thing, especially for a parent, is watching how much both of my kids have got into all sorts of actual messy art-attacking (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsHuNuoAfV0">hi, Neil!</a>) off the back of the unique pixel style that Toby Fox used for Undertale. These characters and situations are easy to recreate, to add to your backpack (and draw all over your mum's office).</p>
<p>It all opens doors to creativity and, alongside the music aspects, and the little life lessons we've discussed as they've played and replayed the game over the years (you better believe these guys are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> fans now, btw), Undertale has gone from something that would very definitely have passed me by, into something that has become an important, relatively speaking, part of my relationship with my kids.</p>
<p>So that's nice. Happy birthday, Undertale. I still have to use a guide to play you when my kids aren't around, and I'm not even ashamed to admit it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gearbox-boss-tells-%E2%80%984k-stubborn%E2%80%99-players-to-switch-to-1440p-or-use-dlss-in-borderlands-4-in-place-of-native-rendering.1297989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox is probably happy overall about the Borderlands 4 launch, which quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke series records</a> for concurrent players active on the Steam platform and did it again this weekend, topping 304K players sixteen hours ago. However, it also has to deal with performance complaints for the PC version, which have been voiced loudly in over 16 thousand and a half Steam reviews, which are currently 'Mixed' (67% rating).</p>



<p>Gearbox Software co-founder and president Randy Pitchford tried to address the performance <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a lengthy X thread</a>, alleging that there are some '4K stubborn' PC players who either don't have the hardware to run the game at Ultra HD resolution and should switch to 1440P, or perhaps do not want to use upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS even if they have access to them.</p>



<p><em>I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4K with ultra max settings and using 2-3 year old hardware. You do you, but Borderlands 4 and UE5 are doing a lot, and for me, that trade-off for frames isn’t worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade-off - the game looks amazing at 1440p. If you’re not 4K stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution. If you’ve got a beast of a video card, you’re probably fine at 4K. But if you’re in the middle or close to min spec, I would definitely recommend making that trade.</em></p>



<p><em>If you have a DLSS option, use it! Especially if you’re trying to run at resolutions higher than 1080p. This is a campaign game - you’re not competing in high-stakes esports here. The input latency is so insanely negligible that less than .01% of the population could reliably detect it without tools in a blind test. Take the W on frame rate and use this incredible tech with DLSS on.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, many comments that can be read not only on Steam but also on Reddit, X, and other social channels are from users who insist on using native rendering only. As seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's benchmarks</a>, even the most powerful graphics card available on the market, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090, stops at around 48 frames per second with maxed settings and 4K native resolution. But games are not designed anymore to be running at native resolution, and to be honest, they haven't been for a long time on either PC or consoles. Besides, with the latest NVIDIA DLSS transformer model and AMD FSR 4 (which can be enabled at a driver level by 9000 series users), the visual quality is excellent and the performance gains are massive.</p>



<p>The Gearbox executive eventually <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answered</a> one such comment that invited the studio to make their game 'look good without AI upscale'. As usual, Pitchford did not mince words:</p>



<p><em>Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please. We will be your customer when you pull it off. The people doing it now are clearly dumb and don’t know what they’re doing and all the support and recommendations and code and architecture from the world’s greatest hardware companies and tech companies working with the world’s greatest real time graphics engine coders don’t know what you seem to know.</em></p>



<p>While there is an argument to be made that Borderlands 4 perhaps doesn't look as good as it should for how taxing it is on hardware, and Gearbox absolutely has work to do to improve performance through patches, deliberately choosing to keep AI upscaling disabled when both current hardware and software are designed with that in mind feels like living in the past.</p>



<p>In other Borderlands 4 news, the studio <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> there is no spyware in the game. The first PC mods have already been uploaded to Nexus, and we've listed a few useful ones <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-borderlands-4-mods-remove-outlines-bloom-fog-tweak-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>.</p>

            <p>
Stop Destroying Videogames - the European campaign inspired by the Stop Killing Games movement - has shared a progress update as EU countries continue verifying petition signatures, saying it's preparing for the next stage, which will include "countering misinformation and industry lobbying".
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames is looking to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." To that end, it turned to the European Citizens' Initiative - an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">successfully surpassed 1.4m signatures</a> before the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">petition</a> closed in July.
</p>
<p>
With several months having passed since then, Stop Destroying Videogames organisers have now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1nfvxk1/campaign_update/">shared a progress update on the Stop Killing Games subreddit</a>. At present, the post explained, all signatures are being checked by national authorities. As previously noted, if 1m signatures are successfully verified (the post adds "early reports from several countries show around 97 percent of signatures being valid"), the petition can then be presented to the EU for either a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. "That moment will mark the start of the legislative phase," the post continues, "where the Commission and Parliament must decide how to respond."

<p>
While verification continues - a process that should take around three months - Stop Destroy Videogames is preparing for the next stage of its campaign. The goal, organisers explain, is to ensure "our initiative cannot be ignored", and so it's working toward, "Legislative outreach to Members of Parliament and the Commission; countering misinformation and industry lobbying; strengthening our community structures to support this next stage." Some work will, by necessity, remain behind the scenes. "Past attempts to undermine the initiative," organisers write, "have shown us the risks of being too open."
</p><p>
Stop Destroying Videogames also noted some "long-time contributors" - including Ross Scott, the figurehead of the main Stop Killing Games initiative - have "stepped back" after years of effort. In a follow-up comment, Ross clarified, "It's more like I'm 'on call' for anything where me being involved would help a lot. Most of what's happening now is best left to people familiar with EU political processes like Mortiz [Katzner], so I'm leaving most things to people who know what they're doing better than I do to maximise our odds."
</p>
<p>
"This campaign exists only because of you," the post concludes, "and with your continued support we can make sure our voices are heard in Brussels."

<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a89261df84c13/final-fantasy-vii-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> is heading to the Switch 2 on <strong>22nd February 2026</strong>, finally letting both fans and newcomers experience Square Enix's ambitious reimagining on a Nintendo console since its initial release in 2020. Not only that, but the entire remake trilogy, including Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and an as-yet untitled third entry, is also bound for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a complete newcomer to FF7 (or indeed Final Fantasy in general) then you might be pleased to know that <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch2-xbox-series-x-s">Square Enix is introducing</a> a whole bunch of difficulty / progression features to the Switch 2 version to make the game much (<em>much</em>) easier.</p>
<p>This isn't just a case of making enemies weaker or giving you more experience points, though. No no – much like the re-release of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> on Switch, you can effectively break the game by giving yourself unlimited HP, MP, Limit Gauge, and ATB Gauge. Oh, and you can also deal 9,999 damage with every attack, if you wish.</p>
<p>So let's go over exactly how Square Enix breaks it down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- HP is always full</strong> - your HP is at its maximum value at all times. Even when hit by an enemy, your HP won’t go down. Instant death is also removed (sorry Tonberries!)</p>
<p>- <strong>MP is always full</strong> - your MP is always at its maximum value. Sling out spells with wild abandon!</p>
<p>- <strong>Limit gauge is always full</strong> - the Limit gauge is at maximum when you enter battle, and using powerful Limit Breaks won’t deplete it.</p>
<p>- <strong>ATB gauge is always full</strong> - your ATB gauge is always maxed out, so you can unleash abilities as much as you want without restriction!</p>
<p>- <strong>Damage dealt is always 9999</strong> - with this set on, you’ll do maximum damage with every attack. No boss can stand against you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth reiterating that these are completely optional, so if you want to experience Final Fantasy VII Remake as intended, then you can just ignore these. But for those who might be struggling or simply want to enjoy the story, then it's great to have options.</p>

            <p>Oh, Netflix's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/the-witcher">The Witcher TV series</a> is back with its fourth series next month, following a lengthy hiatus that's seen Geralt regenerate from Henry Cavill into Liam Hemsworth. The new series premieres in late October, and first official looks at both the HemsGerry and Laurence Fishburne as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine">Blood and Wine</a> vampire Regis have been offered.</p>
<p>Hang on a minute, I thought, when I scrolled past this news on one of the screens in my Adrian Veidt-esque world-watching setup - Laurence Fishburne's in it? Yep, it seems that after not getting around to watching the third series, I've managed to completely blot out all knowledge that the actor behind The Matrix's pill distributor is being cast in The Witcher.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Netflix announced season four's October 30th arrival date yesterday, amid some sort of boxing fight that I'm sure paled in comparison to the scrap Gerry has with a Skelligean bear in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>. With it came the first proper clip of Liam Hemsworth portraying Geralt, after Henry Cavill <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/henry-cavill-will-be-replaced-as-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-four">opted to make series three his last in the role</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure new Geralt staring at a wraith that springs out of a tomb like a jack-in-the-box, before he casually removes its heart like someone gently unplugging a table lamp was meant to be as funny as I've found it. But otherwise it's a decent, if pretty unremarkable, first glimpse at Hemsworth killing monsters.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Continent awaits. Here’s your exclusive first clip of Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher Season 4. Returns 30th October, only on Netflix. <a href="https://t.co/CTvryeUmRd">pic.twitter.com/CTvryeUmRd</a></p>— The Witcher (@witchernetflix) <a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1967038088867102733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, official photos have been put out, with one being of Fishburne as Regis, while others show Anya Chalotra and Freya Allan continuing as Yennefer and Ciri respectively. I'll be honest, seeing what the former does is one of the few things that might persuade me to get back into this Witcher adaptation. I watched the first couple of series right after they came out, and while they certainly weren't terrible, they didn't grab me enough to stick around through series three.</p>
<p>There's a good chance part of that's just down to my enjoyment of The Witcher being much more firmly rooted in wielding the twin swords myself via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">CD Projekt's games</a>. I've read the books, but their tales aren't the main thing that got me into Gerald from the Riviera's adventures. Ok, you got me, I just like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-netflixs-witcher-isnt-based-on-the-games-why-that-shot-of-geralt-in-the-bath">shots of hairy fantasy lads in the bath</a>. That said, given the hiatus and departure of the series' primary face in Cavill, Hemsworth's got a tough task convincing those who were on the fence after series three.</p>
<p>Best of luck to him given that unenviable position, as well as both Chalotra and Allan, who I reckon did really well with what they were given in the first two series. Oh, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-took-about-10-minutes-to-write">toss a coin song bloke</a>, can't forget about him either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>My Arcade has produced a number of miniature retro arcade cabinets supporting officially-licensed games from developers like Capcom and Sega. But now, they’ve just launched an Atari gaming handheld, the Gamestation Go, that just looks beautiful. Pre-orders have opened up earlier this week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4110/">You can head on over to Amazon to reserve yours at a price of $180.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4110/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>200+ Video Games</h2>
<p>The library is impressively stacked. Over 200 video games from yester-year, spanning the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari 7800 along with Atari Arcade as well as Jaleco and PIKO platforms. Play titles like&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em>,<em> PAC-MAN</em>, <em>Balls of Steel,&nbsp;</em><em>Missile Command</em>, Centipede, and <em>Asteroids</em>. They all come pre-loaded, no download necessary. It does state is has built-in Wi-Fi for easy updates, but it’s unclear if that could mean more games added at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Design-wise the Atari Gamestation Go looks similar to a Nintendo Switch at a glance, with controller inputs along the side of a big 7-inch display. Also, like a Nintendo Switch, you can play its games on your TV. No dock required. Just a simple HDMI cable will allow you to put these classic titles on the big screen. You’ll probably want one with some decent length though as you’ll still be using the Atari handheld as the controller. It’s battery life will grant you about four to five hours of playtime on a single charge.</p>



<p>The original Atari consoles were well before we established the quintessential layout and design of modern video game controllers. My Arcade’s Atari handheld looks backward to the weird oddities of these old controllers, implementing multiple options like a trak-ball and numeric keypad. You can play these Atari titles authentically to these quirky inputs you just don’t see any more.</p>
<p>There are also all the modern conveniences like an analog stick, D-pad, bumpers and classic A-B-X-Y gamepad buttons (Notably in Xbox’s layout with the A button at the bottom). The various buttons, sticks, and other inputs are all illuminated with SmartGlow technology to both see the inputs in the dark and, more importantly, look cool.</p>
<p>The price point or $180 is a little rough.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4110/"> That’s more than half the cost of a Nintendo Switch for a console that just plays games from the 80s that are pretty easy to get your hands on for next to nothing elsewhere</a>. This seems like a collector novelty more than anything, but definitely a cool thing to pick up if you want to escape skill trees and battle passes for awhile.</p>
<p>The Atari Gamestation Go is available to pre-order at Amazon and is set to release October 31 of this year.</p>

That’s the real, ‘How you gonna do this?’ — now you need to rebuild them. We didn’t say, ‘Oh my god, we have to do it, but we can’t because of that.'

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The programmers back then were afraid of bugs…"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy series’ iconic victory fanfare has been a staple feature for the majority of the long-running RPG franchise since the very first entry in 1987. However, series composer Nobuo Uematsu recently revealed that a music programmer’s accidental discovery was what enabled him to give Final Fantasy’s battle themes and fanfare a truly punchy, driving drumbeat for the very first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a recent sold-out event reported on by <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/kikaku/2045647.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameWatch</u></a>, Uematsu talked in detail about Final Fantasy III's score and its development. With a soundtrack that incorporated a wider variety of tunes including comical pieces, Uematsu credits Final Fantasy III as a turning point in which he established his approach to composing music for RPGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uematsu emphasized that there was a stark difference in Final Fantasy III’s music quality compared to Final Fantasy I and Final Fantasy II, even though they were composed using the same equipment and for the same console (the Famicom / NES). Although most games only used four of the NES’s audio channels, Uematsu revealed that Final Fantasy III made heavy use of a particular drum sound on the fifth channel, which was discovered completely by accident during development.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/14/gettyimages-156598107-1757879498904.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nobuo Uematsu has discussed the creation of Final Fantasy's iconic victory fanfare. Photo by David Wolff - Patrick/Redferns via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Uematsu recalls that the game’s music programmer Hiroshi Nakamura came to him one day with a kick drum-like sound he had discovered. Uematsu was very excited to make use of this. Although the NES’s “white noise” channel could be used for hi-hat and snare drum-like percussion effects, this kick drum sound provided exactly what Uematsu had been looking for to add a more driving rhythm to battle themes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Nakamura expressed misgivings, concerned that it may cause issues with the game. Uematsu explained: "The programmers back then were afraid of bugs and so they didn't want to play that kick drum sound," adding that he reassured them that he would stop using the kick drum sound if it caused problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, no such issues occurred. Uematsu successfully used this drum sound to create a punchier version of the fanfare, as well as to add a driving drum beat to battle themes. He particularly highlighted how important Nakamura’s kick drum was to Final Fantasy III’s ‘This is the Last Battle,’ and proudly observed that the first four bars “still have a rich sound even today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even 35 years on, Uematsu said that he still really wants to know exactly how Nakamura came across the drum sound, but apparently the music programmer no longer remembers. Uematsu joked that "he must have had his memory erased by aliens."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The NES had only five audio channels. The “pulse wave” channels 1 and 2 were the main ones used for melodies, “triangle wave” channel 3 was often used for basslines, and channel 4 was for “white noise." Channel 5 was for PCM samples (which could be used for comparatively higher quality sounds, such as voice samples). "I didn't know about that fifth channel (at the time)," revealed Uematsu, adding that such samples took up a lot of memory so "hardly anyone used it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Uematsu, he asked a younger colleague for their opinion on how the sound was created. “I wasn’t an engineer back then so I don’t know the details, but I think they were definitely doing something with the PCM channel,” they supplied, surmising that if Final Fantasy III’s devs were able to produce the drum sound without using imported waveform data, they may have cleverly utilized the PCM channel's on/off function. The act of switching the channel on and off might have been used to produce this sound without using up limited memory. However, this will remain a mystery until someone who actually worked on the game reveals exactly how it was done (if anyone remembers).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uematsu credits Hiroshi Nakamura’s involvement in Final Fantasy III for helping him to shape his ideas into music and convincing him that incorporating varied types of music (such as comical pieces) made RPG soundtracks more interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by David Wolff - Patrick/Redferns via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

                <p>Mega Man fans haven't seen Capcom's iconic hero in his own game since since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mega-man-11-review-an-uneven-retro-romp/1900-6417003/" data-ref-id="1900-6417003">Mega Man 11</a> in 2018, but the franchise hasn't been forgotten. 2026 will mark the 20th anniversary of the Mega Man Star Force games, and Capcom is celebrating by bringing all seven titles together in the Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KG9kEUxNOA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8KG9kEUxNOA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In 2006, Mega Man Star Force was the follow-up to the Mega Man Battle Network games. Star Force introduced players to a young boy named Geo Stelar who became a new Mega Man after merging with an alien, Omega-Xis, two hundred years after the final Battle Network game. Their adventures unfolded in seven action-RPG games before concluding in Mega Man Star Force 3: Red Joker in 2008.</p><p>The seven Star Force games in the Legacy Collection are listed below:</p><ul><li>Mega Man Star Force Pegasus</li><li>Mega Man Star Force Leo</li><li>Mega Man Star Force Dragon</li><li>Mega Man Star Force 2 Zerker x Ninja</li><li>Mega Man Star Force 2 Zerker x Saurian</li><li>Mega Man Star Force 3 Black Ace</li><li>Mega Man Star Force 3 Red Joker</li></ul><p>Since these games were originally designed for the Nintendo DS, the Legacy Collection will feature a dual-screen style that features both screens on a single TV screen. The Legacy Collection will also have an "enhanced experience" and allow players to trade card and battle each other online.</p><p>Capcom hasn't set a specific date for Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection beyond a vague 2026 release window. The game will be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p><p>Earlier this year, Capcom reiterated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-is-still-one-of-capcoms-most-important-franchises-company-says/1100-6532998/" data-ref-id="1100-6532998">Mega Man is one of its most important franchises</a>. While there isn't any word about a new game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-animated-series-blu-ray-discotek-classic-video-game-cartoons/1100-6533981/" data-ref-id="1100-6533981">the original Mega Man animated series</a> is coming to Blu-ray on October 28.</p>
