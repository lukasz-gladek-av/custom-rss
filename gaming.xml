			<p>Following the surprising <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teaser trailer</a> for The Witcher IV, CD Projekt RED has begun sharing a few more tidbits about the already massively anticipated open world roleplaying game. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> more about Ciri's new role as the protagonist and who's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voicing</a> her in the new game.</p>
<p>While in Los Angeles for The Game Awards 2024, CD Projekt RED also joined Easy Allies for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmbhFPninuw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thirty-minute long videocast</a> entirely dedicated to this reveal. To begin with, in case you had any doubts about the presence of the Gwent card mini-game, they've provided reassurance on that front.</p>
<p><em><strong>Gosia Mitręga (VP and Executive Producer):</strong> We really love the game and we also really carefully always listen to the community, which we love. It's an amazing one. I don't think anyone will be disappointed.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sebastian Kalemba (Game Director):</strong> Yeah, for sure. You know, it's a part of the experience.</em></p>
<p>The conversation then moved on to some of the elements that were glimpsed in the trailer, such as the magic chain summoned by Ciri and her new powers as a whole. On this topic, Kalemba said:</p>
<p><em>The chain is not only a utility tool that comes from the school of the Lynx, but also it's a pretty cool reference to the very first initial trailer we released 20 years ago for Striga, which was inspired heavily by a short story by Andre sap Koski where Geralt is literally using a silver chain to fight a Striga, so that's kind of a segue. That's one thing. The second thing, for those who don't know, Ciri is a pretty special being. She's a Source. That means that she has this Elder Blood, and she's a pretty powerful human. In this world, there's a magic, a Source that you can control and catalyze to create a spell, like Yennefer, Triss, or other mages in this world. Siri, as a powerful Source, after being mutated, is also able to use this magic, as Geralt could use Signs, which are like simplified magic.</em></p>
<p><em>Ciri is literally using energy. Actually, in The Witcher IV trailer, she's taking it out of the water, which is one of the elements that are part of the Source, so she's kind of extracting the energy out of this particular element and catalyzing it to create a bolt to build this opportunity window and defeat the monster.</em></p>
<p>The hosts from Easy Allies also asked about the game's adherence to the various endings players could unlock in the previous installment. Is the one in which Ciri becomes a Witcher the canon ending? Kalemba was vague on this subject, although it seems likely, given what we saw in the trailer.</p>
<p><em>We cannot tell you more right now, but definitely, we will refer to The Wild Hunt endings for sure, because we pay a lot of respect to the canon. For us, canon is Andrzej Sapkowski's literature and, of course, our games.&nbsp;This is one common world. The Witcher IV happens a few years after The Wild Hunt. Geralt will appear, and who knows who else.</em></p>
<p>In the videocast, the CD Projekt RED developers also teased an enhanced monster hunting experience that will be very much core to The Witcher IV. It was also confirmed that the village featured in the trailer, which is located in the far North, will also be in the game.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there is no release date yet for the game. While we patiently wait, stay tuned to get all the latest rumors and news on the project.</p>

            <p>Toy Box sounds like a very Xmassy game, but then you watch a trailer, and realise that it is not very Xmassy at all. It's a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you're a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either "salvage" them or "sentence" them to the incinerator.</p><!--more-->
<p>The toys can be "sentenced" because the toys appear to be alive. They talk to you and share their memories as you pull them apart. The obvious thing to do is salvage them all - after all, who'd throw a miniature talking ballerina in the furnace? But the toys are Not Nice. Their talk is of suffering and malice, darkness and blood. Some of them have glowing eyes and teeth. And then there's the enigma of the Grand Toy Maker, who returns periodically to evaluate your choices. "It's of the utmost importance that inspectors upkeep the Maker's image," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3341830/TOY_BOX/">the Steam page</a>, not very reassuringly.</p>

<p>I haven't played all of Toy Box because, frankly, the subject matter is too much for me. I mean, look at the content warnings. There's "no explicit imagery of sexual acts", but there is pretty much everything else, including "visual and written depictions" of "Blood, Body Horror, Gore, Death, Unreality, Child Abuse, Pseudo-Jumpscares, Motion Sickness, Flashing Lights, Religious Themes, Swearing, [and] Violence."</p><p>From what I've played, the ghastliness of Toy Box is partly just the fundamental uncanniness of toys, the grey zone they inhabit between objects and companions, though it's possible the eventual and more straightforward twist is that these manky ornaments are possessed. The game doesn't feel gratuitous or pornographic in its handling of the above themes, but it's certainly disturbing: the worst of Pinocchio with a generous helping of FNAF and Thomas Ligotti.</p>
<p>Developers DEADline Studios are "a small POC and Queer-owned studio" who "seek to relay stories about just what it means to be human and dive deeper into the good, the bad, and the downright ugly". There's plenty of the latter here. Their other projects include <a href="https://deadline-co.itch.io/fools-paradise">Fool's Paradise</a>, a satirical horror visual novel with romantic elements.</p>
<p>I'm writing about Toy Box partly because it's been a while since I last had to stop playing a horror game, and partly because I think the premise of telling stories by dismantling objects is wonderful, and I'd like to see more of it. It doesn't have to involve horror - the closest parallel I can think of right now is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>. Which is, I guess, a pretty horrible game in its portrayal of indentured servitude and self-cloning, but at least those spaceships don't beg for mercy when you disassemble them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But <em>Rivals</em> uses it differently from what you might expect. The game uses Ace two separate ways. One refers to more of a title or status, while the other refers to a specific gameplay situation. The identical naming has certainly caused some confusion for players. </p><h2 id="h1893"><a id="score"></a>What does ‘Ace’ mean on a scoreboard?</h2><p>The first usage of Ace you’ll likely see is on the scoreboard. Check in midway through a match, and you’ll see one player on each team with the word displayed over their character portrait. <strong>Whichever player has the Ace term is essentially the one performing the best.</strong> If they keep the title throughout the match, they’ll likely be who you see as the MVP or SVP. Those familiar with <em>Overwatch</em> will recognize this as similar to the On Fire system.</p><p>The scoreboard is pretty minimal on details for other players otherwise. If you’re wondering how Ace is determined and why someone with fewer kills than you has the title, it’s likely because they made up for it with better heals, more blocked damage, or more time on the objective.</p><h2 id="h1894"><a id="kill"></a>How to get an ‘Ace Kill’</h2><figure id="" data-id="04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-recommend-id="image://04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-recommend-id="image://04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll also see the term pop up in the middle of your screen during a match sometimes. <strong>It’s a little awkward, but Ace is also used as the name of <em>Marvel Rival</em>’s version of a team kill.</strong> Don’t worry, it’s not like you have to solo the whole team yourself. You’ll be notified that an Ace occurred even if you’re walking back from the respawn area.</p><p>Of course, actively participating and taking out most of the enemy team does feel pretty great. The best way to do this is to work together with your teammates and coordinate your attacks. That’s easier when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-crossplay-xbox-pc-playstation-1851715183&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-crossplay-xbox-pc-playstation-1851715183">playing with friends</a></span>, but the Ping system is still useful for relaying information. Having one person immobilize the opponents while someone else picks them off is always a great strategy. Making a move when the other team is all concentrated in one area is also a wonderful opportunity to make use of.</p><p><strong>The easiest way to get an Ace kill is to use ultimate abilities at the right moment.</strong> Most will dish out a lot of damage quickly or over a large area. Be smart with them and you can KO multiple players in one go. The following are ones that I’ve seen lead to an Ace kill the most often:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">Jeff The Land Shark</a></span> – It’s Jeff!</li><li>Moon Knight – Hand of Khonshu</li><li>Psylocke – Dance of the Butterfly</li><li>Scarlet Witch – Reality Erasure</li><li>Spider-Man – Spectacular Spin</li><li>Storm – Omega Hurricane</li></ul><p>We don’t know if Ace will remain the name for these two situations in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>as the game continues to receive updates. Gaining the Ace status on the scoreboard after helping to get an unrelated-in-name Ace kill is pretty confusing. Either way, I hope you can come away from this with a better understanding of both.

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket launched Mythical Island and new Themed Collections to give players fresh objectives and rewards to chase. Each collection is different, and there aren’t too many to worry about. We’ve provided this handy guide telling you all about Mythical Island’s Themed Collections and what you need to do.</p>



<p>Themed Collections are another of Pokémon TCG Pocket’s many features. They are passive challenges rewarding you with amazing goodies, allowing you to open packs faster—a win-win! Genetic Apex has a set of Themed Collections, and Pokémon TCG Pocket’s first mini-set—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a>—has its own.</p>



<p>I’ve made this nice and easy by letting you know how many Mythical Island collections there are to complete, as well as the rewards for doing each.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-mythical-island-themed-collections-are-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How Many Mythical Island Themed Collections Are in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Open packs, and get rewards. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Mythical Island expansion has 13 Themed Collections for you to complete.</strong></p>



<p>These are an entirely new set of Themed Collections from Genetic Apex or any other set in <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>. As usual, they require you to <strong>open booster packs</strong>—in this case, for Mythical Island—and collecting certain cards goes a long way to completing Themed Collections.</p>



<p>The reality is, you can’t manufacture the cards you pull for now. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Picks</a> provide an extra chance to get a card you might need, and it remains to be seen if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a> makes this task easier.</p>

It kicks off with anniversary concerts in Poland and Boston, Massachusetts in May 2025, before a tour of Europe in the fourth quarter of 2025 and then the U.S. in the first quarter of 2026.

In many ways it would make sense, given both Tekken and Pac-Man are owned by Bandai Namco, and The Swordsman is an actual humanoid fighter who wields a sword. But what does Harada himself think?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to the man himself in a recent interview, and his response suggested such a crossover is certainly possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Perhaps,” Harada responded when asked, “because the game environment would be a good crossover for Tekken, atmosphere-wise.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out that Harada explored the possibility of adding Pac-Man to Tekken as a guest character long before Shadow Labyrinth was a thing. But designs for the character, which saw Pac-Man as a head on a muscular humanoid body, horrified original Pac-Man creator Tōru Iwatani.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Many years ago, Iwatani-san, the original creator of Pac-Man, was still in the company when we were here. And I thought about maybe using Pac-Man as a guest character,” Harada remembered. “So I had the artist come up with a sketch and it turned out to be that the character had like a Pac-Man head, but the body was this really muscular bodybuilder type.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I showed it to Iwatani-san, and Iwatani-san got so upset and scolded me quite heavily. So I was surprised that, ‘Oh, I can't just be quite liberal with the Pac-Man IP, I have to be more constrained.’ At the time I was a bit surprised, but now because of the atmosphere of this [Shadow Labyrinth], it's something that could be considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iwatani, by the way, is apparently fully on board with Bandai Namco’s plan to take the Pac-Man IP in totally different directions. “Iwatani-san seems to realize that that's something that's needed at this point,” Harada added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2D action platformer Shadow Labyrinth stars The Swordsman, a character whose only goal is to "eat" as they attempt to escape a maze. It’s a Metroidvania of sorts, and a significant departure for the world famous arcade franchise. Meanwhile, Tekken 8 gets Clive from Final Fantasy 16 as a DLC character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-game-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-nintendo-game-of-2024.1063563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-game-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 will likely be remembered as a transitional year for Nintendo. Last year saw heavy hitters like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder while next year is all about the Nintendo Switch 2, leaving this year in kind of an awkward middle ground. Even so, Switch owners still had a ton of great games to play during the aging console’s eighth year on the market as Nintendo somehow managed to publish a game every single month, while third-party and indie developers continued to support Switch with awesome series revivals and clever new ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many fans were begging to turn the page to the next generation, Nintendo proved Switch still had enough in the tank for one more year with a surprise Zelda game where you actually play as Princess Zelda, our favorite Mario Party in years, and a whole lot more. These are the best Nintendo games of 2024, starting off with the honorable mentions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Nintendo Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A couple of titles just barely missed out making our top tier or picks for the year. For years, the concept of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake</a> felt as mythical and unattainable as opening the titular door itself, but Nintendo finally listened to this RPG’s extremely vocal fanbase and delivered a near perfect retelling of Mario’s iconic GameCube quest. It’s remarkable how well The Thousand-Year Door holds up 20 years later, with its hilarious script, satisfying combat, lovable party members, and memorable locations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario literally climbs the ranks of a pro wrestling league set on a floating island in the sky, and that’s just the setting for one chapter of this epic adventure. And, following the last few Paper Mario entries that traded in unique, original characters in favor of hordes upon hordes of samey Toads, it’s a complete delight to see the slimy city of Rogueport and its surrounding areas peppered with fresh personalities. Simply giving The Thousand-Year Door a gorgeous new coat of paint and sprinkling in a few quality-of-life improvements has instantly placed it on the list of the best RPGs on Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble,</a> a stunning return to form for a series that had completely lost its way for the better part of the last two decades. After several misguided attempts to get the monkey ball rolling again, the pieces finally fell into place in Banana Rumble thanks to the tightest controls, physics, and level design the series has seen since Super Monkey Ball 2 in 2003. Tilting the stage to roll your monkey to the finish feels right again, and the new spin dash ability significantly opens up speedrunning and trick shot techniques without feeling like a betrayal to Monkey Ball’s core mechanics like some past gimmicks did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t hold back by the end either, with devilish late-game obstacles that will throw your monkey off the stage dozens of times before you finally break through that sweet, sweet goal. It’s also a fantastic game to play with others, as you can tackle all of Banana Rumble’s 200+ stages in local or online co-op with up to four players. It may not quite soar to the lofty heights of the GameCube originals, but it’s undeniable that Super Monkey Ball is back after years of fall outs, and I’m both shocked and overjoyed I get to say that in 2024.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Super Mario Party Jamboree</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/smp-jam-blogroll-1728690742214-1734443527122.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we move onto the runner-ups – the games that narrowly missed out on the top spot. First is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review">Super Mario Party Jamboree,</a> one of Nintendo’s finest efforts of 2024, which simultaneously became a go-to multiplayer game on Switch and a standout entry in the longrunning dice-rolling, backstabbing series. It has pretty much everything you’d want from a great Mario Party: a wonderful set of seven boards each with their own unique wrinkles, an incredibly fun and varied set of minigames you’ll want to return to again and again, and a huge roster of 22 playable characters filled with both fan favorites and deep cuts. Plus, if you’ve been on the wrong end of one too many Chance Times or Bowser Revolutions and just can’t take it anymore, the all-new optional Pro Rules offer an alternative take on Mario Party that lessen the luck-based elements and emphasize skill and strategy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree is particularly exciting because it’s easily the best original Mario Party game developed by Nintendo Cube, the studio that’s been in charge of the series since 2012’s Mario Party 9. The developers spent years trying to completely transform the Mario Party formula – from putting all four players into a car, to having everyone take their turn at the same time – and it just never really worked. But the Switch era represents a comeback story for the Mario Party series, beginning with Super Mario Party which was a step in the right direction, but still not entirely there. Then, Nintendo Cube returned to the franchise’s greatest hits in Mario Party Superstars, which was a ton of fun, but it wasn’t original content. Finally, the Mario Party comeback arc is complete with new boards, items, and minigames that stand side-by-side with the greats and cement Jamboree as a modern multiplayer classic. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/lorelei-blogroll-1719248226107-1734443527122.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like head-scratching, mind-bending puzzle games like Return of the Obra Dinn and The Witness, then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> is a must-play to add to your Switch wishlist. Created by Sayonara Wild Hearts developer Simogo, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes features the same unrivaled presentation and atmosphere with a tantalizing mystery to match. The story begins with Lorelei arriving at a creepy, surreal hotel and within minutes you’ll be enraptured by unraveling its greatest mysteries and discovering why she was summoned there in the first place. Our reviewer Tom Marks called it “the closest thing I’ve played to a modernization of what a point-and-click adventure could be,” saying “Its story is enticingly fresh, its vibes perfectly eerie, and the desire it evokes to uncover every inch of its intricately interwoven mystery is irresistible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also not afraid to scare you. While it never treads too far into horror game territory, it effectively keeps you on edge with a handful of frightening moments as you dive deeper down its ever-expanding rabbit hole. As Tom said, “Lorelei and the Laser Eyes does do a fantastic job of unsettling you as you go, using its beautiful black-and-white visual style with pops of neon to create haunting, abstract imagery that can sometimes be as anxiety-inducing as any monster.” This is one of the best examples of a small developer bringing a brilliant set of ideas to Switch in 2024, resulting in an unforgettable journey that’s not quite like anything else on the console.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Unicorn Overlord</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/unicornoverlord-review-blogroll-1709773454638-1734443527121.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a phenomenal year for RPGs, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unicorn-overlord-review">Unicorn Overlord</a> is a big reason why. This is a superb high-fantasy strategy RPG from 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim developer Vanillaware, and the developer’s iconic art style is on full display with Unicorn Overlord’s beautifully animated characters and backgrounds, along with some of the most unnecessarily good-looking food we’ve ever seen in a video game. Our reviewer Eric Zalewski said Unicorn Overlord has one of his favorite strategy RPG combat systems ever, praising its unique blend of real-time strategy and turn-based RPG mechanics that result in something entirely new and delightfully deep. You’ll need to expertly maneuver your squads and fully engage with its complex ability system to succeed on the higher difficulties, and our review praised the scenarios you’re thrust into across Unicorn Overlord’s diverse maps, calling the mechanics and gimmicks presented some of the very best in the genre. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unicorn Overlord’s fairly stereotypical story about a prince fighting to take back his kingdom is immaculately presented across five separate arcs that each add vital context to the tale, with Eric saying, “Rather than lengthy exposition or 30-minute lore dumps, its wonderfully realized world is gradually fleshed out by the people you interact with, providing interesting perspectives as you learn the stories of both your allies and your enemies. Its overarching plot may be rather simple as a result, sticking closely to genre tropes, but when paired with a beautiful presentation, even familiar stories manage to feel fresh.” Unicorn Overlord is a special RPG in a year full of them, and proof that some third-party developers are still bringing the good stuff to Nintendo Switch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Winner: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/zeldaechoesofwisdom-1731393838923-1734443527121.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There were a lot of great Switch games this year, but in the end it’s tough to beat The Legend of Zelda, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">Echoes of Wisdom</a> is IGN’s pick for the best Nintendo game of 2024. Echoes of Wisdom marks a lot of exciting firsts for the series: It’s the first new top-down Zelda game on Switch, the first time a Zelda game is played largely without a sword, and most importantly it’s the first time Princess Zelda is the playable character in a mainline entry. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this isn’t just a traditional adventure where Zelda simply takes the place of Link. Instead, Echoes of Wisdom carves out its own niche in Hyrule’s history thanks to its central copy-and-paste gameplay mechanic where Zelda can summon Echoes of objects and enemies she encounters to solve puzzles and take down powerful foes in unique ways. From plopping down a bed to restore her health with a quick nap whenever and wherever to finally turning the tables and commanding enemies that have been nuisances for years, there’s no shortage of fun, innovative uses for the dozens of Echoes at Zelda’s disposal. It takes a page from Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom by setting players loose to find their own solutions, where the only wrong answers are the ones that don’t work. It only took hours after Echoes of Wisdom’s launch to see crazy improvisational combinations surfacing on social media, like tornado beds and crows endlessly chasing after a chunk of meat just out of their reach, leading to a pretty reliable form of flight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Echoes of Wisdom doesn’t entirely return to the classic top-down setup that a lot of longtime fans miss, but it takes several half steps that bridge the gap between the modern formula and the old favorites. Hyrule is littered with Heart Pieces to find, warm orchestral melodies accompany nearly every step of the journey, and many characters, locations, and other references make Echoes of Wisdom feel like a love letter to cherished Zelda games like A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and many others. With Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo once again took the Zelda series in a bold, unexpected direction, giving Hyrule’s princess her long-awaited starring role with new gameplay concepts we never could have imagined beforehand, and that’s why it’s our pick for the best Nintendo game of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let us know what your pick is for the best Switch game of the year, and be sure to check out all of the other categories for the 2024 IGN Awards.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-starfield-dev-surprised-by-how-much-loading-the-game-launched-with<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big criticisms <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> players have with the game is the over-abundance of loading screens. When Bethesda’s sci-fi epic launched last year, fans were surprised by just how often you’d trigger loading, from on-foot traversal to simply heading into city buildings. Players said Starfield’s loading broke immersion and added frustrating pauses to gameplay, and modders have worked to remove as much of it as possible over the past year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/starfield/Neon_City_Guide">city of Neon</a> was a particular focus of loading complaints. This cyberpunk-style urban area would often trigger a loading screen just for opening doors, some near to each other, which made questing annoying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But did it have to be this way? In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/veteran-starfield-developer-surprised-by-sheer-number-loading-screens/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer.com</a>, developer Nate Purkeypile, who worked at Bethesda Game Studios from 2007 before leaving in 2021 to found Just Purkey Games, revealed his surprise at the sheer amount of loading the game ended up launching with, particularly in the city of Neon.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/starfield-neon-city-core-1734446210120.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Did the city of Neon need to launch with so much loading?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It could have existed without those [loading zones],” Purkeypile said. “Like, some of those were not there when I had been working on it and so it was a surprise to me that there was as many as there were.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why did Starfield launch with so many loading screens? Purkeypile said part of the segmentation of the game has to do with the way the Creation Engine, which Bethesda uses to make its games, works, and that has a lot to do with performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of it is gating stuff off for performance in Neon,” Purkeypile confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about New Atlantis, Starfield’s main city? It was designed with its train system in mind, but doesn’t let you sit on the train as it takes you from A to B. Instead, you get another loading screen. That decision, Purkeypile suggested, was more about having players not just sit there for the train ride.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Starfield Update Screenshots - gamescom ONL 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile was lead lighting artist and senior world artist on Starfield and left Bethesda two years before the game launched, one year before its original release date, and a month before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-redfall-delayed-2023">its high-profile delay to 2023 was announced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of Starfield’s launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-starfield-performance-and-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-x-and-s">Bethesda development chief Todd Howard revealed that the game would release locked at 30 frames per second on both Xbox Series X and S</a> to ensure “consistency” of performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it'll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for,” Howard said at the time. “Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen. And we do want to do that. It's 4K in the X. It's 1440 on the S. We do lock it at 30, because we want that fidelity, we want all that stuff. We don't want to sacrifice any of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fortunately in this one, we've got it running great. It's often running way above that. Sometimes it's 60. But on the consoles, we do lock it because we prefer the consistency, where you're not even thinking about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And we don't ever want to sacrifice that experience that makes our games feel really, really special. So it feels great. We're really happy with how it feels even in the heat of battle. And we need that headroom because in our games, really anything can happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since launch, Bethesda has worked to improve the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-gets-big-update-that-adds-detailed-surface-maps-ship-decoration-and-60fps-on-xbox-series-x">with 60fps now possible as part of performance mode</a>.

From Software wants each run to be unique, though relics can be carried over with future attempts in Limveld. The co-op game, which can be played solo, is set to release next year.</p>

                <p>Talk to most collectors and they'll tell you that the pandemic almost five years ago changed the way people buy and sell collectibles. Pokemon cards were heavily affected and some big chain retailers like Target had to limit the number of packs they could sell to customers. They've become such a hot commodity that Japan's news media has reported that the mob is using cards to assist in laundering money.</p><p>As Shunkan Gendai online reports (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/nongaming-news/pokemon-cards-are-so-valuable-that-criminals-are-using-them-to-launder-dirty-money-japanese-media-reports/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), criminals have been turning their dirty money into Pokemon cards. The cards' portable size makes them easy to hide and transport, and then they resell the cards, converting their profits into local currency.</p><p>"Many criminals who commit bank transfer fraud are converting the money they steal into Pokemon cards. Shady money can't be deposited in a bank, and there's a high risk of it being stolen if you hold it in cash," a former high ranked crime family member explained. "Pokemon cards are easy to hide, and if you take them overseas and cash them there, you can't get tracked down."</p><p>Criminals have also gotten smarter with what to look out for and feel for when trying to get the more valuable cards. With the chances of getting sought-after Pokemon-ex cards rare already, criminals are now using metal detectors to get a hit on the foil from the card. They're also implementing highly sensitive weighing devices to determine if an unopened pack contains a rare foil card.</p><p>In 2022, YouTuber and WWE performer Logan Paul bought a graded Pikachu Illustrator card for $5.7 million, making it the most expensive card ever sold. The Pikachu Illustrator was only awarded to the winners of the Original Illustration Contest in Japan, with only 20-39 known copies ever released. Similarly graded cards are priced on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eBay for $2-$4 million</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>James Wan's production company Atomic Monster has acquired the rights to turn indie driving survival game&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>into a TV show.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-game-james-wan-1236251563/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, Wan, best known as the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Saw&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Insidious&nbsp;</em>franchises (as well as the director on movies like&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>and both&nbsp;<em>Aquaman&nbsp;</em>films), will serve as an executive producer alongside Michael Clear and Rob Hackett, also Atomic Monster execs.</p>

<p>They'll be joined by Jeff Ludwig, who will, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4906983/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to IMDb</a>, also serve as an executive producer on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">Annapurna and Remedy's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>TV series</a>. He's also worked alongside movie and TV production studio Story Kitchen on a&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>live-action adaptation, which has yet to see the light of day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-tv-show-rights-driving.jpg?itok=viI5n6hF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-tv-show-rights-driving.jpg?itok=wt8ZwQ0Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>could well be getting itself a TV adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that, as Variety points out, Wan and his production company have only acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, which is essentially the first step towards a full&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>TV show.</p>

<p>However, since the project doesn't yet have any creative personnel attached to it (not to mention a streaming platform), it's likely that we're still very early on in production, so it could be a very long time indeed before we hear anything about this one.</p>

<p>If you aren't familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's a "driving survival adventure" developed by Ironwood Studios and published by Kepler Interactive. The game is set in the fictional Olympic Exclusion Zone, which may be in the Pacific Northwest but which owes more than a small debt to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em></a>.</p>




<p>Your goal in&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is to explore the Zone, scavenge resources to build yourself better equipment and upgrade your car, and uncover the area's "mystery".</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is just the latest game to come into non-interactive media's crosshairs. Major successes in recent years include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow">HBO's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow">The Last of Us</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow">Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show</a>, although as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paramount-cancels-halo-series" rel="nofollow">Paramount and its&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>show</a> can no doubt tell you, these experiments don't always pan out.</p>

<p>If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>to get yourself ready for a potential streaming series, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

As ever with Google, it feels like a lot of <em>stuff </em>without necessarily a coherent plan behind it. But if you look closely enough, and start to put some of the pieces together, the combination of those announcements might add up to something like Google’s vision for the future of everything.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a><em> </em>(our last Tuesday episode of the year), <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/kylie-robison">Kylie Robison</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/victoria-song">Victoria Song</a> join the show to do some Google puzzling. They describe their experiences with all of Google’s new projects and experiments, and explain why Google thinks XR could be the killer app for AI&nbsp;—&nbsp;and vice versa. </p><p>After that, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/christopher-grant">Chris Grant</a>, group publisher for <em>The Verge </em>and <em>Polygon</em>, joins to talk about the two biggest 2025 stories in gaming: the impending launches of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a><em> </em>and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. He explains why <em>GTA </em>is such an important and enduring gaming franchise, why he’s confident the Switch 2 won’t be like the Wii U, and why the whole gaming world is waiting for these two things so intently.</p><p>Finally, we answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!), with some help from <em>The Verge’s </em>publisher <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/helen-havlak">Helen Havlak</a>. Helen mentioned last week that she uses Figma to manage her garden, and let’s just say you all had some follow-up questions about that. So Helen came back to explain her whole system.</p><p>Oh, and did we mention we’re doing <a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/vergecast">a live <em>Vergecast</em> at CES</a>? We’re doing <a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/vergecast">a live <em>Vergecast</em> at CES</a>! Wednesday, January 8th, 5PM, at the Brooklyn Bowl at the Linq Promenade. It’s free, it’s going to be great, come join us!</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with Google:</p><p>And in games:</p><p>Also, here is some screenshot inspo of Helen’s Figma garden in all its to-scale glory.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developer of Catly, an open-world cat game revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2024">last week's The Game Awards</a>, has denied using generative AI for the game's trailer, or the game itself.</p>
<p>The game is set for release across Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Apple Watch and its trailer features a series of hyper-realistic cats that quickly raised eyebrows as viewers suspected generative AI was used.</p>
<p>Since the reveal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hdo5rf/catly_has_direct_ties_to_ainftblockchain_gaming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit users</a> noted various oddities and supposed indicators of AI art used on the game's website, some of which have reportedly been removed. Moreover, commenters suggested the developer has links to blockchain gaming and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>, which it has now denied.</p>

<p>A statement from a PR representative for Catly's developer SuperAuthenti, shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/catly-creator-says-game-has-no-generative-ai-no-blockchain-and-no-nfts">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/catly-developer-denies-it-s-using-generative-ai-or-blockchain-technology-in-its-cute-cat-game">Game Developer</a>, said generative AI had not been used for the trailer or the game. "In fact we are very surprised by such speculations," the statement reads. "We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion."</p>
<p>Both outlets were shown in-progress shots of the trailer from The Game Awards, which seemed to confirm the trailer was not AI-generated.</p>
<p>A co-founder of SuperAuthenti is Kevin Yeung, who also co-founded TenthPlanet - a studio <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/tenthplanet-unveils-two-ambitious-blockchain-games/">reportedly working on two blockchain games</a>. One of these is Alien Mews, a digital cat life simulation built in Unreal Engine 5 that on the surface shares similarities with Catly. Reddit users have also pointed to a previous game published by SuperAuthenti called Plantly: Mindful Gardening that's since been scrubbed from the internet but appears to have used blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Catly's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/">Steam page</a> also includes a testimonial quote from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and Arcane producer Thomas Vu, a <a href="https://cryptorank.io/funds/thomas-vu">known web3 investor</a>.</p>
<p>Another quote is from Ben Brode, game director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>, who <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social/post/3ldcw6m7voc2y">responded on BlueSky</a> to say he'd seen 20 minutes of gameplay footage and "thought it looked cool so they asked me for a quote", adding "it looks real enough to me, cats looked wild".</p>

<p>As Game Developer reported, SuperAuthenti did not comment on any business connections, but stated "Catly is not a blockchain game" and "there are no NFTs". The statement continued: "Our company/project has never issued any blockchain currency and any NFTs. Our company does not and has never owned any blockchain currency and NFTs."</p>
<p>SuperAuthenti also confirmed to IGN Catly has been developed in Unreal Engine 5, with "various software" used to produce hyperrealistic hair and fur.</p>
<p>What's certainly clear is the prevalence of AI in the games industry makes it hard to ascertain what's AI generated and what's hand-crafted.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI is changing video game development forever</a>, as its use is becoming widespread across animation, scriptwriting, voice acting and more.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-has-developed-an-ai-tool-that-generates-fully-playable-3d-worlds">Google detailed its Genie 2 tool</a> it claims can create playable 3D worlds from a single image prompt. It stressed the tool is for "rapid prototyping".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The new upscaling solution used by Guerrilla Games for Horizon Forbidden West and Zero Dawn Remastered on PlayStation 5 Pro delivers image quality that is essentially on par with NVIDIA DLSS on PC, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>In their review of the PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the two main entries in the series developed by Guerrilla Games, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> also compared the new upscaling solution used by both games with the other major upscalers available on PC, such as NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR 3. Using a similar 1440p base resolution to upscaled 4K resolution, Guerilla's upscaling solution handles a variety of visual elements much better than NVIDIA DLSS, such as reflections on water surfaces and even motion, while NVIDIA's upscaler handles particles better. Compared to AMD FSR 3, the upscaling solution used by Guerrilla Games in their titles on PlayStation 5 Pro does significantly better, as AMD's upscaler delivers blurry grass with a stationary camera and softer results in general.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Best Upscaling on Consoles? Horizon Forbidden West/Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster PS5 Pro Review" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sWaa0xNuelI?start=922&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given the excellent results this upscaling solution delivers, it's not surprising that Guerrilla Games skipped using the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler, whose implementation has been lackluster, if not outright broken, in many of the games updated to take advantage of the new system's features. As this upscaling solution was developed for future titles and then backported to the Horizon games, it will be very interesting to see the image quality it will be able to deliver in the future and how it will compare to future versions of PSSR, which will reportedly be much better than the one seen in action so far.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro brings more to the table than just the AI-powered PSSR upscaler. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>

You’ll find 12 free in your Gifts tab “from the development team,” which is enough for a whole pack. Then, while completely unannounced and hidden by the game (a repeated issue), there are also a bunch of new Solo Step-Up Battle challenges to complete, offering five more hourglasses for each stage.</p><p>So, what do we have here? Primarily, it’s those <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-mew-1851719502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-mew-1851719502">Mythical Island packs we were told about last week</a></span>. This is what the physical <em>Pokémon TCG</em> would call a “special set,” but here it’s a “Themed Booster Pack,” a smaller, 86-card set (68 new cards, with 18 secret rare versions), released between full sets. It’s themed around Mew, but introduces a bunch of new cards that seem very deliberately designed to screw with the current meta. And thank goodness.</p><p>Expect to see a lot of Vaporeon and Misty decks springing up, but also a whole bunch of people disrupting what previously worked with Pigeot ex and Tauros. I’m most excited, however, to mess around with the huge range of new possibilities for the Grass decks, combining Serperior and Exeggutor. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/preview/the-best-new-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-mythical-isla-1851722781?rev=1734447333147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/preview/the-best-new-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-mythical-isla-1851722781?rev=1734447333147">We have a full guide for these new cards</a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-recommend-id="image://deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the prettiest cards in Mythical Island." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Five of the prettiest cards in Mythical Island." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-recommend-id="image://deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the prettiest cards in Mythical Island." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Those 18 secret rares offer some stunning art to find, too. My son somehow already hit the alt-art Marshadow <em>and</em> Salandit, although we’re both primarily chasing the astonishing Serperior. There are also lovely alts for Mew ex, Celebi ex, and the most stunning lithograph-style rendering of Aerodactyl ex. It is, yet again, agony that these are not real-world cards to add to a binder.</p><p>You’ll also want to dig into the offline challenges, since—as mentioned—there’s hourglasses in them there hills. Hit Battle, Solo, and then the Step-Up Battle at Advanced level, and then the tiny “Expansions” button top-right, and you’ll be able to select a series of unlocking new challenges to pit yourself against decks designed around the newer cards. The same goes for the Expert Solo Battles. Why is it hidden like this? Why isn’t it mentioned in the news updates? I wish I knew. But still, this’ll allow you to open a few more packs when completed.</p><figure id="" data-id="b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-recommend-id="image://b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1008" data-height="1930" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The My Cards screen in Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen in Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-recommend-id="image://b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1008" data-height="1930" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The My Cards screen in Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It does seem like the new set might have not only been a surprise for players, but also the app’s designers, since the UI has somehow become even more abysmal as a result. If you want to see your Mythical Island collection, you have no choice but to scroll down through your Genetic Apex cards to find where they’ve been peculiarly inserted between GA’s secret rares and Promo-A cards. And if you don’t toggle the switch at the top to show missing card spaces, they’re not even given their own delineated section! It’s as if the developers set out to do the precise opposite of what anyone playing would expect or desire.</p><p>Things are slightly more sensible on the Home screen, although only after you’ve fiddled. When you open up the app for the first time today, you’ll see just a Mythical Island pack as an option, and might fear Genetic Apex has suddenly gone away. Not so, but you’ll need to tap on the pack (because god forbid this app <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873">put options to do things that are nothing to do with opening a pack</a></span> anywhere other than on the screen for opening a pack), and then the faint button bottom-right that says “Select other booster packs.” Do this, pick a GA pack, and when you return to the Home screen you’ll <em>now</em> have the option to pick from either. Great work, everyone!</p><p>As poorly implemented as so much of this may be, it’s still a real pleasure to see Mythical Island added, especially given how many Pack Hourglasses are up for grabs in the (buried) new challenges. It’s fun to tear a bunch of packs open in a day, especially when gathering even the Basics makes for some major updates to your decks.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But if you just can’t wait, you can buy an Early Access pack now and get started. But you may have some questions first, such as whether the game provides crossplay or cross-progression features. That’s fair, so let’s take a look and see!</p><h2 id="h3643"><a id="crossplay"></a>Does Path of Exile 2 have crossplay?</h2><p>One of the best parts of playing an action-RPG like <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is beating the hell out of monsters with your friends.

No worries! <strong><em>Path of Exile 2</em> has full crossplay across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PC</strong>. This means you can easily link up with friends regardless of which platform they choose to play the game on. </p><p>That’s great for playing with friends on different machines. But what if you want to switch up platforms yourself? </p><h2 id="h3644"><a id="crossprogression"></a>Does Path of Exile 2 have cross-progression?</h2><figure id="" data-id="5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-recommend-id="image://5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character uses a lightning magic attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character uses a lightning magic attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-recommend-id="image://5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character uses a lightning magic attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is a long-term game with so much content coming down the line, it’s reasonable to want to play it on multiple platforms based on your day-to-day whims.

Well, there’s some good news for you if you find yourself in such a situation.</p><p><strong><em>Path of Exile 2</em> features cross-progression across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC</strong>. So, if you want to play across multiple platforms, you’ll have no problems doing so! </p><p>There is one caveat, though: <strong>You’ll need to purchase the Early Access version on each platform separately if you want to play during this early period of the game</strong>. However, once the game enters its full free-to-play release, you’ll be able to hop between platforms with no purchases necessary.</p><p><em>Path of Exile 2</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC in Early Access, so get out there and start wailing away on those baddies.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Borderlands 4</em>&nbsp;narrative director Sam Winkler has revealed that he intends to tone down what he identifies as an "overabundance of toilet humor" in the series' previous game.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868741632449036648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to a follower</a> on social media platform X, Winkler says that while he's "not at liberty" to discuss the narrative content of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>at the moment, he remains "firm" in his "criticism of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em>'s overabundance of toilet humor".</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>fan then humorously asks Winkler if they'll be able to "use the poop poop farty 4000" to "clean up porta-potties with my companion skibidi toilet", which is a sentence that physically hurt me to write, even though I'm quoting someone else's sarcastic observation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director-psycho.jpg?itok=Ey-BmeCK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director-psycho.jpg?itok=wbmQTnEb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will focus less on "toilet humor", its narrative director says.</figcaption></figure><p>In response to this painfully-worded question (for which props must begrudgingly go to the post's writer Moxsy), Winkler says that while he can't guarantee there will be "no toilets", he'll "cry real tears" if "the word skibidi ships in the game".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that writer Paul Tassi joked&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>would feature a gun called "Hawk 2A" (a reference to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/06/28/hawk-tuah-meme-explained-how-woman-in-viral-interview-made-a-reported-65000-and-prompted-tiktok-craze/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the famous Hawk Tuah meme</a>) and that this suggestion prompted a fellow dev to ask if that gun was real.</p>

<p>That question, Winkler said, made him want to "put [his] hand down the sink grinder", so it sounds like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will also de-emphasize the kind of meme humor for which the series has become known.</p>

<p>With all of that said, the thread originally began with Winkler praising&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s contract writers as "some of the funniest people [he knows]", so the game definitely won't be a serious grimdark take on the series.</p>




<p>The first gameplay trailer for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was revealed during this year's Game Awards, alongside the likes of an&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow"><em>Okami&nbsp;</em>sequel</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">co-op survival spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em></a>, and Naughty Dog's new game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p>

<p>Gearbox describes the game as a "mayhem-fueled looter shooter" packed with "billions of weapons, outrageous enemies, and intense co-op action", which sounds about right for the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is set to come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will, in fact, pit you and your friends against&nbsp;enemies from the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series, game director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu interview</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), Ishizaki says that some&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies will appear to fight you in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, although it seems like there won't be too many; the game's enemy roster will largely be made up of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>enemies, Ishizaki says.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he got permission from&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2&nbsp;</em>director Yui Tanimura to include enemies from their respective works in <i>Nightreign</i>, so it looks like you can expect&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2&nbsp;</em>enemies alongside iconic foes from the other two games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-combat.jpg?itok=cMqza9I9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-combat.jpg?itok=4l-M7hwg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will feature&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies, as well as those found in the original&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Eagle-eyed observers had already spotted&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s Nameless King boss in the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>debut trailer, as well as a boss that looked suspiciously like&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Centipede Demon, and now it looks like those won't be the only&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>callbacks in the game.</p>

<p>Ishizaki doesn't mention whether any&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies will be appearing in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, but given that the&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>IP is owned by Sony and not by FromSoftware or Bandai Namco, it's unlikely.</p>

<p>As for why&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies turn up in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, Ishizaki's answer is rather amusing; he puts it down to the influence of the game's villain, the Night King, which rather smacks of "a wizard did it" to me.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming co-op survival action game created by FromSoftware and based on the 2022 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">smash hit</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>




<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards ceremony last week</a>,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>eschews FromSoftware's typical Soulslike formula, opting instead for a sort of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-inspired roguelite approach that sees players banding together to survive three days and nights of increasingly difficult encounters.</p>

<p>The game's announcement came less than two weeks after FromSoftware head Hidetaka Miyazaki <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">said there were no plans</a> to expand the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>IP in the future, but then his games are well-known for featuring duplicitous or obscure NPCs, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches next year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox.</p>

One of the most important skills to learn is how to react when you hear one of these abilities coming, whether that’s running for cover when you hear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-voice-actor-actress-troy-baker-1851716746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-voice-actor-actress-troy-baker-1851716746">Scarlet Witch</a></span> screaming “Pure chaos!” as she floats into the battlefield with explosive intention, or throwing a shield up when Star-Lord starts raining down his autotargeting bullets on your squishy allies. But some heroes can just shut down several ultimates in the game; it’s just a matter of timing, precision, and situational awareness to ensure it’s worth the risk when you could, instead, just run away.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193348" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="God Of War Is Still The GOAT For Opening Boss Fights" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="223" data-playlist="193348,197298,197284" data-current="193348"><div><p>God Of War Is Still The GOAT For Opening Boss Fights</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18794.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have been trying out several of the game’s stun-based abilities against different ultimates, and discovered that several heroes on the roster can deny enemy players all that value with the press of a button. Some of them are pretty simple, such as Luna Snow freezing Scarlet Witch out of her Reality Erasure attack.</p><p>Others require much more precision and game sense, like using Cloak &amp; Dagger’s Dark Teleportation ability to briefly make your team invulnerable right as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">noted menace Jeff the Land Shark</a></span> tries to gobble them up and spit them off the map.</p><p>Timing really is everything with some of these strategies. Several heroes’ ultimate abilities have a brief startup animation before they get real crazy and can’t be stopped. Characters with crowd control abilities, like Wolverine and Peni Parker, can stop most ults if they strike just before the enemy executes the attack, and doing so will often come down to the stars aligning. The ability can’t be on cooldown, of course, and you have to have the perfect line of sight to strike. But if you’re going to play heroes who have that utility, it’s a good skill to have in your arsenal.</p><p>A lot of these shutdowns will become second nature as you memorize ultimate voice lines and are on the receiving end of every attack. Anticipating when your foe’s about to drop theirs is a big part of canceling a possible team wipe. This also comes with time, as you’ll get a sense of when enemies have likely racked up enough damage or healing to charge their ultimate. Then you’ll know what positioning to look for as enemies set up their attacks. You’ll see an Iron Man who tries to flank your team to surprise you with an Invincible Pulse Cannon, for instance, or Thor leaping into the air before he slams his hammer down. You can spend some time in the training range to see what abilities you can actually stop, but nothing will replace the practice of getting into casual matches and trying them out naturally. Then you’ll be ready to take those skills into competitive play.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">check out <em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Xbox owners could be getting their hands on more PlayStation-exclusive games in 2025. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/inside-the-risky-strategy-that-will-define-xboxs-next-decade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new report</a> from Jez Corden of Windows Central, sources have told him that there will be “more unannounced and previously PlayStation-exclusive games” coming to Xbox Series X|S next year. </p>



<p>News of PlayStation exclusives coming to Xbox shouldn’t surprise anyone. Over recent years, both sides have continued to release games on the competing platforms. Recently, Genshin Impact finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made its debut</a> on Xbox after being console exclusive to PlayStation since 2020. Another PlayStation exclusive,&nbsp;Predator: Hunting Grounds, released on Xbox in 2024 after four years as a Sony exclusive.</p>



<p>As of now, it’s unclear if Corden is referring to first-party or third-party games making their way to Microsoft’s consoles.</p>



<p>On the other side of the coin, Microsoft is bringing exclusives like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> to PlayStation 5 in 2025. There are also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored plans</a> for Forza Horizon 5 to make its way to the console as well.</p>



<p>What PlayStation games do you think will make their way to Xbox Series X|S in 2025? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/more-playstation-exclusives-are-coming-to-xbox-next-year-its-claimed.1331/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

It's therefore likely the photo was taken there, and could be as simple as him liking the jacket and wanting a photo in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't the first time Snoop Dogg's name has been brought up in relation to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series. Following on from Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which featured Danny Trejo as the likeness and voice for villain Dwight Méndez, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-asks-yakuzalike-a-dragon-fans-if-they-want-celebs-like-keanu-reeves-and-mark-hamill-in-next-game">publisher Sega asked fans which other celebrities they'd like to appear</a> in the series going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside video game adjacent stars such as Keanu Reeves, Mark Hamill, Jack Black, Rami Malek, and David Hayter came other celebrities, one of which was none other than Snoop Dogg. This tease could therefore be the end result of this poll, though nothing is confirmed yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snoop would likely appear as a new character and not just as a cameo of himself, especially if he does show up in Project Century since it's set 56 years before he was born. Little is known about the game, however, so anything is possible.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ちょっと待ってね <a href="https://t.co/N2hkLB5Z53" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/N2hkLB5Z53</a></p>— 横山昌義 (@yokoyama_masa) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokoyama_masa/status/1868823727687057888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-fans-are-already-theorizing-what-the-heck-rgg-studios-project-century-is">RGG Studio fans are already deep in the theorizing phase to figure out what the heck Project Century is</a>, of course, and already have ideas on where it's set, if it's connected to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon franchise, who it's main character is, and if it's using the developer's Dragon Engine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They'll have to be patient for these answers though. Project Century is probably still a while away given it doesn't have a title yet, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-set-to-take-on-street-fighter-and-tekken-once-again-with-virtua-fighter-the-game-awards-2024">RGG Studio is currently developing Virtua Fighter 6</a> and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii alongside it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is known for its unbelievably speedy development times, however.
