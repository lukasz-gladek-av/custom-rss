<p>There’s some concern surrounding the campaign length in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. On average, it will take approximately eight to ten hours to finish the story mode, which isn’t too long. However, much of the game’s lifespan revolves around its PvE mode, Operations, and its PvP mode, Eternal War. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-main-missions-in-space-marine-2">All Main Missions in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>Most players will likely start their time in Space Marine 2 by playing through the campaign. It’s an excellent introduction to the game’s core mechanics, characters, and the various worlds you’ll explore in the PvE and PvP game modes. Again, the story mode includes full co-op and will take around ten hours to finish. It features six missions, all of which are further broken up into various chapters and segments. Each mission will take quite a bit of time to play through; praise be to checkpoints.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Skyfire</strong></li>



<li><strong>Severance</strong></li>



<li><strong>Machinus Divinitus</strong></li>



<li><strong>Servant of the Machine</strong></li>



<li><strong>Voidsong</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dawn’s Descent</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Trust me when I say you want to complete the story mode, especially the chapters on Demerium. It offers some of the most memorable moments in gaming!</p>



<p>Furthermore, you can replay the story, should you wish to relive the epic moments of the campaign as Titus. Once you finish the game, you’ll start on the Battle Barge, where you can interact with the terminal by the dropship to change game modes and choose missions. From here, you can select any of the game’s campaign missions and play through them again.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-operations-in-space-marine-2">All Operations in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>You can tackle the game’s Operations, which are cooperative PvE missions, at any point during the campaign. They’re side stories that take place simultaneously alongside Titus’ storyline. Your objectives directly support the campaign’s actions. In total, there are six Operations:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Inferno</strong></li>



<li><strong>Decapitation</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vox Liberatis</strong></li>



<li><strong>Reliquary</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fall of Atreus</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ballistic Engine</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The Operations were designed for replayability. While the map layout and objectives remain mostly the same, it’s still fun to run through the hordes of enemies repeatedly for rewards, such as cosmetics, weapons, and armor pieces.</p>



<hr>



<p>I know many people are upset about the number of missions in the game, especially the Operations, but Saber Interactive has more coming, as per its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year one roadmap</a>!</p>

Where the circle layout usually only shows two factions – the Automatons and Terminids – and their progress as represented by red and orange colors, some were beginning to spot a third, purple color, gaining ground. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8qlkb/so_this_just_popped_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Helldiver343</u></a> was one of the first to share their findings and posted a screenshot of the updated map before the changes “vanished.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/17/helldivers2-blogroll-1694726613946-1708210207931.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Hellidvers 2 players think the Illuminate are on the horizon.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The image suggests that a third enemy, likely the Illuminate, will soon rear its head, but many were quick to write it off as a glitch, mistake, or even fake. Players then grew more suspicious when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8ql19/illuminate_on_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>additional reports of purple map progress</u></a> started to show up. Developer Arrowhead Studios had been silent about the strange sightings, adding to the confusion. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8qlkb/comment/llg8h2h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MoonlitSaiyan</u></a> said that they “didn’t know what to believe” before an in-game message suggested that Arrowhead was already very aware of player concerns.</p><p>“Some Helldivers may have noticed a recent service outage in the Major Order Communication Display,” the message says. “The issue has since been resolved.”</p><p>Arrowhead continues, explaining that a Comms Technician got trapped in a server room and died due to “exposure,” resulting in “organic tissue degradation on electronic equipment.” Of course, the technician's family has already been fined for damages, too.</p><p>It’s gross and par for the course for Helldivers 2 in a few ways. Arrowhead has been known to mislead players in the name of liberty in the past, with one past example seeing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-just-quietly-added-flying-bugs-ceo-insists-bugs-cant-fly">the team deny the existence of flying Terminids</a> despite numerous first-hand reports that the bug faction had managed to mutate. Arrowhead eventually admitted that flying creatures had indeed started to sprout from the ground, so don’t be surprised if the Illuminate finally makes their grand entrance in the near future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The alien group has existed since the days of the original Helldivers but was thought to be extinct by the time the events of Helldivers 2 began. However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-helldivers-2-players-are-convinced-the-illuminate-are-coming"><u>fans began to guess that they may soon return</u></a> shortly after launch thanks to the appearance of mysterious blue lasers in the sky. New models for the Illuminate have also <a href="https://x.com/HelldiversAlert/status/1766878355633164706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>leaked in the past</u></a>, so despite <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1768765861463035956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Arrowhead insisting that there is nothing to worry about</u></a>, all evidence has pointed to an eventual Illuminate takeover. That said, it's best to stay on your toes for something else or nothing at all until the studio has more to share.</p><p>Helldivers 2 launched in February and exploded into one of the biggest releases of the year.

<p><em>Minecraft</em> is among the most successful and influential games of the early 21st century, winning many awards and selling over 300 million copies (so far) since its 2011 release. So it was only a matter of time before Hollywood gave us a feature film based on the 3D sandbox game, simply titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Minecraft_Movie"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a>. Sure, one might have reservations about yet another video game-based movie, but on the plus side, we've got Jason Momoa and Jack Black co-starring. And the first teaser is full of eye-popping candy-colored cubic visuals and sly references to the game that should please fans.</p>
<p>Within a year of <em>Minecraft</em>'s initial release, Mojang Studios was fielding offers from Hollywood producers about making a TV series based on the game, but the company wanted to wait for "the right idea." There was a 2014 attempt to crowd-source a fan film, but game creator Markus "Notch" Persson didn't agree to license that effort since he was already negotiating with Warner Bros. about developing a film based on the game. Thus began a long, convoluted process of directors and writers being hired and leaving the project for various reasons.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>When the dust finally settled, Jared Hess (who worked with Black on <em>Nacho Libre</em>) ended up directing. The COVID pandemic and 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike delayed things further, but filming finally wrapped earlier this year in Auckland, New Zealand—just in time for a spring 2025 theatrical release. Per the official synopsis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative… the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Game players will recognize Steve as one of the default characters in <em>Minecraft</em>. The teaser is set to The Beatles' "Magical Mystery Tour" and opens with our misfits encountering a fantastical Tolkien-esque landscape—only with a lot more cube-like shapes, like a pink sheep with a cubed head. &nbsp;We get the aforementioned Piglins and other creatures before Black appears and dramatically announces with great fanfare, "I.... am Steve." Honestly, we'll probably watch it just for Black's performance alone.</p>
<p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> hits theaters in April 2025.</p>

Martin, the writer of the <em>Game of Thrones </em>novels and the <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> spin-off upon which HBO series <em>House of the Dragon </em>is based, had a lot to say about a major change made in the show. On September 4, Martin <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a post on his blog</a></span> called “Beware the Butterflies,” which goes into great detail about his qualms with a specific scene in season two of <em>HotD</em>. However not long after publishing the post, Martin deleted it entirely. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195281" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="684" data-playlist="195281,195618,197209" data-current="195281"><div><p>11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20744.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Based on the post, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://archive.is/CaMRZ#selection-233.0-240.0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://archive.is/CaMRZ#selection-233.0-240.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which you can read in archived form here</a></span>, Martin took serious issue with the way <em>House of the Dragon</em> showrunners changed a moment known amongst fans of <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>as “Blood and Cheese.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/house-dragon-recap-season-2-episode-1-blood-and-cheese-1851560238&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/house-dragon-recap-season-2-episode-1-blood-and-cheese-1851560238">In the show</a></span>, Queen Helaena is accosted in the castle by two intruders, who demand she point out which of her two young children is a boy, ostensibly so they can murder the heir to the Iron Throne. She shakily offers them her necklace, but when they persist, she points to Jaehaerys, her son, who the intruder swiftly murders.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-dunk-and-egg-spinoff-1851613395&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-dunk-and-egg-spinoff-1851613395">We Got Our First Look At The Next <em>Game Of Thrones</em> Show</a></span></p><p>In the novel,  Helaena actually has three children,  Jaehaerys, Jaehaera, and Maelor (Maelor is not in the show, though Martin claims in the now-deleted blog post that he was told he’d be in the third season). When Blood and Cheese (as they’re known in the novel) break in, Helaena first offers up her own life, then reluctantly points out Maelor, who is the youngest, for the murderers to slay. But the intruders realize that she’s avoiding pointing out Jaehaerys, next in line for the throne, and kill him anyway, with Cheese whispering to Maelor that his mother chose him to die before leaving the castle. </p><p>Martin claims he argued with showrunner Ryan Condal about the change, but not for long “or with much heat,” saying that Condal gave him enough reassurances that he could accept the change. “[He] had what seemed to be practical reasons for it; they did not want to deal with casting another child, especially a two-year old toddler,” Martin wrote. “Kids that young will inevitably slow down production, and there would be budget implications. Budget was already an issue on <em>House of the Dragon</em>, it made sense to save money wherever we could. Moreover, Ryan assured me that we were not losing Prince Maelor, simply postponing him.  Queen Helaena could still give birth to him in season three, presumably after getting with child late in season two.  That made sense to me, so I withdrew my objections and acquiesced to the change.”<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2a8a54a39f4840c857864ae4fa80ba88" data-recommend-id="image://2a8a54a39f4840c857864ae4fa80ba88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Blood and Cheese stand in the castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Blood and Cheese stand in the castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a8a54a39f4840c857864ae4fa80ba88" data-recommend-id="image://2a8a54a39f4840c857864ae4fa80ba88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Blood and Cheese stand in the castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though Martin ultimately “still [loved]” the episode despite the changes, he has a much bigger issue with the alleged removal of Maelor outright, writing, “Sometime between the initial decision to remove Maelor, a big change was made.  The prince’s birth was no longer just going to be pushed back to season 3. He was never going to be born at all.  The younger son of Aegon and Helaena would never appear.”</p><p>He then references the “Butterfly Effect,” the philosophical notion that a very small thing, as small as the flap of a butterfly’s wings, can, across time, have major implications on things seemingly unrelated. Martin then warns readers of spoilers, writing that “If you have never read <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>maybe it does not matter, because all I am going to ‘spoil’  here are things that happen in the book that may NEVER happen on the series.” <strong>I’ll give you a spoiler warning of my own, as there’s major story beats in the novel coming now.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Helaena commits suicide not long after the death of Prince Maelor. Since she is beloved by the smallfolk, when rumors spread that it was Queen Rhaenyra who killed her (as Rhaenyra has taken over King’s Landing at this point), rather than Helaena jumping out of a window of the Red Keep, the people of King’s Landing flood the streets, demanding justice for the beloved ruler. “It is the beginning of the end for Rhaenyra’s rule over the city, ultimately leading to the Storming of the Dragonpit and the rise of the Shepherd’s mob that drives Rhaenyra to flee the city and return to Dragonstone… and her death,” Martin writes. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-questions-answers-1851613595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-questions-answers-1851613595">Your <em>House Of The Dragon</em> Season 2 Finale Questions, Answered</a></span></p><p>He continues, writing, “Maelor by himself means little. He is a small child, does not have a line of dialogue, does nothing of consequence but die…but where and when and how, that <em>does</em> matter. Losing Maelor weakened the end of the Blood and Cheese sequence...it undercut the motivation for Helaena’s suicide, and that in turn sent thousands into the streets and alleys, screaming for justice for their ‘murdered’ queen. None of that is essential, I suppose… but all of it does serve a purpose, it all helps to tie the story lines together, so one thing follows another in a logical and convincing manner.”</p><p>Martin then ominously ends his post with a warning that there are “larger and more toxic butterflies to come if <em>House of the Dragon</em> goes ahead with some of the change being contemplated for seasons 3 and 4...”</p><p>I find it funny that Martin never got this publicly bitchy about the ending of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, which didn’t just deviate from his source material but created new storylines entirely, as he hasn’t yet finished the mainline novels. And I find it even funnier that he posted such a scathing takedown of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-book-season-2-adaptation-finale-1851607960&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-book-season-2-adaptation-finale-1851607960">a series I believe is doing adaptation the right way</a></span>. But perhaps Martin did what so many of us who are terminally online do, and tweeted and deleted after having a bit of clarity. We shall see. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been more than four months since Gray Zone Warfare was released to a positive reception by MADFINGER Games. It’s a landmark tactical FPS with an enormous, immersive world, extraction shooter-like mechanics, and a stacked pipeline that promises to help the game evolve in an epic fashion.</p>



<p>At Gamescom, I was fortunate to sit down with Marek Rabas, MADFINGER’s CEO, to talk about the game his team have built, the future of the title, and most importantly, the state of play for tactical and extraction shooters.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-need-a-bigger-market">‘They Need a Bigger Market’</h2>



<p>It’s no big secret that extraction shooters have been coming up in recent years. We’ve seen many titles come and go, and even titans like Activision have taken a stab at producing a game (or a bolt-on mode) that jimmies itself into the genre. </p>



<p>It’s fast becoming overdone, and developers like MADFINGER are trying to alter the paradigm to produce something <strong>close</strong> but at the same time unique. That’s why Gray Zone Warfare has such a refreshing palette and promise – and why it’s leaning more into being a <strong>tactical FPS </strong>than a strict extraction shooter.</p>



<p>As we spoke, I asked Marek Rabas what he thought about the growing popularity of extraction shooters and the potential oversaturation of the titles making it to the market:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are a <strong>lot </strong>of new extraction shooters. People noticed the success of Tarkov, even the big guys – that’s why they made DMZ – but the big guys don’t have the balls to do it exactly like Tarkov. They need a bigger market, so they can’t do that. They don’t get the <strong>essence </strong>of Tarkov.</p>



<p>There are a lot of indies, including us, who saw the potential in <strong>tactical shooters</strong>. Big companies, they started to just make battle royales, and they killed the big brands. Even Call of Duty, Ghost Recon, all these titles, they’ve just killed it a bit.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a fair point. Many modern developers piecing together new extraction shooters are trying to make them more ‘arcadey’ and globally accessible, going so far as to introduce paid features that make the game a little easier.</p>



<p>Rabas insisted that people looking for something more challenging and genuinely strategic <em>‘don’t have anything else to play except Tarkov or Arma or Squad’</em>. But there are limitations to these games, such as a steep learning curve, elements that ‘put off’ the average player, or frustrations like ‘needing to have a second monitor’.</p>



<p>That’s certainly true for Escape from Tarkov – if you’re not playing with maps, market trackers, guides, or ballistics charts on a second monitor, you’re far too pro at the game.</p>



<p>Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel in the extraction shooter market, some developers – like MADFINGER – have opted to feed those hungry for a <strong>tactical shooter</strong> – and it has already proven to be successful.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-try-to-be-different">‘You Try To Be Different’</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>More extraction shooters will inevitably surface, of course. </p>



<p>On the horizon, you’ve got titles like Beautiful Light, Exoborne, Marathon, Delta Force, and whatever ARC Raiders turns out to be. In recent weeks, Arena Breakout Infinite was released, as was Level Zero: Extraction.</p>



<p>That’s a sentiment that Rabas echoed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There will be more extraction shooters coming. Tencent is not stupid, that’s why they created Arena (Breakout Infinite). If the guys abandon them, new games will come and fill the space, and you (need to) try to be different.</p>



<p><em>(Speaking about Gray Zone Warfare)</em> This is why we chose it to be session-based and not match-based. This is more experience-based than competition-based, you know? And we chose the jungle because everyone is doing Western or Eastern urban and forests.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many will claim that Gray Zone Warfare is an extraction shooter by nature, but few have linked it to Escape from Tarkov. From the setting to the core military mechanics and from the unique gameplay loop to the mysterious backstory sitting at the heart of the map, there’s a lot to set GZW apart from Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>In my opinion, GZW walks a blissful line between various genres. It’s an extraction shooter that’s not punishing, and it’s a tactical shooter that’s not intense or overly complex. It’s a milsim title that’s light on the sim, and it’s a survival game that eases you into the concept.</p>



<p>Plenty is in the pipeline for Gray Zone Warfare – keep an eye on Insider Gaming to catch all the latest news for this game.</p>

It comes with a 40-page handbook with instructions for assembling the 23 miniatures you'll find in the box. <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgames-workshop-space-marine-the-board-game%2F-%2FA-87877079&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2-preorder-guide%2F1100-6520972%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Space Marine: The Board Game</a></strong> is exclusive to Target and costs $40.</p><hr><h2>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 preorder bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4362025-spacemarine2preorderbonuses.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362025" data-ratio="0.56219512195122" data-width="820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4362025-spacemarine2preorderbonuses.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362025"></a><figcaption>Space Marine 2 preorder bonuses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4362025-spacemarine2preorderbonuses.jpg"></figure><p>All Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 preorders come with the Macragge's Chosen DLC.

            <p>
Flaming Fowl Studios - the developer that announced then shelved a game on the same day back in April amid financial difficulties - has unveiled its latest project, a comedic sci-fi auto battler called Konfronto that's due to release on PC later this year.
</p>
<p>
Flaming Fowl, which was founded in 2016 by former members of original Fable developer Lionhead Studios, first made a name for itself with the release of card battle <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fable-fortune">Fable Fortune</a>, but it's perhaps known for its acclaimed digital adaptation of popular board game Gloomhaven.
</p>
<p>
The studio's third release, a co-op RPG with turn-based combat called Ironmarked, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-lionhead-devs-announce-new-game-shelve-new-game-and-confirm-layoffs-all-at-the-same-time">revealed back in April</a>, but it wasn't exactly a moment for celebration. Instead, Flaming Fowl's unusual announcement came with the news the project was being shelved due to a current lack of funding in the industry, and worse, that it had been forced to lay off around 20 people at the studio. The hope was Ironmarked's announcement and accompanying demo would be a way to demonstrate the team's work and help them find jobs elsewhere.

<p>
As for the nine remaining employees, Flaming Fowl said they'd be turning their attention to a small, self-funded strategy title it was intending to release before the end of the year. And five months later, we now know that game to be Konfronto.
</p>
<p>
Konfronto is described as a "sci-fi roguelike auto battler" in which players command and upgrade an intergalactic carrier. They'll need to outfit it with new spacecraft, equip it with "weird and wonderful" technologies, and hire its crew - all so they can battle it out in asynchronous multiplayer. 
</p>
<p>
"The position of cargo items can both trigger awesome combos with other cargo or combine to create entirely new technology," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2994150/Konfronto/">Konfronto's Steam page</a>. "Hundreds of unique items means, billions of combinations - and we've tested them all... honest, don’t look into it. "
</p>
<p>
There's no launch date for Konfronto beyond a vague "2024" window, but it'll be arriving as a Steam early access release when it does show up. The "fully playable" initial version is said to feature "plenty of content", but the goal is to add more ships, cargo, and crew members - alongside an improved UI and other features - as early access continues. Flaming Fowl says it expects Konfronto to remain in early access for around six months, depending on feedback.
</p>
<p>
To give interested players a taste of Konfronto's action, Flaming Fowl will be releasing a demo of the game as part of Steam NextFest in October. "NextFest is a huge opportunity for devs that are self-publishing like ourselves," creative director Mike West said in a statement accompanying Konfronto's announcement. "We really hope the community enjoys what we have made, or at the very least they pretend to enjoy it if they are streaming."

			<p>Goichi Suda, more commonly known as Suda51, and Shinji Mikami require no introductions. Over the long years of their careers, they released seminal titles that have had a lasting impact on video games and contributed to shaping the medium as we know it today. The No More Heroes series, Killer 7, the Resident Evil and Dino Crisis series, the original Devil May Cry, and Viewtiful Joe are only some of the games the two Japanese developers either created or helped make that have influenced many of the games that came after them.</p>
<p>Besides the aforementioned Killer 7, Suda 51 and Shinji Mikami collaborated on a few other games, such as Shadows of the Damned, which is coming to modern PC and consoles as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-gets-official-release-date/">Hella Remastered edition</a>. During Gamescom, I had the chance to chat with the two legendary developers not only about the upcoming remaster and the original concept for the game, which changed heavily during development, but also about the projects they would like to develop, their illustrious careers, and more. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Shadows of the Damned has become a cult classic over the years, but it is far from being the most popular game you have worked on together. Why did you decide to bring it back? Do you feel the game will be better received now?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: The original Shadows of the Damned came out in 2011 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and these days, it's pretty hard to play, even if someone wants to. Back then, the game wasn't promoted that much and didn't really get as widely known as we'd hoped. For this reason, we wanted to bring the game back for modern consoles to allow more people to experience it, whether for the first time or all over again. Also, we'd like to get as many of our Grasshopper games available as possible, and we decided to start off with Shadows of the Damned.</p>
<p><strong>Why a remaster and not, say, a remake?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: I'm not sure there's a good answer to this question. A remake would cost a lot more money to make. The original's graphics were pretty good for the time, and they held up pretty well, so there wasn't really a necessity to remake the game fully.</p>
<p><strong>Besides New Game Plus and new costumes, is there anything else that has been changed or improved? If nothing has been changed, is there anything you would have liked to change, given the chance?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: As you mentioned, there's a New Game Plus mode and new costumes, but apart from that, the game is 4K compatible to better work on modern consoles. Besides this, there isn't any other change. Shadows of the Damned was based on an idea called Kurayami, and if the game we ended up making would have been based on that idea, I would have wanted to make a full-on director's cut of that. But unfortunately, that wasn't the game that we put out, so I didn't want to make any changes. Playing the game for the time in 10 years, however, I noticed the tempo of the action really stands out for modern games' standards, as does the trip through hell, which compliments the graphics well and how everything is presented. I think that is really cool, and I might have added something to it if given the chance</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about the original concept for Shadows of the Damned, it's been known that Suda-san wasn't really happy about how the game turned out in the end. Do you think the original concept would have worked better nowadays with people having a different perception of Japanese games compared to 2011?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: As you mentioned, the perception of games has changed over the years, and nowadays, it would be easier to make. To be honest, I haven't given up on it yet. This isn't an actual guarantee, but it could be the next, next, next project I will work on.</p>
<p><strong>Now that the Shadows of the Damned series has been revived, is there a chance of a sequel with both of you involved?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: I'd rather make a Killer 7 sequel first, but realistically, if the game sells well enough, I'd like to look into making a sequel. I really love Garcia, Paula, and Fleming as characters and their dynamic, which is kind of like an adult version of Super Mario Bros. I'd really like to continue their story if there's an opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about potential future projects, is there any game or series you have worked on that you would like to give another chance with a sequel or remake?</strong></p>
<p>Shinji Mikami: God Hand 2.</p>
<p><strong>I approve of that. </strong><em>(Everyone laughs)</em></p>
<p>Suda51: I have talked frequently with the people from Spike Chunsoft, and one game that has come up several times is Michigan, a game that I released years ago. The type of game and its general vibe would go over pretty well the way video games are these days, and it's something I'd like to revisit again at some point.</p>
<p><strong>You have collaborated on multiple projects. What did you learn from each other, and have you applied these lessons to other projects?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: Up until we made Killer 7 together, me and Grasshopper mainly developed adventure games. Killer 7, on the other hand, was an action game, and I learned a lot from Mikami-san on how to make such a game, decide on a direction, and solve typical action game issues. That experience was basically my textbook about how to make an action game.</p>
<p>Shinji Mikami: Working together with Suda51 was a lot of fun, but there wasn't anything to learn from him. I really love the scenarios and stories he writes, but it's not the sort of thing that you can learn from or copy, even if I had wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>Are you open to collaborating again on a future project?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: If it was somehow possible to do, I'd love to develop a Killer 7 sequel with Mikami-san.</p>
<p><strong>Now that you have mentioned it again, I really have to ask. Is a Killer 7 sequel happening?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: We have talked about it with a few different media outlets before. The only thing preventing a Killer 7 sequel from happening is the IP. If we somehow got the rights to that...<br>
Realistically, I am a bit scared of going back to the series again. When we made the original, I poured time, energy, and passion into it like never before, directing everything and making sure every little thing was just right. The work was very draining, and I'm not sure I could do that again.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about the original Killer 7, a lot of content was cut from the game. So, maybe some sort of complete edition would be an easier way to revisit the series.</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: A complete edition is something I could do, and I wouldn't have to drain myself so much to put it out.</p>
<p><strong>You both had very long careers. One word to define them, and another to define your collaborations.</strong></p>
<p>Shinji Mikami: It's kind of hard to find a single word to define my career. "Completely putting myself into everything" is a good definition. Regarding my collaborations with Suda-san, a good definition would be "enjoying new things."</p>
<p>Suda51: As Mikami-san said, it is difficult to find a single word to define my career and our collaborations. If I had to find a word, I'd say "Instinct."</p>
<p>Regarding my collaboration with Mikami-san, it felt like going to school. Back in the day, we'd get together for an hour or two, and for the first twenty or so minutes, we would discuss actual game development. For the remainder of the time, we would talk about non-gaming-related stuff, and I not only had fun but also learned a lot from these talks.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/chemistry-set-card-game-brings-scientific-joy-courtesy-of-former-zachtronics<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new game studio is making its tabletop debut. But this studio aren't completely new to interactive entertainment. They are former indie videogame developers known for scientific puzzle games. Their first project is on-brand: a card game simply called <em>Chemistry Set</em>.</p>
<h2>The Chemistry Set Card Game Announcement</h2>
<p>The announcement of the <em>Chemistry Set</em> card game came via media post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/coincidence.games/post/3l2dhx32skk23">on Blue Sky</a>. The post describes the game itself: a two-player competitive experience about building molecules out of atoms.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chemistry-set-card-game-bluesky-announcement.jpg?itok=YJ-vk4vn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chemistry-set-card-game-bluesky-announcement.jpg?itok=756CTJht 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Developer Coincidence Games' web page contains additional information about the game and studio. First, it specifies that <em>Chemistry Set</em> is not an educational experience. You don't need any knowledge of chemistry whatsoever to enjoy this card game.</p>
<p>As for the developers, they are all former devs of Zachtronics LLC, an indie videogame developer. The founder, Zach Barth, is the lead designer on <em>Chemistry Set</em>.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it makes sense that Coincidence Games' first title revolves around science-based puzzle solving.</p>
<p>Zachtronics' body of work includes 2011's <em>SpaceChem</em>, a game about synthesizing chemicals in a reactor, the 2015 sandbox game <em>Infinifactory</em>&nbsp; the 2017 industrial engine-building game <em>Opus Magnum</em>, and retro-tech puzzle anthology game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zachtronics-announces-its-final-game-last-call-bbs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Last Call BBS</em></a>.</p>
<p>Zachtronics last game released in 2022. Since then, the studio has been inactive. However, Barth has made the entire studios' library <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zachtronics-makes-entire-library-free-to-schools-in-zachademics-program" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free to all schools</a> and non-profit educational institutions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zachtronics-last-call-bbs-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=9bonAfoa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zachtronics-last-call-bbs-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=uZhJcUv- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Chemistry Set will be releasing alongside another card game by Coincidence Games. The second game, <em>The Lucky Seven</em>, is a tactical solitaire game framed as an unknown modern conflict.</p>
<p>Players will move and place squad members to neutralize threat cards and attempt to keep the peace. Much like <em>Solitaire</em>, the game will have different outcomes depending on the luck of the draw.</p>
<p>Both <em>The Lucky Seven</em> and <em>Chemistry Set</em> are available for pre-order right now. <em>The Lucky Seven</em> is available at an MSRP of $11.99. <em>Chemistry Set</em> is available at an MSRPG of $12. Finally, both are available in a bundle for $23.99</p>

<p>When you first dive into a horde shooter, you want that overwhelming feeling of power. You play on one of the lowest difficulty settings to crush every foe in your path. But as you learn the maps and mechanics, you find brushing off enemies easy, and you want more of a challenge. That’s when you ramp up the difficulty. To help you decide where to start, here’s a look at the campaign difficulty modes in Space Marine 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-difficulty-modes-in-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2">All Difficulty Modes in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 includes four campaign difficulty modes: Easy, Normal, Veteran, and Angel of Death. Saber Interactive is planning a fifth, more challenging difficulty level for some time during year one, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per its roadmap</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a simple, straightforward experience, I recommend starting on Easy. It’s a fantastic time, and you genuinely feel powerful. But if you want a slight challenge while still feeling like an Ultramarine, Normal is an excellent starting point. That said, the game does recommend Veteran. I don’t. Especially for new players, it’s a bit much to handle at first.</p>



<h3 id="h-easy-mode">Easy Mode</h3>

<p>All of the game’s difficulty modes alter the amount of armour you start with, making recovering from combat encounters either a breeze or an absolute hair-pulling experience. In time, as you learn the game’s dodge and parry mechanics, however, you will find that increasing the difficulty to Veteran or Angel of Death becomes a must!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-change-difficulty-modes-in-space-marine-2">How to Change Difficulty Modes in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>When you start a new game in Space Marine 2, you can select the game’s difficulty before stepping into Titus’ boots. But once you’re on the Battlebarge, you can still increase or lower the campaign difficulty. </p>



<p>Walk up to the terminal near the dropship, right to the left-hand side on top of the staircase leading to the launch platform. Here, you can interact with the terminal to select any one of the difficulty levels. You can also swap between Campaign, Operations, and Eternal War (PvP) at this very same terminal!</p>

<p>Bloober Team wants to bring you back to the 90s. When the Silent Hill 2 remake launches in October, the developers are giving players a way to increase the overall immersion of the game.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam/status/1831331608302907651">social media</a> on Wednesday, the developers announced that players will have the option to turn off all UI elements within the game. In addition to that, they have created a “90s filter” for players to add on to it.</p>



<p>“We’ve also created a “90s filter” with grain effect, color correction and screen adjustments to complete the old-school experience,” Bloober Team said while showing off an example.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the original Silent Hill 2 launched in 2001, the first game in the series launched in 1999 and was developed in the late 90s. So, adding a 90s filter to the game isn’t all that ridiculous.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 launches on October 8 for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

The immersion might feel cool, but for more precise aiming, you want to have this effect turned off.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deadzone">Deadzone</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362006-deadzones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362006" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362006-deadzones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362006"></a><figcaption>BO6 dead zone setting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362006-deadzones.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deadzone Inputs:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Left Stick Min: 0.3</li><li dir="ltr">Left Stick Max: 0.99</li><li dir="ltr">Right Stick Min: 0.3</li><li dir="ltr">Right Stick Max: 0.99</li><li dir="ltr">L2 Button: 0.0</li><li dir="ltr">R2 Button: 0.0</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Stick drift varies for each player's controller.

You might want to keep the sprint assist setting off to play a bit slower and more tactical, but for me, I found that it gave me much more fluid movement, and it required fewer button inputs to get sprinting into action and make use of the omnidirectional movement. As an added bonus, it makes for less wear on your hands and your thumbsticks as well.</p><p dir="ltr">You might even like the mantle assistance on, but for me personally, I found I was often mantling at awkward times when I would prefer to just stand behind the cover.

			<p>The new season of <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-road-trip-fortnite-rocket-league/">Rocket League</a> went live today, and ancient folklore is present in the game. Players will get to explore a brand-new arena called Drift Woods. As you are competing against other players, you may find yourself sighting the Chupacabra or even an appearance of Mothman.</p>
<p>Season 16 will give you access to new cars such as the BMW 1 Series, which you can unlock automatically by purchasing the Rocket League Season 16 Rocket Pass Premium. This will give you access to the BMW 1 Series RLE Car Body, the Chupacabra Topper, Sasquatch Print Wheels, and a Mothman Decal as you scale up the Season 16 Rocket Pass Premium tiers.</p>
<p>You can also obtain a Mothman Antenna, Darker Disc Wheels and a Ghoulpost Antenna, if you want to get into the Halloween spirit ahead of time. There are over 70 Tiers to unlock across the Free and Premium tracks, meaning those who aren't purchasing the Premium pass will still get some cool rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rocket League Season 16 - Urban Legends Emerge from the Arena’s Darkest Depths" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W0qrGEG4pog?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As well as the cosmetic rewards, players can expect to hear some new music on the Rocket League Radio, with a new song to represent Season 16 titled "Lie." This song has been produced by Mr. Bill &amp; Culprate and will be available on the Rocket League Radio. It will appear in the Featured Shop as a Player Anthem.</p>
<p>One important note that was added to the blog post announcing Season 16 of Rocket League is that the BMW 1 Series and BMW 1 Series RLE car bodies both use the Octane hitboxes, meaning that these car bodies will be eligible for cross-game ownership between Rocket League and Fortnite.</p>
<p>The post-demolition camera is one of the most important features added to Rocket League season 16. It's a more seamless transition with improved tracking that shows precisely where you are in the arena and where you will respawn afterward. The latest season of Rocket League has already started and will continue until December 4, 2024.</p>
<p>During this season, players will also see and participate in the available Competitive Tournaments for both Soccar and Heatseeker, depending on your preferred game mode. There are 32 teams in total, and to accommodate players in South Africa, players can participate in weekend tournaments.</p>
<p>You will be rewarded for your efforts if you successfully climb up the ranks during the Competitive Tournament. This includes rewards such as the Bateye Topper, the Gnaw'd Wheels, and the Rocketmancer Goal Explosion.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/rocket-league-season-16-urban-legends-emerge-from-the-arenas-darkest-depths" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on the official Rocket League website explains the Competitive Tournament schedule slots in more detail so those who want to compete can find out when they can expect to be online and available to play Rocket League.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> is a Bandai Namco-developed anime MMO which released in Japan last year, and was meant to arrive in the west at some point this year courtesy of Amazon Games. Alas, that's no longer the case - and the game is also shutting down in Japan early next year.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, Bandai Namco Online announced that they have made the difficult decision to end service on Blue Protocol. They will shut down their Japanese Blue Protocol servers in January 2025, and have ended plans to release the game in the West in collaboration with Amazon Games," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139230/view/4244166473681846926">the announcement from last week</a>.
</p>
<p>The Japanese servers will be shut down on January 18th, 2025. As of today, the game has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139230/BLUE_PROTOCOL/">delisted from Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Outwardly, Blue Protocol seemed to be following closely in the footsteps of Genshin Impact, with a world of blue skies, green grass, and Breath Of The Wild-style enemies to bash through action-RPG combat. Ed wasn't sure there was anything more to it beyond that when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-protocol-seems-like-a-slick-anime-mmo-if-an-extremely-predictable-one">he had a chance to play it last year</a>, calling it predictable, describing its world as "eh", and fretting over the inevitable microtransactions.
</p>
<p>Still, it's a shame we won't get a chance at a proper play of it - and even more so that it's shutting down for those players who were already invested. Bandai Namco say that they're not offering refunds for players who already spent real money on in-game Rose Orbs currency, but they'll be handing out 5000 free Rose Orbs every month between now and January for players to spend on in-game cosmetics. That sucks.
</p>
<p>There's apparently still some new contnet to come to the Japanese version of the game before it closes down, and its developers have <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/506">put together a schedule for the remaining months here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So while the upcoming <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>is going to recap his history when it comes out on October 25, I thought I’d break down who the black-and-red hedgehog is and why every blue blur stan you know is freaking out about his appearance in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="98f3de2aa5c6261e055b8fb62f45b1f4" data-recommend-id="image://98f3de2aa5c6261e055b8fb62f45b1f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1462" data-height="819" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow standing on his motorcycle like a cool guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow standing on his motorcycle like a cool guy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="98f3de2aa5c6261e055b8fb62f45b1f4" data-recommend-id="image://98f3de2aa5c6261e055b8fb62f45b1f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1462" data-height="819" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow standing on his motorcycle like a cool guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>No, Shadow is not a cliched “evil” Sonic variant. The antihero debuted in 2001 in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, a Dreamcast game all about playing two different sides of the same conflict. The story was divided into two sides: Hero and Dark. The first followed Sonic and his friends Tails and Knuckles, while the second followed series antagonist Doctor Eggman, Shadow, and a treasure-hunting government double agent, Rouge the Bat. A lot of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/wYhPrZIP3HA?si=50bNI047peZZQpUA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/wYhPrZIP3HA?si=50bNI047peZZQpUA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sega’s marketing</a></span> played up Sonic and Shadow’s juxtaposition as a good, angelic hedgehog and an evil, devious foe, and it’s true, Shadow does team up with Eggman, claiming to help him achieve his dream of world domination. But that’s just who he appears on the surface. Shadow’s actual motivations are revealed as the Dark-side story goes on, and there’s a much more tragic, multifaceted character at the center.</p><p>Shadow was created 50 years prior to the events of <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>by Doctor Gerald Robotnik, Eggman’s grandfather. He was born in a space station floating above Earth called Space Colony Ark. Here, Robotnik was researching immortality in an effort to find a cure for his granddaughter Maria’s terminal illness. Shadow was designed to be the “Ultimate Life Form,” capable of withstanding any disease or injury, with his immortal nature hopefully one day transferred into humans like Maria. The young girl lived with her grandfather on the space station, and as a result became close friends with Shadow as Robotnik continued his research. The two would look down on Earth and dream of seeing it together one day when Maria was cured of her condition.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="712eb84efd3e03803a4011dbf40f4b95" data-recommend-id="image://712eb84efd3e03803a4011dbf40f4b95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1487" data-height="833" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="712eb84efd3e03803a4011dbf40f4b95" data-recommend-id="image://712eb84efd3e03803a4011dbf40f4b95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1487" data-height="833" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow and Maria look at each other through glass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Robotnik’s research was being funded by the United Federation (the <em>Sonic </em>equivalent of the United States). It was initially conceived as a means to create a living weapon, though Robotnik’s personal motivation was to save Maria. During his research, Robotnik created two immortal beings: Shadow, and a giant reptilian prototype called the Biolizard. Unlike Shadow, the Biolizard was violent and uncontrollable, and once the United Federation caught wind of it, the decision was made to shut down the project and eliminate anyone who knew of it. A squad of G.U.N. (Guardian Unit of Nations) soldiers were deployed onto the station, arresting Robotnik, killing researchers, and evacuating civilians. However, one civilian was caught in the crossfire: Maria.</p><p>Different versions of Shadow’s story across the games and extended universe depict Maria’s death differently. The 2005 game <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>shows a G.U.N. soldier shoot her in cold blood, while the <em>Sonic X </em>anime shows him kill her when she refuses to comply with his orders. What was she doing that they found so objectionable? She was sending Shadow to Earth in order to save him from the slaughter.</p><p>With her dying breath, she asks Shadow to bring hope to humanity as he is sent down to Earth on an escape pod. You’d think that wish would have led to Shadow saving the world rather than attempting to destroy it. So what happened?</p><p>As is revealed throughout <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Robotnik went mad after the loss of Maria and his research. Even while imprisoned by G.U.N. and continuing his work under heavier supervision, the doctor began planning his revenge. If he couldn’t save Maria, he would destroy the humans who took everything away from him. This included brainwashing Shadow to forget Maria’s dying wish, instead having him misremember it as her asking him for revenge.</p><p>Shadow was eventually captured by G.U.N. and put into stasis, where he would remain for 50 years. Finally awoken by Eggman all those years later, he manipulated the doctor into bringing all seven Chaos Emeralds to the remnants of Space Colony Ark, claiming he wanted to use the stones’ energy to power the station’s powerful Eclipse Cannon and threaten the people of Earth into submission. But in truth, his plan was to use the emeralds to put the station on a collision course with the planet, destroying it and all of humanity.</p><p>Shadow nearly succeeded, too, before being reminded of Maria’s true dying wish by Sonic’s not-girlfriend Amy Rose. He then joined the rest of our heroes in stopping the Ark’s descent by using the Chaos Emeralds to defeat the Biolizard who was sprung from its imprisonment in the depths of the station. Then, having used all his power to stabilize the Ark, he fell to Earth. The rest of our heroes mourned him, but celebrated that he was able to carry out Maria’s wish.</p></div></div><div><p>That was the plan. Shadow was intended to be a one-and-done antihero with a heart of gold and a full circle redemption story. If that had been the extent of his story, it would have been a pretty powerful note to end on. However, because fans latched onto him, Sega decided to bring him back in 2003’s <em>Sonic Heroes</em>, but it wasn’t entirely clear if we were playing as the same character, or an imitation. It’s here that Shadow’s story became much, much more convoluted as <em>Sonic </em>started to go back to the well on this guy again and again.</p><p>In <em>Sonic Heroes</em>, Shadow appears as a member of Team Dark. This group is founded by Rouge, who stumbles upon Shadow in a containment pod in one of Eggman’s secret bases. The hedgehog seems to have lost his memories and is under the watchful guard of one of the doctor’s robots named E-123 Omega, and the three team up to find the scientist and demand answers. <em>Sonic Heroes </em>raises more questions about Shadow than it answers, as the group stumbles upon lifelike Shadow androids. Rouge finds an entire lab full of these robots in stasis, and confides in Omega that she believes the Shadow they’ve been fighting alongside to be a robot like the others. Omega points out that if Eggman has cloned Shadow, the original must exist somewhere. However, it wasn’t until Shadow’s 2005 game that the <em>Sonic </em>series would make a definitive statement on the matter.</p></div><div><p><em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>, the 2005 game starring Shadow as the sole playable character, is a complicated web of stories to unpack. The platformer is choice-based, allowing you to see different stories unfold based on which missions you complete in each level. If I kill a bunch of bad guys, I can see Shadow go down a heroic path. If I sabotage Sonic and friends, I can watch him revert to his villainous ways. All of these are portrayed as “what if” scenarios, but the game does tell us a lot more about how Shadow came to be.</p><p>In between all the alternate histories, it’s revealed that while creating Shadow, Robotnik sought the help of an alien race called the Black Arms. These invaders occupy a comet that passes over Earth every 50 years or so, and plan to return to the planet in a few decades to impose themselves on humanity. Robotnik made a deal with the aliens to further his research, offering to have Shadow help with the invasion in exchange for the DNA of Black Doom, the aliens’ leader. Shadow’s memories are still gone, but Robotnik left a video message from before the raid on the Ark with instructions for Shadow to use the Eclipse Cannon to destroy the Black Arms’ comet and save the world. Shadow faces Black Doom in a final fight, then blows up the comet from orbit. He then makes the decision to leave his past behind and determine his own future…but not before Eggman confirms that he is, in fact, the original Ultimate Life Form, whom he rescued after the events of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. Wildly enough, this confirmation only comes if you take over eight minutes to complete the final boss battle, so plenty of players never hear this voice line from Eggman.</p></div><div><p>Look, it wasn’t his finest hour. But, yes, Shadow did use firearms in the 2005 game, and swore when he took damage. He also started riding vehicles like motorcycles when it would have been faster for him to run. In the years since, the vehicles have stuck, as he used them again in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</em> and is seen riding a motorcycle in the first trailer for <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. The swearing and guns? Less so. Earlier this year, Sega <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-the-hedgehog-guns-vehicles-1851530228&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-the-hedgehog-guns-vehicles-1851530228">gave some conflicting reasons</a></span> for why Shadow put down the glock, claiming that he used guns out of necessity, but also that he doesn’t need weapons because he’s a living one. Look Sega, just say it was a different time and you were trying to appeal to different, edgier markets. Not everything has to be lore.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9876c2881738c4869d20cf2faa790b53" data-recommend-id="image://9876c2881738c4869d20cf2faa790b53" data-format="jpg" data-width="2016" data-height="1130" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow race down the side of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow race down the side of a building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9876c2881738c4869d20cf2faa790b53" data-recommend-id="image://9876c2881738c4869d20cf2faa790b53" data-format="jpg" data-width="2016" data-height="1130" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow race down the side of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Up to this point, it hasn’t been confirmed why Robotnik made his Ultimate Life Form a hedgehog. Shadow’s resemblance to the blue blur has gotten Sonic into some trouble, however, as the government mistook Shadow for the hero during his life of crime. For now, the predominant theory is that Shadow may be based on a prophetic mural depicting Sonic’s future that appears <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1appdh1/shadows_origins_in_the_movie/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1appdh1/shadows_origins_in_the_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Angel Island</a></span>, but that’s just a theory. Fans are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/sonicstadium/status/1799314859202408858?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/sonicstadium/status/1799314859202408858?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speculating that <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>may end up confirming this</a></span>, based on images of Robotnik’s journal included with physical copies of the game.<br></p></div><div><p>Yes, but Shadow’s appearance in <em>Sonic 3 </em>is a bit more significant than that. For a few years, Shadow was one of the faces of the franchise, and came second only to Sonic in character popularity polls. His story was complex, his character intriguing, and he was an excellent foil to Sonic’s happy-go-lucky attitude. Following <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, Sega made a concerted effort to pull back on the ensemble cast in favor of going back to basics. Sonic was the only playable character for most games, the stories became more simple, and everyone was sanded down to a few distinct traits, with Shadow being solely defined by broodiness and hating the company of others, despite making some really excellent strides in accepting the companionship of the rest of Team Dark in <em>‘06</em>.</p><p><br>For nearly 20 years, Shadow has swayed in the background as a caricature of himself, and Sega has taken its time putting him back in the spotlight. He made brief appearances in <em>Sonic Forces</em> as a DLC character and had a bit part in the <em>Sonic Boom</em> subseries, so Sega has been gradually nudging him back into the public consciousness. But what we’re seeing in <em>Sonic 3 </em>seems to be leaning toward a version of him that we haven’t seen in years. Shadow the Hedgehog deserves more than being remembered as a misanthropic edgelord who said “damn” and used a gun one time. It seems like Sega, and hopefully the rest of the world, is finally coming around to that fact. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony doesn’t think it has enough original intellectual property (IP).</p>



<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/307f7a2e-a755-4f6e-badc-9bc119f185df" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> (h/t to <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/09/04/playstation-doesnt-have-enough-ip-says-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Lifestyle</a> for spotting it), Sony chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki said that the company needs to put more of a focus in creating its own IP moving forward. And that’s not just in a specific sector, but throughout the company.</p>



<p>“Whether it’s for games, films or anime, we don’t have that much IP that we fostered from the beginning,” he said. “We’re lacking the early phase (of IP) and that’s an issue for us.”</p>



<p>Hotoki added in the interview that Sony has been “better at finding a global audience for content that have already become popular in their home market.”</p>



<p>From a gaming standpoint, Sony has a number of original active IPs for PlayStation. Franchises such as God of War, Horizon, Uncharted continue to be successful from Sony first-party developers. The company also has a number of dormant first-party titles like Bloodborne (which Sony funded at FromSoftware), Killzone, SOCOM, Resistance, and more.</p>

That's good news, because the event is chock-full of new activities and rewards that look to celebrate 30 years of Warcraft as a franchise and 20 years of Blizzard's MMORPG.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNeQdGV5_2U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MNeQdGV5_2U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The biggest prize players will want to seek out are the updated Tier 2 armor sets. Originally found in the vanilla version of WoW, the sets for each of the game's original nine classes are still some of the most iconic armor sets in the game: the gold standard by which all of its subsequent tier sets are measured. Blizzard is giving each of them a visual upgrade for the anniversary event to look more in-line with the game's modern visuals. For classes that didn't exist back when Tier 2 was originally available--Death Knights, Monks, Demon Hunters, and Evokers--Blizzard is introducing all-new sets inspired by WoW's early days.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what new activities will be available during the event, Blizzard is looking back to some of WoW's most iconic dungeons and raids for inspiration. Blackrock Depths is coming back as a raid, for starters, and Blizzard is looking to capture the spirit of the game's iconic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-players-quest-to-become-scarab-lord-highlights-what-makes-the-games-aq-event-so-special/1100-6501029/" data-ref-id="1100-6501029">Gates of Ahn'Qiraj</a> event with new outdoor activities in Silithus. The anniversary update will also see a handful of original WoW dungeons get the Timewalking treatment, allowing players to venture into iconic dungeons like the Deadmines, Zul'farrak, Dire Maul, and Stratholme to earn updated rewards. For PvP enjoyers, the Korrak's Revenge brawl is coming back once more as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Participating in the new activities, as well as Season 1 content (which will still be in full swing by the time the anniversary update arrives) will earn players a new currency. That currency can be used to buy the aforementioned Tier 2 armor sets as well as new mounts, pets, and other cosmetics, including a set modeled off Blizzard's real-life service rewards granted to longtime Blizzard employees. A fairgrounds of sorts for the event will be set up outside the game's Caverns of Time location, where players can enjoy other festivities like dressing up as iconic WoW characters, listening to stories from WoW's past as told by Lorewalker Cho, or a new Mount Mania minigame where players will be able to show off their mount collection.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the event itself, patch 11.0.5 will allow Dracythr players, until now restricted to being the Dracthyr-exclusive Evoker class, the option of being some, but not all, of the game's other classes. Dracthyr will be able to play as Rogue, Warlock, Hunter, Priest, Mage, and Warrior come the update. Shamans will also see an update to their Ascended forms that channel the various elements that Shamans wield in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard hasn't announced a release date for WoW's 11.0.5 patch just yet, but said it will be available for testing on the game's public test realm soon. Previous anniversary events have happened in November, so expect the update to arrive somewhere around that time. Meanwhile, WoW's latest expansion, The War Within, just launched. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review-stay-awhile-and-listen/1900-6418275/" data-ref-id="1900-6418275">WoW: The War Within review</a>, we called the MMO's 10th expansion one of its best. WoW: The War Within Season 1, which introduces the expansion's first raid and kicks off its Mythic+ dungeon and PvP seasons, begins September 10.</p>

					<p>I thought Dragonflight was the absolute peak of modern-day World of Warcraft, but I didn't think it could be topped. At first, I didn't have much hope for <a href="https://thewarwithin.blizzard.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The War Within</a> when diving into it. However, the action started immediately, and my interest was immediately piqued. While World of Warcraft has had some questionable choices in villains (looking at The Jailer from Shadowlands), Xal'atath feels multi-faceted and genuinely evil compared to other villains that have popped up over the years.</p>
<p>The Warbands feature was one of the best features added in this new expansion. You could choose up to four characters in a Warband, regardless of race, class, or faction. By having those four in the Warband, you could transfer supplies between them, including currencies, appearances, Renown levels, and achievements! With the Warbands feature came the feature of learning a transmog appearance, regardless of whether you could equip that type of armor or weapon, making the potential to get great transmogs even easier.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this feature did break the Guild bank, with my guild, in particular, losing a ridiculous amount of supplies and materials. Many mounts were in there for players to get if they didn't already own them. There is no update on whether Blizzard will resolve that, and neither my guild nor I am hopeful about this situation.</p>
<p>What surprised me most about getting stuck into World of Warcraft: The War Within was how Alliance tailored it felt. Although I play as a Blood Elf Arcane Mage, I immediately noticed that the main characters I interacted with were all Alliance except for Thrall, who is part of the Alliance, and Horde. I went into this expansion without knowing anything about it other than that it centered more heavily around the Void, which I was incredibly excited about. Since Void Elves were introduced in World of Warcraft: Legion, I have loved everything to do with the Void and was excited to see it come back to life in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-launch-qa-on-dungeons-raids-and-art/">new expansion</a>.</p>
<p>While the action started brilliantly, I was shocked to see it take such a turn and for them to kill off a main character so soon into the expansion. I'd barely done five quests before seeing the cutscene, and it still feels like a questionable choice. Whether it was done to get rid of a powerful character or to get back at Alleria is something that I'm still figuring out.</p>
<p>The new areas we are introduced to in The War Within are stunning. Khaz Algar and the surrounding areas are incredibly tranquil and feel like something out of Middle Earth. Pair that with the accompanying music, and completing side quests or working on your professions is very peaceful. I usually spend a lot of time completing the surrounding side quests and grinding reputations, and I found the daily quests and world quests enjoyable, as well as some of the mount and pet farms available.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-6.png"></a></figure>

<p>Compared to previous expansions, I was thoroughly impressed with how well the expansion seemed optimized from the outset. During all the last expansion releases I've experienced, servers have been packed, or immense lag has made it difficult to get anything done. This time, the expansion seems to be running like a well-oiled machine, with barely any hiccups along the way.</p>
<p>My main gripe with The War Within is now from an update Blizzard pushed a couple of days ago, making the enemies more challenging to deal with overall. I could initially take care of a pack of five basic enemies alone, but I had to heal and use all defensive cooldowns to deal with just one. Even Delves have become pretty much impossible, even at the lower levels. Regardless of whether you set Brann Bronzebeard up to be in a healer role or a DPS role, his attacks and abilities aren't of much use to you at all.</p>
<p>I find that he's of more value as a damage dealer. Although he drops potions in the healer role, it feels as if the potions don't actually provide any healing whatsoever, and now Delves will only be possible if you are overgeared, which won't be able to happen for a while yet.</p>
<p>Once I get some new gear for my Arcane Mage and max out my Hero Talents, I'll enjoy the challenge of Delves again without dying before completing the first mission. I enjoy being a glass cannon class as my rotation is simple and fun, and I hope I don't have to swap to my Paladin just to be able to progress and complete the Delves entirely.</p>
<p>Compared to some previous expansions, the story for World of Warcraft: The War Within is very well thought out. It's been fantastic to see characters such as Alleria again, bringing hidden characters back into the limelight after not being seen for multiple expansions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-8.png"></a></figure>

<p>Each area throughout Khaz Algar felt unique, with their features that made them stand out from each other. For example, Dornogal is very peaceful, and you can have a great time while leveling professions there. In contrast, the atmosphere in Hallowfall is very different, with far more tension than the other areas in the expansion.</p>
<p>Thus far, I've found the dungeons to be a little bit samey. They remind me of multiple expansions in the past, specifically Warlords of Draenor and Cataclysm. The dungeons feel inspired by other dungeons from previous expansions, with Priory of the Sacred Flame reminiscent of a dungeon from Shadowlands.</p>
<p>Although there is now the addition of collecting Skyriding Glyphs in the latest expansion, despite collecting a massive amount of them, it seems bizarre to me that the point of these Skyriding Glyphs is to provide the players with a new mount. They served a purpose in Dragonflight, as they offered your Dragon abilities during flight. I like that they were reincorporated into this new expansion, but I feel that it could have been built upon rather than just being used to provide players with a new mount grind.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing what the first season of this expansion brings and seeing my Arcane Mage become more powerful with some better gear, especially with the addition of Hero Talents, which have revolutionized my gameplay as an Arcane Mage. Nothing is quite as cool as summoning your own Arcane Phoenix (even if it can sometimes be a bit temperamental.)</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-7.png"></a></figure>

<p>As someone who has always played the weakest spec of Mage in World of Warcraft, it's been fantastic seeing the Arcane Mage thrive and finally have a spot on the DPS charts. This has been boosted substantially by the Hero Talents, which, as stated above, can give you awesome abilities like summoning an Arcane Phoenix when using Arcane Surge. Depending on what stats you spec into, your Arcane Phoenix can even help with interrupts, utilizing its own Spellsteal.</p>
<p>Interacting with the Earthens and getting to know Magni and his family has been a highlight of the expansion. I wasn't expecting Magni ever to be freed from the curse set upon him by Azeroth, and it was a complete shock to the system to see him as a normal Dwarf rather than one made of stone.</p>
<p>Overall, World of Warcraft: The War Within has been a delight to experience, from fun and rewarding mount grinds to surprisingly adorable pets (looking at you, Oop'lajax), as well as some genuinely heartbreaking quests that you get to experience in the main story campaign. Admittedly, I ignored the main campaign for quite a while and decided to do many of the side quests and Skyriding Glyph collecting, but even then, I had fun at every interval. I can't wait to sink even more hours into World of Warcraft: The War Within and I look forward to seeing what comes next in future updates.</p>

<p>The expansion was so close to perfect. If it wasn't for the update that Blizzard released where they went from undertuning everything to overtuning it, the expansion would have been perfection. The quests are fun, Hero Talents provide lots of cool options, and the music really makes the areas of Khaz Algar magical and threatening, all at the same time. Admittedly, the story for this expansion could have done with being a little longer, as it felt quite short overall compared to previous expansions. However, there is still time for them to add more in future patches.</p>

            <p>Paradox are integrating four of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-iv">Europa Universalis IV</a>'s DLCs into the base game. The Rights Of Man, Art Of War, Digital Extreme Upgrade and Common Sense DLCs will be free to all current and future players of the eleven-year-old grand strategy game from October 17th onwards. 
</p>
<p>On the same date, Paradox are also introducing a new Starter Edition of the game and lowering the price of the its Ultimate Bundle DLC collection.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are happy to announce the integration of FOUR essential DLCs into the Europa Universalis IV base game: 'Rights of Man', 'Art of War', 'Digital Extreme Upgrade' and 'Common Sense'. That’s right - all current and future EUIV players will receive these four DLCs absolutely free of charge! And you won’t even need to do anything to receive them," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/236850/view/4599951478208420913">the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>Three of the above DLC - Digital Extreme Upgrade, Art Of War and Rights Of Man - are already a part of the current Starter Edition, which typically costs £7 more than the base game itself. Common Sense - which, my parents will tell you, I don't possess - would typically be an extra £12.79 on top.
</p>
<p>Upgrading the base edition with these extras is great for those who don't already own them, and less so for those who paid money for them in the past several years. Paradox are positioning the new Starter Edition and lowered Ultimate Bundle cost as a "special treat" for those players, although that seems less than convincing. The Ultimate Bundle typically costs £313.56, by the way - albeit minus the cost of any included DLC you already own.
</p>
<p>From now until September 9th, the base game of EUIV is 76% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/">over on Steam</a>, making it £8.39/$10. That'll grant you access to the four DLCs when they unlock for everyone October 17th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only is he a former WWE superstar, but he’s a world-renowned talent who has his name in the annals of U.S. wrestling history with WWE and then-competitors WCW and New Japan Pro Wrestling. In many ways, Jericho’s involvement with AEW legitimized it as a new avenue for wayward WWE veterans and new talent alike. Unfortunately, however, most if not all of Jericho’s booking has hampered new talent rather than helping them flourish.<br></p><p>Traditionally, wrestlers enter a feud with another talent that can last upwards of a month with a big payoff at a pay-per-view where the victor—typically a good guy—graduates into a bigger feud with someone who has a championship or is issued a rematch with their villainous competitor. This structure allows companies to build new stars by having them overcome feuds with industry veterans or promising new talent. However, Jericho’s feuds—unaffectionately dubbed the “Jericho vortex” by fans—have had the opposite effect. Jericho’s booking only benefits himself while keeping younger talent like Konosuke Takeshita, Ricky Starks, Darby Allin, and Hook caught in his nebulous orbit until he’s done with them.<br></p><p>AEW’s “Jericho Vortex” phenomenon started to take shape when fans noticed that the Canadian wrestler’s feuds with younger talent felt more like Jericho clinging to their coattails for relevancy. As an AEW fan, knowing your favorite wrestler was entering a program with Jericho meant you wouldn’t see them do anything worth watching until the Jericho Vortex was done sucking up all their star power. Things have gotten so bad that fans began <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ItsGresh/status/1826703038561878283?t=-kZkwCARz0YwtN8kF-ANzw&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ItsGresh/status/1826703038561878283?t=-kZkwCARz0YwtN8kF-ANzw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memeing the phenomenon on X/Twitter</a></span> with videos of migrating WWE superstars interrupted by Jericho’s theme music—signaling that they, too, will be stuck in his vortex.<br></p><p>While the Jericho Vortex isn’t as all-encompassing and toxic as Hulk Hogan’s disastrous late-stage TNA run, it has garnered its fair share of groans from AEW audiences whenever they see a promising young talent enter a deadlock feud with the 53-year-old wrestler. Four months ago, fans voiced their growing frustration with Jericho by chanting “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TheEnemiesPE3/status/1790911976681398700?t=iqkZzl5xCrS0pY7AZ41cow&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TheEnemiesPE3/status/1790911976681398700?t=iqkZzl5xCrS0pY7AZ41cow&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Please retire</a></span>!” at him during AEW’s Dynasty pay-per-view.</p><p>Instead of retiring, Jericho did what he usually does: create an on-screen character with a new gimmick. Only this time around, instead of backing off of the antics that got him bad heat in the first place, Jericho leaned fully into the Jericho Vortex meme with his new bad guy persona, “The Learning Tree.”<br></p><p>With this new gimmick, Jericho takes up precious TV time every other week in a talk show segment called “TV Time with Jericho,” a glorified promo segment where Jericho and his lackeys glaze him up while standing next to cardboard cutouts of trees. During these segments, he refers to the Jericho Vortex by name, claiming it’s a mutually beneficial feud for his opponents. In theory, Jericho’s newfound gimmick is meant to give fans a scripted reason to boo him by utilizing their frustrations with how his booking tends to overshadow younger talent. But in practice, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PhilDL616/status/1830967096567832668&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PhilDL616/status/1830967096567832668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans absolutely hate it</a></span>. Jericho’s Learning Tree bit makes everything worse because it excuses how terrible his booking continues to be by retroactively folding it into his character arc.<br></p><p>Moreover, Jericho’s character—a fake-smiling “I’ve got the company’s best interest at heart” do-gooder is already cribbing off of The Young Bucks’ <em>Succession</em>-inspired EVP gimmick. A gimmick, mind you, that is also inspired by real-life heat the pair garnered during the whole CM Punk kerfuffle.<br></p><p><br>While this would typically be the part of the wrassling dissertation where a solution would be offered, there isn’t one here short of Jericho leaving the ring to go do something else. He’s a problem that would benefit AEW if he just went away. Whether he takes time off from AEW to appear on <em>The Masked Singer</em> again, or to go on tour with his butt rock band, Fozzy, or to take a vacation with his wife who may or may not have been “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Maffewgregg/status/1735392018719703194&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Maffewgregg/status/1735392018719703194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breaking the walls down” on January 6</a></span>, fans need him off TV so they can finally breathe a sigh of relief, knowing his music won’t hit their ears the moment their favorite wrestlers are on AEW.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m not talking about its story, though you will see some dark turns before your journey in Fa’diel ends. Instead I mean that underneath the bright and casual facade of <em>Visions of Mana</em> lies a deceptively deep RPG. I was amazed at how immersed I was in the game’s class system and team building, and I didn’t expect I’d spend so much time just exploring and uncovering secrets.<br></p><p>That said, to get the most out of <em>Visions of Mana</em>, you do have to kind of play by its rules. For example, if you don’t engage with the game’s RPG systems and try to brute force every battle with your action game sensibilities, you’re straight-up going to have a bad time. To get right to the crunchy center of what makes this trip to the Mana Tree so good, check out these ten tips that will make your journey sing.</p><p><strong>Order <em>Visions of Mana:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Visions-Mana-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CQ73WDH8/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-tips-square-enix-difficulty-1851639676&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CQ73WDH8" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/clVDQrSgeMQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/clVDQrSgeMQ" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2F&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-recommend-id="image://4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A piece of shadow art depicting a hero holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A piece of shadow art depicting a hero holding a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-recommend-id="image://4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A piece of shadow art depicting a hero holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’ve followed <em>Visions of Mana</em> at all, you probably know that it’s the fifth mainline entry in Square Enix’s <em>Mana</em> series (also known as <em>Seiken Densetsu</em>). Fortunately, you won’t miss anything by skipping right to <em>Visions of Mana</em>. Each game in the series typically takes place in its own world, so you aren’t missing any context that would help you understand this one better.<br></p><p>The main point of confusion is that, much like how <em>Legend of Zelda</em> take place across different iterations of Hyrule, <em>Mana</em> games all feature different incarnations of the same world of Fa’Diel. Bosses, locations, and characters will reappear in each game, but they have no connection to their appearances in past games. Similarly, “Sacrifice” tends to be a recurring theme in <em>Mana</em> games, which might make the premise of <em>Visions of Mana</em> make more sense as you’re starting out.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-recommend-id="image://7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero swishes a sword with all sorts of fancy effects." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our hero swishes a sword with all sorts of fancy effects." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-recommend-id="image://7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero swishes a sword with all sorts of fancy effects." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The 2020 remake of <em>Trials of Mana</em> is an infamously easy game. It’s not a total cakewalk, but you definitely need to play it on Hard mode to experience any friction in the combat. By comparison, <em>Visions of Mana</em> is more balanced. Hard mode actually feels tough, so you may prefer Normal mode after coming off of a <em>Trials of Mana</em> playthrough.</p><p>Fortunately, difficulty settings can be changed at any time, so you can decide to dial up or down the challenge as you progress.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-recommend-id="image://e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Three heroes pose after a battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three heroes pose after a battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-recommend-id="image://e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Three heroes pose after a battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Having said all that, I really recommend a Hard mode playthrough for anyone who wants to have a crunchy RPG experience. It doesn’t feel great in the early game, since enemies inflict major damage and can soak a ton of hits before they’re defeated. At the same time, Hard mode really forces you to optimize your defenses and offenses equally. You know, the kind of stuff that RPG fans enjoy strategizing around. Once you get into some of the game’s deadly DPS builds, those enemy lifebars aren’t going to feel big at all.</p><p>This is how I experienced <em>Visions of Mana</em>, and I recommend it for anyone else who wants to dive into everything that the game’s class system offers.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-recommend-id="image://dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The map showing the continents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The map showing the continents." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-recommend-id="image://dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The map showing the continents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the end of chapter 1, you’ll eventually board a boat in Rhata Harbor to continue the main story. This isn’t a point of no return, but it does lock you out of returning to that first continent for now. Fast travel at Meridians can’t cross bodies of water, but rest assured that you’ll unlock other ways to travel the world as you advance the main story.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cd4ffd15a10f790f1e44d744806713ab" data-recommend-id="image://cd4ffd15a10f790f1e44d744806713ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Help help, make it go away." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Help help, make it go away." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cd4ffd15a10f790f1e44d744806713ab" data-recommend-id="image://cd4ffd15a10f790f1e44d744806713ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Help help, make it go away." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Visions of Mana</em> has a lot of quests. In fact, if you attempt to complete all the optional content in the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-visions-of-mana-square-enix-rpg-1851635405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-visions-of-mana-square-enix-rpg-1851635405">you can add about 20 extra hours to your run time</a></span>. Some of these are part of larger side quest chains, such as Niccolo’s requests or the woman who asks you to find locations depicted in paintings. Otherwise, most quests exist as an excuse for you to grind. These won’t affect your playthrough if they remain unfinished.</p><p>You can see what a side quest will award you right in the Side Quests tab of your main menu. Quests that give equipment or ability seeds are worth prioritizing, but you can typically save quests that only give money for later. If you’re not in the mood to kill five monsters or find a trinket in a field, don’t force yourself.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="518ca4125df75377b19bd86b550d4d8c" data-recommend-id="image://518ca4125df75377b19bd86b550d4d8c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="It's...an empty courtyard?

However, a fledgling level one Val will <em>not</em> have the ability to 100 percent complete each area he sees. Some chests are hidden inside ruins that house endgame monsters. Others require Elemental Vessels that you don’t have yet. Either way, you’ll need to return later to collect every reward.</p><p>As a fun tip, <em>Visions of Mana</em> will always add new markers on old maps showing you where you can use new Elemental Vessels. There’s no need to take notes if you encounter something you can’t interact with!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-recommend-id="image://3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Elemental madness as fire rips through everything." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Elemental madness as fire rips through everything." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-recommend-id="image://3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Elemental madness as fire rips through everything." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Elemental Aeries are optional battle arenas that you’ll find all throughout your journey. These typically make you fight two waves of powerful enemies, and you’ll only have a couple minutes to pull it off. Fortunately, most character’s class strike skills are <em>very</em> good at totally clearing entire groups of enemies, so these challenges will feel way easier if you begin with a fully charged gauge. The timer won’t even run as the flashy animation plays!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-recommend-id="image://36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Moves UI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Moves UI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-recommend-id="image://36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Moves UI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>You will unlock a lot of character classes in <em>Visions of Mana</em>. To upgrade them, you’ll need to advance the Elemental Plots found in your main menu. Each character only has so many points to invest in each track found here, so you unfortunately can’t invest in every skill you see.</p><p>That said, even if you don’t use a certain class, any spells or moves learned via Elemental Plots <em>will</em> stick with the character no matter how they’re built. This means characters like Val can natively equip almost every elemental imbuement in the game, while Careena can use debuffs even if you’re using her as a Monk. Characters can only bring so many spells into battle, though, so make sure you set their ring menus after unlocking skills!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-recommend-id="image://c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A party of four face off against a beastie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A party of four face off against a beastie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-recommend-id="image://c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A party of four face off against a beastie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As deep as the class system is in <em>Visions of Mana</em>, it does have some limitations. You can’t respec your characters until very late in the game, and the way you approach boss battles will differ from the way you approach Elemental Aeries. Fortunately, you’ll unlock five characters before your journey ends, and building all of them will let you adapt to different situations as you encounter them. For example, you can build Palamena to inflict massive damage on bosses, while Careena can specialize in Class Strike damage that absolutely destroys huge waves of common enemies.</p><p>All characters earn equal EXP, even if you don’t use them in battle. Specialize all your characters in a way that compliments the team—you’ll be happy to have those extra options on standby as you progress.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-recommend-id="image://f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Visions of Mana intro screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Visions of Mana intro screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-recommend-id="image://f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Visions of Mana intro screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I weally would have wiked this fweature in Twials of Mana<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
