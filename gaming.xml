That means, if you’re running with randos, that it’s entirely possible you’ll end up with a team of people who instalock their favorite damage-dealing Duelist character and leave you to babysit. <em>Rivals</em>’ roster makeup is a factor as well, with Duelists accounting for nearly 20 slots of the 35 playable heroes in the game. It’s only natural that many players would land on one of them as a favorite.</p><p>Credit where credit is due, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>plays around with the core elements of the DPS role. It has a great mix of melee, snipers, and everything in between. Which characters you gravitate toward will undoubtedly boil down to your playstyle, but we’ll try and be fair to everyone as we rank the best and worst of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Duelists.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6897e9969b9add5684156ef551029396" data-recommend-id="image://6897e9969b9add5684156ef551029396" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Widow stands with her rifle in her right hand pointed downward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Widow stands with her rifle in her right hand pointed downward." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6897e9969b9add5684156ef551029396" data-recommend-id="image://6897e9969b9add5684156ef551029396" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Widow stands with her rifle in her right hand pointed downward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Natasha, who is clearly meant to be the Widowmaker character in NetEase’s hero shooter, is one of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ most unfortunate <em>Overwatch </em>knock-offs. The inevitable direct comparison highlights that, for as much as she may have been modeled on Blizzard’s sniper, Black Widow is nevertheless a significantly inferior version of the archetype. Unlike her <em>Overwatch </em>counterpart, Black Widow can’t one-shot with her rifle. That makes her a lot less frustrating to go up against, but it also means that she’ll often be more reliant on her teammates to shave off enough damage that one well-placed headshot can take out a foe. And when so many characters in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>are incredibly mobile and can rush her down in seconds, she just isn’t as dominant as she could be. If NetEase does decide to give her a one-shot kill, the community will lose its mind. But until then, she gets to kick off this ranking at the very bottom.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5a3b1b91319092840572392114d80ca6" data-recommend-id="image://5a3b1b91319092840572392114d80ca6" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wolverine stands with one of his giant hands held up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wolverine stands with one of his giant hands held up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5a3b1b91319092840572392114d80ca6" data-recommend-id="image://5a3b1b91319092840572392114d80ca6" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wolverine stands with one of his giant hands held up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Logan, the comic-accurate short king, is a decent rush-down character who is greatly outclassed by most others in the role. He’s got some okay tankiness for survivability, he can slice a squishy enemy hero to bits if he manages to corner them, and his Feral Leap ability is pretty forgiving of even the least accurate aiming. But that’s kind of all he’s good for. His Team-Up ability with Hulk in which the big green guy throws Wolverine so he can get in close is fun, but he’s a little too easy to counter.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb07a853f7ffd8db33f9e60aeafc39e7" data-recommend-id="image://bb07a853f7ffd8db33f9e60aeafc39e7" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wanda stands with red energy emanating from her hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wanda stands with red energy emanating from her hands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb07a853f7ffd8db33f9e60aeafc39e7" data-recommend-id="image://bb07a853f7ffd8db33f9e60aeafc39e7" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wanda stands with red energy emanating from her hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Wanda was always destined to become less impactful as players spent more time with <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. On the plus side, Scarlet Witch has decent damage and an explosive ultimate that <em>can </em>be very effective if you find interesting ways to combo it with the right abilities. In the early days, her Reality Erasure ultimate, which nuked anyone within a decent radius, was terrifying in the same way D.Va’s Self-Destruct is in <em>Overwatch</em>. However, it has so many more weaknesses to exploit that it has made Scarlet Witch one of the least optimal picks in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>right now. Wanda has to charge up the attack, move slowly through the air while exposed to get into position, and as she screams “Pure! Chaos!” she’s so vulnerable that she can be crowd-controlled or just killed before she even gets a chance to set it off. She’s just too predictable these days. Her own CC ability is decent, but ultimately there are better picks who don’t leave themselves open to wasting an ult every team fight. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87f7fedf04113d9e938844666c23be54" data-recommend-id="image://87f7fedf04113d9e938844666c23be54" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spider-Man stands with his arms by his sides." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spider-Man stands with his arms by his sides." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87f7fedf04113d9e938844666c23be54" data-recommend-id="image://87f7fedf04113d9e938844666c23be54" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spider-Man stands with his arms by his sides." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man has one of the most devastating ultimates in the game, but he’s otherwise a bit finicky. Swinging around the map is as satisfying as it’s been in any game starring the web-slinger (if you mess around with the settings, at least), and it’s always fun to yank an enemy into a chasm with your web, but Spidey sometimes feels map-dependent and can be easily punished for poor play. That ultimate, though. When I hear “Don’t mess with the Amazing Spider-Man!” I know I have only a few seconds to move before I’m about to see Uncle Ben.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5e3b3377ece980a57b35bc781b91688" data-recommend-id="image://f5e3b3377ece980a57b35bc781b91688" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Man hovers in his suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iron Man hovers in his suit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5e3b3377ece980a57b35bc781b91688" data-recommend-id="image://f5e3b3377ece980a57b35bc781b91688" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Man hovers in his suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When Tony Stark has a Hulk on his team, he can rain down a ton of damage from the skies. Otherwise, he still does that but it’s a lot less impressive. Iron Man can be a real pest in the right hands, but his air-based playstyle leaves him more static than you might think. A good hitscan hero can ground him pretty easily and even in the best circumstances, he often has to choose between damage output and the slightest mobility. It makes him a well-balanced hero in the grand scheme of things, but it also means that one of the smartest men in the Marvel universe is constantly leaving himself open to anti-air fire. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9ed5d8f6980da58910ee9f1874134aaf" data-recommend-id="image://9ed5d8f6980da58910ee9f1874134aaf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Punisher holds a rifle in his hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Punisher holds a rifle in his hands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ed5d8f6980da58910ee9f1874134aaf" data-recommend-id="image://9ed5d8f6980da58910ee9f1874134aaf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Punisher holds a rifle in his hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every hero shooter needs a standard point-and-shoot guy, and the Punisher is that in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. He’s the most straightforward character on the roster, and that means he’s good at looking down the barrel of his gun and shooting whatever’s in front of him. His turret and gatling gun ultimate can shred through even the tankiest heroes on the field, but the latter also makes him easy to flank, and by the time you’re out of your turret and mobile again, you’re probably already dead. Overall, the Punisher is solid and will do exactly what he needs to.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e81c3d4529650145c8978e5db085dbe2" data-recommend-id="image://e81c3d4529650145c8978e5db085dbe2" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Namor holds his trident while looking at the camera with some disdain usually reserved for scornful teenagers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Namor holds his trident while looking at the camera with some disdain usually reserved for scornful teenagers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e81c3d4529650145c8978e5db085dbe2" data-recommend-id="image://e81c3d4529650145c8978e5db085dbe2" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Namor holds his trident while looking at the camera with some disdain usually reserved for scornful teenagers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Namor’s turrets are some of my favorite tools in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but they can also frustrate me as a user just as much as they probably annoy my foes being pelted by the octopus-like monstro spawn shooting them from whatever vantage point I can place them in. The King of the Seas is a defense-driven builder character who is good at setting up a fortified space on an objective. You can throw his turrets into any nook and cranny you can reach and they’ll automatically pepper enemy foes with decent damage and push them back as they attempt to advance on the point. His trident throws are slow but strong, and while his whale-summoning ultimate only does okay damage, it’s a quick deploy with good crowd control. That being said, if someone dives on you, you’re probably fucked, and his turrets aren’t static fixtures you can set and forget. They disappear after only a few seconds, and it makes it harder to create good setups and get value out of them; if you set up too early, you’ll lose time with them on the field, and if you set up too late, you’re probably going to end up just throwing them somewhere to do even a bit of damage while you’re getting swarmed. Playing Namor well requires game sense and timing, and I wouldn’t be mad if NetEase made it so his turrets stayed present until they were destroyed, but for now, he’s good at what he does.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="54e1a3f0ee20d95f9275bcd88807260b" data-recommend-id="image://54e1a3f0ee20d95f9275bcd88807260b" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mister Fantastic stands with his arms crossed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mister Fantastic stands with his arms crossed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54e1a3f0ee20d95f9275bcd88807260b" data-recommend-id="image://54e1a3f0ee20d95f9275bcd88807260b" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mister Fantastic stands with his arms crossed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I have become a Mister Fantastic main since he launched last week, and I was surprised to hear most people think Reed Richards is one of the worst characters in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Based on his placement here, I obviously disagree. Mister Fantastic is surprisingly tanky, with most of his kit being focused on survivability and slow but strong swings of his stretchy arms. I wouldn’t be surprised if in a year’s time, Reed has been moved to the Vanguard role considering his entire schtick is absorbing damage to send it back to enemies and raising the defenses of his teammates through shields. But for now, I still find myself wrecking shop in his inflated state, zipping around by latching onto friends and enemies, and being an absolute bother as I bounce on the point with my ultimate. He’s one of the most interesting and effective brawlers in the game if you know how to use him.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0af2efabe2668cb809a641764fead811" data-recommend-id="image://0af2efabe2668cb809a641764fead811" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Storm hovers as her cape flows in the wind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Storm hovers as her cape flows in the wind." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0af2efabe2668cb809a641764fead811" data-recommend-id="image://0af2efabe2668cb809a641764fead811" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Storm hovers as her cape flows in the wind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>NetEase has taken some time to figure out Storm’s place in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. She started out Season 0 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with the lowest pick rate</a></span>, but has received some pretty substantial buffs in Season 1. Since then, the flight-based hero has become a much more reliable Duelist with higher damage output and sustainability. Storm also has some decent supportive abilities to empower her teammates, so she manages to stand out among the other flight-based heroes. Her ultimate is also still one of the most useful for clearing a group of enemies, as she’s able to unleash heaps of damage while not remaining stationary the way other heroes with high-damage AOE attacks have to. She’s got a lot of potential, so I’m interested to see what she looks like in a season or two.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6a0bb2cef1213598fd2ab60222aaf6d0" data-recommend-id="image://6a0bb2cef1213598fd2ab60222aaf6d0" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squirrel Girl holds a slingshot and a grey squirrel is perched on her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squirrel Girl holds a slingshot and a grey squirrel is perched on her shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a0bb2cef1213598fd2ab60222aaf6d0" data-recommend-id="image://6a0bb2cef1213598fd2ab60222aaf6d0" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squirrel Girl holds a slingshot and a grey squirrel is perched on her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Squirrel Girl can pack a punch and she’s been helped by the Season 1 buffs that made her ultimate something actually worth fearing instead of just a mild inconvenience. Her explosive abilities are great at keeping people at bay without you having to be a living aimbot. She’s basically <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Junkrat, and it’s good that NetEase has its own silly gremlin to occupy that playstyle. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="330e065d1c9cbecad69fc8f5f3fda7a9" data-recommend-id="image://330e065d1c9cbecad69fc8f5f3fda7a9" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Panther lifts up one of his claws." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Panther lifts up one of his claws." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="330e065d1c9cbecad69fc8f5f3fda7a9" data-recommend-id="image://330e065d1c9cbecad69fc8f5f3fda7a9" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Panther lifts up one of his claws." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A good T’Challa can be absolutely vicious in the enemy’s backline. His Vibranium Mark, which marks enemies after they’ve been struck by most of his abilities, allows him to immediately recharge his dash-based attack and helps sustain him with bonus health. The best way to use Black Panther is to master combos that maximize cooldowns and let you maintain a neverending onslaught of damage and mobility, zipping around enemy teams so fast they don’t have time to react. That chain-based kit does leave him vulnerable, however, as fumbling those combos will leave you without available abilities and open to enemy fire. That precision can be a lot to manage, but Black Panther is a force to be reckoned with when the player knows what they’re doing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e081badaa15b793de95adca6b2840850" data-recommend-id="image://e081badaa15b793de95adca6b2840850" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Moon Knight holds a crescent moon blade as his cape flows in the wind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Moon Knight holds a crescent moon blade as his cape flows in the wind." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e081badaa15b793de95adca6b2840850" data-recommend-id="image://e081badaa15b793de95adca6b2840850" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Moon Knight holds a crescent moon blade as his cape flows in the wind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Moon Knight is the kind of setup character who can wreck an enemy team before they’ve realized he’s done anything. His playstyle revolves around ankhs he can place anywhere on the map that, when fired upon with his primary attack, will bounce around and do damage to enemies within a radius. If you place one of these and it escapes a foe’s notice, you can rack up so much damage before anyone on the enemy team even catches on. Making the most of him is a bit reliant on positioning and the good fortune of not drawing your enemies’ attention, but sneaking around, getting a good ankh placed, and going to town on a group of enemies never gets old, and also never stops being frustrating to deal with for more stationary heroes.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="39c5e9e9354844a9f85981d6eac9af5a" data-recommend-id="image://39c5e9e9354844a9f85981d6eac9af5a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bucky stands with his metallic arm pressed against his chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bucky stands with his metallic arm pressed against his chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="39c5e9e9354844a9f85981d6eac9af5a" data-recommend-id="image://39c5e9e9354844a9f85981d6eac9af5a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bucky stands with his metallic arm pressed against his chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Again!</p><p>Again!</p><p>Again!</p><p>You heard that vividly in your head every time, right? Bucky is great at picking off multiple enemies very quickly thanks to his high damage and crowd-controlling maneuvers. He can pull people in close and/or punch them in the air, and each of these attacks puts them in the perfect position for a well-placed headshot. But really, the bread and butter of his moveset is his repeatable ultimate that lets him jump into the air and strike down on foes multiple times, as long as he’s landing kill shots within an incredibly gracious window. Winter Soldier’s ultimate has several interlinking systems that determine just how many times you get to bring the hurt down on unsuspecting foes on the ground, but when all the stars align and enemies are positioned just right, it deletes entire squads groveling underneath your mechanical fist.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2ba1282d3d7416b800284348a79554a4" data-recommend-id="image://2ba1282d3d7416b800284348a79554a4" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord holds his pistols with one pointed in the air and the other at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord holds his pistols with one pointed in the air and the other at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ba1282d3d7416b800284348a79554a4" data-recommend-id="image://2ba1282d3d7416b800284348a79554a4" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord holds his pistols with one pointed in the air and the other at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Peter Quill is hands down one of the most fun characters to play in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. He’s a more mobile evolution of Tracer from <em>Overwatch</em> with a little Reaper and Soldier: 76 sprinkled in there to fill out his kit. The dual-pistol-wielding smartass zips around the map with a fluidity not afforded to pretty much any other flight-based hero on the roster. His hit-and-run playstyle lets him get in close, spray enemies with a barrage of bullets, then quickly escape to reposition and do it all over again. Hit ultimate ability automatically locks onto enemies from a good distance as he gains infinite flight. It’s one of the best flanking abilities in all of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but it’s also well-balanced enough that it’s not an instant win button. He’s the kind of character that feels good to play, but also feels good to play against.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b7572bd65d7a5a1699b61c21c6abe776" data-recommend-id="image://b7572bd65d7a5a1699b61c21c6abe776" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magik stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding her sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magik stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding her sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7572bd65d7a5a1699b61c21c6abe776" data-recommend-id="image://b7572bd65d7a5a1699b61c21c6abe776" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magik stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding her sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of hit-and-run characters, Magik is all about mind games at close range. Her slower sword swings are offset by her mobility, allowing her to cleave through enemies and then pop back to safety through a teleport. Despite her melee-based playstyle, she’s not a brawler per se. Trying to beat up an entire enemy team as Magik is how you end up back in spawn, but a strategic dive can take out your enemy’s backline in seconds. When she pops her ult, her entire kit becomes more destructive and that’s when she’s able to really deal some damage. But even without that, Magik can reliably get picks no matter what.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5dc32a8774eebacdf59fab908f84a8b3" data-recommend-id="image://5dc32a8774eebacdf59fab908f84a8b3" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Fist stands in a combat stance with his hands raised." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iron Fist stands in a combat stance with his hands raised." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5dc32a8774eebacdf59fab908f84a8b3" data-recommend-id="image://5dc32a8774eebacdf59fab908f84a8b3" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Fist stands in a combat stance with his hands raised." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re looking to get right up in an enemy’s face, you can’t go wrong with Iron Fist. He’s arguably one of the best melee-based characters in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> with a focus on survivability, quick hits, and mobility that even lets him keep up with an Iron Man as he flies away in fear. No one in the game is able to incessantly pester people like Iron Fist can. When he’s not throwing punches and kicks, he’s blocking enemy attacks and recycling all that incoming fire into shields so he can punch and kick them some more. His entire kit fuels a repeating cycle of fists and feet barraging an enemy until they’re either dead or they start running away. Iron Fist’s ultimate cranks all of these already incredible abilities up to 11, allowing him to pummel enemies into the ground with speed and simplicity. He’s a menace, and any character without the mobility to avoid him (and even some who can fly out of a fight) hates to see him coming.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d0f820676772468cce8d0d11b574535" data-recommend-id="image://9d0f820676772468cce8d0d11b574535" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Psylocke stands with one arm by her side the other raised to her chest with two fingers extended." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Psylocke stands with one arm by her side the other raised to her chest with two fingers extended." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d0f820676772468cce8d0d11b574535" data-recommend-id="image://9d0f820676772468cce8d0d11b574535" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Psylocke stands with one arm by her side the other raised to her chest with two fingers extended." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The last of the X-Men on this list is one of the most efficient assassins in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. When Psylocke gets into the thick of a fight she can take out squishy heroes with a few shuriken tosses, then quickly escape and hide thanks to her invisibility. She’s a ninja, and her kit reflects that. She’s all about quick, precise strikes and retreating to safety and secrecy when needed. A sneak attack by a Psylocke is pretty much a guaranteed kill, and that ferocious killing intent extends to her ultimate, which is one of the best in the game. As she strikes down enemies in a pretty wide area of effect, even the most powerful heroes in the game will still get sliced up like butter under a hot knife.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="00675459194d4cc98cfc11db3c30277c" data-recommend-id="image://00675459194d4cc98cfc11db3c30277c" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hawkeye stands with his bow in hand, pulling the string slightly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hawkeye stands with his bow in hand, pulling the string slightly." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00675459194d4cc98cfc11db3c30277c" data-recommend-id="image://00675459194d4cc98cfc11db3c30277c" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hawkeye stands with his bow in hand, pulling the string slightly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Everyone’s least favorite Avenger is easily the best one in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Clint’s bow is somehow one of the most powerful weapons in the Marvel universe, capable of one-shotting most characters in NetEase’s shooter. Part of this is because of Hawkeye’s passive ability Archer’s Focus, which increases the damage of your arrows the longer you aim at a specific enemy, allowing you to easily clear the threshold of a one-shot kill if you land a headshot. There’s nothing quite as frustrating as the immediacy of dying by Hawkeye’s hand. You’ll be in the middle of a team fight, living your best life, and starting to make some headway in capturing an objective when-boom, you’re dead. Even after the nerfs at the beginning of Season 1, Hawkeye still has almost everyone in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> in his sights. Well, all except for one…</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ff51349a64f5b9c241cb32165e20ccc1" data-recommend-id="image://ff51349a64f5b9c241cb32165e20ccc1" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hela stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hela stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff51349a64f5b9c241cb32165e20ccc1" data-recommend-id="image://ff51349a64f5b9c241cb32165e20ccc1" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hela stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I can’t believe NetEase watched the devastation the Marvel goddess of death was raining down upon the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> player base and thought a 25 HP nerf would be sufficient in Season 1. With a flick of her wrists, Hela can send hit-scan daggers across the battlefield that will two-shot most of the roster without all the focus you need to pull off something like that as Hawkeye. On top of her insane damage output, having a brief CC and some decent mobility means Hela has responses to most other playstyles. If she gets dove on, just hold an enemy in place and fly away, then throw daggers at their heads as you gently float down. If all of this wasn’t enough, her ultimate lets her leer over the map with a whopping 1000 HP as she lobs down chaos and destruction at her ant-like foes, cackling as she destroys them like the meaningless insects they are. Somebody call Surtur to start Ragnarok. I need this woman dead expeditiously.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> at CES 2025 doesn't mean earlier versions of the Deep Learning Super Sampling upscaler aren't still being used. Today, NVIDIA provided an update on some PC games that are about to get support for DLSS Super Resolution (2.0), Frame Generation (3.0), and/or DLAA.</p>
<p>Both NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation are available in Tankhead, a roguelite vehicle shooter released last month on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tankhead-2f3b51" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. In this game, players become Whitaker, the pilot of a drone-controlled Light Tank that can move quickly and deliver devastating damage with various weapons. The ultimate goal is traversing the Event Containment Area, where humans cannot survive, to reach the so-called Highpoint.</p>
<p>Starting today, DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex are also available in <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-2-is-a-next-generation-action-moba-made-with-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMITE 2</a>. Following the end of the Closed Alpha stage, the Unreal Engine 5 powered third-person action MOBA game <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-2-gets-open-beta-launch-adding-three-new-modes-five-new-gods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has entered the Open Beta</a> and is officially free to play on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, as well as Sony's PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X consoles. Developer Hi-Rez Studios has added five new gods with this update: Aladdin from Arabian myth, the Egyptian God of Earth Geb, the Chinese Ascendant Warrior Mulan, Agni from the Hindu Pantheon, and Ullr from the Norse Pantheon.</p>
<p><iframe title="SMITE 2 Free-to-Play Open Beta Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTbb9B3UinQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tomorrow, HoYoverse will release update 3.0 for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/honkai-star-rail-trails-of-mediocrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, MiHoYo's free-to-play science fantasy gacha game. The patch will add the new world of Amphoreus and a fresh chapter in the game's main story and introduce NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution to the PC version, increasing frame rates for GeForce RTX users.</p>
<p>Italian developer KUNOS Simulazioni will release the highly anticipated racing simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-set-to-release-on-steam-january-16-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> on early access in two days, on Thursday, January 16. The game features a vastly improved proprietary engine that supports a full 24-hour race cycle, advanced lighting, dynamic weather, and track conditions. It also supports VR and triple-screen Surround setups for maximum immersion. In both cases, users will be glad to know the game supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution on day one as a frame rate booster.</p>

having attacks automatically hit. According to a datamine by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-datamined-plunderstorm-abilities-349674" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, it seems there will be some new abilities for players to experiment with this time around, with two new offensive and utility abilities. On the offensive side, there is Aura of Zealotry, which looks to mimic the iconic Paladin ability Consecration, while another, Celestial Barrage, calls down beams of moonlight to damage and reveal enemies. The new utility spells include Call Galefeather, which pushes enemies back, and the G.R.A.V. Glove: a spell that allows players to place a mark and then instantly teleport back to it.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally, winning and completing matches saw players progress through a Plunderstorm Renown reward track (similar to a battle pass). The end result was one where players felt compelled to grind all the way to the end to earn the more lucrative cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">This time around, the experience should be less aggravating. Instead of progressing a battle-pass-like system, players simply earn Plunder that can be spent at new reward vendors. This lets players pick and choose which rewards they want to go after rather than having to grind through rewards they might not be interested in.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of rewards, there's a number of new items available for players who maxed out the Renown track the first time the event was playable. Those who fell off the grind the first time the event was live will find that many of the mode's old rewards have returned. There are two new pets, mounts, and titles to claim, as well a number of new weapon and armor cosmetics. There are also new achievements, all of which reward a number of pirate-themed titles like Swabbie, Swashbuckler, and Buccaneer based on how much Plunder players earn over the course of the event.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW will see two major content updates this year according to the game's 2025 content roadmap, as well as a full reveal of the game's next expansion, Midnight. Blizzard already revealed that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">long-requested feature, player housing, will be part of Midnight</a>, but has not released additional details.</p>

Such plans, according to the outlet, potentially include entering the educational tech and mental health sectors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, the focus is on growing out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BeatStar </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">into other genres via potential standalone games. Barnes told MobileGamer the next "most obvious evolution" would be nostalgic rock, a la Guitar Hero.

Now, over three decades later, he’s taking his leave, after helping ship dozens of legendary games and bringing many, many more to the platform from developers big and small throughout the rest of the world. His parting gift to PS5 and PS4 players is a list of 22 personal favorites for fans to dig into during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/january-2024-game-releases-tekken-tlou-1851124958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/january-2024-game-releases-tekken-tlou-1851124958">the January release calendar lull</a></span>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195301" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="111" data-playlist="195301,196358,196215" data-current="195301"><div><p>This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20762.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Yoshida was a producer on the first <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> back in 1996 and received a special thanks in the credits of <em>Astro Bot</em> for “contributing to the creation” of the 2024 GOTY winner. During the PS3 and PS4 eras he was center stage, promoting the platform as it transformed from just a disc-playing machine into a massive distribution network for digital downloads and online gaming. His last day at Sony is January 15, though he promises he’s not retiring from the games industry entirely. </p><p>His departure will, however, mark the end of a friendlier, more fan-facing PlayStation brand. While the PS5 is more dominant than ever, the company that powers it has all but faded into the background. Gone is the era of E3 press conferences and live fanfests. Yoshida was the last familiar face from that epoch, and now he’s gone too. </p><p>To mark the occasion, January’s “monthly picks” on the PlayStation Store were personally chosen by the Sony veteran to celebrate some of the platform’s past legacy, its best exclusives, and recent indie hits from new generations of game makers. Here’s the full list of 22 recommended games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>﻿Nine Sols</em><br></li><li><em>Hades</em></li><li><em>Dead Cells</em></li><li><em>The Binding of Isaac: Repentance </em></li><li><em>Super Time Force Ultra</em></li><li><em>Doki Doki Literature Club</em></li><li><em>Sifu</em></li><li><em>Before Your Eyes</em></li><li><em>Inscryption</em></li><li><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></li><li><em>Genshin Impact</em></li><li><em>Fall Guys</em></li><li><em>Let It Die</em></li><li><em>Nioh 2</em></li><li><em>Ape Escape</em></li><li><em>Crash Bandicoot N-Sane Trilogy</em></li><li><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></li><li><em>Returnal</em></li><li><em>Bloodborne</em></li><li><em>Sound Shapes</em></li><li><em>Journey </em></li><li><em>Shadow of the Colossus </em></li></ul></blockquote><p>Let’s note a few standouts. One is <em>Before Your Eyes</em>, a PS VR2 game about a person reflecting on their past as they make their way into the afterlife. The scenes shift every time the player blinks, underlining the fleeting nature of time and our fragile grasp on our own memories. <em>Let It Die</em>, Grasshopper Manufacture’s 2016 cult-hit survival action game about climbing a tower, is another underrated shoutout. <em>Sound Shapes</em> also deserves more love. The 2012 music-based platformer doesn’t get talked about as much these days, but it speaks to how much more diverse Sony publishing used to be in the past (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mango_lychee/status/1678838942202839040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mango_lychee/status/1678838942202839040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its creator is quietly working on a new game</a></span>). </p><p>Most of the other names on the list are well-known at this point. If you haven’t already checked out <em>Nine Sols</em>, it’s a Metroidvania Souls-like in the vein of <em>Hollow Knight</em> that was one of 2024's best games. <em>Super Time Force Ultra</em>, meanwhile, is a retro shoot ‘em up in which the ghosts of prior failed runs help you out. It’s neat, pretty, and totally deserves a sequel. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/yosp/status/1878905474059554964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/yosp/status/1878905474059554964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yoshida’s also playable in it</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"There's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way and it's got to come off, you have meat caps to the bottom where the flesh is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had systems for all of that and it turned into a big rat's nest. All these things you have to count for now with all these crazy hoses on the helmets and all that kind of stuff that we added. Or now you could change the body size significantly. The character creator had evolved quite a bit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans lamented that Starfield, which was the first full single-player role-playing game from Bethesda in eight years, didn't have the gore and dismemberment mechanics that were present in Fallout 4. Mejillones said these mechanics make more sense in Fallout than in Starfield, however, given their "tongue in cheek" humor. "It's part of the fun," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield arrived in September 2023 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-hits-15-million-players-as-patch-adds-achievement-friendly-creations-new-land-vehicle-and-quest-and-more">in the time since has reached more than 15 million players</a>. "Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, another former Bethesda developer revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-starfield-dev-surprised-by-how-much-loading-the-game-launched-with">his surprise at the sheer amount of loading Starfield ended up launching with</a>, particularly in the city of Neon. Since launch, Bethesda has worked to improve the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-gets-big-update-that-adds-detailed-surface-maps-ship-decoration-and-60fps-on-xbox-series-x">with 60fps now possible as part of performance mode</a>.

But one high-schooler has managed to port Doom into an actual PDF file that you can run inside your browser. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, it’s missing minor elements like “text” and “sound” — but who really needs that when you can play E1M1 while pretending to do those taxes you’ve been ignoring?  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Github user and “high school student” <a href="https://github.com/ading2210" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ading2210</u></a> was inspired by a recent port of Tetris, named TetrisPDF, to the humble PDF format, and resolved to make one of the world’s most celebrated shooters playable in a Chromium-based browser near you. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/14/screenshot-2025-01-14-171016-1736874646161.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doom in a PDF?

While the official specifications for a PDF allow for more sophisticated scripting, security concerns in browsers cut things down a bit. But it was enough to still port Doom over to the format.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Javascript capabilities within the PDF specifications allowed ading2210 to “do whatever computation we want,” and the results are glorious. Using a six-color ASCII grid to represent sprites and graphics, the high-schooler managed to deliver a legible port of Doom, so long as you’re happy with a lengthy response time of 80ms per frame drawn on screen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might not want to throw out your PS5 just yet, but seeing Doom ported to the inside of a .PDF file is pretty remarkable, especially considering just how legible the overall result is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TetrisPDF creator Thomas Rinsma <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680801" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted on Hacker News</u></a> that he had also made his own version of PDF Doom, but added that ading2210’s version was “neater in many ways."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you might not want this version of Doom to be the way you first experience the game, the novelty of seeing Doom run on all kinds of ridiculous devices, files (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DnoOOgYxck" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>or even living gut bacteria</u></a>) is endlessly entertaining.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Director David F. Sandberg also explained the premise: teenagers are stuck in a time loop where each cycle is a different horror genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The movie, it has sort of the same tone and the same vibe but it expands upon the universe," he said. "One of the creative things the game did is that people make different choices and die in different ways. The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again. Every time they come back to life it's like they're in a new horror genre. To survive, they have to make it until dawn."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-features-a-new-story-and-cast-of-characters">Sony Pictures already revealed the film will feature a new story and cast of characters</a>, it's now clear it's taking a more meta approach rather than just telling a traditional horror story as the video game did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until Dawn, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-review">which arrived in 2015 and became a quick fan favorite</a>, lets players make pivotal decisions in a story where all eight teens can die, all eight can live, or anywhere in between. Its story also brought in elements of different horror genres, with villains shifting from a creepy man in the woods to a clown mask-wearing killer to full on spooky monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Until Dawn film will seemingly focus on these elements instead of expanding the stories of Sam, Josh, and so on, or telling the tale of new teenagers struggling through a similar night. The characters in the film will have to make different decisions, like the players of the game, and progress through different genres as they go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actor Peter Stormare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-will-see-dr-hills-video-game-actor-reprise-his-role">who played Doctor Hill in the original game</a>, and as we now know, another character also called Hill in the film, said earlier in January that this approach works for dedicated fans and newcomers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>Nintendo is reportedly set to announce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on January 16, and Walmart Canada--known for upsetting video game developers by leaking announcements early--has chimed in with a meme of its own.</p><p>Today, January 14, the Walmart Canada Gaming account posted the popular image of Mario peeking from behind a curtain. "Hey, Mario," the post said, with the waving-hand emoji. Walmart Canada is no doubt referencing the rumors of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">forthcoming Switch 2 reveal</a>.</p><p>What's noteworthy here is that Walmart Canada has a semi-lengthy history of spoiling major announcements by posting product pages ahead of official announcements. As of yet, however, Walmart Canada hasn't spoiled anything about the Switch 2.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/788900063833493504" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Mario curtain image dates back to 2016</a>, when Nintendo of America used it to promote the announcement of the Switch, which was then known as "NX." It was meant to suggest that Nintendo would soon pull back the curtain on the device. It quickly became a meme, and some thought it was kind of creepy. Former Nintendo staffers later discussed how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-former-staff-say-infamously-weird-mario-curtain-photo-wont-happen-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo was aware of the reaction</a> and would never do something like that again.</p><p>Walmart Canada's leaks have included the first reveal of Rage 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-bethesda-vp-pete-hines-drags-walmart-canad/1100-6459642/" data-ref-id="1100-6459642">prompting Bethesda to drag the retailer in comments during E3 2018.</a> Also in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-reacts-to-rage-2-possibly-being-leaked-be/1100-6458836/" data-ref-id="1100-6458836">Walmart Canada leaked Borderlands 3, Gears 5, Just Cause 4, and other titles</a>.</p><p>Walmart Canada's gaming account is run by Riley Little. He <a href="https://www.walmartcanada.ca/news/2022/11/16/gamers-united-the-success-story-of-walmart-canada-gamings-twitter-account#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20Walmart%20was%20a%20person,more%20than%20three%20years%20ago." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a blog post in 2022</a> that it came down from above that Walmart Canada could do a better job communicating to gamers, and it was his idea to make the account "more approachable and more interesting." To achieve this, Little started posting all kinds of memes, as well as straight news and product announcements to drive people to shop at Walmart.</p><p>Walmart Canada's gaming leaks, though, have slowed down significantly in recent years. After all, video game developers and publishers generally do not enjoy having their unannounced information emerge early. As such, it would be shocking to see Walmart Canada actually reveal anything legitimate about the Switch 2, though you never know. Outside of Walmart Canada, the internet has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-breaks-its-silence-on-recent-switch-2-leaks/1100-6528735/" data-ref-id="1100-6528735">full of Switch leaks</a>. </p><p>If the rumors prove to be accurate, Nintendo could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">announce the Switch 2 on Thursday, January 16</a>, with the console then going on sale in May or June.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Sims is turning 25 this year, and EA has announced that a trio of new Kits are scheduled to hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> later this week to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">The news was announced via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk">a livestreamed</a> episode of Behind The Sims, which was posted to the official Sims YouTube channel. The stream featured a number of well-known "Simmers": players who stream their Sims 4 gameplay on Twitch or YouTube. In fact, one of the upcoming Kits was created in collaboration with LilSimsie, a popular Sims 4 content creator known for her elaborate house builds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FryVzV0aJdk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As for the Kits, their official titles haven't yet been announced, but we do know when they're arriving: All three Kits will be available for purchase on January 16, and although their price has yet to be confirmed, Sims 4 Kits normally cost $5 USD, so it's likely that players will be able to get their hands on all three of the new Kits for a total of $15.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the actual content included in these Kits, EA was a little more forthcoming.</p><p dir="ltr">"Two of the Kits are a mixture of Build/Buy [Mode items] and Create-A-Sim items inspired by Sims icons," LilSimsie shared during the livestream. "And the last one? Well, that one was made in collaboration with me!"</p><p dir="ltr">Given LilSimsie's well-known love for creating extravagant lots in Build Mode, it's likely that the Kit she collaborated on will include a good number of new items for players to build in-game homes with.</p><p dir="ltr">But these mysterious new Kits aren't the only thing players have to look forward to: According to the schedule shared in the livestream, the game's main menu is getting a total UI revamp, which has already gone live. Additionally, EA has announced that the MySims: Cozy Bundle will come to PC on March 18 (currently, it's only available to play on Nintendo Switch). Lastly, The Sims FreePlay will get a new update on February 4 that pays homage to the era in which the game first launched back in 2000.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Sims FreePlay has an exciting update planned!" EA shared. "Starting February 4, we're taking you back to the 2000s, where The Sims all began. Participate in special events, unlock velour tracksuits, and enjoy 25 days of in-game gifts featuring some of the most iconic items from The Sims' history!"</p><p dir="ltr">For more information on the new Sims 4 Kits, the MySims: Cozy Bundle, and The Sims FreePlay update, check out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/behind-the-sims-episode-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's recent blog post</a>.</p>

Players help their character reconnect with their lost heritage and discover what it truly means to be Na'vi.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pandora is a rich world containing thousands of different plants, animals and insects. I had the opportunity to create the sound for some of these. In this article, we will analyze two specific examples: The Lift Vine and the Veilswarm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Lift Vine">The Lift Vine</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Audio direction">Audio direction</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Lift Vine blurs the line between plant and animal. It’s what the Avatar universe calls “zooplantae” – they may look like exotic plants, but can have surprising, fun interactive behaviors. They might retract when you get close to them (as seen with the “Helicoradian” in the Avatar movie), electrocute you while you’re exploring the world, or in the case of the Lift Vine: pull you up a ledge when you grab onto them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some parts of the Lift Vine look like an animal and other parts look like a plant. For example, the tail of the vine looks very much like a reptilian or bird claw, while the top looks like a plant with leaves and branches. We wanted to emphasize both elements by creating organic sound textures, to make it feel grounded and believable, and fit in with the rest of the natural soundscape in the game world. However since they have gameplay functionality, we also made sure they have high transients to make it easily audible for the player, in the busy mix of sounds in the rainforest. The Lift Vine also has several versions with gameplay variations that we will explain later. As it is found very frequently in the game, in every part of the open world, the sound couldn’t be too invasive, repetitive or loud. We wanted the sound to be somewhat appealing and attractive for the player to invite them to use the Lift Vine.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Gameplay">Gameplay</h4><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Allows the player to go up or down ledges when they grab the vine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The vine isn’t available in polluted environment.

I recorded various props, such as a leather belt, jacket, deflated balloon, various vegetables, etc. and processed it in Reaper.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Lift Vine in Wwise. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The source sounds are implemented in Audiokinetic Wwise, using random containers with sound variations. We paid a lot of attention to detail in the implementation. Each part of the Lift Vine was to have its own bespoke, carefully positioned sound, not only when the player uses it but also when it is static in the open world. For example, when the Lift Vine isn’t used, we can see the vine or the claw slightly moving. The leaves in the vegetal platform on top of it are also gently moving according to the current wind strength in the world. All these little things deserved a sound.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6N1H28AO0tA?si=O8bLoMRc6FgwlGlm" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s look at all those components in detail, starting with the vine. The vine sound is made of leathery and creaky textures. I remember in the recording room, twisting an old big rope in every possible direction to have as many variations as possible, which was a lot of fun. Two audio emitters are positioned along the vine and the distance from each other varies according to the vine length.</span></p><p>Left, a vine. Middle, 15 meters vine length and right, 30 meters vine length. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The vine length can be just a few meters long, or up to 30 meters. The audio emitter position changes according to this length so they stick to the vine. This emitter position variation is scripted in the Lift Vine’s graph in Snowdrop, our proprietary game engine. We calculate the real time vine length by subtracting the Y axis float world position of the head to the tail Y axis float world position. Then we divide the difference by a constant. The quotient is then added with the Y axis of the tail world position and the sum is the Y axis of the audio emitter.</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Em-pgrW5ehg?si=d7_uQARWaWQS7H5A" height="450px" width="100%" data-testid="iframe" loading="lazy" scrolling="auto"></iframe><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These vine creak sounds stop playing when the area in which it is placed, has been polluted by the human antagonists in the game. When it’s polluted, visually, the vine disappears, the bulb and the vegetal platform turn grey and look sickly. We use the audio emitter position and check its pollution value at runtime. When it’s above a certain value, we set a Boolean to false, preventing the audio from playing.</span></p><p>How we dynamically change the audio emitter position based on the vine length in Snowdrop.

Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The claw idle sound, when it’s static and already opened, is made of rope creaks and gravel friction to get a "clicky" organic sound. It gives the claw a sort of animal texture. We didn’t want it to sound too vegetal because it looks very much like a monster claw. So, this part had to sound different than the rest of the plant. Also, as mentioned before, these high transient clicky sounds are made to attract the player’s attention.</span></p><p>Lift Vine claw. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNoZl1jXDAk?si=yGOy3eNTWZz33aGW" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The upper part of the Lift Vine contains the bulb and the vegetal platform. Sometimes, the bulb hosts the vine inside it (one of the gameplay variations). Visually, when it does, we can see that the bulb is very big and round, inflated. The bulb idle sound remains very organic but emphasizes the fact that it contains something inside. It also plays only when players use their “Na’vi senses” to listen, but we will talk about that later.</span></p><p>Inflated bulb containing the vine inside it. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this case, the player must shoot at the bulb to release the vine. We trigger a bulb burst and vine release sound with organic vibes when it’s destroyed. We wanted the bulb burst to be puffy, grainy, almost smoky, to fit with the big brown seed cloud VFX release. The vine being released needed to sound a bit wet, liquid as we imagined that the inside of the bulb theoretically contained some sort of lifeblood even if we don’t see it. We extrapolated the sound from the visual to give even more life to the plant.</span></p><p>Bulb Explosion.

We made a specific one-shot sound for the plant retracting with the same vegetal and organic vibes.</span></p><p>Plant to interact with.

The idea is to mimic something we’ve all experienced in the real world: the low, fluttering sound of air buffeting on our ears when there is a lot of wind or fast movement. It’s one of the ways in which we try to take advantage of the game’s first person perspective, to make the player feel like they’re really there—more immersed in the world and connected to their character. This sound is in 2D, meaning it moves with the player’s position rather than being placed in the world. Therefore we need to manually switch between a stereo and a 4-channel (quad) version, depending on whether the player is using a surround sound system.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q0eDidAD5GI?si=_Sq-tWZ3DVOB00EO" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p>In ear sound configuration in Wwise. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having the 2D in-ear wind sound emitter attached to the player created a complication. In coop mode, we didn’t want this sound to trigger when the player’s teammate uses the Lift Vine because it wouldn’t make sense for the local player to hear this extreme proximity sound, when a remote player uses the Lift Vine.</span></p><p>Snowdrop node. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do that, we set a condition with a Boolean when the agent using the Lift Vine is the local player or a player from the server. This was just one of many considerations that needed to be made to ensure the coop experience works for both players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As promised earlier, let’s talk about the player character’s “Na’vi Senses”. Basically, the player can go into a “super focused mode” by pressing a button on the controller, and it helps guide them through the game. It highlights important things visually and sonically and enables the player to find relevant information. (In early production, this feature was called Master Hunter Senses, which is why you can see the abbreviation MHS in these screenshots).&nbsp;</span></p><p>Wwise switch container. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Na’vi Senses are active, and the bulb is big and round so the vine is inside it and not available, we trigger an extra layer of organic and clicky looping sounds in the bulb. We also do some dynamic mixing with azimuth and elevation RTPCs so it gets more audible when the player is looking directly at it. All these things are very subtle on their own. But when put together, they can guide the player towards the Lift Vine in the dense and busy open world, without becoming overbearing.</span></p><p>Na’vi Senses activated to guide the player.

So, we needed some “foley” sounds to cover the characters hands interacting with the zooplantae. To make sure the sound matches what the player sees on screen, we not only had to work on the Lift Vine graph object but also in the player animation system to implement these little sounds.</span></p><p>Wwise implementation for player grabbing the vine sound. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p>Audio integration in Snowdrop animation system. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Working on the Lift Vine was very interesting as it’s a highly interactive feature, and it involved working on a lot of different sounds, such as the sound of the Lift Vine itself but also player foley sounds and 2D in-ear wind components. This also meant learning to work with a lot of different graphs and systems in the game engine and creating solutions to make dynamic spatialization and motion for audio emitters, both in Snowdrop and Wwise. It was super cool to bring all the different parts of this feature together and use sound to help shape it into a cohesive experience for the player.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaOkrJBUf9g?si=2T6Uq6p2nYSqzWbu" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Veil Swarm">The Veil Swarm</h2><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Audio direction">Audio direction</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Veilswarm is a flock of small organisms, that the player’s Ikran (their winged mount and companion) can eat to replenish its stamina. They look like butterflies, but much bigger compared to butterflies on earth, so we wanted to have medium size wing flapping sounds. We didn’t want any kind of tonal screech or bird whistling sound as the Veilswarm is everywhere in the open world and hearing the same type of sound over and over would have become fatiguing. Something a bit more discreet was enough. Also, the open world already has a lot of tonal sounds coming from other flying animals, so there was no need to pile up in this field. Of course, we wanted it to sound like a swarm surrounding the player, and it especially needed to be convincing when the player flies through the swarm and they all disperse. So, we did a lot of work on these flapping sounds in terms of variety and texture, but also in terms of implementation, positioning and movement.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Gameplay">Gameplay</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the player is flying on their Ikran and goes through the Veilswarm, the swarm will disperse but the Ikran will catch and eat a few of the animals to gain stamina.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Audio design">Audio design</h2><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YMjuvvhCHas?si=8kfH0GfMliNnSQ1R" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The swarm spreads in all directions when the player flies through it. We play a windy whoosh sound when it spreads to give the player a sensation of speed and dynamism. We trigger it according to the player’s speed and distance from the Veilswarm. In addition to the whoosh sound, when it spreads, we trigger a one-shot agitated flapping sound. Another layer is an audio loop in a blend container with various assets based on distance to the player. It helps them find the Veilswarm while flying with the Ikran in the open world, while keeping the sound of the swarm grounded and convincing at various distances.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the player stays inside the swarm, while flying steadily, the swarm will surround them. In this case, a 2D stereo or quad agitated Veilswarm flapping sound plays (2D meaning not actually positioned in the world, but all around the player, as with the in-ear wind above). We switch between stereo or quad version according to the player’s speaker configuration. This 2D sound gives a good sense of being surrounded by the swarm by filling the entire sound field with a wide, bespoke audio asset.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAF7Qcgmxk8?si=v87MrzrRlc87TAC6" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the player moves inside the swarm, the little butterflies will quickly move to the sides, escaping from the Ikran’s attempt to eat them. We dynamically mix the sound using Wwise’s real time parameter controls (RTPC), based on camera movement, player distance from the object, player speed, and azimuth. We tweak the volume, pitch and spatialization using these RTPCs. The flapping sound dynamically increases in volume or pitch, and stays in sync with the visual when they spread on the sides, because we use the same data inputs as the visual in the graph object.</span></p><p>Wwise mixing RTPCs for the swarm spreading sound while inside it. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For better clarity when in coop, just like with the Lift Vine, we don’t want to hear this 2D sound from the local player perspective if the remote player triggers it.</span></p><p>Wwise switch container for local and remote player. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Veilswarm has 2 audio emitters. The first one plays in the origin of the graph object. The other one dynamically changes position according to the player’s position. It mirrors the player’s position, and its axis is the origin of the Veilswarm object. It helps the sound to be more vivid when the player stays inside the swarm and moves around.</span></p><p>When the player moves to the left, the upper emitter moves to the right. Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p>When the player moves to the right, the upper emitter moves to the left.

Image and caption via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Veilswarm was also a collaborative work. The player’s Ikran triggers an “eating” animation when going through it and it also involves some VFX when the little animals are being chewed by the Ikran (Pandora is a dangerous place…). The player character may react with a line of dialogue when the Ikran feeds, and the UI stamina bar regenerates with a small animation. So not only did the Veilswarm involve the work of a variety of different sound designers and voice designers, it also enabled us to collaborate with all those other departments working on this part of the experience.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sirens of the Deep, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s latest animated The Witcher movie - which is perhaps most notable for the fact it'll see Doug Cockle reprising his video game role as the gravelly voiced Geralt of Rivia - now has a release date, and is streaming from 11th February.
</p>
<p>
Sirens of the Deep is based on The Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski's short story A Little Sacrifice, and begins with Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village. One thing leads to another, however, and everybody's favourite white-haired grump soon finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.
</p>
<p>
"He must count on friends — old and new," Netflix teases in its announcement, "to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war."

<p>
Geralt will be joined by Anya Chalotra and Joey Batey, reprising their live-action TV series roles of Yennefer and Jaskier respectively, and the whole thing is being directed by Kang Hei Chul - who helmed Netflix's previous animated Witcher movie, 2021's surprisingly decent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-best-look-yet-at-the-witchers-animated-prequel">Nightmare of the Wolf</a>. And if that's whet your appetite, there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYzqa1CDTik">new two-minute trailer</a> to view.
</p><p>
As for what's next for Netflix's The Witcher, that'll be season four of the streaming service's divisive live-action adaptation, which sees Liam Hemsworth taking over the role of Geralt of Rivia following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">Henry Cavill's departure</a> in 2022. But if it's more Cockle you want, he'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">be back</a> in CD Projekt's recently unveiled next Witcher game - although not as the protagonist, given <a href="hhttps://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Ciri is officially the focus this time around</a>.

That’s one of the selling points behind <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, a new RPG from some of the masterminds behind <em>The Witcher 3</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Rebel Wolves, formed in 2022 by a bunch of ex-CD Projekt Red developers, revealed the game this week in a new teaser trailer. It looks pretty legit. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196626" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The first game in what the studio hopes will be an entire new RPG saga, <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em> is a narrative-driven, single-player, open-world, dark fantasy action-RPG. It’s being made in Unreal Engine 5 for PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S, and PC. The game is currently in alpha with more updates promised later in the year. That’s another way of saying it probably won’t be out for a while. </p><p>Players will step into the shoes of a young warrior-turned-vampire named Coen who uses otherworldly powers, including teleporting around like Nightcrawler, to fight off enemies and navigate a world where monsters come in all different forms. Like I said,<em> The Witcher </em>with vampire powers. Here’s the cinematic trailer with a quick look at gameplay near the end:</p><p>Rebel Wolves was originally formed by <em>Witcher 3</em> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz after he left CDPR following an investigation into workplace bullying, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/top-director-leaves-embattled-game-developer-cd-projekt&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/top-director-leaves-embattled-game-developer-cd-projekt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he told <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> ultimately found him not guilty of the charges. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-03/former-cd-projekt-developers-take-lessons-from-cyberpunk-debacle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-03/former-cd-projekt-developers-take-lessons-from-cyberpunk-debacle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to the same outlet last year</a></span>, he said he started the new studio out of a desire to go back to working in smaller teams where developers aren’t as pigeonholed into specific roles. He also said he’d be working on his empathy and prioritizing the well-being of the team. </p><p>Alongside its game announcement, Rebel Wolves also announced the hire of <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>’s creative director: Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz. The CDPR veteran was a quest designer on multiple <em>Witcher</em> games, including the card-based spinoffs<em> Gwent</em> and <em>Thronebreaker</em>. He was also in charge of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s quests before later departing after the game released to do narrative consulting for other companies. </p><p>  “Throughout all my years in game development, story-driven role-playing adventures have always been something I was most passionate about,” Tomaszkiewicz said in a press release. “For me, nothing beats being able to fully immerse myself and discover handcrafted stories and worlds. There are so many fantastic RPGs out there today, however, I feel that there’s not only enough space but also a hunger among players for more captivating stories.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4's</a> seventh seasonal update, Season of Witchcraft, arrives on January 21 and will give players a whole new set of fan-favorite powers from an old Diablo class to experiment with.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the new 25 Witchcraft Powers are taken almost directly from abilities used by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3's</a> Witch Doctor. The class hasn't made its way to Diablo 4 officially just yet, but Blizzard isn't being shy about paying homage to the frog-slinging mystic. Powers like Firebat Servants, various Hexes, Poison Frog Servants, Soul Harvest, and Piranhado are all taken from the Witch Doctor's Diablo 3 playbook and will be usable by any class.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4426521" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4426521"></a><figcaption>Everything new that's coming as part of Diablo 4 Season 7.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To earn those Witchcraft Powers and others, players will need to aid a coven underneath the Tree of Whispers by completing new Whisper bounties and hunting down Headrotten enemies that have been stolen from the Tree of Whispers. Like some previous seasons, specific zones on the map will periodically transform into Headhunt zones where numerous Headrotten enemies can be found. After completing bounties in the zone, there is a rare chance for an Uprooted Cocoon to spawn a deadly boss that, once slain, can be returned to the coven underneath the Tree of Whispers for a greater reward. Players can also discover Rootholds within Headrotten zones. These seasonal dungeons need a key to unlock, but will further aid players in increasing their standing with the coven. The Tree of Whispers will additionally have a chance of rewarding players with an Ancestral Collection, which guarantees at least one Ancestral item.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to new powers, players will be able to equip new Occult Gems that will further enhance their Witchcraft Powers. Many gems have effects that enhance specific categories of Witchcraft powers or are activated once a player equips a certain number of powers from a particular category. In addition to their unique effects, each Occult Gem grants 160 Armor and 8% Resist All, which should make them an attractive choice for those looking to take full advantage of their Witchcraft Powers.</p><p dir="ltr">The other big addition in Diablo 4 Season 7 is the Armory, a feature that will actually be a permanent feature going forward. Players will be able to create up to five loadouts per character that can be easily swapped between with the click of a button. Doing so will automatically equip the skills, Paragon Board, Glyphs, and gear saved to the loadout, allowing players to easily change builds without having to constantly reset their skill tree or Paragon Board. It will not cost gold to swap loadouts using the Armory--once a skill tree and Paragon Board have been saved to the Armory, that build can be swapped free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">Other permanent changes coming in Season of Witchcraft include an improved layout to the area around the Tree of Whispers, as well as making it so each specific class quest only needs to be completed once per class. Players who afterward make a new character of the same class will be able to access their unique class power earlier without having to do the requisite quest. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-out-free-diablo-4-boosts-and-automatically-unlocking-those-annoying-lilith-altars/1100-6527717/" data-ref-id="1100-6527717">welcome back level boost</a> will be sticking around permanently, and Unique items with Greater Affixes will also be improved, with Unique powers having their minimum rolls increased when the item sports a Greater Affix. There is additionally a new Unique item for each class, and for Vessel of Hatred owners, three new runes to experiment with.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard will share more details about Diablo 4 Season 7 during a developer livestream on January 16. Diablo 4 Season 6 revolved around the game's Vessel of Hatred expansion, which introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-how-to-unlock-and-equip-runewords/1100-6527208/" data-ref-id="1100-6527208">Runewords</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-all-mercenaries-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6527178/" data-ref-id="1100-6527178">Mercenaries</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-a-huge-first-of-its-kind-dungeon-filled-with-exclusive-rewards/1100-6526026/" data-ref-id="1100-6526026">co-op-only dungeon</a>.</p>

			<p>The Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Kickstarter campaign is launching today to further expand the action role-playing game in development by The Farm 51 with new features, including a highly requested one.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, The Farm 51 listened to and analyzed fan feedback regarding the game, noticing how the switch from the first-person combat view of the first entry in the series to the new third-person perspective of the sequel was the most critical issue. As such, the studio decided to fix the issue by introducing a switchable third-person and first-person combat perspective, but to do so, it is asking fans for support. More information on the fundraising campaign can be found on the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thefarm51/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-an-open-world-sci-fi-rpg/">Kickstarter page.</a></p>
<p>To celebrate the beginning of the Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Kickstarter campaign, The Farm 51 also released a new gameplay trailer showcasing some of the game's most prominent features. You can check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="KICKSTARTER LAUNCH TRAILER - Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5lRDzR54eo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone is aiming for a late 2025 release date. You can learn more about how the second entry in the series will expand the formula of its predecessor by checking out our interview with the game's Development Director conducted during<a href="https://wccftech.com/chernobylite-2-qa-20-times-bigger-world-2-3x-longer-playtime/"> Gamescom 2024.</a></p>

            <p>A quick one: Firaxis have confirmed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> will be Steam Deck verified at launch. It's a pleasant surprise, given that 2016's Civ 6 is still only listed as "playable" on Valve's oversized Switch. I like this news about as much as I'm terrified to realise that Civ 7 is just under a month away. I do not need that much strategy game, this early in the year. But hey, at least I'll be able to play the new 4X in bed as Sid Meier intended.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Admittedly, I don't currently own a Steam Deck - James, ever the fickle lord of hardware, took back the one I was borrowing last year. I'll get that guy. But I've been playing a lot of 4Xs in bed, as it happens. I've just discovered that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a>'s brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> runs comfortably on my Dell work laptop. Current activities: trying to find a new location for my roving beetle city that has both a strategic resource and a luxury resource within easy building distance.</p>
<p>There are no giant beetles in Civ 7, but the two games do share a campaign structure in the shape of age-based progression. Every time your civilisation enters a new age, you get to pick from a pool of epoch-making options determined by your prior accomplishments. When playing multiplayer, you have the option of confining the proceedings to a single age. It sounds like quite a significant refresh of the whole caveman-to-spaceman concept. Also significant: in a first for Civ, you can choose your leader separately from your civilisation.</p>
<p>Civ 7 is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games of 2025</a>. "It looks very pretty, and it has some very intriguing ideas (navigable rivers and commander units), and also Gwendoline Christie," summarised Ollie. It's out 11th February and you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Riot Games has committed to changing VALORANT’s map pool every single act, but the next map swap set for Patch 10.04 is not being well received. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-2025-new-agents-more-map-variety-ranked-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second act of the 2025 season</a> will see the removal of Abyss and Bind, and the return of Ascent and Icebox.</p>



<p>While many players won’t miss Abyss, there is a widespread feeling of disappointment that both Ascent and Icebox are returning. That is, unless they return with some changes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-patch-10-04-map-changes">VALORANT Patch 10.04 Map Changes</h2>



<p>As part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT’s new yearly season model</a>, the team at Riot has pledged to making map pool changes each act. There are currently 11 standard maps, with seven making up the active pool. Riot said at the beginning of the year that the initial plan is to swap two each act, but noted that number “might change” throughout the year.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>When the second act of 2025 begins on March 4, Patch 10.04 will replace Abyss and Bind with Icebox and Ascent. This change has not sat well with the community though, especially on the pro side. Prior to this current act, Ascent was the only map that had never been rotated out, and now it’s being reinstated after just a few weeks. Icebox has also been one of the more disliked maps across the community, but <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1879198967541764168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most of the replies</a> to the official announcement are upset about Ascent’s fast return.</p>



<p>Fans and members of the VALORANT pro scene are also not pleased about the impending changes. Sentinels’ coach Adam Kaplan <a href="https://x.com/itskaplan/status/1879214468674277613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is frustrated</a> with announcing the map changes ahead of time, claiming teams that don’t make the first Masters event of the year will have twice as much time to prepare for the new maps. Kaplan also says this will lead to an increase in burnout, as teams that attend Masters will have no time to rest if they don’t want to get out-prepped for Ascent and Icebox.</p>



<p>Is it too soon to bring Ascent back? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-godzilla-event-release-date-godzilla-skin-king-kong-crossover-what-to-expect/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fortnite’s long-awaited Godzilla event is nearly here. With a King Kong appearance and special skins, the event is hotly anticipated. Its release date is known, so here’s a rundown.</p>



<p>I’m having deja vu from Warzone Caldera’s epic Godzilla and King Kong event. But Epic is having a crack with Fortnite’s Godzilla event featuring the two titanic creatures. Godzilla and King Kong are arguably at the top of the food chain when it comes to monster movies, and their presence is sure to be felt in Fortnite. Does anyone fancy a trip to Skull Island while King Kong is away?</p>



<p>If not, I’ll instead break down this King Kong-sized collaboration.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fortnite-godzilla-live-event-release-date">When is the Fortnite Godzilla Live Event Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A Godzilla-sized event approaches. Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Godzilla x Kong event is expected to launch on January 17.</strong></p>



<p>January 14 featured downtime for the shooter as Epic prepares for the upcoming heavyweight battle. Maintenance provided enough time to complete the transition to version 33.20. But it’s also the first hurdle (a big one) as we prepare for the arrival of Godzilla and King Kong.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we learn its exact start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-godzilla-evolved-and-mecha-godzilla-skins-in-fortnite">How to Get Godzilla Evolved and Mecha Godzilla Skins in Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What are you looking at? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Godzilla Evolved Skin and Mecha Godzilla Skins are available to obtain from the Chapter 6, Season 1 Battle Pass</strong> <strong>on January 17.</strong></p>



<p>It’s no surprise to learn both Godzilla skins go live along with the event start date. Here’s a quick guide in case you’re unaware of the Godzilla skins:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open up Fortnite.</li>



<li>Purchase the Chapter 6, Season 1 Battle Pass.</li>



<li>Wait for the Locked Pages to become available on January 17.</li>



<li>Complete the objectives to earn the special, limited-time skins.</li>
</ol>



<p>Many Fortnite skins are locked away for a long time after their initial appearance. I would recommend you <strong>act quickly</strong> if you want the Godzilla Evolved and Mecha Godzilla Skins. </p>



<p>They’re likely to be available for purchase later down the line, but it’s not worth risking the wrath of the mega-tall monsters.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-the-fortnite-godzilla-event">What to Expect From the Fortnite Godzilla Event</h2>



<p><strong>It’s unconfirmed, but full-scale interactions with both Godzilla and King Kong are expected in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-godzilla-transformation-mythic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Godzilla Transformation Mythic</a> has leaked (thanks to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hypex</a>). It’s thought you can <strong>turn into Godzilla</strong> and use its “Beam, Stomp, and Roar” abilities. Plus, a “throw banana” ability has been outed by the leaker too—meaning <strong>control of King Kong</strong> is also swinging its way into Fortnite!</p>



<p>The consensus is a <strong>fight is brewing between King Kong and Godzilla</strong>—à la the movies. We’re not sure if it plays out via a cutscene, or if we have the incredible honor of getting caught in the fire, fists, and swinging tails. All I am certain of is it’s going to be Epic (pun intended).</p>



<hr>



<p>Where does the Fortnite Godzilla Event rank in terms of all-time hype? Is it one of Epic’s better efforts? What’s a crossover the company desperately needs to do that Fortnite hasn’t done yet?</p>



<p>Speaking of which, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-cyberpunk-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite and Cyberpunk 2077 crossover</a> is coming, so make sure to read up on the collab. Plus, check out the addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hatsune-miku-fortnite-skin-leaks-online-before-fortnite-festival-season-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hatsune Miku Fortnite Skin</a>.</p>
