            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> developers Digital Extremes have announced a new round of early access for their 2025-bound fantasy action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a>, which I saw a bit of last year and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframes-full-reveal-shows-a-slow-and-pensive-fantasy-rpg-built-on-the-bones-of-warframe">think is pretty promising</a>. They're now adding 2000 players to a Preludes build of the game every week, with each invite email including an additional four invite codes, so you can get your friends involved.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you're new to Soulframe, it's a stately swords-and-sorcery affair with a hazy golden open world and procedural dungeons. It has the same visual opulence as Warframe, with richly woven costumes and an interface of painted scrolls and sigils, and the same appetite for screwy jargon-tastic lore writing. But it plays things quieter. Everything looks old and dusty and the pacing of exploration and encounters seems closer to From Software's work - you'll weigh up every blow. Last year, director Steve Sinclair summarised it as follows: "Where Warframe is fast and frenetic, Soulframe is going to be slow and pensive."</p>
<p>A bit of plot: you're a downfallen amnesiac soldier who must form pacts with the spirits of their ancestors. These pacts are the game's loadouts, encompassing character stats and sets of abilities. You also get access to the Nightfold, an extra-dimensional progression hub akin to Bloodborne's Hunter's Dream. You can expand the Nightfold's crafting and customisation facilities by asking your ancestors to move in.</p>
<p>Soulframe is another free-to-play offering from Digital Extremes, and the big worry as ever is how much the monetisation will sabotage the experience. That aside, I'm looking forward to it. Some smaller flourishes: when you die, you reincarnate as a bird at the last respawn site and have the option of flying back to resurrect your body. When you move between dimensions, your character falls backward through a portal with arms outspread, as though tumbling into bed at the end of a long day.</p><p>You can sign up for Preludes access <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/signup">here</a>. If you don't manage to scrape an invite, Digital Extremes have also lifted restrictions on streams and videos of the Preludes area, so by all means fire up the Youtubes and have a gander. I'm sure somebody's published a 10 hour Let's Play already.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But I’ve been playing around with Sony’s most expensive console ever for the past week, and the biggest issue I have with it, besides the high price, is that its really hard to actually figure out what games run and look better on it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112">PlayStation 5 Pro</a></span> is not a console you probably need to buy. However, if you have a really good 4K TV and you care about framerates and ray tracing, then it’s an impressive machine that provides truly fantastic looking upgrades to games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-cloud-cross-save-ps5-pro-mass-effect-1851691865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-cloud-cross-save-ps5-pro-mass-effect-1851691865"><em>Spider-Man 2 </em>and <em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></span><em>.</em> But unless you look up a list online, its hard to actually find which games in your library or on the store are PS5 Pro enhanced. </p><p>When I booted up the PS5 Pro, the first thing I did was hop into my library to see which of the games that I already owned supported Sony’s new powerful console. This isn’t easy. There is currently no symbol or text on a game’s tile or cover to indicate if its PS5 Pro enhanced. Even when I click on game and it opens up a sub menu, there is still no indication if it’s going to take advantage of the new features.</p><p>Currently, the only way to figure this out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-specs-list-enhanced-upgraded-games-elden-ring-1851688507?_gl=1*18f4ggf*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTA4NjIyNC4yMi4xLjE3MzEwODcwMDYuNDcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-specs-list-enhanced-upgraded-games-elden-ring-1851688507?_gl=1*18f4ggf*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTA4NjIyNC4yMi4xLjE3MzEwODcwMDYuNDcuMC4w">besides checking our list  or Sony’s website</a></span>, is to look at the PSN Store. You can either do this directly in the store or via a “Show Product” option in your game library. There you’ll see a PS5 Pro Enhanced badge, letting you know that yes, this game will look and run better on your new expensive machine.</p><h2 id="h275276"><a id=""></a>Sony, steal this idea from the Xbox Series X</h2><p>At first, when I got the PS5 Pro last week, I assumed that Sony would have a plan to make it easier to find Pro Enhanced games while using the console and its store. So I waited until after the PS5 Pro launched on November 7 and... nothing. I still can’t quickly tell at a glance what is or isn’t enhanced.</p><p>Sony has added a PS5 Pro enhanced section to the store, but as far as I can tell it doesn’t show every game that is actually enhanced. And for a day or so it showed <em>Dead Rising 2</em>, which is a PS4 game that isn’t at all enhanced. (It’s been removed since and replaced with<em> Dead Rising Deluxe Remaste</em>r, which <em>is</em> enhanced.) </p><p>Thankfully, there is now a PS5 Pro enhanced filter you can apply to the store, which is helpful. However, this filter can’t be applied to your own library of games, which seems silly! </p><p>As someone who plays a lot of Xbox Series X, I really appreciate that Microsoft uses icons to quickly indicate what games are native Series X/S titles and which ones aren’t. I hope Sony looks into adding some indicator or icon for games that run better on PS5 Pro, so its easier for folks to actually take advantage of the most powerful PlayStation console ever made. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In a new interview, Nintendo executives stated that they are skeptical of big budgets and want to rely instead on "new ideas." Nintendo itself conducted the interview as part of its earnings briefing for this fiscal year, which ends March 2025 (you can find the full English translation <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>).</p><p>During the interview, various Nintendo executives--including Mario-creator Shigeru Miyamoto--were asked about the company's recent efforts, such as the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">Nintendo Music</a> and the announcement of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-play-switch-1-games-nintendo-confirms/1100-6527598/" data-ref-id="1100-6527598">Switch 2's backward compatibility</a>.</p><p>When asked about rising development costs throughout the video game industry, Miyamoto replied that the company wishes to cultivate good ideas and refine games until the developers are confident in what they've made. While this does have costs, not all games need to be expensive. Miyamoto said, "it is possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs."</p><p>Senior executive officer and corporate director Ko Shiota emphasized an efficient development environment. Because developers are already familiar with the Nintendo Switch, the company wishes to "maintain a similar basis for development environments," according to Shiota. In conclusion, Shiota added, "I believe the most important thing for Nintendo is how we create new ideas. Bigger budgets do not necessarily equate to better ideas."</p><p>In the same interview, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-i-am-no-genius/1100-6527661/" data-ref-id="1100-6527661">Miyamoto said that he is not a genius</a>. Nintendo also emphasized that it would generally prefer to "organically expand" rather than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-acquisitions-arent-always-best/1100-6527609/" data-ref-id="1100-6527609">acquire new companies</a>. News about the Nintendo Switch successor has been scarce, but leaks suggest an official announcement is set for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">sometime in the next five months</a>.

Products from Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, and Microsoft are part of the event, with models seeing discounts up to $750. Whether you’re shopping for an affordable rig to stream content or a premium gaming laptop, there’s bound to be something that catches your eye.</p><p>One of notable deal is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hp-victus-gaming-laptop-is-only-430-at-best-buy-in-early-black-friday-doorbuster-sale/1100-6527616/" data-ref-id="1100-6527616">15.6-inch HP Victus gaming laptop</a>, which part of Best Buy's first round of limited-time Door Buster deals.

The 15.6-inch OLED display should also look great whether you’re gaming, streaming movies, or knocking out some work. The RTX 3050 is a bit underpowered for heavy gaming, though everything else about the laptop makes it an absolute steal at $800 (was $1,300). </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4397062-mixcollage-08-nov-2024-08-54-am-7617.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4397062" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4397062-mixcollage-08-nov-2024-08-54-am-7617.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4397062"></a><figcaption>Microsoft Surface, Dell Inspiron, and Lenovo Yoga 7i</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4397062-mixcollage-08-nov-2024-08-54-am-7617.jpg"></figure><p>The <a href="https://howl.link/gusx7s7yludsh?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17310815651478?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HP OmniBook X</a> is also down to $800 (was $1,200).

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-joins-the-ranks-of-companies-making-their-products-worse.1031181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nvidia-geforce-now-hours-cap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia, the company that makes <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-bought-the-wrong-graphics-card-and-i-am-full-of-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graphics cards</a> you can't afford anymore and keeps vying for status as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/05/nvidia-passes-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company-.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the world's most valuable company</a>, is taking a page from <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox's book</a> and announcing a confusing change to its GeForce Now cloud gaming service that includes a monthly cap on the hours you can play games. As many people are saying in the comments to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, maybe it's time to build a PC.</p><p>I will be honest that after writing the lede above I had to look up exactly what GeForce Now <em>is</em>, and reaffirm that it is not one of the many Nvidia things my graphics card installed on my computer. Like Stadia (<a href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-bungie-destiny-2-cyberpunk-2077-red-dead-1849601243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RIP</a>) and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft's xCloud</a>, GeForce Now can let you stream games your hardware might not be able to support. It has a bunch of tiers, some of which now have new names and new limits.</p><p>Buried in an announcement that leads with new games being added to the service and the ability to stream in 1440p is this tidbit:</p><blockquote><p>At the start of next year, GeForce NOW will roll out a 100-hour monthly playtime allowance to continue providing exceptional quality and speed — as well as shorter queue times — for Performance and Ultimate members. This ample limit comfortably accommodates 94% of members, who typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe...</p><p>Up to 15 hours of unused playtime will automatically roll over to the next month for members, and additional hours can be purchased at $2.99 for 15 additional hours of Performance, or $5.99 for 15 additional Ultimate hours.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Current paying members won't have the cap imposed on them until 2026, and Founder members won't be subject to the cap. Members can only roll over a limited amount of unused hours, with Nvidia writing that "The most one can have at the beginning of a month is 115 hours<em>.</em>" Nvidia has also renamed its "Priority" membership to "Performance," just to make things more confusing.</p><p>The idea that this 100-hour-a-month limit works for most players may well be true, and GeForce Now already has some time limits on how long your play session can be, but the idea of this is wild to me. Many commenters on Nvidia's Reddit post call this what it is--<a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/my-mcluhan-lecture-on-enshittification-ea343342b9bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enshittification</a>--and worry it's a herald of worse things to come. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289443/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-playtime-caps-performance-membership-1440p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>, this has been done in lieu of raising fees, which you could see as a bit refreshing when compared to services like Disney+ and Amazon Prime that added ads, removed password sharing, <em>and</em> raised prices. </p><p>But it's still chilling. The idea that this service, which you pay to access, can now just restrict your access, all while trying to sell you on how this is fine and actually the service is <em>better</em> now, is shining up how <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stupid</a> Nvidia thinks you are through corporate speak. To burn users this way on the heels of announcing a market valuation of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-surpasses-36-trillion-market-value-after-trump-win-2024-11-07/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3.6 trillion</a> feels especially egregious. Nvidia is all-in on AI these days; this change, like crypto mining before it, feels like further proof that the company is moving away from regular users who just want to play games on their damn computers to serve the worst people in the world and chase the latest planet-torching trend. </p><p>With the possibility of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/trumps-proposed-tariffs-will-hit-gamers-hard-2000521796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware prices spiking massively</a> if Trump has his way with tariffs, cloud gaming could be a viable alternative, which makes this unlikable announcement all the more badly-timed. Well, for regular people. For Nvidia, the company gets to provide less and stands to make more, considering users having to pay for extra time. I'm so mad about this and, like I said above, I barely even know what GeForce Now is! If you actually use this service, let me know how you feel about it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Promo A is likely the first of many promotional sets in Pokémon TCG Pocket. I get you want to focus your efforts on collecting the main cards, but certain promo cards might not be around forever. The cards’ obtainability might get harder over time, meaning you should set your sights on unlocking Promo A Cards faster than a Rapidash.</p>



<p>You might find yourself overwhelmed by Pokémon TCG Pocket’s early release content. The card-collecting title is not content to rest on its laurels though—oh no. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-tcg-pocket-secret-missions-rewards-how-to-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Missions</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-tcg-pocket-level-up-rewards-xp-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level-up rewards</a> easily eat into your time, and even more is sure to be spent trying to collect all the Promo A Cards.</p>



<p>We’ve got information on every Pokémon TCG Pocket Promo A Card, how to get them, and much more.</p>







<figure><figcaption>There’s quite a few to catch. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s thought <strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket has 24 Promo A Cards to collect</strong>.</p>



<p>There’s a hint of trepidation about this figure because not every card has been released yet—the available information regarding Promo A is based on released cards, and datamined cards. With suggestions the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Pokémon Pocket expansion</a> is a while away yet, more Promo A Cards could be added later on.</p>

Thanks to <a href="https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/promo-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Serebii</a> for clarification on a couple of the remaining cards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-call-for-change-to-going-first-mechanic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"One advantage, however, is that you can concede faster."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> adapts the beloved card game into a speedier experience more fit for mobile, but players can't get their heads around one rule change regarding going first and are calling on developer Creatures Inc. to change it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At its simplest, the Pokémon TCG works by players attaching energy to their Pokémon to do attacks, with more energy resulting in bigger damage dealt. Pokémon are eventually knocked out and, once a certain number are defeated, someone wins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card games commonly apply nerfs to the player who goes first so they don't gain an unfair advantage over what's essentially a coin toss, and the Pokémon TCG is no different. The player going first draws a card and can attach a single energy to a Pokémon, as normal, though isn't allowed to attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This balances things out a touch as, while player two is the first to attack and therefore do damage, player one can swing back the following turn with two energy and a bigger attack. But Pokémon TCG changes this mechanic by only allowing a card draw on the first turn, making the entire thing, some players believe, completely redundant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As we seem to all acknowledge going first in this game feels awful, and don't get me started about the one energy evolutions which benefit off going first," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gm5u0x/going_1st_sucks/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user Seedler420 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Can't we trade the possibility of attacking turn one, which in terms of gameplay doesn't make any sense, with the possibility of attaching energy turn one? This way the player going first would have energy advantage while the player going second would have the first attack."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The way Pokémon TCG Pocket works essentially gives the advantage to the player going second, as they have both the energy advantage and the first damage advantage. "It would feel a little better if we at least got to put energy on a card first turn," said one player in the comments. "It definitely feels bad," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. did ask for feedback when it announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-passes-30-million-downloads-in-9-days">more than 30 million players had downloaded the game in just nine days</a>, so perhaps if enough people complain a change will come about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 as a streamlined and has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that immediately proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. is keeping busy since launch as it has already added three events to the game: one focused on collecting, one focused on solo battles, and one focused on player versus player battles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first offers players a free Wonder Pick with the chance of pulling either a Meowth or Chansey alongside event tickets and Wonder Hourglasses, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-adds-new-rewards-and-missions-to-wonder-pick-event">its second part also released today</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, the solo battle event <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">let players take on a handful of water themed decks</a> for the chance of winning new promo cards including Lapras ex. And a PVP event was later added too, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">putting badges on the line in true Pokémon fashion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you'd expect, players are looking to take the best decks into these events, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo and Charizard are naturally dominating so far</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-it-should-have-done-user-testing-and-internal-evaluation-earlier-on-concord<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has reflected on the disastrous launch of PlayStation 5 game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, saying it’s still learning when it comes to live service games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord, a live service hero shooter from Sony-owned Firewalk Studios, has gone down as one of the biggest flops in PlayStation history. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony hauled Concord offline just two weeks after launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown"><u>It eventually shuttered Firewalk and confirmed Concord wouldn’t return</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has proved a costly failure for Sony. Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million according to a report by <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>, which cited two sources familiar with the agreement. They said the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself. Kotaku's number aligns with an <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/sony-acquires-video-game-studio/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>earlier report</u></a> saying that ProbablyMonsters — Firewalk's original parent company — raised $200 million in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all points to Concord being seen as an ambitious project that was expected to attract a large audience. Instead it launched to tepid reviews and low interest, prompting PlayStation to pull the plug within days of release. One estimate suggested it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>only sold around 25,000 copies</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Midia Research analyst Rhys Elliott told IGN shortly before Concord was shut down: “Pivoting to live services is high-risk, high-reward venture, and the risk is heightening to levels that might not be worth it for many AAA console/PC publishers that aren’t already active in the space."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial call, Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the company has learned lessons from both the record-breaking launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> earlier this year and Concord’s failure. On Concord specifically, Totoki said Sony should have run its development gates such as user testing or internal evaluation “much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently we are still in the process of learning,” Totoki said. “Basically, with regards to new IP, of course you don’t know the result until you actually try it. So for our reflection, probably we need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates, we need to bring them forward. We should have done those gates much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here from Totoki is that Sony should have noticed and reacted to Concord’s issues earlier in the development process, presumably so that it could have improved the game before launch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/gettyimages-2153633660-1731080199508.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki. Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Totoki then went on to point fingers at Sony’s “siloed organization” and Concord’s release window, which may have caused cannibalisation. Concord launched in August, not long after smash hit Black Myth: Wukong hit PS5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother,” Totoki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximize our performance in terms of title launches. That’s all I have.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Concord launched into the ultra competitive live service hero shooter market following the failure of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which contributed to a $200 million hit to publisher Warner Bros.’ revenue.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Sony senior vice president for finance and IR Sadahiko Hayakawa compared the launches of Helldivers 2 and Concord, saying lessons learned would be shared throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We launched two live-service games this year,” he said. “Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games — which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP — with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s live service push has seen mixed results so far. Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, but other live service games have fallen by the wayside. In December last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">Naughty Dog canceled a live service The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> and announced plans to focus on single-player games. Sony-owned developer Bungie, meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">has suffered significant layoffs as a result of Destiny 2’s struggles</a>. The failure of Concord and the closure of Firewalk is yet another troubling development for PlayStation live service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, a number of PlayStation live service games remain in the works, including Bungie’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, Guerrilla’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">Horizon Online</a>, and Haven Studio’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgame$</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a> debuted earlier this year, its similarities to Pokemon led observers to expect a legal response from Nintendo. That finally happened in September, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">Nintendo filed a lawsuit</a> against Palworld developer Pocketpair in Japanese court alleging infringement on the company's patents. Now, Pocketpair has shared details about which patents Nintendo's claims are based on, and how much money the company wants out of the case.</p><p>Pocketpair posted <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a summery of the information</a>, which reveals that the three Japanese patents in question are <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7545191</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7493117</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7528390</a>. All three patents were registered earlier this year. Instead of going after Palworld for its Pokemon-like creatures, the patents appear to be centered around the mechanics of throwing a ball at characters, riding characters in the game, and shooting at targets.</p><p>The lawsuit is asking for an injunction against Palworld, plus 5 million yen (which is roughly just under $33,000 in American dollars) payments--with late fees--to both Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. The details of the lawsuit largely lineup with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-vs-palworld-why-nintendo-will-probably-win-according-to-analyst/1100-6526608/" data-ref-id="1100-6526608">the predictions made earlier this year</a> by Kantan Games CEO and video game analyst Serkan Toto. At the time, Toto believed that Nintendo's allegedly infringed-upon patents would be "very technical" in nature, and that Pocketpair will ultimately be forced to make a deal with Nintendo.</p><p>So far, Poketpair hasn't slowed down its ambitions for Palworld. The game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-launching-on-ps5-today-despite-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6526675/" data-ref-id="1100-6526675">recently ported to PlayStation 5</a>, and it has even been released in Japan despite the ongoing lawsuit. Poketpair has also struck a deal with Sony to form <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828">Palworld Entertainment</a>, which will expand the franchise and create new merchandise and licensing opportunities.</p>

                <p>Sony just revealed new sales numbers for PS5, and set expectations on what kinds of games will be coming in the future for the console.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q2_sonypre.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">financial report from Sony</a>, the company said it shipped 3.8 million PS5 consoles during the second quarter of the fiscal year from July 2024 to September 2024. That was 29% drop from the same time period last year. The new lifetime total units shipped is now 65.5 million, making the amount just shy of the 67.5 million PS4 units shipped when it was in the same period of its lifespan.</p><p>On the bright side, Game &amp; Network Services division brought in about $7 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase. Sony attributed this to third-party games on the PS5 platform, including "an action RPG title from China," which is most likely referring to Black Myth: Wukong.

Nintendo is keen to keep the Switch's dual focus of being both a gaming handheld and home console "to carry over the experience we have already built" and reduce development costs in future, it's said.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors, Nintendo exec Ko Shiota <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf">said</a> the company's current Switch hardware had benefited from the "merging" of software teams previously focused on developing for separate portable and home console platforms - such as in the era of 3DS and Wii U.
</p>
<p>
While still unannounced by Nintendo, it's widely expected that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treat-yourself-with-eight-inches-of-lcd-on-switch-2-report-says">Switch 2 will also be another hybrid console</a> similar to the company's current Switch hardware.

<p>
Discussing Nintendo's development process in more detail, design legend <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> said that the Mario maker must focus on developing polished, original creative ideas that have "never existed before", as its research and development costs increased each year.
</p>
<p>
Rising costs were "in some respects inevitable" as games became more complex and development teams grew in scale, Miyamoto said, but Nintendo was still focused on ensuring original ideas could germinate, with time to properly "nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart".
</p>
<blockquote>"We continue refining our products until we are confident."</blockquote>
<p>
"Our belief is that what we create is more important than the amount spent on development," Miyamoto explained. "We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo must spend time finding the ideas that are worth honing, Miyamoto continued, saying this was a concept that had "not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System", 40 years ago. 
</p>
<p>
"Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing," Miyamoto continued. "However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. 
</p>
<p>
"The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings. We believe that it is important to nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart, allocate funds to development if necessary, and release games only after we are confident in the product – and repeat this process over and over again."
</p>
<p>
Not all gaming ideas needed big budgets, Miyamoto concluded, noting that simple yet intriguing ideas could still become projects with wide appeal "without incurring significant costs". 
</p>
<p>
"With the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time," Miyamoto concluded. "We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's continued silence on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> was broken - briefly - this week with confirmation that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch successor would indeed be backwards compatible</a>. When might we hear more about Switch 2? This week, Eurogamer was told by an analyst that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">"the ship had sailed" on a 2024 reveal for Switch 2</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> has been out for a little while already, what with me giving its multiplayer largely a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review">thumbs up</a>. Still, it's an ever-evolving thing and Activision have announced the game's first seasonal drop. It's a hefty one with a lot of additions, so I'll try my best to break down the good stuff. TLDR: there's some new maps for multiplayer and zombies, new modes, and a few extra bits. I'm mildly excited for more. More in this case is good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> Season One kicks off on November 14th and it'll bring with the usual assortment of things. Some guns, many of which will likely be meta almost immediately. One is a power drill melee weapon that I immediately want but can't be arsed to unlock. There are new Operators, too, one of which looks like the Haze guy from that PS3 game.</p>
<p>Really, though, the highlights here are the new maps. Hideout being a training site home to some "intense indoor combat", which looks fine? Heirloom looks the most interesting, being a private art gallery filled with lots of nice sculptures and shiny lobbies to sling lead in. Hacienda arrives mid-season, the vineyard estate returning from Black Ops 4 and sure to please fans of a game I genuinely can't recall.</p>

<p>A new game mode called Ransack arrives at launch, where you've got to loot gold bars from crates dotted around maps, then bring them successfully back to your team's stash. It's all about collecting and raiding and pilfering - sounds fun, to be honest.</p><p>One new scorestreak has caught my eye, with it being a big Hand Cannon. Hit 900 points in a single life and you'll "equip a massively powerful hand cannon for a finite amount of time". It'll have "high-penetration shots that can one-shot enemies", a bit like the Golden Gun from the Hunter class in Destiny 2, eh.</p>
<p>In zombies there will be a new Directed mode, that I'll 100% use. Turn this on and it'll mean that zombies objectives will be clearly marked with a maximum round cap of 15, turning it into an easy to follow story experience. I'm also looking forward to the new map, which is an "abandoned castle", with promises of a "medieval village".</p>
<p>Elsewhere there's a new ranked mode for people who take their Duty very seriously and the introduction of omni-movement and Blops 6's guns to Warzone.</p>

However, the new dev hasn’t quite landed on the same success as the original titles from Don’t Nod, unfortunately.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,196358,196663" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As of this writing,<em> Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> sits at a ‘Mixed’ rating on Steam. Most of the game’s negative reviews mention the lack of Chloe as the primary reason they didn’t enjoy this experience. Of course, most of the positive reviews also mention Chloe. </p><p>On the topic of the negative reviews, we would be remiss not to mention the advanced access edition of the game, which asked players to spend more money to play <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>—a story-driven single-player game—a few days ahead of the full release. Developers use this tactic to coax a nice chunk of change out of the community’s pockets, and many pay. </p><p>But let’s talk about the positives, because<em> Life is Strange </em>remains an exceptionally complex and captivating story worthy of attention and, for the most part, praise. Regarding the many positive reviews on Steam, players note the story, facial expressions, graphics, and, of course, the characters themselves, like Max and Amanda. They remain fan favorites.</p><p>Whether you’re new to the franchise or a returning player looking for closure from this long-running tale, <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> provides a unique experience that captivates most players from the get-go. Here’s a look at the latest <em>Life is Strange</em> game, as told by Steam reviews!</p><figure id="" data-id="b44284ed06f5354d5bb47f91b79480dc"

Firstly, he suggested PlayStation needs to be checking in earlier on during  the development process to determine if things are on track or not. Secondly, the company has been too siloed when approaching new projects, needing more communication between teams. Thirdly, the release timing for <em>Concord</em> might have been especially bad. And finally, live-service multiplayer games are just risky even if everything is done right. </p><p>Here are Totoki’s full comments during today’s second quarter earnings call via Sony’s translator:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Currently, we are still in the process of learning and basically with regards to IP you don’t know the result until you actually try it. So for us for our reflection probably we need to have a lot of gates including user testing and user evaluation and the timing of such gates we need to bring them forward and we should have done those gates much earlier than we did. </p><p>And also we did have a siloed organization so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in both development and sales and I think that could have been much more smoother. </p><p>Going forward in our first-party titles and third-party title we do have many different windows and we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalization so we can maximize performance in terms of title launches.</p></blockquote><p><em>Concord</em> launched back in August, and struggled to gain any traction with players—a death sentence for a live service game that relies in part on a healthy player pool to reduce matchmaking times, and make players confident that the game they’re investing in won’t soon disappear. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened with the hero shooter after Sony took the unprecedented step of unreleasing it just a couple weeks later. The game, with an initial development deal <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290"><em>Kotaku</em> previously reported</a></span> at $200 million, has since been fully refunded and the team behind it, Firewalk Studios, disbanded in a mass layoff last month. </p><p>“The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title,” PlayStation co-CEO Hermen Hulst said at the time. “We will take the lessons learned from <em>Concord</em> and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.” The 170 developers cut as part of Firewalk brings Sony’s total gaming layoffs for the year up to 1,290. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the most famous and groundbreaking creative types across all of entertainment, but the man himself doesn't agree that he's a genius. As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings briefing</a>, Miyamoto pushed back against the suggestion that he's been able for decades to turn out hit after hit because he's a "genius."</p><p>"You referred to me as a 'genius,' but I consider myself quite ordinary," he said.</p><p>Miyamoto went on to say he gives a speech each year to Nintendo's new hires, and the feedback he gets from these people is that he is "surprisingly ordinary."</p><p>Making great games allows Miyamoto to have an easier career, he said. "I often think it would be fun if I didn't have to work, so I'm always thinking about things like, well, if I have to work, how can I do it more efficiently. And if I am going to do the same work, how can I make it more of a hit, because when a project is a hit it makes future work easier," he said.</p><p>Miyamoto went on to reveal more of what he tells new hires coming to Nintendo. He said many people come to work at Nintendo and aspire to make "upgraded versions" of games they've played before. But Miyamoto pushes back against this idea and encourages them to think differently.</p><p>"[Game design] is about observing the world around us and figuring out how to assemble those elements into an engaging video game," he said. "I explain that game design is about planning. That is, it is about assessing what hardware and development environment to use to create the game, whether the desired game can be realized with its available processing power, and engaging in trial and error to bring it to life."</p><p>Miyamoto has had a long and illustrious career at Nintendo. The 71-year-old started at Nintendo all the way back in 1977 and helped create Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., and The Legend of Zelda. He's remained a key player at Nintendo to this day in his "Creative Fellow" position, contributing to all manner of Nintendo game franchises. In addition to his work on Nintendo's game franchises, he was an executive producer on 2023's The Super Mario Bros. Movie and will produce the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-planned-to-come-out-this-decade/1100-6527603/" data-ref-id="1100-6527603">live-action Legend of Zelda film.</a> He's also involved in the Nintendo theme parks.</p><p>Miyamoto has no plans to retire, but has admitted he has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-has-no-plans-to-retire-but-is-thinking-about-it-in-case-something-does-happen/1100-6520073/" data-ref-id="1100-6520073">spent time thinking about who may fill his shoes</a> one day.</p><p>As for Nintendo's hardware business, the Switch is now in its eighth year on the market. It's sold more than 146 million units worldwide, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-announcement-is-still-five-months-away-at-most/1100-6527576/" data-ref-id="1100-6527576">all eyes are on Nintendo to reveal the Switch 2 by April 2025. </a></p>

            <p>
Almost two years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>'s PlayStation launch, Sony Santa Monica has - after introducing the feature in September's PC release - finally made it possible to stop blabbermouth companions from incessantly spewing out puzzle hints on console.
</p>
<p>
Puzzle-ruining companions were one of the most consistent criticisms levied at the otherwise extremely well-received God of War Ragnarök back in 2021, with users lamenting Sony Santa Monica's rather condescending decision to almost immediately shower players with hints on encountering a new puzzle, rather than giving them space to find solutions for themselves.
</p>
<p>
"I am now many (many) hours further into Ragnarök, and yet these 'hints' just keep on coming," a rather exasperated Victoria Kennedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-overly-helpful-characters-create-a-puzzling-puzzle-problem">wrote on Eurogamer at the time</a>, "with varying degrees of abruptness from those delivering them."

<p>
Thankfully, when God of War Ragnarök finally made its way to PC back in September, Sony Santa Monica had taken criticism of the PlayStation version to heart, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc-lets-players-reduce-intrusive-puzzle-hints">introducing an option that specifically reduced the frequency companions doled out puzzle hints</a>. And that option - as Sony previously promised - is now available on console.
</p><p>
The feature arrives as part of Ragnarök's 06.00 update, which also brings a new Audio Descriptions accessibility option for all in-game cinematics, bug fixes, and a range of PS5 Pro-specific enhancements. The latter include a new mode enabling Favour Quality features while running at 60fps, a PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution option, plus the ability to unlock framerates when using variable refresh rate monitors. Full details can be <a href="https://support.sms.playstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/31642737345293-Patch-Notes-v-06-00">found on Sony's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the PC version of God of War Ragnarök, Digital Foundry was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-a-quality-port-with-small-issues-and-here-are-our-best-settings-selections">broadly impressed</a> when it took a closer look back in September, praising some "super-smooth gaming" while criticising "edge case problems that need addressing".

            <p>Activision has unveiled what's coming up in Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>'s first season, which is scheduled to launch on 14th November.</p>
<p>Along with five multiplayer maps - three of which are brand new - players can also expect a "vast amount" of free and premium content, including a new Zombies "experience in-season", plus full integration with Call of Duty's spin-off battle royale, Warzone.</p>

<p>Treyarch has outlined what's coming up in painfully busy infographic below, revealing that as well as the arrival of Racket (2v2 and 6v6), Hacienda (6v6), and Nuketown Holiday (6v6) mid-season, three new maps are also en-route: Hideout, Extraction, and Heirloom.</p><p>Hideout is described as a medium-sized training site featuring signature Black Ops design, whilst Extraction boasts the medium-sized Avalon Heliport "built for a variety of playstyles". Heirloom is more compact and features a "fine art museum built for fast-paced action". All are available for 6v6, with the latter also coming for 2v2.</p>
<p>Players can also expect ranked multiplayer games, as well as the new modes Ransack and Prophunt - the former requires you to loot gold bars and get them out whilst ensuring the enemy can't raid your stash, whilst the latter is "an infamous game of hide-and-seek". Whilst Prophunt launches mid-season, Ransack goes live at launch.</p> <div>
