            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/vtuber-usada-pekora-is-in-death-stranding-2-and-while-some-japanese-fans-hate-it-others-note-hideo-kojima-games-always-have-unexpected-crossovers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima Productions recently announced that VTuber Usada Pekora will be making a guest appearance in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>. However, this surprise cameo seems to have ruffled the feathers of some rather vocal Japanese Death Stranding fans on social media, some of whom are now proclaiming that they won’t buy the game anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Usada Pekora is a Hololive VTuber whose carrot-loving avatar is an anime girl with rabbit ears. As well as singing, she often streams games and has recently been playing Elden Ring: Nightreign. Fitting with her hungry, mischievous rabbit girl avatar, she is known for frequently adding the made-up word “peko” into her sentences (which probably comes from the casual Japanese expression “pekopeko,” which means “very hungry”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As seen in Kojima Productions’ video below, Pekora will appear as a hologram in Death Stranding 2, calling out greetings to Sam and thanking him for his hard work (she says “otsu<em>peko</em> deshita<em>”</em> instead of the actual Japanese phrase “otsukaresama deshita<em>”</em>).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">新たな繋がりを確認🐰<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeathStranding2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DeathStranding2</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%87%E3%82%B9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%882?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#デススト2</a> <a href="https://t.co/Xy5lsFS2FK" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Xy5lsFS2FK</a></p>— KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS (@KojiPro2015) <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015/status/1928043652758036711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some Japanese fans reacted strongly to the announcement of Usada Pekora’s cameo, with some commenters on X saying “I won’t buy Death Stranding 2 now.” Others elaborated on their reasons. “Death Stranding 2 is done for. When a game I planned to buy gets treated like this, I definitely won’t buy it,” said <a href="https://x.com/Usagi_chan_n/status/1928092742992941172" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one user</u></a>. “Stop pandering to VTubers. I won’t buy it now,” added <a href="https://x.com/Matatab21859902/status/1928105131398287510" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another</u></a>. It could be that these users find the VTuber and her affected speech annoying, or feel that Pekora doesn’t match Death Stranding’s more serious tone. In response, defenders have been giving equally terse replies such as, “Then don’t buy it then!” and, “If you are not going to buy DS2 just because Pekora is in it, then don’t!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is not the first time that Usada Pekora and Hideo Kojima have crossed paths. As reported by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/news/2505292o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Denfaminicogamer</u></a>, Pekora visited Kojima Productions back in August last year, posing with Kojima for the obligatory snap in front of Ludens.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">兎田ぺこらさんと🐇 <a href="https://t.co/S0JuGcBqVe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/S0JuGcBqVe</a></p>— 小島秀夫 (@Kojima_Hideo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1829421334730092634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Players familiar with Kojima’s work will know that his past games feature many unexpected crossovers, Easter eggs and bizarre elements. These include fourth wall-breaking mentions of other games, as well as the inclusion of real-life products and people (creepy developer “ghosts” in MGS2, anyone?). Metal Gear Solid 3 introduced the Kerotan frog character and featured the real-life Japanese snack Calorie Mate, both things that technically don’t match its 60s jungle setting — not to mention the Ape Escape monkeys that pop up in Snake Vs. Monkey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the first Death Stranding got Horizon: Zero Dawn-themed holograms, with the PC version getting even more crossover references to other games (Half Life, Portal, and Cyberpunk 2077) in the form of items. With Kojima’s penchant for putting all kinds of references and crossovers into his games, it seems likely that Usada Pekora will be one of many that players can discover in Death Stranding 2 when it releases on June 26.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, we reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach"><u>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</u></a>'s ESRB rating, which suggests players will be able to use an unconventional melee weapon. Hideo Kojima is also working on a live-action <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-coming-from-a24-kojima-productions"><u>Death Stranding film with A24</u></a>, and we recently learned that a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation-hideo-kojima-says"><u>Death Stranding anime is also in the works</u></a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%93-how-to-unlock-the-dark-souls-skins.1205292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-unlock-the-dark-souls-skins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Though deeply rooted in the Elden Ring universe and its Lands Between, the Elden Ring Nightreign setting allowed FromSoftware to make the game a celebration of its challenging Souls series, adding content lifted from games such as Dark Souls 3, among others. As you attempt to survive the Night and defeat the Nightlords, you will surely encounter some familiar faces from past games developed by the Japanese studio like the Nameless King and the Dancer of the Boreal Valley, but the content lifted from older games is not limited to bosses, as by achieving an extraordinary feat, you will be able to use skins inspired by the Dark Souls series, allowing you to turn Nightfarers into beloved characters like Solaire of Astoria and Sigmeyer of Catarina.</p>
<p><strong><em>WARNING: Light spoilers regarding Elden Ring Nightreign's content are ahead, so avoid reading if you don't want any potential surprises spoiled</em></strong></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603112654_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-change-skins/">Unlocking the Dark Souls skins in Elden Ring Nightreign isn't really complicated</a>, but it's far from easy, as you will have to <strong>successfully defeat at least four Nightlords</strong> to be able to embark on the Night Aspect Expedition, where you will be able to fight the game's final boss, Heolstor the Nightlord. <strong>Defeat the true lord of the Night</strong>, and once you are back in Roundtable Hold, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-change-skins/"><strong>access the mirror</strong></a><strong> to check the Dark Souls skins</strong> that are now available for purchase, and unlock them using Muck.</p>
<p>While unlocking the Dark Souls skins in Elden Ring Nightreign can be quite challenging, the effort is well worth it, especially if you are a fan of FromSoftware games. We may never get another entry in the Dark Souls series, but getting to play as some of its characters will make the pain of knowing that their stories are done a little more bearable.</p>

            <p>Last night, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> got some behind the scenes updates, and as has become tradition, this little morsel of change has immediately raised hopes that maybe, just maybe, we will be getting some kind of release date news soon.</p>
<p>These SteamDB updates were spotted and subsequently shared on social media by Wario64, who noted that one of the updated packages had just received its first update in 15 months. So, what could this all mean? Well, of course it means that developer Team Cherry is gearing up for the game's imminent release. Right?</p>

<p>Since Wario64's post, there have been plenty of other social media users who have come to this conclusion. "SWITCH 2 SHADOW DROP," <a href="https://x.com/Papa_Kutz/status/1929773856367300618">one excited fan wrote</a> with an accompanying gif of The US Office's Michael Scott getting very hyped up about things finally happening. I mean, we do know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">Silksong is set for <em>both </em>Nintendo's consoles</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2 is set to release this week</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-release-window-finally-narrowed-down">a Silksong tease earlier this year</a>, so maybe…</p>
<p>That said, the game is also coming to other platforms as well, and <a href="https://x.com/Animator_Alex/status/1929770574777033112">others have suggested that either Summer Game Fest</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-june-showcase-event-reveals-game-getting-this-years-big-spotlight">during the Xbox showcase on Sunday</a> will be when Team Cherry finally releases Silksong out into the wild. <a href="https://x.com/reverie_mark/status/1929781696804934110">Others are less certain</a>, but "manifesting" a release this week all the same.</p> <div>

<p>It has now been six years and a bit since Hollow Knight: Silksong was first announced, and many have been eagerly waiting ever since. In January, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">then finally assured us that Silksong was "real, progressing and will release"</a>.</p>
<p> So, do you think that release will be in just a few short days time?</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> and co released a sizzle reel for Summer Game Fest, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-releases-hype-trailer">featured titles such as Death Stranding 2, Dune Awakening, Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, and Mafia: The Old Country</a>, to name a handful. Silksong did not feature.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The battle for Super Earth that kicked off with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Heart of Democracy update concluded last week, with players managing to fend off an Illuminate invasion of their home planet. One of the two cities that ended up holding out against the hostile squids was Equality-On-Sea, located in the in-game map's version of China, and it's led <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">the shooter</a> to make a local news report in the country.</p>
<p>As spotted by players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1l1zad3/battle_for_super_earth_broadcasted_by_local_tv/">Helldivers 2 subreddit</a>, following the big victory for Super Earth, Chinese broadcaster Kanka News's Good Morning Shanghai anchors fronted <a href="https://www.kankanews.com/detail/dZ2e8qddBwR">a short segment</a> about these recent developments in the game. Based on a translation by a Reddit user with the handle AtypicalGameMaker (whose profile asserts that they're a Chinese game developer), the report discussed the defense of Equality-On-Sea, hailing both Chinese and non-Chinese players for working together to protect the city.</p>
<p>For some context, Equality-On-Sea and the Super Earth capital of Prosperity City were the only Super Earth cities left standing after the invasion. The defense of the former caused a bit of controversy, with a relatively small number of players <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-review-bombing-apparent-galactic-war-mixup">review bombing Helldivers 2</a> because they couldn't push the city's defense percentage gauge up to 100%, meaning it'd be fully under their control.</p>
<p>Members of the game's community suggested the root of this was that Equality-On-Sea was located in-game where Shanghai is in the real world, leading Chinese players to take its defense very seriously. An alleged translation mixup with the Chinese language version of the game seemingly also convinced these players that they could totally liberate the city while the battle for Super Earth was still in progress.</p>
<p>That last bit wasn't actually the case, with the constant flow of fresh Illuminate troops while the invasion was ongoing making it impossible to fully secure any mega cities at that stage of proceedings. Cue players getting frustrated as they believed their in-game efforts weren't having a dynamic effect on how the war was playing out, and some accusing developer Arrowhead of railroading them into certain outcomes.</p>
<p>The translation alludes to this apparent misunderstanding, citing the news anchors as having praised Helldivers 2 players for not following Arrowhead's Galactic War "script" and instead having "fought for their own story in an honorable way."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I quite like the way the report looks to have described the final stages of the big fight for Super Earth playing out: "Chinese players were battling the enemies during the daytime using their excellent shooting skills and strategic plans," the anchors allegedly said, "American players took over the nighttime operations, utilizing air drops and firepower to construct the defense line for Shanghai.</p>
<p>"This great unity of Chinese and American netizens came to a happy ending on the 30th." Nice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has now had 3.5 million players, less than a week since its release.</p>
<p>FromSoftware shared the news in a social media post, which also confirmed duo expeditions will be added "at a later date".</p>
<p>The multiplayer spin-off to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> is ostensibly a three-player game, though it's possible to play solo too. However, it's received plenty of criticism from players hoping to play as a duo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">FromSoftware stated it was considering adding a two-player mode post-launch</a>, with director Junya Ishizaki explaining it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>It seems, from this latest post, that the mode is on the way. It will follow the already announced DLC releasing later this year, as well as "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month".</p>
<p>The news suggests FromSoftware will be supporting the game with new content post-release.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">But the Night is far from over.<br>In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date.<br>Thank you for your support.</p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If you can't wait that long, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-two-player-elden-ring-nightreign-pc-mod-is-already-available">PC players can already play the game with two players thanks to a fan-made mod</a>.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign released last week and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">received two million players in its first day</a>. Initially, the game had a "Mixed" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/#app_reviews_hash">reaction on Steam</a>, but it's now recovered to "Mostly Positive". Perhaps players just needed to give it time and appreciate the game for what it is, rather than what it supposedly lacks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, FromSoftware <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">patched Elden Ring Nightreign to make it easier for solo players</a> - now there's a new automatic revive and an increase in runes gained. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">multiplayer remains the best way to experience the game</a>.</p>

For better context, the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion sold 5 million copies within three days of its release in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware’s multiplayer spin-off had launched to 2 million sales in just a day, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-massive-steam-launch-tarnished-by-mixed-user-reviews-over-lack-of-duos-co-op-voice-chat">but with a 'mixed' rating on Valve's platform</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of the initial negative sentiment revolved around Nightreign’s brutal solo experience, its lack of duos co-op, lack of voice chat, and other archaic mechanics. That age-old multiplayer struggle to find enough friends to make up a coordinated three-player group is very much a part of the Elden Ring Nightreign experience, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As explained in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign review</u></a>: "Let’s get the most important caveat out of the way first: if you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn’t for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn’t patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But on Monday, FromSoftware released a patch to make solo play much easier, and despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-matchmaking-not-working-fromsoftware-has-some-suggestions">matchmaking problems over the weekend</a>, sentiment has improved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, producer Yasuhiro Kitao <a href="https://x.com/YasuhiroKitao/status/1928475446217163233" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to social media</u></a> to comment on Elden Ring Nightreign’s early sales success and to thank players for giving the game a go despite its quirks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nightreign has some peculiar aspects to its game design and is different from our recent titles in various ways,” Kitao said. “Nonetheless, many of you have bravely jumped into this world, and for that we're immensely grateful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As with Demon's Souls or Sekiro, it may be confounding at first, but just like those games, Nightreign offers its own challenges and experiences. Once you overcome the initial hurdle, it'll surely provide a sense of accomplishment that's also its very own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hope you enjoy it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what happens next? FromSoftware said that in addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be “gradually implemented,” including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month (June), as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of duos will come as some relief to players who have questioned its omission from launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a> drops players into the shifting lands of Limveld, exploring and fighting for survival either solo or in groups of three.

When asked why there's no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that if you're playing with just your favorite duos partner, you have to accept a random third into your game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hands-on-robocop-rogue-city-%E2%80%93-unfinished-business.1205235/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/03/hands-on-robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There are people who thought&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> was a really good RoboCop game, and there are people who are wrong. Sure, RoboCop is a ponderous, stompy, overpowering tank of a police officer, and that plodding nature could be seen as a bit boring, but for many – myself included – that’s just the perfect representation of the character. In the films bullets barely bother Robo, so why should they in a game?</p>
<p>A lot of people agreed with me, Rogue City was a big hit for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/publisher/nacon/" rel="tag">Nacon</a> and less than two years later we have Unfinished Business, a new standalone game that continues the story. By continuing the story, I mean “borrowing very heavily from that really good Judge Dredd film with Karl Urban.” This time Robo is heading into a massive tower block, the OmniTower, a new housing development which is home to the many evicted residents of Detroit, who have been relocated to make way for the new super shiny Delta City.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MAmQl6ATq7Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The tower is controlled by a vicious gang that’s actually led by a former colleague of Murphy’s, and has has lots of tech installed that could give the bad guys control of everything OCP has ever created, which even includes RoboCop. It’s probably best not to think too hard about why such powerful tech would be in a civilian tower block, but maybe they have really fancy automated elevators, imported Japanese toilets and super snazzy power showers? With OCP in jeopardy, RoboCop must fight his way to the top, aided on the way by Miranda Hale, a former OCP scientist.</p>


<p>I think it’s fair to say that Unfinished Business is not reinventing the wheel when it comes to gameplay. RoboCop is still as stompy as ever and has many of the same power-ups found in the original game, including a dash and a shield. There are swarms of goons to take out with the iconic RoboCop pistol and it is as deliciously gory as ever, with heads exploding like watermelons. There are now location based finishers, so if an enemy is near a waste chute you can give them and slap and pop them down hole. There are also some new enemy types, most notably drones which spiral around in the air and can be a right pain if not dealt with quickly.</p>
<p>To mix things up you won’t be playing as Robo all the time, with flashback sequences letting you play as Alex Murphy before he had the ‘accident’ that resulted in him being given a robotic body. Sadly I did not get to play any of those sequence but I did get to play as one other character and it’s something you’ve never been able to do in any other Robocop game. – you get to control ED 209!</p>

<p>If you enjoyed the fact that RoboCop was an unstoppable tank then you might feel a tingle in your nethers when playing as ED, as his two massive guns mow down enemies, cutting through them like a knife through butter. If machine guns are too plain for you, he also has missile launchers which can take out huge groups of bad guys in one go, their bodies rag-dolling down hallways as explosion after explosion rains down upon them. It is ridiculous and completely over the top and I loved it.</p>
<p>You will also get to play as Miranda which could bring yet another angle to the game, though no details have been released on this just yet. If I had to guess, I’d figure she’s not great with guns and may have some other tasks to perform.</p>

<p>It’s a shame I didn’t get to try of the human characters as they should change how the game plays quite considerably. What I did play was more of the same, and that’s no bad thing in my book.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-sold-3-5-million-units-more-updates-coming-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, FromSoftware <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780347576750367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its latest game, the experimental multiplayer-centric Elden Ring Nightreign, has sold 3.5 million units in less than a week. This is already the second sales announcement in a short span after registering <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-had-2-million-players-on-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 million units sold on launch day</a>.</p>
<p>The Japanese developer also teased upcoming updates, some of which should be available soon:</p>
<p><em>We are ever grateful for your passion. But the Night is far from over. In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date. Thank you for your support.</em></p>
<p>Regarding Duo Expeditions, PC players can actually already <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-mods-framerate-two-player-mode-easier-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> a user-made mod while they wait for the official implementation.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign has received widespread acclaim, although critic scores and user scores alike are lower on average than those of the original game. On Steam, around 73% of 42.1K user reviews are positive. Here on Wccftech, though, Francesco De Meo loved his time with this peculiar take of the Soulslike formula, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rating</a> the game 9 out of 10.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign, more than many other FromSoftware titles, is likely to be an acquired taste for most players. My first few Expeditions into Limveld weren't particularly enjoyable, but the more I learned its mechanics, and the less I expected a traditional Soulslike with some roguelike elements sprinkled in, the more the game grew on me. Now, after dozens of failed Expeditions and a handful of successful ones spread over 30+ hours, I find it hard to put down. With its wealth of character customization options and the tension of a ticking clock dictating the fast pace of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign is an engaging and exhilarating experience that even those with only a passing interest in FromSoftware's games, or those still skeptical about it, should give a chance. Like me, they may find themselves drawn to the Night so deeply that they may never want to leave.</em></p>

            <p>Having never designed an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> before, there's a good chance the following grand theory of combat design I'm about to propose is reeking globnonsense, but here goes: I figure you've basically got two approaches. You can either keep it simple but chunky, and use this to lure the player in right away by making them feel powerful and capable. Then, you can keep your relatively pithy verb list interesting by riffing on things like encounter and enemy design.</p>
<p>Then, there's the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/texnoplazm">Texnoplazm</a> method (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527710/TEXNOPLAZM/">Steam demo here</a>) which is to slap you across the chops with a phone book of gun fu possibilities straight from the off, offer a taste of stylishness just piquant enough to convince you that mastering this toolkit seems like a fun and worthwhile idea, and let you loose. It's the "I suck at this, but I will not suck eventually, and then my enemies will be sorry and also impressed at how cool I look" approach. This method also ends up with you feeling much more capable than the first guy, even though they got to have more fun earlier.</p>
<p>That was a lot of words to say "game good, if a little overwhelming initially". Here's a trailer. It may contain the following verbs: punch. Punch but big. Slide. Slam. Dodge. Throw weapon. Grab weapon in midair. Kick. Wall run. Block. Parry. Have impeccable android butt.</p>

<p>I should add that wall running is the good kind, not just the situational 'run across a wall with special running arrows to cross a pit', although that does happen sometimes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-mixes-fast-gameplay-consistent-resource-system<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, I was invited to LA to visit Riot Games studios and get a chance to get my hands on four of the trial decks for <em>Riftbound </em>and play against a variety of well-known influencers in the TCG and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f592df1a-b23c-4d90-be15-ad30ae0f5543" href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em></a> space.</p>

<p><em>Riftbound</em>, featuring well-known characters from the world of <em>League of Legends</em>, is a fast-paced TCG where at any moment you can have your momentum reset, resulting in a game filled with entertaining highs where even when I was down, I never felt like I was 'out'.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to learn more about the development of Riftbound, the spoiler season leading up to the release of Set 1: Origins, and what Organized Play will look like be sure to check out everything we learned&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="44fc125e-f0a1-4c69-a5b6-976d9c84ae8e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/everything-we-learned-about-riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-at-pre-launch-summit" rel="nofollow">Everything We Learned About Riftbound At The Pre-Launch Summit</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How Does <em>Riftbound </em>Work?</h2>

<p>In <em>Riftbound</em>, players use Runes to summon units and cast spells. The objective of play isn't to set up attacks to levy at your opponents directly, but instead, the game is about conquering and holding objectives called Battlefields to earn points.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a player's turn, they're able to trigger all Beginning of Turn text, refresh all of their cards, draw two additional mana, and then draw a card into their hand. From there, each player is free to take any other action. That could be to cast a spell, summon a unit, or move any active Units from your Base out to a Battlefield to begin a Showdown.</p>

<p>Summoning Units take up a certain number of Runes, and sometimes can also cause Runes to be recycled (returning it to the bottom of your Rune deck.)</p>

<p>The Rune system in <em>Riftbound </em>is unique, working perfectly to ramp up the speed of a game of <em>Riftbound </em>while also giving all decks a level of consistency. Every turn, you draw two more, letting your available resources grow from two to four, to six, etc. Games beginning with playing a single unit exhausted end up in larger turns where you're able to combine the strengths of Units and Spells to create entertaining combos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You'll never have to worry about not drawing a Land or Energy when playing <em>Riftbound</em>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have Units ready, you'll be able to move them to a Battlefield. If one is unoccupied, you'll automatically Conquer it, earning yourself a point. If you hold the Battlefield until your next turn, you'll earn another point.</p>

<p>When players' Units collide on a Battlefield, that's when you'll have a Showdown. At its core, the Showdown is just a matter of "Are my Units' might numbers higher than your Units?" If one side has two Units of 3 and 4 Might, and you move a powerful creature with 8 Might onto the Battlefield, then without the intervention of any spell (or other player), the weaker units will perish.</p>

<p>In a situation where each side has multiple units, you might not be able to successfully hold or conquer the Battlefield, but you could defeat one or two of your opponents' Units, weakening their side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-battlefield.jpg?itok=RhOc1UJ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-battlefield.jpg?itok=JZW79jg8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While the Viktor Side will win this Showdown based on Might (8) the opposition's 4 Might will lead to the death of Viktor's two 1 Might Units</figcaption></figure><p>A nice touch about the win condition, of earning eight points, is that you need to win your final point by holding a Battlefield uncontested for a turn or by capturing all Battlefields simultaneously (this means two in a standard game). This adds a fun level of tension as you can view your opponent creeping closer and closer to their eighth point, and can work to deny them.</p>

<p>With an ever-progressing mana system and a tweaked final point/win condition, it gives players a lot of chances to regain ground while stalling their opponent on their final point. It also means that the game is always progressing towards its conclusion. Even while being taught the game, a standard 1v1 only took 20 minutes, and even less time once everyone really started to understand the ins and outs of their decks.</p>

<h2>Losing The Final Point Isn't Exciting</h2>

<p>One downside of the point system, and how scoring the final point is done, is that the writing is normally on the wall on the losing player's final turn. They'll be able to look at their hand, available Runes, and Units out on the field and know if they're going to win or lose.</p>

<p>Unlike other TCGs where players are in the game until it's over, there's a recognizable "There's nothing I can do here, I surrender" on the final point.</p>

<p>There are scenarios where combat can take place, and spells can fly, shifting the final battle one way or another, but that's going to be far less likely in comparison to a recognizable defeat.</p>

<p>Overall, I think to have a very tense battle for 90% of the game, to have a bit of a weak ending is far more valuable to me as a player who is very interested in playing this game when compared to playing a different TCG where not pulling certain cards or resources can lead the competition to really even begin.</p>

<p><em>Riftbound </em>is designed to be played not only 1v1 but also multiplayer with four players, either as a 2v2 or a free-for-all. There are only a few rule differences when it comes to multiplayer, but it also changes a lot of the mentality behind the game.</p>

<p>When playing a free-for-all or 2v2, rules-wise, the first player doesn't draw on their first turn, and there's a third Battlefield placed in the center of the players. With more Battlefields to conquer, you can stay out of each other's way a little bit longer, but if you want to be making points then you'll need to be advancing your units.</p>

<p>The change in mentality comes from the final point/win condition. There's clear visibility on who has how many points, and as one person is creeping towards winning, it's in the best interest of the other players to stop them. This combined effort of all players to stop one person winning creates shifting allegiances and the ability to team up and betray one another.</p>

<p>Interestingly, in Multiplayer, there are also rules that while the Showdown will always be against the two players whose Units are at the Battlefield, a participating player can invite another to cast spells to help turn the tide of victory.</p>

<p>This kind of gameplay stirs discussion at a table, asking others if they move their weaker units into a Battlefield if someone would be able to help them win it over.</p>

<p>In a 2v2 game, the descriptions on some cards expand. Card text normally doesn't say "Your Units" but instead "Friendly Units." The effects of these cards in a 2v2 game will allow you to trigger abilities that assist you and your partner.</p>

<h2><em>Riftbound </em>Decks And Their Playstyle</h2>

<p>Each of the Trial Decks we got to use had its own unique mechanics:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Jinx is a Red/Purple deck whose purpose is to always be going full out. When you start a turn with only one card in your hand, you'll get a chance to draw twice.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Volibear is a Red/Orange deck that ramps quickly to pull out singular, powerful creatures that you'll have trouble coming up with the Might to take on</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Viktor is a Blue/Yellow deck that is all about building up recruits to create a small army to hold Battlefields, even if they may not hold it for long</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Yasuo is a Green/Purple deck where a number of cards have the Ganking ability, which allows them to traverse from one Battlefield to another (instead of having to return home first). This allows for attacks to come from anywhere with speed and precision.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-legends-and-their-cards.jpg?itok=zK15fgG0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-legends-and-their-cards.jpg?itok=qpowPI4u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Legend, Champion Unit, and Signature Spell of the Trial Decks will give you an idea of the core mechanics of each</figcaption></figure><p>Of the decks that I played, the one that I had the most difficulty with was Jinx. While I understood the benefit of milling out cards and drawing more to unleash powerful attacks, I always felt like I was in a situation with less flexibility due to having fewer cards in my hand.</p>

<p>Volibear and Viktor were both extremely interesting sides of the same coin. Is it better to have eight Units with 1 Might or to have a giant bear with 8 Might? Depending on the Battlefields in play and the speed at which each can activate the deck's engine, I found these two decks to be very evenly matched.</p>

<p>Yasuo, I had the least experience. There was talk about Yasuo games where he swept across each of the Battlefields, resetting every opponent's momentum, but I didn't get to experience that firsthand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At launch, there will be three pre-made decks, four weaker decks as part of a Proving Grounds 4-player set aimed at beginners, and twelve Champions available from Booster Packs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outside of the Trial Decks, I also got to try out a pre-made Darius deck that was Red and Yellow. This deck was an absolute powerhouse and one that I can't wait to build when <em>Riftbound </em>fully releases. Darius had a mix of powerful cards that could Accelerate allowing them to be ready on their first turn, as well as a 1 Might Recruit generating engine like the Viktor trial deck.</p>

<p>Another powerful keyword of the Darius deck was the Legion ability, these are effects that only activate if another card has already been played that turn. You could summon Darius's Champion Unit card, play a card with a Legion ability to generate a 1 Might Recruit, and then trigger Darius's Unit Card's effect that if a second card is played, he's readied. Your side could go from nothing to a 7 Might Unit ready to move, and two additional Units currently Exhausted but ready to move up next turn.</p>

<h2><em>Riftbound League of Legends</em> TCG Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The speed with which Riot has been able to create <em>Riftbound </em>has been insane, and the final product feels insanely polished. With quick-to-complete games that always feel like you're only just ahead or slightly behind, and wide mechanical variety, <em>Riftbound </em>is a game that can appeal to a hardcore TCG player while also being entertaining for new players to pick up a game and get started.</p>

<p>The Battlefield mechanics and movement in general in a TCG is novel but easy to understand. It also keeps you engaged as you try to shift tactics to win over one instead of another.</p>

<p>For collectors or players, whether you're into the world of <em>League of Legends</em> or not I would definitely recommend picking up a few decks and trying them out with your friends when it releases in October.</p>

At first, the Keys appear blank, but as you progress, the sentences explaining them gradually fill in.

Later, it becomes crucial to act in accordance with the completed Key Rules.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_020.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_021.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Nintendo Switch 2 Physical Version</strong></p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 physical version will be released as a game-key card.

No other details were provided beyond that.</p>

<p>The aforementioned 20.1.0 update arrived May 27 and made some notable audio and visual changes to the Switch's interface to bring it more in line with its successor. In particular, Nintendo tweaked the look and color of the Parental Control settings button on the Home screen, as well as changed the sound that plays when launching the Nintendo Switch Online menu.</p><p>The 20.1.0 update also arrived alongside a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-switch-2s-launch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-gets-first-update-in-years/1100-6531857/" data-ref-id="1100-6531857">new patch</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" data-ref-id="5000-487113">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>--the first the game has received since 2022. In preparation for Switch 2's launch, the 2.0.7 update "improved the compatibility for multiplayer sessions between Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch."</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 hits stores on June 5. The console itself retails for $450, while the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> bundle runs for $500. The latter, however, will only be available for a limited time and is set to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-bundle-will-be-discontinued-this-fall/1100-6530950/" data-ref-id="1100-6530950">discontinued in Fall 2025</a>.</p><p>While Switch 2 preorders quickly sold out when they went live back in April, many retailers like Walmart and Target will have in-store and online restocks this week in time for the system's launch. You can read more in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/" data-ref-id="1100-6531967">Switch 2 restock guide</a>.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Ver. 20.1.1 Patch Notes</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue where some software would not start after updating to system version 20.1.0.</li></ul>

						<h5>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon</h5><p><span>May 23rd, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><span>Think of one of your favorite games of all time. Chances are, there’s some passionate team of developers out there trying to make their own experience molded after that same shared love for the game. Trouble is, unless you’re a development studio with the same staffing level as Bethesda or Rockstar, you probably won’t be making the next Elder Scrolls or Grand Theft Auto. Polish studio Questline has tried the impossible with their take on spinning an Arthurian tale with the first-person finesse of Bethesda’s signature RPG series. Does Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon deserve a seat at The Round Table, or is this one folktale best left in history?</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tainted-Grail-Red-Death-scaled.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon isn’t the first title from Questline to tell a dark and nearly apocalyptic take on the tale of King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table, but it is certainly the most ambitious. Set in the land of Avalon, Tainted Grail focuses on the bastion of humanity some six hundred years following King Arthur making a pilgrimage to this island of Avalon to escape The Red Death, a plague that slowly cripples and ultimately kills anyone who comes in contact with it. Now, as the legend of King Arthur has been twisted into a horrific facsimile of itself, the tales of the old noble king are instead talked about in hushed whispers and cursing both the king and the gods alike for their plight.</span></p>
<p><span>Enter the nameless protagonist, a prisoner of the Red Priests locked away in an island asylum to await the aggressive Red Death to corrupt his body and come to an untimely end. Players are quizzed on the circumstances that led them to the prison by an inquiring guard, with the choices players make leading to a small boost in particular stats. None are particularly drastic enough to justify starting the adventure over if you don’t like your starting stats, but I did enjoy that answering that your background was that in magics and you would rather burn a tree down than heal someone rewards you with a fireball spell that would last for the opening acts.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tainted-Grail_-Fall-of-Avalon_20250524204724-scaled.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>At this point, you’re left to dwell upon your choices and waste away as The Red Death overtakes you. That is, until a prison break leads to the playable hero crossing paths with the soul of King Arthur and taking that kingly power into oneself. Much as the artifacts of The Round Table have been spread across the land, so too have parts of King Arthur’s soul. What could have been a possession by the strongest human of the era is instead conferred upon the player as an immunity to The Red Death and some novel time-slowing mechanics for combat. It’s here that the player is tasked with gathering up a number of artifacts that house parts of King Arthur’s soul, from his trusted Excalibur to his shield and crown.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tainted-Grail-Galahad-scaled.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>One of the hallmarks of Bethesda’s first-person RPG series is that anything can be picked up and most actions have an underlying skill and leveling system underneath. Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon takes these touchstones and simplifies them without the complexity and nuances one might expect. Players gain combat proficiency in one of four combat styles each time they land an attack: Unarmed, One-Handed Weapons, Two-Handed Weapons, and Archery. Axes, spears, claymores, and the like are all bundled together until the general weapon type and magic is similarly truncated down to a single skill set rather than specializing in a specific school of focus. This was a novel change I rather liked, as this incentivized me to pick up a new weapon whenever possible and not have to worry about getting skilled up in the proficient use of axes just because I was using a wooden club for the first couple of hours. And yes, jumping off cliffs or hopping down the street does help train your athletics.</span></p>
<p><span>Leveling up confers a single attribute point and a couple of skill points upon the player. Attributes are divided into one of six basic stats, and each comes with both combat and passive bonuses, making it worth investing in a wide range of stats instead of focusing on just strength or endurance to become a pack mule. Most decent equipment has a stat requirement to put on, so it’s worth being flexible and throwing a couple of points into a different stat just to put on a fresh pair of pants. Skill points can be freely distributed among any skill tree at any time without needing a stat requirement, and instead only require being purchased in order, depending on the skill tree you’re investing in. Scattered throughout Avalon are a number of origin potions which help reset your choices and can help if you suddenly find yourself unable to draw a bow again, such as having your arm chomped off for trying to pet a sleeping crockmaw.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tainted-Grail-Croakmaw-Results-scaled.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>On paper, Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon sounds like it hits the right marks for being a Skyrim-inspired adventure. With a 60-70 hour-long campaign, three massive zones to explore, and dozens of side quests with branching paths and choices, what’s not to love? Unfortunately, there’s an awful lot to put on that list, especially on the PlayStation 5 Pro.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During the week or so leadup to the 1.0 launch and finally leaving Early Access, Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon had a number of substantial patches that both fixed and broke a great deal. While I didn’t have any particularly save corrupting issues that flat-out blocked my progression, I had several instances where quest NPCs simply didn’t exist. Perhaps they died in the dead of night during the Wyrdness or to a pack of wolves, or maybe they simply blipped out of existence when I wasn’t looking. </span></p>
<p><span>In both of the first two zones, I was soft locked into being unable to progress the adventure by any normal means. Within the first major hub city is a grotesque statue where players must draw Excalibur out to retrieve one of the first pieces of King Arthur’s Soul. The only problem is that there were two factions I could have allied with in order to get information on how to retrieve the mythical blade in one piece. Players can choose between allying with Sir Galahad and Kamelot or the smaller tribal factions; in my case, I came to a stalemate because I killed Sir Galahad for his armor, and then the other faction was also hostile and wouldn’t let me speak with words rather than blades.</span></p>

<p><span>With both factions essentially stripped of their leadership in Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, I essentially crippled my information gathering and was left without a reliable way to secure Excalibur. That is, until some handy experimentation and chugging a whole barrel full of healing potions allowed me to survive long enough to free Excalibur from its resting place on display. Sadly, while this permitted me to venture into the second region, I was left with a pile of loose threads and unfinished quests because the key NPCs were dead. Similarly, in the second region, one of the NPCs I needed to meet with to finish the main quest in that region simply never showed up for me.</span></p>

<p><span>Alas, my fifty-hour playthrough of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466060/Tainted_Grail_The_Fall_of_Avalon/">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon</a> ended with a whimper as I could do little more than roam around the two maps I had fully cleared, a world that’s beautiful when you stop to examine the splendor but is interrupted by hitches and slowdown the moment you start walking forward. Perhaps in another few months time, once Questline has had the time to patch out the game-crushing bugs, this is one trip to Avalon worth checking out.</span></p>

						<section>
				<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon is an ambitious passion project that clearly invokes some of the highlights of Bethesda's signature RPG series while retaining some unique quirks all their own. Unfortunately, the first few steps out of Early Access show that this adventure into Avalon could have used a little more time fending off the Red Death.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Combat that rewards players for switching between playstyles and experimenting with magic
</li><li>Cheeky writing that pokes fun at itself and the genre without veering into meme territory
</li><li>Dozens of weapons with unique enchantments
</li><li>Dual-wield anything
</li><li>A spell that turns people into cheese
</li><li>Open-ended quests that let you ally with different factions, or just carve your own way to glory
</li><li>Fishing</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Overly aggressive autosaving that freezes action to a halt
</li><li>Major performance flaws including repeated crashing, screen tearing, and general poor performance even on PS5 Pro
</li><li>Impossible to view items in the stash without first pulling them back into your inventory (currently a bug that hopefully will get patched out)
</li><li>Critical NPCs either dying or disappearing from the world when you need them most</li>						</ul>

                <p>Dear Villagers is having a publisher sale on Steam. Most of its games (Big Helmet Heroes, The Forgotten City, Gravity Circuit, etc.) are currently being offered at a discounted price. One particular game, however, is being offered for free. For a limited time, players can claim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hellslave/" data-ref-id="5000-530727">Hellslave</a> on Steam and keep it forever. No strings attached.</p><p>Developed by Ars Goetia and released back in 2022, Hellslave is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler that tasks players with saving humanity via a deal with the devil. By using the power granted from worshipping one of six demons, they'll need to subdue the forces of hell. Varying skill trees, turn-based combat, a large post-apocalyptic world map to explore--the game seemingly has all the makings of an interesting RPG. And thanks to this Dear Villagers promotion, it’ll be available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1608450/Hellslave/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free</a> until June 16.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt617ejAIf4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gt617ejAIf4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Steam is known for its seasonal and publisher-based sales. What it isn’t known for, at least not to the extent of competing platforms, is free games. So, it’s nice to see a game being offered in this fashion, especially since Ars Goetia announced that Hellslave 2 is coming in 2026; what better way to check out the original Hellslave ahead of its sequel?</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s Star Wars season is almost over, but there's still one more big thing left on the schedule before we dive into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">a more traditional summer season</a> of battle royale: the Death Star Sabotage live event! Unlike past Star Wars incursions into Fortnite, which ended with the Empire or First Order just kinda bailing, we're getting a proper wrap-up here that will involve players teaming up to invade the Death Star, which has been looming over the island all season, and presumably blow it up.</p><p dir="ltr">While Fortnite has frequently held ambient live events that took place during battle royale matches, Death Star Sabotage will be the sort of event that's usually reserved for the end of a chapter. We haven't had a live event like this one in the middle of a chapter since the Collision event at the end of Chapter 3 Season 2, almost exactly three years ago. Fittingly, it was what happened during that event that drew Darth Vader to the island in Fortnite's story.</p><p dir="ltr">It won't be long now until we get to take on Emperor Palpatine. Here's what we know.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_is_Fortnite_s_Star_Wars_event__Death_Star_Sabotage_">When is Fortnite's Star Wars event, Death Star Sabotage?</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite's Death Star Sabotage live event will take place on Saturday, June 7 at 2 PM ET / 11 AM PT. It will be its own separate mode in the Discover pane, and will be available to join two hours before the start time, at noon ET / 9 AM PT. It will likely be the only mode available by the time it starts, so it should be hard to miss.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a one-time-only thing, and there won't be any encores, so don't be late! But if you can't make it yourself, there will still be plenty of folks streaming it on Twitch, YouTube, and elsewhere.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Fortnite_s_Star_Wars_event">What to expect from Fortnite's Star Wars event</h2><p dir="ltr">If the event is similar to past ones, it will be a fairly short, scripted, and linear experience, approximately 10-20 minutes long. It'll have interactive elements, and there will be targets to shoot and objectives to complete, but it's not intended to test your skills. Think of it more like an interactive theme park ride.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4505105-fortnitestarwarsfinale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505105" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4505105-fortnitestarwarsfinale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505105"></a><figcaption>Fishstick will apparently have a role to play in taking down the Death Star.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4505105-fortnitestarwarsfinale.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There haven't yet been any leaks about what's in store, but judging by the key art, we'll be seeing some Fortnite characters disguised as stormtroopers, as players fly up to the Death Star to fight the Emperor and disable some shields and/or tractor beams. But that's just a hunch.</p><p dir="ltr">To get a sense of what we're probably in for, check out this replay of the Collision event from June 2022.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3grDht7-kK0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3grDht7-kK0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_happens_after_the_event_ends_">What happens after the event ends?</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite is likely to go offline entirely once the event ends, and will stay that way for about half a day, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">the new season</a> begins on Sunday morning.</p>
