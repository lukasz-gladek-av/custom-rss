			<p>Krafton, the parent company of Subnautica and Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds, has reportedly delayed the highly anticipated Subnautica 2 from its original 2025 release window into 2026, seemingly in an attempt to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a significant $250 million bonus.</p>



<p>A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM">Bloomberg</a> claims that the development team at Unknown Worlds was due to get a $250 million bonus if the studio hit certain revenue targets before the end of 2025, a goal that would be accomplished more easily with Subnautica 2's release by the end of the year. Now that the game has allegedly been delayed, developers at Unknown Worlds believe they will miss those revenue targets, and miss out on the bonus.</p>



<p>This follows the <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">seemingly sudden departure of Unknown World's studio leadership last week</a>, with Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire, all being replaced by former Striking Distance Studios studio head, Steve Papoutsis. Krafton announced the departures, and while it did not provide a reason for the three founders leaving, in a press release it said, "<em>There is nothing more important than the gamer experience. Given the anticipation around Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible</em>."</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg's report, delaying Subnautica 2 into next year was not what Cleveland, Gill, or McGuire wanted. Cleveland even took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Subnautica Reddit page</a> to publish a farewell, saying that, "<em>the events of this week have been quite a shock. We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you're ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton's hands. And after all these years, to find I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings</em>."</p>



<p>Bloomberg's report also describes a town hall meeting with the development team at Unknown Worlds, in which the new studio head, Steve Papoutsis, explained to the team that it was Krafton's belief that Subnautica 2 was not ready for an early access release, and that delaying it into 2026 was necessary to add more content to the game. Papoutsis was then asked if Subnautica 2 was being delayed so Krafton could avoid paying the $250 million bonus, to which Papoutsis reportedly said, "<em>It's a good question, and I would appreciate patience on this particular topic</em>," and continued to say that he was not familiar with the specifics of Krafton's contract with Unknown Worlds and its acquisition. He said they were "<em>beyond my current understanding at the moment</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The desire of Krafton is to have the very best version of Subnautica 2 available for its early access,</em>" Papoutsis continued. "<em>While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, 'Hey we should launch this,' that wasn't where both parties aligned around</em>."</p>



<p>Papoutsis also said that he was never told that "<em>we're making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that</em>."</p>



<p>Krafton is the developer and publisher behind the massively successful battle royale game, PUBG, and also the studio that saved <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-lives-again-thanks-to-krafton/">Tango Gameworks from total closure by acquiring the studio from Microsoft</a>. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021</a> for an undisclosed amount at the time, which Bloomberg now reports to have been $500 million. Subnautica 2 was announced as arriving in 2025 in early access in<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-launches-next-year-in-early-access-on-pc-and-xbox-will-also-be-on-game-pass/"> October 2024</a>, and is due to launch into Xbox Game Pass.</p>

Taking place in the space-themed space around Magic's Multiverse, it plays on sci-fi tropes from alien creatures to uncharted planets - both of which we got to show off in the gallery above.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Preorder MTG: Edge of Eternities Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first two cards - Broodguard Elite and Debris Field Crusher - are uncommon cards in the card pool of the main set. That means they generally have an eye more toward fitting into Edge of Eternities' draft and sealed formats (which only use cards from this single set) rather than making waves in constructed formats like Standard or Commander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, they do a good job of showing off two of EOE's new mechanics: Warp and Spacecrafts. Warp is sort of an interesting twist on a previous Magic mechanic called Evoke, letting you cast creatures for a cheaper cost but forcing them to be exiled at the end of the turn, allowing you to temporarily take advantage of their abiltiies earlier and then cast them again from exile later. Spacecrafts, on the other hand, start as a simple artifact that you need to "Station" creatures on (by tapping them) in order to make them because creatures that can attack and block on their own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other seven cards we got to reveal are a little bit different. They are all reprints of exisiting land cards with flashy new intergalactic art, and aren't actually part of the main EOE set. Instead, these are part of the Stellar Sights bonus sheet, which means these cards can be found alongside many other lands in any type of booster pack but <em>are not </em>being added to any formats they aren't already a part of. They can also be found in an even rarer "poster" variant with different art, but only in Collector Boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to know more about Magic's interstellar escapades, we've got a more in-depth <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preview">preview of Edge of Eternities</a> - or if you'd prefer to stick to crossover sets, here's a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">the current schedule for its Secret Lair sets</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">One infamous story that emerged from the Nintendo Switch 2 launch in early June came from the Staten Island section of New York City, where a GameStop employee stapled a receipt for the console to its box--which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-switch-2-owners-have-holes-in-their-screen-thanks-to-gamestop/1100-6532136/">damaged the Switch 2's screen</a> in the process. Now, GameStop is turning this blunder into a boon for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, as the company is auctioning off multiple items from the incident--including the staple itself--for charity.</p><p dir="ltr">The<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731" rel="nofollow "> eBay listing</a> for the charity auction includes a letter from GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, confirming that all four items included in the auction are "authentic relics from the now-infamous 'Staplegate' incident." Cohen's message also says that, "while the incident itself was unfortunate, [GameStop] hope[s] its legacy serves a greater purpose."</p><p>The four items included in the auction are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The staple used in the incident, which is described as "a retail legend born from a half-second decision"</li><li dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch 2 console itself, with a repaired screen</li><li dir="ltr">The full retail packaging of the console, "with the staple mark clearly visible"</li><li dir="ltr">The individual staple that damaged the console, which has been "carefully extracted and preserved" in an "individual display pouch"</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The auction--which is raising money for Children's Miracle Network, per the eBay listing--has surpassed $8,000 in bids as of this writing, with the most recent bid currently sitting at $8,110. The listing also confirms that bids on the lot will be accepted until July 16 at 9:51 AM PT / 12:51 PM ET.</p>

But for some reason, Piranha Plant Pipeline never made the leap to Switch. It also isn’t included in <em>Mario Kart World </em>on Switch 2. And because <em>Mario Kart Tour</em> rotates tracks in and out, actually <em>playing </em>Piranha Plant Pipeline is tricky.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s taken a couple of weeks for the full extent of <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> to enter my field of view. For a while, all I’d seen of the Netflix animated phenomenon was the extremely…uh, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/1lpb52f/i_havent_seen_kpop_demon_hunters_so_i_have/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/1lpb52f/i_havent_seen_kpop_demon_hunters_so_i_have/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>exuberant</em> early scene</a></span> of its main cast of KPop idols getting real excited about their dinner, and the gifs from it being used <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GOREJ1RA/status/1939835188982554998&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GOREJ1RA/status/1939835188982554998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in some out-of-pocket ways</a></span> by gay and stan Twitter. Then, I saw some movie critics saying it would likely be in the conversation come awards season, and my interest was actually piqued. What finally put me over the edge was hearing one of the soundtrack’s standout songs: “Free.”</p><p>The hopeful ballad is a duet between Rumi, the lead singer of a demon-hunting trio group called Huntr/x, and Jinu, an up-and-coming boy band frontman who is secretly a demon seeking to weaken Huntr/x’s influence by stealing their fanbase out from under them. However, by this point in the film, the two opposing rivals have shifted into a star-crossed lovers era, and the result is a song that could easily stand alongside some of Disney’s classic love songs. After hearing just a few brief seconds of the soaring vocals, I knew I had to see what all the fuss was about. And y’all, if you were put off by the memery, I urge you to give <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>a chance.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Huntr/x is the latest group in a long line of demon hunters who use music to win the hearts and minds of the public, whose adoration in turn powers them in their demon-hunting efforts. Rumi, however, has an even more personal stake in seeing the demon and human world separated than her predecessors did, as she is part demon herself. For her entire life, Rumi has been told that if she and her bandmates can power the “Honmoon,” a barrier between both worlds, the demon markings on her skin will disappear, and she won’t have to hide who she is from her friends and fans. It’s very much giving Elsa’s story in <em>Frozen</em>, but the demon-hunting girl group framing gives it an edge that production studio Sony Pictures Animation bolsters with a vibrant visual style that makes you want to press a non-existent Screenshot button in your head every other shot.</p><p><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>’ character arcs are a little tropey, but it pulls off its sentimentality and paranormal action with such confidence that I was still caught up in all of it. Its main trio’s story of superficial friendships being tested when shit gets real is poignant and punctuated by explosive, visually stunning fights with Jinu’s demon hordes. Whether its leads are dueling or dancing, <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>is a pretty thrilling animated spectacle.</p><p>But a KPop movie is nothing without its songs, and <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em>’ soundtrack is full of bops. “Free” is still probably my standout favorite, but the assortment of Huntr/x songs and a few tracks by the rival demon group Saja Boys run the gamut of spunky power pop, flirtatious earworms, and anthemic stadium songs. The music is sung by some major KPop talent including Ejae, who provides Rumi’s singing voice and has worked with huge names in the space like Le Sserafim and Twice. So if you’re a KPop enthusiast and wondered if the film would have the talent to back up such a storied genre and industry, worry not.</p><p>All the gorgeous animation, music, and choreography in the world are great, but without an interesting storyline, <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> would have still fallen flat. What surprised me the most about the movie is how it depicts stan culture and musicians’ impossible task of maintaining an audience in a world in which a viral hit can come and go. Though the film does approach this with a tongue-in-cheek, rapid-fire comedic attitude, the concept of a pop group having to maintain their fanbase lest they face the literal end of the world makes for a surprisingly layered setup. If you’ve ever been online and adjacent to pop fandoms (KPop and elsewhere), you know that the industry and fans love to pit two bad bitches against one another. Having what is essentially a stan battle between Huntr/x and Saja Boys serve as a potentially world-ending war is a clever foundation that could have allowed for deeper interrogation of real-world issues of unhinged fandom than the film cares to explore. I also wish <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>would get a bit more pointed about some of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3440558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3440558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemic problems in the music industry like overwork</a></span>, which the film mostly chalks up to its girls being “workaholics,” but most of the industry talk in the movie is set dressing for it to deal with other, more universal topics. Can’t win them all, I suppose.</p><p>That being said, if your sole exposure to <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>is a gif of Rumi passionately sniffing and eating kimbap, I do think you’ll find something to like in the movie. It’s beautifully animated with a killer soundtrack, and it’s just angsty enough that it can feed a fandom for ages.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fading-echo/" data-ref-id="5000-681533">Fading Echo</a> has caught my eye for a few reasons: its desert punk setting, fast-paced and fluid-looking combat, and its mixture of both Japanese manga and American comics for its visuals. French developer New Tales' debut title is an impressive-looking action-adventure game, but what has most surprised me about it is seeing so many names attached to it that I recognize from the tabletop industry. But as it happens, that's no coincidence--from the very beginning, Fading Echo has had a connection to TTRPGs.</p><p dir="ltr">"Before joining the video game industry, I used to work in the TTRPG industry," New Tales co-founder and Fading Echo co-director Emmanuel Obert told me. "So eight or 10 years ago--something like that--I created a TTRPG setting for a group of friends [that] I met in the '90s and 2000s in the TTRPG space."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eulglZW-W0g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eulglZW-W0g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">He continued: "At some point each of us was a Dungeon Master for [our home games] and when a campaign was done, it would switch to another Game Master. So when my turn came, I was a big fan--and am still a big fan--of the Chronicles of Amber, but it's hard to play in worlds that are super well set. It's hard to move stuff around. And it's a diceless system. Some people in the TTRPG [space] hate systems [like that]. And so then I thought, 'Okay, let's take some inspiration from that [instead]. Let's build something [new].'"</p><p dir="ltr">The original idea of that setting, homebrewed to work with the Marvel Heroic Cortex Plus system, is what would eventually become Fading Echo. When Obert and his fellow co-founders first started New Tales three and a half years ago, they wanted to make games, not just publish them. But they didn't have access to any existing IP or ideas for their own. So Obert pitched the fantasy world he had made for his friends years prior--the team thought it had "potential" according to Obert, and aspects of it were adjusted to make the setting their own. But aspects of the original world remain in Fading Echo. "The legends that we have in Fading Echo, it's very much our version of a Princess of Amber," Obert said.</p><p dir="ltr">Lore-wise, Fading Echo takes place on Corel, a lost world discovered by House Kelevra (of which protagonist One and her mother, Rahne, are a part). With advanced machinery and liquid magic, Kelevra attempted to colonize the planet, but their overly aggressive efforts fractured the Corel and doomed those who came to call it home.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529010-ss_803c26d0c31089a12a8b61658a12669d74e54db3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529010" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529010-ss_803c26d0c31089a12a8b61658a12669d74e54db3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529010"></a><figcaption>You can temporarily create platforms over lava by pushing a wave of water through it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529010-ss_803c26d0c31089a12a8b61658a12669d74e54db3.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To showcase how the planet is fighting back against those seeking to tame it, Fading Echo's world is built around systemic depth to encourage player expression in combat and traversal, or when interacting with elemental forces, like lava or pollution.</p><p dir="ltr">"Water [is] the mana of the game," studio head Sylvain Sechi told me. "And then we expanded this concept of playing with fluid--not only water but also other fluids like lava, like waste, like corrosion. Each fluid has an elementary reaction when they are affected by each other. So we really pushed for this concept of fluids and how fluids interact with each other--how you can be a fluid and leave fluids behind you. And then we decided to push forward and say, 'Okay, what if our enemies are also made of fluids?'"</p><p dir="ltr">He continued: "And that's how the action of the game was created. We were not even seeing combat back then. We were thinking about the global systemic action where what we're trying to achieve is create systems that make the player feel smart. Basically you can anticipate which kind of fluids will react toward each other. Some are pretty easy--you can guess water and lava are going to solidify and create a rocky platform which you can jump on top of. So for combat, there is never one solution. [It's all about] systemic interaction--[what] can I create by combining fluids or by using fluids that are in their environment or [by] using my own fluids. And if you're smart, some combat [encounters] can be pretty easy. And at the end of the day, if you run out of fluids or you do not think of some smart interaction [that you can] do, you can always hack and slash with your spear."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529011-ss_f6c93bcd9b6a14164bc90575c5def2bfc1608b07.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529011" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529011-ss_f6c93bcd9b6a14164bc90575c5def2bfc1608b07.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529011"></a><figcaption>One transforms into a ball of steam if she touches lava while as a water droplet.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529011-ss_f6c93bcd9b6a14164bc90575c5def2bfc1608b07.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Generally, the reason people play TTRPGs is because it's a game system that allows you to have an urgency and an autonomy of choice that is [rarely] seen in any other games," Sechi said. "Especially [when there's] a dice system, [which can] go pretty crazy. And this feeling of freedom in a game system is something we love. And we tried to recreate [that feeling]."</p><p dir="ltr">From that TTRPG-inspired baseline, it was a hop, skip, and a jump for the New Tales team to seek input from other tabletop voices. Critical Role's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2233310/" rel="nofollow ">Matthew Mercer</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1154161/" rel="nofollow ">Laura Bailey</a> now voice major characters in the game, game master and actor Jasmine Bhullar (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4rYvwLCVUc">DesiQuest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul8iK77Cl-k">Coffin Run</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtLcWpD16Uo">Battle for Beyond</a>) joined the team as the writer (and voice of Rahne!), and actor Samantha Béart (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow/" data-ref-id="5000-569367">The Excavation of Hob's Barrow</a>) was cast as One. You may not roll dice or build decks in Fading Echo, but a lot of people who love tabletop roleplaying games have had a hand in shaping what this game is.</p><p dir="ltr">"We met Jasmine because we were all French peeps [and we knew we wanted Fading Echo] to be an Echoverse, [a] multiverse--it needs to talk to a large number of people," Obert said. "And then at the same time, we said, 'Okay, let's try to get some of the Critical Role peeps.' We harassed them every day. At some point, they agreed and probably said, 'Just stop contacting us.' [laughs] I'm joking. We were super lucky to get them. And Samantha--it was a super funny story when we met them in London. I think we were both trying to impress each other."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529012-ss_f1b5f2b25a41b8f1a827496c7fa128972ac55d31.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529012" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529012-ss_f1b5f2b25a41b8f1a827496c7fa128972ac55d31.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529012"></a><figcaption>She's just a little guy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529012-ss_f1b5f2b25a41b8f1a827496c7fa128972ac55d31.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Béart was cast as One, a would-be hero on a quest to discover who she is and how she might save her home, the floating islands of Corel. One can wield the power of water, summoning waves and creating thunderous effects. She can also transform into a cute water droplet-looking slime that can traverse tiny cavities, dive into water to slither beneath enemies or obstacles, and descend onto enemies with an explosive splash.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have actually played a bit of the game," Béart told me. "[New Tales has] given me a Steam key. [Which is] perfect. The worst thing [for an actor] is when [the game] comes out and you go, 'Oh, I would've done that so differently if I'd known that's what it would've played like.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Béart told me that having a chance to play the game and see One in action has already helped them better prepare for the role, pointing out the symbol on One's head matching her "face" when she's a water droplet. It was a detail that I didn't originally notice--it's small--but it unifies One's character. As a humanoid warrior, One is drawn with rigid angles and rough edges, akin to characters from US comic books back in the day. But as a droplet, she transitions art styles, gaining a rounder and more cutesy aesthetic that one might expect in a Japanese manga. I went into my conversation with Béart theorizing that both forms had radically different personalities or voices to bring attention to the two forms in one body. But Béart said that they reached a different conclusion after playing the game--those triangle symbols positioned like a smiling face exist in both of One's forms, representing a constant to characterize her.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529013-ss_1d47e385e3dc37d49eccbf15883ed5c67c5a050d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529013" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529013-ss_1d47e385e3dc37d49eccbf15883ed5c67c5a050d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529013"></a><figcaption>In other realities, One's appearance transforms.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529013-ss_1d47e385e3dc37d49eccbf15883ed5c67c5a050d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"That [expression/symbol] is obviously the core of who she is--that's what it says to me," Béart said. "[It is] lovely to play someone who isn't destruction and fire [in a] video game. As the protagonist, you tend to smash things up, but water is an element I've never explored in this medium, so that's really, really, really exciting to me to see what we can do with that exactly."</p><p dir="ltr">Béart has had a major impact in shaping One. The way they described building the character alongside the developers and being welcomed to interact with the team sounded closer to what's typically reserved to select actors in film or television or theater, not video games. "It is just nice to have that deep knowledge before you can even get started," Béart said. "There was no NDA [and I] still managed not to upset them by spilling a secret. Crazy, isn't it? You don't have to threaten us with a document. I was in the Discord. I can see what everyone's doing."</p><p dir="ltr">They continued: "It sort of reminds me of early days of Lucasfilm where they had everyone in this big warehouse and you could go over and see what props were doing and props could go and talk to the script writers and they could talk to the cinematographer and everyone was [working together]. It's true collaboration rather than the siloed way the games [industry] tends to work. I think it's a small miracle each game gets made. It's difficult, what [studios] are doing. And when the actor understands that, that really helps us in our relations to the developers."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529014-ss_6d30b0995a0d2fa310cdfc3ff425533587e3c614.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529014-ss_6d30b0995a0d2fa310cdfc3ff425533587e3c614.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529014"></a><figcaption>One's mana system is water.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529014-ss_6d30b0995a0d2fa310cdfc3ff425533587e3c614.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Comparing their time with the work they did for Karlach, Béart said, "[In] Baldur's Gate [3], [the actors] didn't technically meet until after the game, or if you came out for a break and bumped into each other. I haven't recorded [for Fading Echo] yet. So the plan is to have a table read with the others. So I imagine there'll be some chemistry tests and there might be some tweaking depending on how those are read, which is again, unheard of in video games--actually, I say that, but I think Blizzard actually does that. I think Blizzard are one of the few that actually do that. [New Tales] takes away some of the best of what they've experienced in this [industry]."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd like to see this more often in games, because we do it in film and TV and theater," Béart said. "Recently, in the marketing part of it, the actor has been a nice extra to have--something to plug in at the end as opposed to [being an] integral [part]. We're certainly an asset to your marketing campaign. Fans will connect with us. If [your game] is played for narrative, they will connect with the actors. It's kind of obvious. It's why film actors do junkets. But also they might be stuck with me for some time. They want to feel me out, see if I'm okay. [Which is] very smart. What if I turned out to be a nightmare or I was a bigot or otherwise my values don't line up with theirs? They'd be in real trouble."</p><p dir="ltr">And Béart very well could be attached to this team for a while. Though this outcome primarily rides on Fading Echo's reception and success, there seems to be an implication that this is merely the first game in series that will tackle a multiverse of locations. Within the narrative of Fading Echo, One exists in an Echoverse of realities, and you'll traverse a few of them in the game--as seen in the reveal trailer, One travels from her primarily desert reality to one that's entirely underwater at one point.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529015-ss_75f9c38ce293a13ef2e49ad04fc276e8e4250a96.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529015" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529015-ss_75f9c38ce293a13ef2e49ad04fc276e8e4250a96.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529015"></a><figcaption>One can leave a trail of fluid behind in her droplet form, like a slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529015-ss_75f9c38ce293a13ef2e49ad04fc276e8e4250a96.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Within the Echoverse, there are specific prime realities that act as starting points from which variable realities, known as mirrored realities or Shadows, can spawn. Corel is a prime reality that is rich in resources when it's first discovered, and since it is untouched, there are no variable realities to consider. House Kelevra sees this as an opportunity: They can shape Corel however they want, manipulating it to birth the type of realities that they want. As a result, Corel's various Shadows are reflections of House Kelevra's exploitation more than anything else, providing insight into the crimes and awful actions performed by One's house. As One goes on her journey, she is plunged into places that are familiar, but substantially different based on a twisted choice made by someone else.</p><p dir="ltr">Going to other universes and living foreign experiences is also part of why New Tales turned to Bhullar. "So I think [pulling from other industries] gives us some opportunities that we would never see or never think about [normally]," Obert said. "[We're a French studio] working with a writer born in the US who's an Indian person that lives in the US--they have a [different] way of building up a character or building story or writing dialogues [than we do]. We are not able to do that on our own--it's impossible. You need to have those diverse perspectives to do what you don't know, especially if you want to create a multiverse--you need as many people who think in different ways as possible."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529016-ss_468af35cfbcd364b7d8868cf185d2c00d6f002bb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529016" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529016-ss_468af35cfbcd364b7d8868cf185d2c00d6f002bb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529016"></a><figcaption>The pursuit of æther has damaged the world of Corel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4529016-ss_468af35cfbcd364b7d8868cf185d2c00d6f002bb.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">He continued: "We like the idea of having some people that come from the same craft but from a different industry and bring something very different. And Jasmine never worked on or wrote for a video game before. And I think she's bringing something super fresh and super new to it and getting a fresh vibe."</p><p dir="ltr">"Our composer didn't come from video games [and] our cinematic team don't come from video games, so it's a bit harder to integrate [their talents] at the beginning, but they bring creative DNA to our source that makes it unique and special," Sechi added. "It's enabling creativity and empowering innovation."</p><p dir="ltr">All of which is to say: Fading Echo sounds like it's going to be a pretty cool game, and I can't wait to try it out. The action-adventure game is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. No release window has been announced yet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Dungeons & Dragons VP of Franchise Announces Shift to New "Franchise Model"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-dungeons-dragons-vp-of-franchise-announces-shift-to-new-franchise-model</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-dungeons-dragons-vp-of-franchise-announces-shift-to-new-franchise-model.1239612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> VP. Dan Ayoub has replaced Jess Lanzillo as the VP of Franchise for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG. With this change in management comes a new shift in business, specifically to a "franchise model."</p>



<p>Dan Ayoub announced his new position as&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> VP via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348517655173054464/" rel="nofollow">a LinkedIn</a> post. In the post, Ayoub expresses his love and passion for Wizards of the Coast's enduring fantasy franchise, mentioning he's been playing since he was 12 years old. The second half of the post explains that the internal structure of <em>D&amp;D</em> will shift into what he refers to as a "full franchise model."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-vp-dan-ayoub-profile-image.jpg?itok=eacmBhcw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-vp-dan-ayoub-profile-image.jpg?itok=akipliRX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What this means is all products and projects —books, video games, TV shows, films, etc. — that touch on the world and setting of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> will now be handled under one roof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The impact here cannot be overstated; this is massive for D&amp;D and will allow a strong, coordinated, and well-funded approach for the franchise, and most importantly, for us, the fans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that, thanks to some digging by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/dungeons-dragons-shifts-to-franchise-model-dan-ayoub-named-as-head.714236/" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, Ayoub's experience comes from the videogame industry. He has spent 11 years at Microsoft, notably as Studio Head and Executive Producer of 343 Industries. This means he had a noticeable influence on the post-Bungie era of<em> Halo</em>. In addition, he has been an executive producer at Ubisoft and as a Game Director for Disney.</p>

<p>Regardless of the state of those institutions under Ayoub, it is difficult to tell how the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> VP's franchise model will affect things going forward. Part of the longevity of <em>D&amp;D</em> has come from it being such large, recognizable, malleable franchise in its current form.</p>

<p>On the consumer-facing side, there is already a plethora of different <em>D&amp;D</em> products available. The critically acclaimed video game of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>. The entertaining <em>D&amp;D</em> movie, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Honor Among Thieves</em></a>.&nbsp;There are even new novels being published like <em>Ravenloft: Heir of Strahd</em>. As such, this model change may not be too noticeable.</p>

<p>As for the business side of things, it does mark a considerable shift in attitude by WIzards of the Coast. Considering Ayoub is filling in a gap of high-profile departures from the company, which include Lanzillo, Todd Kenrick, and lead designers <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-welcomes-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-darrington-press" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christopher Perkins and Jeremy Crawford</a>, this change in direction may potentially be a means to consolidate their workforce from different departments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Y'know, if you're okay breaking the game</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're familiar with some of the glitches possible in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, then you're probably already aware of 'MsgNotFound'. It's essentially the Master Sword from the prologue section of the game, and it's quite possibly the best unbreakable weapon you can get.</p>
<p><em>If</em> you can get it, mind. And now, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrkuO5Y-Z2I">Gaming Reinvented</a>, it's easier than ever. You'll need a copy of Tears of the Kingdom: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition first and foremost, since you'll need to make use of the Zelda Notes app. Here's a look at all of the prerequisites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- The Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom<br>
- Nintendo Switch App with Zelda Notes<br>
- Autobuild (can be obtained before the first Kohga battle)<br>
- At least one weapon you don’t mind losing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you're sorted, be sure to check out Gaming Reinvented's video for the full step-by-step guide (plus the <a href="https://gamingreinvented.com/walkthrough/how-to-easily-keep-the-msgnotfound/">site page</a> for the relevant Zelda Notes QR code). There's also a bit more information available if you'd like to Fuse the weapon and make it even more powerful.</p>
<p>So if you're okay with essentially breaking the game and nabbing a weapon that really ain't meant to be there, then do give this a try. Chances are Nintendo will probably patch it out soon, anyway.</p>

While we didn’t get a crossover with the two heroes in the first season of the Disney+ limited series, we did recently get a nearly 14-minute conversation between Robert Downey Jr. and the show’s star, Dominique Thorne, in which the former gushed over how the show’s first episode managed to fit a Marvel movie’s worth of world-building into just 45 minutes.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197583" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ironheart's New Trailer Delivers A Couple Cool Surprises" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="136" data-playlist="197583,197589,197586" data-current="197583"><div><p>Ironheart's New Trailer Delivers A Couple Cool Surprises</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197583/197583_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23104.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If anyone knows what goes into a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-5-marvel-comics-1851785555&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-5-marvel-comics-1851785555">Marvel film</a></span>, it’s the man who has appeared in 10 MCU flicks. Speaking about the <em>Ironheart</em> series premiere, Downey praised the episode’s ability to introduce a new character in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ironheart-riri-williams-breaking-bad-walter-white-1851784602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ironheart-riri-williams-breaking-bad-walter-white-1851784602">Riri Williams</a></span> while quickly establishing the impetus of her journey, developing the supporting cast, and complicating the show’s emotional core by giving her a dead friend as her AI sidekick. To the most important actor in the history of the MCU, Thorne ran “the whole gamut of an MCU film in 40 minutes.”</p><p>He’s not wrong. What made <em>Ironheart</em> one of my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/andor-severance-black-mirror-daredevil-best-tv-shows-1851779606&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/andor-severance-black-mirror-daredevil-best-tv-shows-1851779606">favorite shows of 2025</a></span> is how ambitious the storytelling was from the very start. In the first episode alone, the show explores the world’s obsession with iron suits after Tony Stark’s death, centers the Iron Man legacy on intelligence rather than money by having Riri build a suit out of scrap metal, and uses childhood trauma to justify the creation of her AI assistant. Each of those story beats could’ve been entire episodes on lesser Marvel series.</p><p>Beyond his love of the show’s storytelling, Downey also explained how Tony Stark and Riri Williams are “twin flames.” It all begins with the heart. Tony Stark’s journey starts in <em>Iron Man</em> after one of his weapons explodes and a piece of shrapnel gets dangerously close to his heart. That injury—and Ho Yinsen (Shaun Toub) using an electromagnet to keep the shrapnel from reaching his heart—inspires the creation of the arc reactor, Stark’s most important invention. Riri’s heart is physically intact when her <em>Ironheart</em> journey begins, but Downey sees a philosophical connection between their origin stories.</p><p>“In this iteration, the heart is not only [about] going home, but also this disparity and inequity, and knowing she can only do as much as she can do.”</p><p>When this video was shot, he’d only watched the first three episodes of the show and he hints at a second conversation between the two that will take place after he finishes the series. Let’s all hope we get more intergenerational chats to push the superhero genre forward.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-ironheart-iron-man-mcu-disney-plus-1851785928]]></content:encoded>

                <p>We already knew that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Blitz Royale <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-looks-like-fortnite-blitz-royale-is-sticking-around/1100-6532735/" data-ref-id="1100-6532735">will be sticking around</a> past its previously announced expiration date, but it turns out that extension will bring some big changes, too. Like how, starting next week, the tiny Blitz island will be the new home of Mega City, that skyscraper-filled town that sat at the center of Fortnite's Battle Royale island for most of Chapter 4. Blitz Royale's first big update will happen on July 15. Mega City will reportedly take over the spot <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1942978180891189610" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">where Retail Row currently sits</a>.</p><p>So Epic isn't just extending Blitz Royale as is--instead, it's continuing as it has been with a new set of themed loot pools, with a continued focus on collaboration items, like this week's TMNT melee-fest. While the teaser refers to the collabs as a "surprise," <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1942947410650575314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leakers believe</a> three of the weeks will center on Jujutsu Kaisen, Dragon Ball, and Mortal Kombat. Blitz will also clearly incorporate other weapons from standard Battle Royale as well, like the gloves that shoot birds that were introduced earlier this season.</p><p>Blitz Royale, with its focus on fast matchmaking and creating an experience that's palatable for mobile players, was immediately a hit when it launched in the middle of June, briefly serving as Fortnite's most popular mode. Player counts have fallen off somewhat since then, but Blitz still stands solidly in third place behind Battle Royale/Zero Build and Reload. And it's <em>well</em> ahead of the fourth place Fortnite OG. So it's no surprise at all that Epic would want to keep Blitz Royale going.</p><p>Before we dive into this updated version of Blitz, however--the new Superman skin, available on the current battle pass, will finally be earnable starting on Friday.
