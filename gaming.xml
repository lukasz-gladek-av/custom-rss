			<p>The Epic Games Store <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year in Review</a> is now available, which provides a look back at 2024, as well as sharing what's to come this year, including some of the most anticipated features of the store and some massive releases. While there are a fair amount of PC gamers who don't favor the Epic Games Store, the community has continued to grow, with there being more than 295 million PC users (up by 25 million from 2023) and a total of 898 million Epic cross-platform accounts (up by 94 million from 2023.)</p>
<p>Additionally, players are engaging more with games than ever before, with the grand total being amassed to 2.68 billion hours of playtime with third-party games in 2024. With the use of Self-Publishing Tools and opt-in programs being available to up-and-coming developers, the Epic Games Store saw the catalog expand by a whopping 1,100 new games. Even for those who don't want to purchase games, the free games program provides a lot of new and fun titles for those who add them to their library, spanning from triple-A titles to hidden indie gems.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>December was a significant month for the storefront, with there being 74 MAU (Monthly Active Users) in December 2024, which was likely boosted thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-winter-sale-live-now-massive-discounts-for-many-great-games/">holiday sales</a> and the free games that were given away to celebrate the festive season. In total, Epic Games offered 89 free games over the span of 2024, with 595 million free games being claimed by Epic Games Store users. This led to a total value of $2,229 per player, with a 76% average score across all free games provided.</p>
<p>As Epic Games continues to grow and flourish, it has been confirmed that the Free Games Program will continue to run and will now continue on both PC and mobile, allowing players to experience games on handheld devices that they previously wouldn't be able to access.</p>
<p>While most PC gamers purchase their desired titles on Steam, $1.09 billion was spent by PC players in the Epic Games Store, with $255 million spent by players on third-party PC games that were available in the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Looking into 2025, Epic Games Store has some major plans for the year ahead. This includes focusing on the Epic Games Store Mobile App, which will allow for an enhanced App Library and Discover Experience with an ever-increasing catalog size. For the developers, there will be AAB file type support.</p>
<p>Additionally, as the storefront has continued to nurture new developers and help them publish games on the app, the store will also add mobile self-publishing tools, which are currently available on an invite-only beta.</p>
<p>There will be some major games coming to the Epic Games Store this year too, including Splitgate 2, 33 Immortals, Killing Floor 3, Borderlands 4 and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/make-a-splitscreen-only-splinter-cell-demands-hazelight-boss-even-as-ubisoft-double-down-on-open-worlds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hazelight founder Josef Fares has called upon Ubisoft to make a splitscreen-only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> game - a move that even I, with my absolute lack of business acumen, recognise as being comparable to demanding that Cadbury start making chocolate bars out of soot. He thinks it would be a "guaranteed success".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm not saying I dislike the idea of splitscreen Splinter Cell. Ubisoft's ancient military stealth series has decent form for co-op sneakery, with players of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory teaming up to synchro-stab the soldiery. But come now, Master Fares. I know you've got to uphold your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-takes-two-devs-are-making-a-new-co-op-game-called-split-fiction-coming-march-2025">reputation for slashing up displays</a> but please, have some dignity. Imagine the grim faces of the Splinter Cell faithful when Yves Guillemot rolls out footage of a splitscreen-<em>only</em> iteration, 12 years since the last one. Imagine the dozens of green laser dots slowly appearing on Guillemot's face. Imagine the glisten of a thousand karambits being drawn from utility belts.</p>
<p>"Other publishers aren't doing this, and it's crazy to me," Fares commented in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-director-josef-fares-says-ubisoft-is-struggling-and-should-make-a-co-op-splinter-cell-game-dont-chicken-out-to-do-single-player-just-say-this-is-split-screen-only/">GamesRadar</a>. "So many people are playing these games, and people love them. I mean, I'm looking at Ubisoft, and they're struggling now, and I hope someone [from there] listens to this interview, but why aren't they taking Sam Fisher and doing a split-screen-only game?</p>
<p>"Don't chicken out to do single-player; just say this is split-screen only," he went on. "Boom, that's it. You have success, and I can guarantee you that they will sell a huge amount of copies of that. Yeah, they don't even have to do it the Hazelight way; why don't they listen to this [interview] and be like, 'Oh, he's right.' That's a guaranteed success for them; it's for you, Ubisoft. You can get it for free from me."</p>
<p>It occurs to me that it's been such an age between Cells that some of you probably don't know or can't recall the premise of Splinter Cell. Here is a quick recap: there is a grumpy man in black pyjamas called Sam Fisher, with three green torches stuck to his head. Sam's job is to creep into places, stick knives and silenced bullets in terrorists, do the splits over hallways, and maybe hack a computer or deactivate a bomb. You'd think the terrorists would see Sam coming, given that he dresses like a broken traffic light, but somehow he always gets away with it, the scamp. Also he's voiced by Michael Ironside, who sounds like a sexy chainsaw.</p>
<p>Ubisoft have been working on a Splinter Cell reboot since 2021 - "rewriting and updating" the story for new players, as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-be-rewriting-and-updating-the-story-for-todays-players">job posting put it in 2022</a>.  We've heard zilch of substance since, and Ubisoft's recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">mass layoffs</a> suggest that they're in no mood to release anything as specific in its appeal as a stealth game. Let alone a stealth game that can only be played by two people sitting on the same sofa - as if sofas even exist any longer, in these days of live servicing.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ubisoft have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-says-the-plan-is-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games-year-after-year/">literally just told their investors</a> that they'll be doubling down on two "verticals" going forward: more of those online game-as-a-service things, and open-world action-adventures. Still, perhaps Yves Guillemot will find time amid efforts to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-march-as-ubisofts-board-consider-a-company-sale">sell the company</a> to infiltrate Hazelight's offices and empty a bin over Josef Fares's head.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Of course Zelnick couldn’t talk specifically about <em>GTA 6</em>'s online multiplayer—which has yet to be revealed by Rockstar—but he did cite an old NBA game as example of how Take-Two has a track record of supporting games that people are still playing. </p><p>“I’m going to speak theoretically only because I’m not going to talk about a particular project when an announcement hasn’t been made. But generally speaking, we support our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles,” said Zelnick. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>As an example, we launched<em> NBA 2K Online</em> in China, I think originally in 2012 if I’m not mistaken. And then we launched<em> NBA 2K Online 2</em> in China in 2017. If I’m not mistaken. We did not sunset <em>Online</em>. They both are still in the market and they serve consumers and they’re alive and we have this massive audience.</p></blockquote><p>Zelnick continued, “So we’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”</p><p>While the Take-Two boss didn’t outright say “<em>GTA Online</em> will keep getting updates after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span> launches,” it’s pretty clear what he’s suggesting here. If <em>GTA Online</em> has a large enough audience still playing, the game will likely get more updates. I do wonder how Rockstar North—the main studio behind <em>GTA</em>—would balance that with supporting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span><em> </em>and any online modes it might include. Would Rockstar tap other parts of the company to support <em>GTA Online</em>, or maybe even an outside studio to take over maintaining and updating the aging crime MMO? <em>GTA Online </em>still makes a lot of money, and Take-Two ain’t going to walk away from hundreds of millions of dollars. </p><p>As for <em>GTA 6</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">earlier this month Zelnick seemed very confident</a></span> that the next title in the series will launch in fall 2025, telling <em>IGN</em>: “Look, there’s always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like ‘absolutely,’ you jinx things. So we feel really good about it.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-wasn%E2%80%99t-at-state-of-play.1109814/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PlayStation State of Play from February 12 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">littered with announcements and trailers</a>, but nothing from Bungie about their upcoming PVP extraction shooter, Marathon. Marathon was one of a few prolific titles that weren’t featured, leaving fans confused as to why Bungie’s first big project post-Destiny wasn’t shown.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-was-marathon-not-at-state-of-play">Why Was Marathon Not At State of Play?</h2>



<p>According to Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb, Marathon wasn’t shown because Bungie is probably going to hold their own showcase event for it, likely in April of this year. During yesterday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72WmrtMEfm8&amp;t=1980s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Mess Decides show</a>, Grubb said that this decision falls right into the Bungie playbook.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Marathon wasn’t here because they’re probably going to do their own thing. Bungie does their own thing usually for Destiny. They’re going to adopt that same ‘we’re going to talk to our audience’ strategy this year as well. I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new Marathon game, not to be confused with the older Marathon trilogy from made by Bungie in the 1990s, was revealed in 2023. Considering the success Bungie has found with Halo and Destiny, and given their recent acquisition by PlayStation, expectations for Marathon are quite high.</p>



<p>Marathon is already going through the ringer during its development process. In 2024, the game’s director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly fired due to inappropriate conduct</a> towards several female employees. Barrett has denied these claims and has since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-denies-conduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against Bungie. The last official update regarding the game itself came <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this past October</a>, from new game director and former director for VALORANT, Joe Ziegler. Ziegler says there have been some “aggressive” changes to gameplay over the past couple years following several playtests. He also said that different parts of the game are at different stages of development.</p>



<p>Can Bungie’s Marathon live up to the hype? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon.1133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

As mentioned above, this is a remake of the PS2 game Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, which is arguably the best game in the franchise. It's a Cold War-era prequel that explains how Big Boss earned his title and reputation as a legendary soldier, and it includes numerous enhancements. </p>                      </div><p>While the story and setting are the same as the PS2 original, Snake Eater now sports an Unreal Engine 5 makeover and nearly every animation in the game has been completely overhauled. Konami says it only modernized gameplay elements where it made sense to do so, and you can choose to play it with the original control scheme or a modernized version instead.</p><p>This approach extends to an over-the-shoulder third-person viewpoint in New Style and a top-down viewpoint in Legacy Style that Metal Gear Solid purists will appreciate. Another neat quality-of-life upgrade is a quick-select menu to make changing your camouflage simpler.</p><p>Metal Gear Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will also be available for Xbox Series X|S and PS5, and on the Sony platform, you can expect a smooth and enhanced performance if you own a PS5 Pro console.</p><p>For more details on console preorders, you can check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorders-now-live/1100-6524133/">Metal Gear Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater preorder guide</a>.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-up-to-20-on-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorders-for-pc/1100-6529515/">Save Up To $20 On Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Preorders For PC</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-buy-one-get-one-half-off-movie-tv-shows-blu-ray-amazon-february-2025/1100-6529351/">Amazon Kicks Off B1G1 50% Off Movie And TV Series Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more/1100-6529304/">PS5 Accessory Sale - How To Save 20% On PlayStation Portal, Helldivers 2 DualSense Controller, And More</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-preorder-deals-collectors-edition-amazon/1100-6526606/">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii Collector's Edition In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-sid-meiers-civilization-7-preorders-for-pc-mac-early-access-starts-february-6/1100-6525971/">Save On Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Preorders For PC &amp; Mac - Early Access Starts February 6</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-airpods-4-discounted-to-only-100-at-amazon/1100-6526375/">Apple AirPods 4 Discounted To Only $100 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-riffmaster-guitar-controller-gets-biggest-discount-yet/1100-6528970/">Fortnite Festival Riffmaster Guitar Controller Gets Biggest Discount Yet</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-preorders-where-to-get-steelbook-edition-and-best-deals/1100-6526687/">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorders - Where To Get Steelbook Edition And Best Deals</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Everyone in the gaming world is waiting for GTA 6 with bated breath, and there's one question that many are wondering about: Just what exactly is going to happen to the game we currently know as GTA Online when GTA 6 releases? While we still don't have the answer, in a recent interview, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick hinted that the current GTA Online could continue after GTA 6 releases as a "legacy title."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, Zelnick said that the publisher has a history of "support[ing] our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles." He cites the 2012 example of NBA 2K Online in China, noting that the original game is still online and on the market, even after the release of NBA 2K Online 2 in 2017. "...We've shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Zelnick was quick to clarify that he was speaking "theoretically," and that an announcement will be made in the future. However, this appears to be an important indication as to what Take-Two's future plans might be. GTA Online is a huge moneymaker for Rockstar and Take-Two in general, but it's been widely speculated by many that GTA 6 will bring a new version of GTA Online along with it. It's unclear how exactly this hypothetical new GTA Online would interface with the old GTA Online, particularly when you consider the amount of resources that some players have put into the game. Fans still don't have the clarification they seek, but this might mean they can rest a bit easier.</p><p dir="ltr">We still don't know <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/">GTA 6's release date</a>, but Take-Two has said multiple times that it'll release in Fall 2025. Zelnick said in another interview back in late 2024 that Borderlands 4 and GTA 6 will probably not be released close to one another--Borderlands 4 releases on September 23, which might indicate that GTA 6 will come later in the year, assuming it doesn't slip to 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Epic Games Store Year in Review for 2024 is here, and according to Epic, PC gamers spent a pretty impressive amount of money in the store last year, although there could well be a very good reason for that.</p>

<p>Epic says that PC players racked up $1.09 billion in spending on the Store throughout 2024, but that figure is "including Epic's games", so it's likely that the number includes spending for battle royale juggernaut&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</p>

<p>The figure represents a 15% increase on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2023" rel="nofollow">last year's</a>, but if the number is restricted to just third-party games, it's much lower; just $255m was spent on third-party PC games in the store in 2024, representing an 18% drop from 2023's total.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review-fortnite.jpg?itok=t9JYXZb0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review-fortnite.jpg?itok=L_Y9J8AM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>PC spending on the Epic Games Store jumped to over $1b in 2024, but that probably includes&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere, Epic hit a new high of 295 million total Epic Games Store PC users last year, representing a 25 million increase on a year-over-year basis.</p>

<p>However, the highest monthly active user total on the platform was 74 million, which Epic achieved in December 2024. That represents a drop of 1% over last year's peak figure, although I'm sure Epic won't be losing sleep over that.</p>

<p>Average monthly active users rose by 6%, as did average daily active users, and the total number of hours players spent playing games on the store was 7.72 billion, a rise of 10% over last year's figure.</p>

<p>Epic's free game program also continued throughout 2024, bringing games like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hell-let-loose-epic-games-store-free" rel="nofollow">Hell Let Loose</a>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free" rel="nofollow">Sifu</a>&nbsp;</em>to players for absolutely nothing. All in all, players redeemed almost 600 million free games via the store in 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review-sifu.jpg?itok=N6yros06 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review-sifu.jpg?itok=42HgObl2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>was just one of the free games available via the Epic Games Store last year.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what were the most-played Epic Store games in 2024? As ever, Epic divides its hall of fame into three separate tiers: Mythic, Legendary, and Epic. Here they are in all their glory!</p>

<p>The first Elden Ring Nightreign network test session has come and gone, and it resulted in for frustration than fun for many users. Due to what FromSoftware called “congestion”, many couldn’t take part in the first session</p>



<p>The issues ultimately led to the PlayStation Servers going down for maintenance during the test. Afterwards, FromSoftware took to social media to apologize for the issues.</p>



<p>“We apologize for the inconvenience caused by the game server issues,” the <a href="https://xcancel.com/ELDENRING/status/1890404327560208502#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a> said. “Work is currently ongoing to improve the stability of the Network Test.”</p>



<p>The developer then added that they are considering an extra test session to make up for the problems with the initial run. As of publishing, there are still four more Elden Ring Nightreign Network Test sessions scheduled for the weekend. </p>



<p>Those times are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>February 14: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li>



<li>February 15: 11am-2pm PT / 2pm-5pm ET</li>



<li>February 16: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li>



<li>February 16: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li>
</ul>

A now-deleted Steam page mentioned additional DLC, confirming Elden Ring Nightreign will get additional boss and characters post-launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, a line on Elden Ring Nightreign's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam page</a> read: "Additional DLC — Additional playable characters and bosses." It's since been removed, and there's always the slim chance this was added in error, but it more than likely confirms Elden Ring Nightreign will be getting more content down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this particular version of Elden Ring is a bit more online and live service, it's not a surprising note. Elden Ring Nightreign <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-a-standalone-co-op-spin-off-the-game-awards-2024">is a standalone game</a>, and developer FromSoftware has been pretty consistent with producing DLC for its previous games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If more bosses are in the works, hopes would presumably be high for returning fights from previous games. Elden Ring Nightreign <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-features-bosses-from-dark-souls">already has a few enemies from previous FromSoftware games</a>, like the Nameless King.

Nothing's set in stone yet, but given FromSoftware's portfolio of bosses, it's hard not to start picking out some dream matches. And that's not even digging into the possibilities for new characters to play as, fighting against said bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Elden Ring Nightreign itself, the network test is underway today, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-network-test-plagued-by-server-issues-fromsoftware-issues-apology">though not without some network hitches</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-capcom-hideki-kamiya-and-machine-head-discuss-hotly-anticipated-sequel-in-exclusive-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">20 years after the release of the original Ōkami, the great god Amaterasu, origin of all that is good and mother to us all, is making a triumphant and unexpected return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced at The Game Awards last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-unveiled-at-the-game-awards-2024">a sequel to Ōkami is in development</a>. Hideki Kamiya, newly separated from Platinum Games, has formed his own new studio, Clovers, and taken the directing helm. He does this with the blessing of IP owner Capcom, which is serving as publisher, and with the support of Machine Head Works, a new-ish studio staffed by Capcom veterans that's already supported several recent Capcom titles, including the Ōkami HD remake. Everything we've seen so far speaks to an all-star line-up of talent, mixing both new developers with veterans of the original Ōkami committed to seeing their original vision bloom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But aside from a fairly emotional teaser and the names behind the Ōkami sequel, we've been somewhat short on details regarding what exactly to expect. Is it a direct sequel, or something else? Whose idea was it, and how did the project get off the ground after all these years? <em>Was</em> that Amaterasu in the trailer, or a lookalike wolf?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recently, IGN had the opportunity to get some answers. Though the Ōkami sequel is still very, <em>very</em> early in development, we visited director Hideki Kamiya, Capcom producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, and Machine Head Works producer Kiyohiko Sakata at their home base in Osaka, Japan. In a two-hour interview, we asked them all we could about Ōkami, the sequel, their partnership, and their respective studios.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/14/img-1581-1739533440112.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">L-R: Kiyohiko Sakata, Hideki Kamiya, Yoshiaki Hirabayashi. Image credit: IGN. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the full Q&amp;A of that interview, which has been lightly edited for clarity:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Kamiya-san, you've talked before about why you left PlatinumGames. You said you were feeling it was going in a different direction from your beliefs as a developer. And you said you wanted to make games that only Hideki Kamiya could make. What beliefs about developing games are important to you and how do you expect them to shape Clovers'?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hideki Kamiya:</strong> It’s a tricky question. In 2023, September, I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideki-kamiya-on-why-he-left-platinumgames-his-youtube-channel-and-his-next-game">announced after about 16 years in Platinum that I was leaving.</a> The main reason that I can give was that as I was in Platinum, I wanted to keep going, but I felt that things were moving in a way that I didn't want it to. But I can't of course go into details. But I can say for game creation itself, the personality of the game creators is very important and also affects the experience that users feel. And so that's why the kind of development that I was aiming for in Platinum felt differently than what I was aiming for. And so I wanted to go somewhere where I could do what he wanted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And from there on out I created Clovers, which wasn't something that I thought of before leaving Platinum, but after. And so I left Platinum and I got to talking to the people around me, people I knew, and I realized that I wanted to create this game development environment where I could achieve what I wanted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What defines a Hideki Kamiya game? If I didn't know you had developed something, how would I look at that game and say, "Ah yes, Hideki Kamiya made this?"</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> So what is a Hideki Kamiya game? That is not something that I really feel that needs to be said throughout all of my games that I create. ‘This is a Kamiya game.’ It's not necessary to have that conveyed. I'd rather something that I put effort into is to have the game be unique. So creating a unique experience that the users haven't felt before. A unique way of enjoying the game is something that I put effort into during the dev process. And this is something that I work hard to convey to users that enjoy my games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What is the connection between Clovers and Clover Studio, if any? Does the clover, the plant, have a special meaning to you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>So the company name Clovers is something that I wanted to continue on using. Back when I was at Clover, it's something that I was proud of and wanted to keep on moving on. The name comes from, of course, when Clover was the fourth division of development under Capcom. Of course, the clover leaf is four leaves and that represents the Capcom fourth division of development, and it's still something that I want to keep going with. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/10/03-clovers-logo-cpv-1734345911794-1739219291848.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Clovers studio logo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And actually with the name Clover, another way of saying it is C-lover. And the C represents creativity, which the Clovers studio cherishes and we all love creativity. And so we have C [in our logo] four times because it's a clover with four leaves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obviously Capcom is very heavily involved in this. But it sounds like you were thinking about a close relationship with Capcom, maybe even before Ōkami came into the picture when you were first starting Clovers. Is the idea behind the studio Clovers that you will keep that very close relationship with Capcom?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoshiaki Hirabayashi:</strong> So answering from the Capcom side for this question. So of course we have Kamiya, the director, being the original director of Ōkami. And then from the Capcom side, we always wanted to create an Ōkami sequel at some point because Ōkami, the IP, was something that we all love and we wanted to see it continued. And that's something that [Capcom producer Jun] Takeuchi also felt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, when we all heard the news that Kamiya left his previous company is when we actually began the talks of this project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tell me the story of how this came about. Why Ōkami? Why now? How did this pitch happen? Who convinced who?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>So this falls back a bit to the answer we gave to the previous question. But for Capcom, we were always looking for the opportunity to create new Ōkami. Of course, for such a project, we needed various preparations to be able to make sure that this all comes true. We needed to have certain key people in place. So if you're looking for a concrete reason, we were always looking for the opportunity and the opportunity came to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>For me, I always wanted to create an Ōkami sequel. Thinking back to about 19 years ago when I first created the game, you have to remember that the story itself isn't really complete, and I always wanted to complete this game. But of course, as I was in Platinum, I couldn't do that. But even back then, I was often meeting with my friends, specifically with Takeuchi, and going out drinking. And we always talked casually about one day being able to do it. Then I ended up leaving Platinum. So now as a creator, I'll be able to actually make this come true now with Takeuchi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kiyohiko Sakata</strong>: So originally, as a Clover Studio person, of course Ōkami was a really important IP for me. And everyone from Clover really thought this. However this time, not precisely from a business perspective, but we all still thought that because all the stars were aligned that this was the best timing for us to move forward with this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I think that maybe a lot of our readers aren't as familiar with Machine Head Works. So would you be willing to introduce it a little bit and tell people about what it is, and what you do, and how you're involved?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sakata: </strong>So Machine Head Works is a very recently created company. I originally based it on M-Two, a company that works very closely with Capcom, working towards branding for users to have our games more known. And that's why Machine Head Works was created.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But before that it originated from Capcom Division Four. So the same roots as Kamiya had. Yes, those were the same. And we were all sort of kids under Mikami.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The way that Machine Head Works is involved now, working together with Capcom and Clovers, is that of course we have Capcom as the major IP holder of Ōkami, deciding the major direction of the games. And we have Clovers as this development lead for this project. Machine Head Works comes in by having the experience of both working with Capcom previously on several titles, so we know what Capcom needs to create the game. That's something that Machine Head Works has the experience and knowledge of. We also have the experience of working with Kamiya-san before as well. So we have both experience of Capcom and Clovers, and we're acting sort of like a bridge between Clovers and Capcom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to this, we also have the experience of working with the game engine that we are using for this project, RE Engine. So Clovers' developers haven't had any experiences with using this engine, but Machine Head Works have experience of using it. So we're aiding them. Also under us, Machine Head Works, we have people who have actually had experience of working with the original Ōkami game and also will be aiding us with the development of this title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>We have Sakata-san and his team, and they actually helped us as well for the PS4 port of Ōkami. So we're having them with that experience. PS4, the Xbox One, and the Switch version. Of course, they've also helped us with even later titles such as Resident Evil 3 and Resident Evil 4, more recent RE Engine games, that they've helped us work with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Why RE Engine? Are there things that you can do with that that will be specifically helpful to the kinds of things you want to do with the Ōkami sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">[There is a long pause.]</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi:</strong> Yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[Everyone laughs.]</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi:</strong> Yes. However, of course we cannot go into much detail at this point in time. But we from Capcom, we believe that without RE Engine at this point we wouldn't be able to realize Kamiya-san's artistic dreams for this project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> So RE Engine is of course famous for showing the best of the games that they have. Very, very good expressively. And so we believe people are also expecting and awaiting the RE Engine level of quality now for this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I want to go back to something you said earlier. You said that Capcom has wanted to do an Ōkami sequel for a very long time. I think some people might actually find that surprising because it seems that people generally understand that at the time that Ōkami came out it was seen as </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideki-kamiya-and-ikumi-nakamura-discuss-okamis-development-brilliance-and-its-many-challenges">maybe not doing as well commercially as you might've wanted it to</a><strong>. And so, I'm curious why Ōkami has always been so special and has been something that Capcom has been thinking about for this long?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi:</strong> So we believe that there are plenty, plenty of Ōkami fans out there within Capcom fans. If you look back, the PS2 game for Ōkami came out almost 20 years ago now, and not going into the concrete sales numbers, there are millions of fans out there that we know. Just go ahead and look into <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/salesdata.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our IR page for Capcom for the million sales titles</a> and you'll find Ōkami listed under there. So we believe that we have a game that people are awaiting, and we want to create this game for them. Of course, it took a bit of time for all of the stars to align for us to be able to realize this project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> So in the beginning for Clover, we perhaps saw that from a development perspective that it might not reach users in such a wide area as we were planning. But moving on throughout the years, we released later versions that people enjoyed. Since then, we’ve received messages on social media of people enjoying the game, and we're realizing that people are liking Ōkami a lot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now with the announcement at TGA, being there live within the audience and hearing people react there, and not only that, but also seeing people reacting on social channels after, there are so many people waiting for this title. And I was very surprised and happier than I thought I would be to hear people so looking forward to this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even now, I look up the YouTube reactions to the announcements and looking at the people reacting to the video, and I find myself crying with the fans. And I'm just so happy to see that, oh, people are so happy to see this game come true.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>So coming from my perspective, from the Capcom perspective of this, I know specifically that people are still enjoying this game, just from the numbers. Normally when we look at games, the sales sort of slow down and they decrease steadily. Sometimes they jump up and down, but normally they go down. But for Ōkami, we see that it's been a steady stream of people always enjoying the game. So in that way Ōkami is a very, very unique IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>Going back a little bit, but why Ōkami now? Of course leaving Platinum, talking to Capcom, it was an important step in all this. But more than that, just hearing all the cheers from the fans pushed me. Going back to PS2, PS3, PS4, Switch, and then the later versions of the games, we can always see that there's always merch going out there that the fans like. You can always see the love of the IP is something that's still spreading amongst fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, with everyone cheering on and our desire to create, it was that that led us to the actualization of this project. So without everyone's voices out there, without everyone cheering us on, we wouldn't have moved forward with this. So thank you so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've really assembled what seems to be quite the dream team here of people who just have the perfect set of skills and familiarity to work on this game, specifically. Are there plans to get any of the other former Clover people involved? I read recently, Kamiya-san, there was a former Platinum directors' drinking party of some sort? I don't know, were you planning on getting people like [Shinji] Mikami, or [Abebe] Tinari, or [Takahisa] Taura, or any of those people involved in this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>Sakata-san said before, but there are several people who were involved in the original Ōkami  project that are involved [in the sequel] via Machine Head Works. Of course, we're not going to mention any names here now, but there are people who are involved with Ōkami. And the other thing that's tricky to say or describe properly, but I believe that the team now is even more powered up than it was for the original game. Of course the team back then put their hearts into creating the original Ōkami, but now things have modernized. And we've been able to gather several more skilled people now that we all know that's also leaving Platinum as well. And so I believe now that we have more of a skilled team and more powered up team than we had before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya-san, you said something about that in that </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideki-kamiya-and-ikumi-nakamura-discuss-okamis-development-brilliance-and-its-many-challenges">interview you did with Ikumi Nakamura</a><strong> about wishing you had had a stronger team the first time around. It sounds like you've addressed that.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> Yes, of course you saw her channel and saw the video where we talked about this. And I wasn't really planning on diving into that with this subject here. But I mentioned there were a few points that I thought we could have done better with the team back then. Of course, development never goes as you plan it to be, things go wrong, but you always have to cover and fix things as you move along. So there are no guarantees even if we have the stronger team, but I believe that as we have a stronger team now, that there's a higher chance we can succeed. And we have so many good people gathered that we can create a great team now, but I'm always open to accepting more great people into the team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi:</strong> So there's three different routes you can choose to enter this project this time. Feel free to pick one of the three routes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Did any of you replay the first Ōkami sometime recently around the announcement?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>Unfortunately, I haven't really had the time to play the game recently, but I did look over the DVD that came with the artbooks and so on that had all the cut things all lined together. And so, that's what I've been checking out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>I didn't know that DVD really existed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sakata:</strong> I haven't played it myself, but the Switch version, my daughter played it recently. And she was in elementary back then, around fourth or fifth year then, and she didn't really play a lot of games. And because the format is a bit old, usually she doesn’t know where to go and what to do in those games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Ōkami is good with leading you and showing you what to do and where to go. So, that's why I think it's a really great game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>So, same for me as well, the Switch version, once it was done, my daughter, I mean she was a bit younger so she didn't clear the game, but she always talked about playing the flower blooming game. And myself, I thought of it as a game where I’d take down the evil spirits and so on, but she saw it as this beautiful and inspiring game. That bridged it for me as well, that this is a game that not only adults can enjoy, but also kids can enjoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, you two have sort of already answered my next question, but if you want to add anything, please do. I was going to ask you all, looking back on the original, what are you most proud of? What do you think stands out as something that the first Ōkami did really well that you want to do really well again in a sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">[There is a lengthy pause while Kamiya considers how to answer.]</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>So, looking back at Ōkami when it was beginning as an original idea, I'm actually from Nagano Prefecture. It's a very nature-filled area, of course. And then I moved to Osaka to live and work here. But my hometown and my love for it was one of the key factors that made me create the game and made me what I write that experience back then in sort of a positive way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's this spirit that drove me into creating the sequel. And so, what was tricky for me to answer for this question was that the story which fans are waiting for... Ōkami is not just a nice story. There of course are the evils within the story. And as you go along the game, you move along with the story, you move along with the goal that you have within the game, but you have people who perish, or you lose along the way in the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I think that's why it is an important game as well. These two people, the two guys next to me said that their daughters played it and enjoy the game. I also want various people to play it, and I want people of all ages to be able to enjoy it. Within that, just the beauty of nature and the evils within, and then the story as well is something that I really want people to be able to enjoy for the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I have a bit of a silly question. Can I show you a picture? </strong><a href="https://revealingerrors.com/okami_watermark" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Do any of you know the story behind this</strong></u></a><strong>?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">[They all declined to comment]</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Since you made the first Ōkami, what do you feel has changed about game development and technology that is going to influence how you approach the sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sakata: </strong>So, with the original Ōkami, of course it came out on PS2. The original concept was to create the soft and hand-drawing style of the game. And that was sort of the visual that the team wanted to show for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even with the hardware back in the days, that was a tricky thing to achieve. So, this was something that we had a lot of discussions with the development teams going back and forth, and we ended up with certain aspects that we had to drop because of that. And so, with today's technology, we are able to achieve all of this that we were trying to achieve back in the days and perhaps even greater now, now than what we have the RE Engine as well working with us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, things that were great that we gave up on then are now able to achieve, and we'll hopefully be able to achieve the Kamiya game that we all wanted to achieve then.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Okami 2 Game Awards Teaser Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, speaking of new technologies, do any of you have any opinions on the Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi</strong>: This is something that we really can't comment on from Capcom side at all, because yeah, it's about the Nintendo Switch 2. Anything that comes out would come out from Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> As a personal comment, I personally would love to see the Virtual Console rebooted. That's something that I would really want to ask Nintendo for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know you're not really saying much about the actual content of the sequel at this time, but I figure I'll try. Can you say anything about any big themes or ideas or stories that you feel you didn't get to tell enough in the first Ōkami that you want to explore in this sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I do have a general idea of a big theme and the idea of the story, and it is in my head. It's been building in my head for several years now, and it's something that I really want to be able to get my hands on and work and visualize to get to the fans. And I have a detailed idea on how I want this game to turn out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>So, one thing that we can say is that this sequel is a continuation of the story that we saw in the original game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>I'm always looking at social channels to see what users are expecting of this sequel. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our work is not to create the exact copy of what people want from us.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Our work, of course, is not to create the game that people request of us, to create the exact copy of what people want from us. But we are working hard to achieve a game that achieves the fun that people are expecting of this Ōkami sequel. I have an idea of what I want to create. And I have no plans of throwing away the user's expectation of the games, but I always want to make the best game possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You said that this is a follow-up to the story told in Ōkami. That is Amaterasu in the trailer we saw at the Game Awards, right? Can you confirm that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I wonder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[Everyone laughs.]</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>Yes, it is. It is Amaterasu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What are your feelings about Ōkamiden? Are we going to acknowledge Ōkamiden in this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi:</strong> We know that there are fans out there that like the game, of course. And we also know the feedback on the game out there, of how the story was taken and now how perhaps parts of the story weren’t aligning with what people were expecting. With that, we also have the sequel now that, as we explained before, is a continuation from the story of the original base Ōkami. That's how we're going to phrase it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It can be difficult going back to an older game where the controls to a modern audience may feel out of date, but then again you have fans from the original who might prefer that kind of control method. What is the general outlook on what the control system for this game might look like and what kind of play feel you want to deliver?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> As we have just started development for this title, it's not something that we have dove into very deeply as of yet, but as I have a lot of experience in the game industry as a developer but also as a gamer, I always looked at how things update and develop going forward with these sorts of titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And even looking back at the old Ōkami, I can't even remember all of the control schemes that there were for the game. But you have to remember that what was best back in the day isn’t perhaps best for modern games. So, we always have to look at what's best for games coming out now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course we won't ignore everything that we had for Ōkami, but we'll also look into the controllers, and not only that, but the various ideas that we had for the base game and see what we can improve in depth going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Am I correct in assuming that this sequel is very, very early in development?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>Yes, we just started this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What led you to announce it so very early at the Game Awards last year?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi:</strong> Because we wanted to. We were excited. We had Takeuchi-san talking about how we wanted to tell people: ‘Yes, can we? Yes, we can make this game. It's going to be possible.’ So, we wanted to tell everyone about this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>I was actually relieved that we were able to do this announcement because now it's not only just a dream and idea. It's something that is actually becoming true. So, it's also a promise for the users around the world that yes, we will make this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you worry that when this inevitably takes some time to make, you're going to have fans banging down your door, wondering where this game is?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi:</strong> So, we understand that emotion, but the team will work as hard as they can to create the game that people are expecting. So, trust us. Trust us in the development team that we will do our best, and we will work towards having the game come out before people start banging on the door a bit too loudly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sakata: </strong>We will do our best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>This is something that we say pretty much for all titles, but of course faster isn't always the best. We will not give up quality for speed, but do know that we will not drag our feet for this title. It's something that we will put our efforts into.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We will not give up quality for speed, but do know that we will not drag our feet for this title.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>There might be people out there who think bad of us, but we will put our heads down and really work hard on this now. So, stand by and wait for what we have coming up next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>There's a </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2M_T5r5lgE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>video you can view when you finish Ōkami</strong></u></a><strong> that is, I think, a prototype of the game that you all worked on, that's Amaterasu running, and trees springing up behind her. Was that at all the inspiration for the Ōkami sequel teaser? Was there any connection?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sakata: </strong>We didn't really have that as a direct inspiration when creating this, but I've seen videos online where people are sort of comparing both videos, but it perhaps just brings it back that we are following the original game idea, and that's why they sort of ended up being very similar in the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>The background music in that trailer was something that was inspired by the original game and something that we saw that users actually catch onto when seeing the announcement, that it was the Ōkami sequel that they were seeing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>The song itself is a very popular song that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZxK58tPU4I" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>you might know from the original game</u></a> and the original composer, [Rei] Kondoh, and he actually was the creator of the song now for the trailer as well. And so, with that we have the sort of original spirit of him living on now with this trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I would love to hear an answer from each of you, but I want to know what is inspiring you right now or what you're really enjoying. What other video games are you playing, what books are you reading, movies, music, what things do you just generally enjoy right now?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>What’s having a really big input in my work right now is the <a href="https://kageki.hankyu.co.jp/english/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Takarazuka stage shows</u></a>. That is something that I really like, and it's based off of three major groups right now, the Hana, Sora and Tsuki groups. And I prefer the Hana group right now, and I always try to go see them when they're performing. They are a group of several women who play both men and women, and they're very unique and a popular sort of stage performance here in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that I like specifically about them is the stage settings and what they do on stage itself. Looking at other media like games and movies, you have a lot of CG, and you have the ability to cut between scenes how you like. But when you have a stage performance, you're not able to do that, you can't use CG. You cannot cut to another scene or another camera. So, it's interesting to see how they solve that by showing off what they want to do and between different scenes and on stage. That really inspires me, and it's something that I bring back when creating games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sakata:</strong> Kamiya-san described how he likes stage performances with Takarazuka. I also like that, but more with the <a href="https://www.shiki.jp/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gekidan Shiki</u></a> and smaller groups with about five to six people performing. I also like the realistic live feeling that you get when you see the actors performing in front of you and how they're able to act and show the scene that they are performing. Sometimes they make small mistakes on stage, but that's part of the act and part of the show that you're there to feel and experience. This live feeling and being close to the stage is something that I really, really like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then when I take that back to games, it's important for us to not create a game that dictates a certain way that we want people to enjoy the game, but we want to create something that users can experience and choose how they enjoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> Stage performances are something that's really different. Even going to the same show over and over again, you might experience something different every time. And that's something that also relates to games and how it's different every time you play it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>Different from the other two people here, I am really inspired by movies lately. I've been recommended to see the latest Gundam movie called <a href="https://en.gundam.info/about-gundam/series-pages/gquuuuuux/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gundam GQuuuuuuX</u></a>. It really brings several people's perspectives and their realistic views, and you can see how the different expectations build up in this movie. You can see how watching the movie gives a different feel, depending on who it is that watches this. Just the emotions put into this movie is something that I really admire as a creator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> This movie was something that I got recommended today by my subordinates as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi:</strong> You can really see the passion of the creator in this movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sakata:</strong> I haven't seen it yet, but the challenge that is required to make something like this is something that I admire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What does success for the Ōkami sequel look like to you all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi:</strong> So, rather than commenting from Capcom's perspective, I would answer this personally. But I would want to see something that fans were able to enjoy, to go above the expectations of what they're looking forward to in this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>This might only be something for Ōkami, but personally for me, success might not be the right word, but if it's something that I personally like, personally would enjoy, then I feel like the project has succeeded. Of course that might not always align with users or the fans, but having it align with the best scenario, that's something that we're aiming for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's the goal that we're aiming for, just having it be something people enjoy. Once the game is something I can be proud of, then I feel like the project is successful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sakata: </strong>Talking success, it's always tricky to pin down what describes that. If I'm happy with the game, then it's successful. Or if it sells a lot, then it's successful. But from the creative perspective, it's always an important successful point when people play the game and they enjoy it. Especially for this title as well, to not only have people who are literate gamers, but people who are new to gaming also be able to enjoy the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But coming from the Machine Head Works perspective, as we are involved with this project, and Kamiya-san as the director, has said that when he's happy with the project, he feels that it's successful. Well, Machine Head Works’ goal is to have the director's goal achieved. So, that would be the Machine Head Works way of saying that it's successful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I asked about the success of Ōkami, but now I want to ask about the success of your respective studios. Kamiya-san and Sakata-san are building these newer studios that have branched off of Capcom, and so 10 years from now, what would you need to feel that you were doing well, that you had accomplished your mission? Do you imagine you might someday end up back under Capcom? Do you continue this partnership or keep working on more games with them? Or do you eventually develop your own IP? What does that look like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sakata: </strong>So, in 10 years I don't have really a concrete goal for Machine Head Works as it is for now. Both Kamiya and I, as people in charge of the company, we're close to pension. As creators, I think we both would still want to keep on working on games, but then the goal would of course have the company continue to create games even 10 years from now. So, that's something that I would want to work towards rather than having X amount of people working for the company or creating X sort of game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> Clovers’ future plan, seeing that we just started, basically from this year, first of all, we still need to gather and increase more people working under us and gather people of the same spirit under Clovers. That's my dream going forward, to have people that I can collaborate with working here and aligning with everyone that works here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Clovers, it's not specifically to work on a specific game. I'd rather have people that I can personally align with and collaborate with under the same roof. And that's the goal that I'm looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>All three requested the opportunity to close by delivering one final message directly to the fans:</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi: </strong>This is just a message to everyone who saw the trailer that was announced last year about the project that we are now working very hard to realize. It might take a little bit of time before we might talk again, but please wait while we're able to realize our dream of creating Ōkami the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sakata: </strong>It might be some time before we get to meet each other again. But do know that this project is made by staff who love this series, still love this IP, and they're working very, very hard to create it. And we're working our hardest to make something that aligns with everyone's expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya: </strong>First of all, this project is something that I really wanted to create personally, but if it wasn't for everyone's cheers, then we wouldn't be able to move forward with this. So, first of all, I would like to thank you, everyone. Lift of my heart, thank you. Not only due to the fans, but also Capcom and Machine Head Works, due to all of their support that I am able to achieve this. So, I will continue to treasure this collaboration in creating this title that we hope that everyone will be able to enjoy. Please, look forward to this project. Thank you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hirabayashi</strong>: Your comment is a bit too perfect. Is that really you speaking now?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> [laughing] No, no, no, really, I'm just so grateful for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kami-2-is-being-made-in-re-engine-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-unveiled-at-the-game-awards-2024">the announcement of a sequel to cult favorite Ōkami at The Game Awards last year</a>, fans immediately began speculating that the game would be developed in RE Engine thanks to Capcom's return as publisher. IGN can now exclusively confirm that's the case, after speaking with several leads on the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a lengthy interview, the use of RE Engine was confirmed by Machine Head Works producer Kiyohiko Sakata. When we asked him about Machine Head Works' role on the project, he responded as follows:</p><blockquote>The way that Machine Head Works is involved now, working together with Capcom and Clovers, is that of course we have Capcom as the major IP holder of Ōkami, deciding the major direction of the games. And we have Clovers as this development lead for this project. Machine Head Works comes in by having the experience of both working with Capcom previously on several titles, so we know what Capcom needs to create the game. That's something that Machine Head Works has the experience and knowledge of. We also have the experience of working with Kamiya-san before as well. So we have both experience of Capcom and Clovers, and we're acting sort of like a bridge between Clovers and Capcom.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition to this, we also have the experience of working with the game engine that we are using for this project, RE Engine. So Clovers' developers haven't had any experiences with using this engine, but Machine Head Works have experience of using it. So we're aiding them. Also under us, Machine Head Works, we have people who have actually had experience of working with the original Ōkami game and also will be aiding us with the development of this title.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the interview, we asked what it was about RE Engine that was appealing to the teams, and if there were things they could accomplish with RE Engine that were specifically helpful to an Okami sequel. Capcom producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi responded quite simply: "Yes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He then elaborated just a little: "However, of course we cannot go into much detail at this point in time. But we from Capcom, we believe that without RE Engine at this point we wouldn't be able to realize [director Hideki] Kamiya-san's artistic dreams for this project."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kamiya also interjected: "So RE Engine is of course famous for showing the best of the games that they have. Very, very good expressively. And so we believe people are also expecting and awaiting the RE Engine level of quality now for this game."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the interview, the leads teased RE Engine again, with Sakata noting that it may enable the team to do certain things with the Ōkami sequel that they had wanted to do with the first Ōkami, but couldn't. "With today's technology, we are able to achieve all of this that we were trying to achieve back in the days and perhaps even greater now, now than what we have the RE Engine as well working with us," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RE Engine, short for Reach for the Moon Engine, is Capcom's proprietary engine that was originally designed for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Since then, Capcom has used it in all of its major games, most notably the Resident Evil series, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, and Dragon's Dogma. Most of the games made in RE Engine thus far have a fairly realistic art style (with a few smaller exceptions), leaving it exciting to imagine what might be possible with Okami's particular art style. Capcom is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-reveals-its-working-on-a-next-gen-re-engine-codenamed-rex">currently working on a new successor engine</a>, known as REX. Its technology is supposedly slowly being integrated into the existing RE Engine, meaning we may see some elements of it in the Ōkami sequel as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything else from our interview with the leads of the upcoming Ōkami sequel in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-capcom-hideki-kamiya-and-machine-head-discuss-hotly-anticipated-sequel-in-exclusive-interview">full Q&amp;A right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-capcom-hideki-kamiya-and-machine-head-discuss-hotly-anticipated-sequel-in-exclusive-interview">IGN</a>, director Hideki Kamiya, Capcom producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, and Machine Head Works studio head Kiyohiko Sakata discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">early-in-development sequel first revealed at last year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Hirabayashi admitted Capcom had "always wanted to create an Okami sequel" because the IP was "something that we all love and we wanted to see it continued". With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-leaving-platinumgames">Kamiya leaving PlatinumGames in 2023</a>, now was the time to discuss a sequel.</p>

<p>Kamiya also always wanted to create a sequel. "Thinking back to about 19 years ago when I first created the game, you have to remember that the story itself isn't really complete, and I always wanted to complete this game," he said. "But of course, as I was in Platinum, I couldn't do that. But even back then, I was often meeting with my friends, specifically with Takeuchi, and going out drinking. And we always talked casually about one day being able to do it. Then I ended up leaving Platinum. So now as a creator, I'll be able to actually make this come true now with Takeuchi."</p>
<p>In a video with Ikumi Nakamura last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okamis-initial-sales-were-huge-failure-says-director-hideki-kamiya">Kamiya noted that Okami was a "huge failure" commercially</a>, though he admitted "for us who made it, it turned out something we can be proud of". Why, then, is he making a sequel now?</p>
<p>Hirabayashi noted there are "millions of fans out there that we know", due to sales of the game remaining a steady stream over time due to various re-releases.</p>
<p>Kamiya detailed further: "So in the beginning for Clover, we perhaps saw that from a development perspective that it might not reach users in such a wide area as we were planning. But moving on throughout the years, we released later versions that people enjoyed. Since then, we’ve received messages on social media of people enjoying the game, and we're realizing that people are liking Ōkami a lot.</p>
<p>"Now with the announcement at TGA, being there live within the audience and hearing people react there, and not only that, but also seeing people reacting on social channels after, there are so many people waiting for this title. And I was very surprised and happier than I thought I would be to hear people so looking forward to this game.</p>
<p>"Even now, I look up the YouTube reactions to the announcements and looking at the people reacting to the video, and I find myself crying with the fans. And I'm just so happy to see that, oh, people are so happy to see this game come true."</p>
<p>He added fan reaction spurred him on. "And so, with everyone cheering on and our desire to create, it was that that led us to the actualisation of this project. So without everyone's voices out there, without everyone cheering us on, we wouldn't have moved forward with this. So thank you so much."</p>

</figure>
<p>What can we expect from the sequel? Hirabayashi confirmed it's Amaterasu in the teaser trailer and the game will be a continuation of the story in the original game.</p>
<p>Added Kamiya: "I do have a general idea of a big theme and the idea of the story, and it is in my head. It's been building in my head for several years now, and it's something that I really want to be able to get my hands on and work and visualise to get to the fans. And I have a detailed idea on how I want this game to turn out."</p>
<p>The pair also confirmed it's being developed in the RE Engine, used in Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, and Monster Hunter games.</p>
<p>Hirabayashi believes that "without RE Engine at this point we wouldn't be able to realise Kamiya-san's artistic dreams for this project", while Kamiya noted how the engine is "famous for showing the best of the games" and is "very, very good expressively".</p>
<p>Sakata also discussed how the hand-drawn style of the original was hard to achieve back on the PS2. "With today's technology, we are able to achieve all of this that we were trying to achieve back in the days and perhaps even greater now, now than what we have the RE Engine as well working with us," he said.</p>
<p>Still, the Okami sequel is very early in development with no release information yet.</p>
<p>"We will not give up quality for speed, but do know that we will not drag our feet for this title," said Hirabayashi. "It's something that we will put our efforts into."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-reveals-first-early-access-roadmap-for-hyper-light-breaker/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After getting off to a slightly rocky start, Heart Machine has revealed its plans for Hyper Light Breaker in the game's first Early Access roadmap. The roadmap details a ton of changes coming to the game from February through to April. While a lot of the changes are minor additions in February and March, April will bring a major content update titled "Buried Below." Below is the Early Access roadmap - Spring Edition, which showcases some of the changes and additions you can expect to see in Hyper Light Breaker.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Hyper Light Breaker, check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-preview-lo-fi-roguelite/">preview here</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>For those who are excited about the new content, the first monthly content update for Hyper Light Breaker will be released on February 18, which will add in a new Breaker to play, new enemies, Holobytes, Affixes, and plenty of rebalances and performance updates to make sure that the game is fun but also provides a challenge to those who want it while playing this roguelite.</p>
<p>The Breaker being added to Hyper Light Breaker is named Ravona, who was previously codenamed "Crow." Along with this comes new SyComs for Ravona as well as new enemies to face off against, including a new Elite enemy if you find yourself needing a challenge in Hyper Light Breaker. As mentioned above, new Holobytes are being added in this update, such as "Hunter's Mark," as well as new Affixes that provide a new challenge to your playthrough. Ravona has been a highly-anticipated Breaker by the community, with the team saying that the community would request to see gameplay of the character daily since the Breaker was shown in the Gameplay Reveal Trailer.</p>
<p>Because Hyper Light Breaker was released in Early Access, Heart Machine is dedicated to taking on player's feedback and suggestions, where they have the potential to be integrated into the game. Whether that's to provide new content or make much-needed fixes, there will be plenty of updates during the Early Access period. This includes expanded control and graphics options, bug fixes, and a rework of the enemy aggro system.</p>
<p>One of the main fixes that will be added to the game includes a rework of the Medkit system, which was previously perceived as too harsh by the players. Instead, players will now be able to start with a Medkit in their runs.</p>
<p>Hyper Light Breaker is currently available in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-top-1m-worldwide.1109715/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>sales have hit their first major milestone exactly a month after the game's initial release.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>has racked up a million sales across PC and current-gen consoles. Not only that, but the game's demo, which is available to check out right now, has amassed over two million downloads.</p>

<p>To celebrate the sales milestone, Koei Tecmo also posted some new artwork featuring the amnesiac main character of&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, along with the kindly doctor Yuanhua, who's helping our protagonist look for answers about his past.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=WqShp_vW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=T5N-p9lS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>&nbsp;has officially sold over a million copies.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, it's the latest entry in Koei Tecmo's long-running hack-and-slash series, which actually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/dynasty-warriors-fighting-game-turned-musou" rel="nofollow">started life as a one-on-one fighter</a> serving as a spinoff of the publisher's&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>Although the name might lead you to believe that <i>Origins&nbsp;</i>is a prequel, that's only true in a certain sense. The game still takes place in the time period covered by the classical Chinese novel&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, but it focuses heavily on the first half rather than encompassing the whole thing.</p>

<p>Rather uniquely for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors</em>,&nbsp;<em>Origins&nbsp;</em>features an original protagonist, and in much the same way as Team Ninja's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty" rel="nofollow"><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></a>, the story revolves around our main character as he meets famous historical figures and helps them to beat the snot out of hundreds of enemies on the battlefield.</p>




<p>Narrative changes aside, however,&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>offers more of the same large-scale tactical hack-and-slash combat you've come to know (and potentially love) from the franchise, so you'll probably already know whether this one's for you or not.</p>

<p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dynasty-warriors-origins/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dynasty-warriors-origins/9p5hjqnx53xj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

			<p>Since its humble beginning back in 1991, the Civilization series has undergone many changes, evolving into something great, much like the civilizations you control in game. Civilization 7 has evolved once more, introducing some new concepts, but simplifying the formula in many ways.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sid Meier's Civilization VII - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGOdJMNN2b0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Because of this shifting focus, Civilization 7 can feel like less of a sequel and more of a sideways set. It’s not that I dislike the way the game plays, but some of the changes are certainly jarring, and the comparison points to Civ 6 or Civ 5 are impossible not to make. As the old adage goes, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Well, Firaxis tried to fix it anyway with mixed results. From an accessibility standpoint and with the simultaneous launch on console in mind, Civ 7 is great. It’s streamlined and simplified features will be great for people getting into the series for the first time, but anyone looking for anything a bit more mechanically complex might be left wanting.</p>


<p>One of the first big changes comes in the form of how you actually pick your leader and civilization. This has now been split apart so that you pick a leader first, and then a civ for them to lord over. Your leader stays with you through to the end of your campaign, but the introduction of distinct Ages – Antiquity, Exploration &amp; Modern – will see you changing civs as time passes. Each time you move into a new one, time will skip several hundred years, and you pick from one of a bunch of new civs to lead, specific to that era, and linked in some way to your previous choice. This means at the start of the game you could be playing as Greece and by the end, the USA.</p>
<p>On one hand, in a way this is kind of cool, because it lets you be a little more customisable in the way you play with unique units, bonuses, civic trees and more. On the other hand, I found it quite jarring that I couldn’t play just one civ out till the end. To me it takes away the whole point of picking a civ in the first place. If I want to lead Spartan Greece to a scientific victory, then let me do it, dammit!</p>


<p>Each transition into a new Age acts a bit like a soft reset, although you will take with you certain traditions and other bonuses. Towards the end of each age, the world will face some form of crisis, such as a plague, which needs to be dealt with before the transition can take place. As you play, you’ll be given missions in the form of Legacy Paths, of which there are four, Culture, Military, Science and Economic. Completing objectives within these paths grants you Legacy Points which you can spend on special boons at the start of the next era. In the Modern Age, each Legacy Path then leads to a victory condition.</p>
<p>What this new system does is break things up quite nicely. Games of Civ are often long affairs and the 4X genre has often struggled with an endgame grind, but this three act structure helps with the pacing. It also means that you’re never truly out of the race, as everyone starts on an even keel when a new age begins.</p>
<p>Each era also introduces new game mechanics, such as religion in the Exploration Age, and ideologies such as fascism, democracy, and communism in the Modern Age. They also march technology forward, so those hoping to charge a mass of Hoplites toward a Panzer Tank will be disappointed. You can always return to the classics to relive this age old Civ meme, but that kind of quirky playfulness is missed.</p>

<p>Overall, the Age system does a lot to freshen up the formula and make games a little more fair, but the end game of the Modern Era feels a little lacklustre. The two prior eras have a lot of focus whereas Modern just feels a bit off. There’s no World Congress anymore, which is a massive shame, and the era itself just feels a little bloated and lacking in excitement.</p>
<p>Citizen management and growth has also taken a new turn, with you no longer being able to assign your best and brightest to work specific tiles for bonuses. Now, each city has slottable resources which are picked up when you expand to new tiles as your city grows. Food is generated every turn, and once you reach a specified number of food, you can expand your city to new tiles and immediately put those new folk to work. If a tile you expanded to has a resource, then you can slot that into your city and gain its bonus. This is a pretty versatile system, as any resources gained can be slotted in any city or town where there is space. After a while, having to slot dozens of resources and moving them about can get a bit tiresome, making me appreciate the old methods all the more. This also means that builders and workers have been done away with, and this reduced unit clutter is very welcome.</p>

<p>Diplomacy in Civ 7 also feels less engaging. In previous games, I really felt like I was hashing things out with other leaders, as they would approach me, telling me how much they disapproved of the pillaging of the small village. Now, the leaders seem to have no real identity, with each interaction feeling very transactional. Clicking on each leader takes you to the diplomacy screen where you can spend Influence – a new yield introduced in Civ 7 – to choose certain actions, such as, establishing a trade route or proposing some good old fashion join science research. You can also spend your influence to block denouncements or even perform a little espionage. It’s all good on the surface, showing that the more influential you are, the more people will like you, but it feels a little soulless. I felt that no matter what I did, the numbers would always stack against me. Xerses would always hate me, and my attempts to nullify that hate ultimately didn’t matter. I would keep spending influence to balance the books without any real conversation taking place. The leaders don’t even look at you anymore, just sideways to the on screen avatar of your leader.</p>
<p>The inability to bargain properly with these other nations is also jarring. You used to be able to negotiate yourself a lucrative deal, getting resources you need in exchange for peace, but now, with resources being shared via trade routes, it all felt a little pointless. You can still demand cities in peace treaties though, so there’s that.</p>
<p>Another major change is the way religion works, with the entire process being stripped back. You can still send Missionaries to other cities to convert their masses, and even when you convert them, religion doesn’t spread, and you don’t get any diplomatic benefit from it. You don’t even get Inquisitors any more entering hold combat which is a real shame. The mechanic was introduced twenty years ago, so to see it relegated now fills me with sadness.</p>
<p>I know it feels like I’ve been nothing but negative towards Civ 7, but it really isn’t a bad game, it’s just not as good as its predecessors yet. I still lost countless hours to it while playing and there have been some clear improvements in many areas. Games do have a good pacing to them thanks to the era system and combat has been tidied up.</p>

<p>The UI could do with a bit of an overhaul though, and Firaxis has already stated this is a priority for them to address. Some parts are just not as intuitive as in previous entries and I often spent way too long looking for what I needed. This could be down to unifying development across both PC and consoles, simplifying the experience for pad players, but it’s detracted form the game with keyboard and mouse.</p>

			<p>Yves Guillemot has stated that Ubisoft plans to focus on Open World Action-Adventure games and live service games year-on-year. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-says-the-plan-is-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games-year-after-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Originally posted by VGC</a>, Guillemot went on to confirm that the company's way of getting out of hot water was to continue exactly the way it has been. This information game during a Q&amp;A that followed after the company's financial results for Q3 of the 2024-25 financial year.&nbsp;In this presentation, a caller asked if the executives could provide more information on what the development pipeline looks like for the future.</p>
<p>In response to this, CEO Yves Guillemot said that the focus would be on open-world adventures, such as the longstanding franchise Assassin's Creed, as well as live service games such as Rainbow Six Siege. The choice to include live-service games definitely comes as a surprise to some, considering its recent announcement to shutter the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">live-service title XDefiant</a>, with the servers of this live-service game due to close in June 2025.</p>
<p>"We have been investing significantly for a big pipeline of products for the coming years along our two verticals, these being open-world action-adventure as well as 'Game as a Service'-native experiences," said Guillemot. "And that's what we want to deliver year after year."</p>
<p>In this presentation, games that have already been confirmed were discussed. This includes Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will be the latest open-world game ready to be released. However, this game has already caused a significant amount of controversy, and it hasn't been released yet. Initially set to be released last year, the game has received multiple pushbacks, with it set to release on 20 March, 2025.</p>
<p>"We've announced that Anno 117: Pax Romana will also come next year, as well as The Division: Resurgence on mobile. All this is coming along well. We haven't provided more color for FY 2026, but we'll have more to share by the time of May."</p>
<p>Guillemot also mentioned that Assassin's Creed Shadows pre-orders were in the same ballpark as those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which was the second most successful entry in terms of unit sales. Despite the controversy, it seems that Assassin's Creed Shadows may be in with a chance of helping provide redemption for the struggling company Ubisoft.</p>
<p>It's not much of a secret that Ubisoft has been struggling for a while, with there being studio closures and layoffs far too often. On top of that, all of the money that was funneled into Star Wars Outlaws wasn't beneficial to the company, as it didn't perform as well as Ubisoft had hoped.</p>
<p>Whether Assassin's Creed Shadows will be the saving grace of the company remains to be seen, with its tentative release date around the corner.</p>

			<p>More opportunities to test Elden Ring Nightreign may be coming today following the server issues that have prevented many from trying out the game in the very first testing session.</p>
<p>At the end of the first testing session, FromSoftware shared a message on <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> apologizing for the server issues and revealing that they are considering holding additional tests. Like many other PlayStation 5 users, I couldn't access the network test at all in the first hour or so due to the server going offline to fix issues, and I wasn't able to get into a single game once the server went back online. I was only able to wander around the Roundtable Hold and head into the new training area for a few minutes before the connection was lost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="ja">ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGNゲームサーバーの障害によりプレイヤーの皆様にはご迷惑をおかけし誠に申し訳ございません。本日のネットワークテストは予定通り23時に終了とさせていただき、改善作業を進めます。本日分については追加でテスト開催を検討しております。ご理解ご了承をいただけますと幸いです。</p>

<p>Being an online co-op-focused experience, it is definitely a good thing that FromSoftware is holding this Elden Ring Nightreign Network Test and that issues are surfacing now and not after the game has launched.<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/">&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earlier this week</a>, we got a new look at the game with a new trailer and confirmation that it will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on May 30th.</span> Together with the standard edition, multiple Elden Ring Nightreign special editions will also be released on the same day, including an exclusive collectible produced in limited quantities.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-lawsuit-trade-secret-infringement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Korean courts have ruled that Ironmace's dungeon-crawling PvPvE action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>did not infringe on Nexon's copyright, but that it did infringe on the company's trade secrets, necessitating a payment of around 8.5 billion Korean won (around $6 million).</p>

<p>Per Korean news platform <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/02/13/MXHA4WV3ANHRFCJZQI4UE4HTQE/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chosun</a>, the Seoul Central District Court's Civil Division 63 came to the decision yesterday. It essentially represents both a win and a loss for Ironmace.</p>

<p>For context, since 2023,&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>has been the subject of an ongoing legal battle between developer Ironmace and Korean studio Nexon, several ex-employees of which make up some of Ironmace's ranks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-and-darker-court-case-trade-secret-infringement-skeletons.jpg?itok=o1901PnW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-and-darker-court-case-trade-secret-infringement-skeletons.jpg?itok=LR9qxE_F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>developer Ironmace must pay Nexon around $6 million for trade secret infringement.</figcaption></figure><p>Nexon alleged in its lawsuit that&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>bore striking similarities to an internal game tentatively codenamed&nbsp;<em>P3</em>. That project's leader Ju-Hyun Choi was fired from Nexon in August 2021 and went on to create&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>alongside several other ex-Nexon staffers.</p>

<p>According to Nexon, assets from&nbsp;<em>P3</em>'s development were leaked by Choi onto an external non-Nexon server, and those assets were instrumental in Choi's decision to try and create a game that would play similarly to&nbsp;<em>P3</em>.</p>

<p>The lawsuit led to Nexon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-developers-respond-to-dmca-takedown-from-nexon-after-removal-from-steam" rel="nofollow">issuing a DMCA takedown</a> against&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>on Steam in March 2023 (although the game has since been restored to the platform) and also resulted in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-early-access-delayed-bit-following-legal-dispute-against-nexon" rel="nofollow">delay to the game's eventual 1.0 release</a>, according to Ironmace.</p>

<p>From Chosun's report, it sounds as though the Korean court agrees with Nexon that material was leaked onto a server from inside the company, but the court doesn't consider this matter to fall under the umbrella of copyright infringement.</p>




<p>It's not clear whether Nexon will pursue any further legal action against Ironmace and&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, but for now, it looks as though the studio and its game won't be facing any more imminent legal threats or takedowns.</p>

            <p>Cult classic N64 platformer Glover now has a release date on current consoles.</p>
<p>Courtesy of publisher and developer QUByte Interactive, Glover will release across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch later this month on 27th February.</p>
<p>Don't expect any changes for this re-release though, it still looks and plays as it did back on N64.</p>

<p>Glover was first released back in 1998 from British developer Blitz Games Studios. And as the name suggests, players take control of a giant glove.</p>
<p>This leads to plenty of creativity as the four-fingered hero throws, dribbles, bounces, and rolls a rubber ball across colourful worlds to help out an old wizard after a magical accident causes him to lose his enchanted gloves.</p>
<p>The game was released on PC back in 2022, though has "mixed" reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257880/Glover/">Steam</a> due to issues with both sound and visuals in this port. Let's hope these console versions fare better.</p>
<p>The original N64 release did receive mostly positive reviews and proved refreshing compared with other platformers of the day. A sequel was in development, but subsequently cancelled.</p>
<p>If you're a subscriber to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, Glover isn't part of it but great platformers like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a> and Banjo Kazooie are available.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
