            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/valkyrae-cinna-emiru-attacked-amouranth-robbed-twitch-kick<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last night, a total of four female Twitch streamers were assaulted, three while together broadcasting in public and one at home in an entirely different state.</p><p>In the first case, longtime YouTube (and recent Twitch) star Rachell “Valkyrae” Hoffstetter was out at the Santa Monica Pier with fellow streamers Brittany "Cinna" Watts and Emily “Emiru” Schunk as part of Hoffstetter’s then-ongoing Sis-A-Thon marathon broadcast, when they encountered a crouching man who’d <a href="https://x.com/changgangart/status/1896431771040047196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly been following them</a>. </p><p>The man lured the group in by asking if they’d listen to him sing a song and then immediately tried to get Schunk’s number, causing the streamers to hastily walk away. Undeterred, the man proceeded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOxr32JJiQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follow them to a nearby snack vendor</a>. After a couple of minutes, he began verbally threatening them, saying things like “Let’s fucking fight right now.” When Hoffstetter called for security, the man tried to rush the group while shouting, “I’ll kill you right now.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Stalker Threatens/attack Emiru, Valkyrae, Cinna, Emily &amp; Rosii at Santa Monica Pier" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJOxr32JJiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The streamers ended the broadcast not long after. Nobody was hurt, but Hoffstetter understandably decided to conclude her marathon.</p><p>“We are all OK and have been with police,” she <a href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1896449449100247336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter last night</a>. “We decided we are done with the marathon and need time to process! … Please send love to Emiru, Cinna, [camera person] Rosii, and Emily! Everybody is in shock but I’m so glad [we’re] together.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxaQlqmo_Zs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a follow up broadcast today</a>, Hoffstetter and Watts, still visibly shaken up, told viewers more about what happened before and after the stream clip that went viral, noting that they had to “hide in a shed for 15 minutes until cops came” after receiving what they felt was insufficient aid from workers at Santa Monica Pier (though Watts added that she didn’t think it was workers’ fault). The two also asked viewers to provide any additional details they might have to help identify the man. They went on to defend themselves against online suggestions that the situation wasn’t particularly serious because the man didn’t seem to have a weapon, which is a totally fucked thing to even need to do when there is clear video footage of <em>somebody trying to assault you</em>.</p><p>“He put his stuff on the ground to fistfight Emily,” said Hoffstetter during today’s stream.&nbsp;</p><p>“I am in hindsight very thankful that we were in the area that we were and that we were able to go into the store, because I think if we had been anywhere else on the pier, it would have been a very different situation,” said Watts. “Please take this stuff very seriously. It can happen to anybody if you’re male or female, but if you ask any girl streamer, they all have stories.”</p><p>To wit, nearly every female content creator featured in my book and many more I’ve spoken to over the years have all shared stories of stalkers and assailants, and as of last night, one, Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa – who in the past has dealt with <a href="https://gamerant.com/amouranth-stalker-update-jail-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stalkers</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/amouranth-is-twitchs-smartest-troll-but-shes-on-thin-i-1847324266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swatters</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23410828/amouranth-abuse-twitch-streamer-safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abuse</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/18/twitch-amouranth-house-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even a suspected arsonist</a> – was robbed at gunpoint in her home. She tweeted about the incident <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896432533442904528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as it was unfolding</a>, saying three gunmen had pistol whipped her to the point of bleeding in an attempt to get their hands on her crypto login info. Today she <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896600968797561248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted security camera footage</a> of gunmen following her into a portion of her home and then fleeing after one seemingly sustained a bullet wound.&nbsp;</p><p>“They pistol-whipped me but I got one,” Siragusa <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896433946919084342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted last night</a>. “Was at gun point they gave me phone and said log in with gun to my head, and I tweeted because calling would be a death sentence.”</p><p><a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2025/03/popular-social-media-influencer-amouranth-pistol-whipped-in-home-invasion-robbery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Esports Advocate</a> received more details from a Houston Police Department spokesperson, saying that "during the time [the home invasion] was happening, Siragusa’s 36-year-old husband heard the commotion, armed himself, and entered the room. As the suspects attempted to flee, Siragusa’s husband was able to fire off an unknown number of shots, possibly injuring one of the suspects."</p><p>Speaking to Aftermath, both Jakob Avery, managing director of Siragusa’s company, and Nick Lee, evidently still with Siragusa even after the aforementioned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23410828/amouranth-abuse-twitch-streamer-safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 abuse incident</a>, took unspecified issue with the HPD’s account of events, but said they’d been advised against sharing more during an ongoing police investigation. Lee said that he believes he shot one of the intruders, all of whom had been in the process of drawing weapons, “aiming towards me, and shouting orders” before he opened fire.</p><p>Following the harrowing experiences of Siragusa, Hoffstetter, Watts, and Schunk – as well as those around them – many in the livestreaming community have suggested that bystanders and police will never make for sufficient protection, given their historically <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/08/15/keffals-adin-ross-ishowspeed-swatting-twitch-youtube/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inconsistent responses</a> to these issues. Content creators, they say, <a href="https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1896465056625480016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need to hire security</a>. That’s far from an option for most streamers, which <a href="https://x.com/LewSpears/status/1896496737604509800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serves as a silent deterrent for women in the space</a>. Others have pointed out that this is a multifaceted problem, and security only treats symptoms, not the sickness.</p><p>"It's not a one-off situation. It's not some random crazy guy," a streamer who goes by the handle <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blau" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blau</a> <a href="https://x.com/JojoPoehls/status/1896663929956536524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> of Hofstetter's situation during a recent broadcast. "This is the result of festering dialogue and conversation around women – around women creators especially. So before we start calling for 'Oh, we need security' [and] 'Oh, we should be more careful with IRL streams,' we need to start holding these fucking toxic clickbait engaging accounts, creators that are farming incel takes – we need to hold all of that accountable."</p><p>But in the meantime, streamers making millions, like Siragusa, can afford security. Avery told Aftermath that in Siragusa's case, that’s the plan.</p><p>“The team is currently looking to increase security on [Siragusa’s] property,” Avery said, “including more cameras, fortified perimeter, and hired security guards.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman"><h3>Major Publishers Can’t Keep Making Fewer, Bigger Games</h3></a><p>"Destined to fail.

            <p>
If you've spent anytime at all plopping stuff down in 2019's wonderfully soothing minimalist city builder Islanders, there's a fair chance you've been won over enough that a sequel is potentially quite exciting indeed. So brace yourself: publisher Coatsink has announced Islanders: New Shores, and it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this "summer".
</p>
<p>
The original Islanders, to recap, was a game about strategically cramming as many amenities as possible onto a tiny (but visually pleasing) randomly generated island - all while attempting to maximise your score by making the most of each amenity's adjacency multipliers. That probably doesn't sound hugely exciting, but its chill vibes and relaxed action made for an unexpectedly hypnotic experience - a space management game as compelling as it was soothing.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Islanders: New Shores, a gently expanded follow-up promising the chance to "explore, build, and strategise like never before". This time around, Coatsink - which acquired the franchise from original developer Grizzly Games in 2022 - has teamed up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/steamworld-build">SteamWorld Build</a> studio The Station, and it's touting a variety of new features for its sequel.

<p>
For starters, New Shores introduces "boons" - one-time power-ups unlocked as players amass points, used to gain an advantage on tougher stages - plus two distinct modes of play in the form of High Score and Sandbox, each with their own saves. Elsewhere, there's talk of 44 unique building types and seven island properties, as well as a photo mode with its own filters and a turntable camera. You can get a taste of New Shores' action in the trailer above.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for Islanders: New Shores just yet, but it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368930/ISLANDERS_New_Shores/">Steam</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch this "summer". And if it's anywhere near as good as its predecessor, it should be well worth keeping an eye on. Christian Donlan called the original Islanders a "thoughtful spin on strategy" and a "classic" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/islanders-console-edition-review-a-gloriously-dreamy-approach-to-city-building">his Recommended review</a> back in 2021.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/rainbow-six-siege-board-game-reprint-and-new-expansions-coming-courtesy-of<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em> board game reprint is on the way. Steamforged Games has announced a crowdfunding campaign so that those who missed out on the first campaign can enjoy the board game adaptation of Ubisoft's shooter. The campaign has two new expansions for returning fans.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/6-siege-pre-order" rel="nofollow">Gamefound campaign page</a>, the <em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em> board game reprint will include the base game and all of its expansions. As the name implies, the game is a tabletop adaptation of Ubisoft's competitive tactical shooter.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-board-game-reprint-operator-miniatures.jpg?itok=SWyFX6gV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-board-game-reprint-operator-miniatures.jpg?itok=vHY4hrXC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Two to four players play as a team of Operators and try to either eliminate their enemies or complete objectives before they do. Each Operator has a unique kit or special ability, allowing you to breach through walls, fortify defenses, or set up special weapons and gadgets. The base game contained 20 Operators with the expansions introducing 40 more.</p>

<p>If you already backed the <em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em> board game, this reprint campaign has two more expansions. One is a map pack, introducing the Skyscraper and Villa environments alongside cardboard obstacles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed by a prominent Call of Duty leaker that Warzone 3 won’t happen alongside Call of Duty 2026 if Verdansk’s revival fails to retain enough players. That includes either those currently playing or those returning for the map’s revival next month.</p>



<p>Warzone has been in a sorry spot for a while, and Verdansk’s imminent return is expected to move mountains, but for how long?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-road">End of the Road?</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1896672391457349981">TheGhostOfHope wrote</a> a few exclusive details about Modern Warfare IV – otherwise dubbed ‘COD 2026’.</p>



<p>Amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other details</a>, he claimed that Warzone 3 won’t be implemented alongside next year’s Call of Duty title if Verdansk fails to perform when it’s brought back alongside the Season 03 update. Earlier today, Activision revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/">Season 03 is delayed</a> to April 3 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone to allow more time to finesse the update.</p>



<p>In March 2020, Call of Duty: Warzone was released to an overwhelmingly positive reception, with tens of millions of gamers worldwide pouring their hearts and souls into the battle royale. It changed the face of Call of Duty, creating an entirely new ecosystem that stood at the top of the genre for quite some time.</p>



<p>Things have changed since then, though.</p>



<p>Warzone has been on the rocks for a while, but Activision is hoping that Fornite OG-style event can bring back millions of players. It was claimed recently – also by TheGhostOfHope – that Verdansk will return as it was in 2020, which is sure to be a blast from the past for many players.</p>



<p>Do you think Verdansk is enough to save Warzone, or will the map’s imminent failure prove to be the final nail in the coffin for Call of Duty: Warzone?</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-2026-is-being-developed-for-the-next-generation-xbox-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1124229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s been claimed that Call of Duty 2026, which is assumed to be another Modern Warfare title is in development for the next generation Xbox.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to break the news after it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 of Black Ops 6 would be delayed until April</a>. </p>



<p>According to Hope, the 2026 title is not being development for past generation consoles (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlike Call of Duty 2025</a>) and is being developed for the next generation of Xbox. If true, this could be our first real hint that the next-gen Xbox could release around Fall 2026.</p>



<p>Also pointed out by Hope is that apparently if Verdansk does not bring players back to Call of Duty: Warzone, a third game in the free-to-play Battle Royale will not release.</p>



<p>Officially, Activision nor Microsoft have released any information on Call of Duty 2026, or even Call of Duty 2025 at this moment in time. But according to our sources, the next game in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty franchise is a Black Ops 2 seque</a>l headed once again by Treyarch Games following rough internal decisions that saw Sledgehammer Games wanting to develop their own fully-fledged Call of Duty title for 2027.</p>



<p>As always, take such rumors with a grain of salt, but Call of Duty 2026 being in development for the next-generation Xbox console is an interesting tidbit of information, if true.</p>



<p>What do you think of the next generation of Xbox potentially releasing in 2026? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen-consoles.1711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

Additionally, it appears that some of these mobile games may not even exist, as only Guitar Hero Mobile has been officially acknowledged on Activision's social media.</p><p dir="ltr">The ads for these rumored games are reportedly appearing on Facebook and Instagram, and contain a link to a survey where players can share their opinions on the games, which have not yet been released.</p><p dir="ltr">The Guitar Hero Mobile ad in particular seems to have truly upset players who have viewed it. Art for the game features four oddly shaped guitarists, each holding an even more oddly shaped red guitar. The strange look of the ads doesn't appear to be the result of Activision trying out a new art style, but instead features what players believe to be the hallmarks of AI-generated art: blurry, oddly shaped, and non-cohesive assets.</p><p dir="ltr">Even stranger, it appears that some of these mobile games may not actually exist. Guitar Hero Mobile, Crash Bandicoot Brawl, and the Call Of Duty titles have yet to be officially announced by Activision, and Guitar Hero Mobile is the only game with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" rel="nofollow ">an ad that's viewable</a> outside of Facebook and Instagram ads.</p><p dir="ltr">Eagle-eyed fans did manage to dig up a <a href="https://store.geeklab.app/p/f6c46a6e325cb82fbb206399" rel="nofollow ">Guitar Hero Mobile page on Geeklab</a>, a mobile marketing platform that helps developers gauge player interest. Geeklab's website says it exists to "create app store pages before the app is released, test product pages, research competitors, build assets, run surveys, run A/B tests, and optimize app stores." Clicking "get" on the Guitar Hero Mobile page <a href="https://lab.geeklab.app/survey/7562005b447f52556c832f82?tq=267a0d4c6151982266fa5a03d97051&amp;pid=3252054" rel="nofollow ">takes players to a survey</a> (also hosted on the Geeklab site).</p><p dir="ltr">The two Call Of Duty titles and the Crash Bandicoot Brawl mobile game do not yet appear to have Geeklab pages, nor do they have official pages on Activision's website, but Facebook and Instagram users are asserting that ads for all three games--plus Guitar Hero Mobile--are regularly running on the two Meta-owned social media sites. Art featured on the Guitar Hero Mobile Geeklab page also appears to include AI-generated assets, according to players. In addition to the bizarre shape of the guitarists and their instruments, the speakers on the stage appear to be facing in multiple directions at once.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thank you Activision," reads one sarcastic player comment on the Guitar Hero Mobile Instagram post. "Thank you for killing any interest I may have had in your games. Makes not supporting you way easier."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision declined to comment when asked about these ads and their reported use of AI-generated assets.</p>

<p>During an IRL livestream, popular streamers Valkyrae, Emiru, and Cinna were stalked and harassed by a young man who threatened to kill them. The stream ended abruptly, but thankfully all three women and their staff were unharmed after the disturbing incident.</p>



<h2 id="h-stream-stalker-charges-at-and-threatens-streamer-trio">Stream Stalker Charges at and Threatens Streamer Trio </h2>



<p>During the multi-day Sis-a-Thon stream, hosts Valkyrae and Cinna were hanging around Santa Monica Pier yesterday with fellow streamer Emiru when the incident occured. The trio, along with members of the camera crew, walked past a young man crouching on the ground who asked for Emiru’s number. She declines and the group decides to move on, but the man says “I’m going to keep following her.”</p>



<p>After being followed for some time, despite asking him to stop, the group attempts to leave. The man then gets into an altercation with one of the friends of the group, and when the streamers call for security to intervene, he charges at them, threatening first to fight them before saying “I’ll kill you right now.” After distancing themselves from the man, amidst more calls for security, the stream ended.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Soon after the stream ended, both Cinna and Valkyrae took to Twitter to tell fans they were alright, but also to inform them that the Sis-A-Thon would be ending as a result. The next day, Valkyrae went back on Twitter to <a href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1896613433245614442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address</a> baseless accusations that the incident was staged, while also criticizing those that stirred up hate towards the women earlier during the stream:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Seeing accounts that have harassed us for a 10 second clip of downtime during a 24/7 marathon accusing us of “just begging for subs, women do nothing” to then farming engagement from this stalker situation while we IRL stream has been so sad to see. Seeing accounts accusing my friends and I for faking this and blaming us instead of questioning the man’s behavior has been embarrassing to see. I’ve learned it doesn’t matter how much I accomplish in this industry or how much I try to gain respect, some men will hate women and blame women no matter the situation.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pockets-triumphant-light-expansion-just-gave-water-decks-another-powerful-card-and-everyones-a-little-over-it.1124154/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pockets-triumphant-light-expansion-just-gave-water-decks-another-powerful-card-and-everyones-a-little-over-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When Pokemon TCG Pocket first launched, the meta quickly came to be dominated by a very small handful of decks. One of those, centered around Misty and water-type Pokemon, came to be hated early on due to its potential to overpower opponents early on based entirely on how well some coin flips went. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, three expansions later, you would think other cards would have swooped in to replace or counter Misty decks. But instead, Pokemon TCG Pocket's latest expansion just added a new card that makes Misty decks stronger than ever, and a lot of players are kind of over it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, it's not that Misty decks are necessarily the most powerful in the game. It's that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">the luck-based nature of Misty makes losing to them feel very, very bad</a>. Misty is a Supporter card, with the unique ability to allow the user to pick a water-type Pokemon, and flip a coin until they land on tails. They then attach a water-type energy to that Pokemon for every heads they flipped. This could result in a player attaching 0 water-type energy, effectively wasting a deck spot on the card and a supporter card play. Or they could attach 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 energy, or more, if luck is on their side that day. A well-flipped Misty could allow a player to win on turn one in certain situations, before the opponent even has a chance to make a move. Or, in more common scenarios, the user gets enough bonus energy to bring extremely powerful cards online before their opponent can build a meaningful defense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that's fine and dandy, but what's made Misty worse are the numerous cards in subsequent expansions that have made it even more powerful. Mythical Island added Vaporean, which has an ability allowing players to essentially move all that bonus energy freely around between their water-types. Space-Time Smackdown brought Manaphy in, which adds <em>even more water energy</em> to the board. Both expansions saw new, powerful water-type Pokemon that can make use of that energy, such as Palkia ex and Gyarados ex. As a result, water decks have been at the top of the meta consistently for multiple expansions in a row.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, with Triumphant Light, there's <em>another</em> card out there making Misty decks even more hellish: Irida. Irida, like Misty, is a Supporter card, but its effect is that it can heal 40 damage from each Pokemon that has any water-type energy attached. Up to this point, grass-type decks have been the healing experts. But with Irida, water-type decks can make significant comebacks as long as they've collected and spread out enough energy...and between Misty, Manaphy, and Vaporeon, they're very likely to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For what it's worth, some Pokemon TCG experts are offering a pretty logical explanation for Irida. In TCG Pocket, decks are limited to 20 cards That means if you want to add something like Irida, you need to take something else out. Water decks are simply swimming in good cards - at a certain point, players must weigh whether or not it's actually worth removing Misty for a card like Irida. Some players are speculating that developer DeNA added Irida in an effort to crowd Misty out and force players to make tough choices about which Supporters to include. But that doesn't mean plenty of wise deckbuilders haven't found ways to include both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the player above points out, Pokemon TCG Pocket is gearing up for a regularly-scheduled event, where rewards will be doled out for going on win streaks in the game's online competitive mode. The best reward, a gold profile badge, will be given out for winning five matches in a row. This is surprisingly difficult to do, and even moreso when many decks you'll be facing can sweep you away within the first few turns if they flip coins correctly, and have backups like Irida to save them even if the flips go bad for them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect to see a lot of water decks during this event and for a long time to come. In fact, at this point, it may just be worth playing one yourself if you're not already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Just one week after it admitted to using generative AI in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> for a number of assets, the publisher is now being accused of using generative AI again to promote a different game: Guitar Hero Mobile. But even as audiences criticize the promotion, sharp-eyed fans are discovering that Guitar Hero Mobile may not even be a real game in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guitar-hero-mobile-ad-ai-art/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Insider Gaming</a>, the generative AI in question appears to have been used in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram ad for the newly-announced Guitar Hero Mobile</a> posted two days ago. The ad features four guitar players on a stage in very similar poses with similarly-blobby red guitars, surrounded by distorted speakers that look suspiciously like washing machines and some mass of blobby microphones directly behind them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In front of them is an audience that includes a number of visible legs that don't seem to belong to anybody, and down the center is a Guitar Hero track with incorrectly colored tracks and blobby, inconsistent notes, some of which don't color match the track they're on. Put together, all of these issues are tell-tale signs of generative AI art, and given Activision's recent track record, it's pretty likely that's what's happening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the comments, fans are furious. "Shows how much effort went into this when you can't even get your own game right," reads one response. Another calls the ad "Lazy AI slop," while another reads, "you’d think a giant company like Activision would have some budget for a real graphic designer". A fourth says, "Wow. It appears they're still using midjourney 1.0. I haven't seen AI art this bad since the early days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't where the weird generative AI ads end. As a few websites such as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/activision-comes-under-fire-for-using-ai-art-to-gauge-interest-in-new-mobile-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a> and <a href="https://80.lv/articles/activision-gets-criticized-for-ai-generated-mobile-game-advertisements/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80.lv</a> have pointed out, Activision appears to have quietly dropped a number of generative AI-created ads on Instagram for a smattering of games that haven't otherwise been announced by the company. These include a Call of Duty Zombies mobile game, something called Call of Duty: Sniper, and something else called Crash Bandicoot Brawl. At the time we're writing this, none of these ads are viewable publicly on Activision's official Instagram, but the Guitar Hero Mobile game ad is still <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available via direct link</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where this gets even weirder is that fans have managed to <a href="https://store.geeklab.app/p/f6c46a6e325cb82fbb206399" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a page for Guitar Hero Mobile</a> on a website called Geeklab, complete with even more AI imagery. Geeklab is a user acquisition and insight company that allows publishers to create "look-alike" store pages for mobile games in order to test user interest. Clicking "GET" on the Guitar Hero Mobile page <a href="https://lab.geeklab.app/survey/7562005b447f52556c832f82?tq=267a0d4c6151982266fa5a03d97051&amp;pid=3252054" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">takes users to a survey</a> that claims "This isn't a real game, but could be some day!" and asks them a number of questions about why they clicked on the ad and how likely they would be to play something like Guitar Hero Mobile.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>OFFICIAL: Activision is currently looking into making a new COD Zombies mobile game. The kicker?</p><p>They're using AI Generated advertisements in order to garner interest on it. </p><p>Full story below:</p><p>Recently, an official Call of Duty Instagram ad has been posted a few hours ago… <a href="https://t.co/CQeQYiVwFq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CQeQYiVwFq</a></p></div>— COD: Zombies News (@MargwaNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/MargwaNetwork/status/1895612833821536676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">What appears to be happening here is that Activision launched some sort of ad campaign to gauge user interest in a number of possible mobile games that don't exist yet. Because those games aren't real, it used generative AI for its advertising art, and confused the heck out of fans who otherwise would have been stoked for an actual Guitar Hero Mobile game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes just one week after Activision admitted to using generative AI in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Said generative AI assets were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">actually discovered and called out back in December</a>, but it took the publisher nearly three months to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">admit it had used generative AI in Call of Duty loading screens, calling cards, and other in-game art</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision declined to comment to IGN for this piece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The visuals also received a significant overhaul, and the 23-year-old game looks nice on modern consoles. The graphical upgrades coupled with the chilling soundtrack help create a tense and unsettling atmosphere. That said, the combat system is rather repetitive, but if you're in the mood for a straightforward PS2-era shooter, The Thing: Remastered is worth checking out.</p><p>And if you'd like to watch the film first before playing, Amazon has the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thing-Blu-ray-4K-UHD/dp/B098Z28MSY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original horror classic on 4K Blu-ray</a> for less than $20.
