			<p>Discounty is a cosy Supermarket simulator in the vein of Stardew Valley. You’ll be ordering products, stocking shelves, and then selling them to the various townsfolk of Blomkest in an effort to expand your business. Unfortunately along with that comes dealing with inattentive local government, shady local businesses, and backstabbing journalists as it seems something in this town is rotten. And all you wanted to do was run a supermarket.</p>
<p><iframe title="Discounty | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbNGAedv08M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You arrive in the town of Blomkest to take over and reinvigorate your Aunt’s business, the local Discounty supermarket, where “everything’s always on sale!” As you wander through the town, you stroll past the bank, town hall, a bar, all the usual places you might expect, but there’s also abandoned buildings dotted around and a memorial museum that is no longer maintained since the council cut funding. Then you’re shown to the trailer where you live for the whole game – no house upgrades here – and told to ignore the mysterious shed behind it that emanates strange noises.</p>


<p>As you get stuck into managing the supermarket, you’ll be ordering stuff, putting it on display, and then manning the cash registers. You don’t set the prices yourself, instead hammering them into a calculator based on the price in your big book of products. It’s pretty enjoyable at first. There’s a zen-like calmness to it when you don’t have too many customers, but when you do, you to have to rush around refilling shelves whilst also serving them and cleaning the floor, which is hectic and results in frustrated customers. I quickly decided to have multiple shelves with the same item at a time so I didn’t have to rush around so much. With a bit of mental maths, you can speed up manning the till as well, saving yourself from the angry faces from impatient customers.</p>


<p>But there’s a litany of things that get in the way of this. Most products are bought form a computer and then quickly delivered by a guy called Guy, which is perfect. You do also need to arrange trade deals with local businesses for access to their products, though, which means running around town every time you want to restock their products, upgrade the trade deal, or ask them something. Stocking your shelves is the limited to grabbing things from the store room in groups of five. Only need to display two toilet rolls? For some reason have to pick up five and put three back, adding unnecessary time and fiddliness.</p>
<p>As customers shuffle around once you open at 9AM, they leave scuff marks on the floor, but you can only clean two scuffs at a time with soap before needing to take the bucket back. Then one of the customers who got everything they were shopping for and, if anything, you managed to serve quicker than the others leaves with an angry face for no discernible reason – nothing you can do about that. At the end of the day, 5PM, you close the shop and sit through the unskippable summary of sales, which is doubly redundant as you need to manually keep track of stock, and because you served everyone yourself. The only information I really need on this page is how much money I made and it doesn’t need to be listed per product, one at a time, whilst I wait for it to finish.</p>

<p>The shop doesn’t open on Saturday, so you might as well skip the day and get through to Monday, where you’ll have to replace all the posters around town, because they’re removed every weekend for no good reason. Oh, but you’ve probably forgotten to print them and the only printer in town, which is in the town hall, takes eight in-game hours to print a single one.</p>
<p>I quickly lost my enjoyment of Discounty because of all these elements. Management games can be cosy, but not when constantly putting frustrations in my path. I was enjoying completing small challenges to unlock more products, add more pockets to my outfit, get an improved scanner, and the actual act of selling was fun, but restocking while serving customers is&nbsp;next to impossible when there’s a lot of customers without angering them all. Every time one of the issues above shows itself again – which is pretty much every day for some of them – my enjoyment diminishes.</p>
<p>The overarching storyline seemed like it might be a plus at first as well, but something isn’t quite right. Sometimes plot threads are just left unresolved. You start out in a trailer and that seems like a signal for “you’ll be able to upgrade to a house at some point,” and the abandoned house you find shortly afterwards reinforces this, but in the end it just doesn’t happen. Then there’s the townsfolk, who are the most infuriating and obnoxious group of NPCs I’ve ever encountered. Everyone is gossiping, myself included, but one character admonished me for apparently starting a conversation with gossip about her own son – all I did was press to interact! Elmer in the town hall has be constantly hounded to do things he’s supposed to, such as removing a tree that is cutting off the only access to nearby farms, or fixing a broken staircase.</p>

<p>All of this involves sprinting across Blomkest on top of your other outings to restock your trade deal products that only restock on specific days. It’s infuriating. I just wanted to run a supermarket, not deal with red tape, incompetent government officials, unpleasant people, and getting loans. Even your Aunt in the game says “I didn’t catch you slacking, did I?” as she enters the store you moved into town to revitalise for her. Everyone just seems so unpleasant, and the “small town drama” promised by the game’s marketing just means whe the worst person you know would describe as “spilling tea”, as they spread rumours and bad mouth people behind their backs.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, I’ve been playing on a Switch, and my experience hasn’t been great. There’s no crashing or anything, but anytime you’re outside of a small building the frame rate tanks noticeably. It’s a very nice looking game as far as pixel art goes, with plenty of nice looking visual effects depending on what time of day it is, but the frame rate is consistently terrible when outside. There’s also some small oversights in behaviours, such as once when a staircase was blocked off for way longer than it was supposed to, but I saw Barbara, my fishy sticks supplier and uses the stairs in her commute, walk straight through it without so much as a pause.</p>

<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159338/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has spent the past few decades going from strength to strength with Mario Kart, so it’s not hard to see why companies holding other recognisable IP have wanted to take a crack at the kart-racer formula to see if they can pull a following of their own. While plenty of copycats have popped up over the years, one that’s made the most sense has been the Sonic franchise, as high-octane speed is kind of the titular character’s whole appeal.</p>
<p>Sonic hasn’t always had the most enjoyable outings in the racing world, but he’s also had some that have gotten awfully close to matching Nintendo’s golden goose. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is one such entry, combining thrilling action and controls with an interesting multiverse gimmick to make for a worthwhile and enjoyable experience. It’s just a shame that the base Switch really struggles to run it well.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159323/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay in Sonic Racing: Crossworlds is roughly par for the course with what you’d expect for a kart racer, as you drift, boost, and trick your way to victory across a series of three-lap, four-race cups that incorporate mind-bending courses and locales.</p>
<p>Effectively drifting corners, timing your boosts, and seizing on shortcuts are all part of a hard-fought victory, while occasional item drops add an X factor that can both give you the edge you need to win first place or torpedo a lead that you’d been holding onto. Overall, the items feel well balanced, and they help to keep things interesting as their influence constantly changes up the formation of a race.</p>
<p>Tracks primarily consist of a mixture of original courses and reimagined versions of classic Sonic courses from across the main series, such as Radical Highway from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2</a> or Water Palace from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/sonic_rush">Sonic Rush</a>. Overall, course design is extremely strong, with multiple routes adding to the replayability and strategy, while the constant jumping between land, sea, and air portions keeps things feeling fresh and fast-paced. Everyone will naturally have their favourites, but it’s tough to argue against the overall quality of these tracks. There’s really not a bad one in the bunch.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159335/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most importantly, the central ‘Crossworlds’ gimmick makes the courses feel dynamic in a way that most other kart racers struggle to replicate. Upon nearing the end of the first lap, the competitor currently in the lead will be given a choice between two <em>alternative</em> courses you will then traverse for the duration of lap two. So, you can begin a race in Seaside Hill, then jump to Mystic Jungle for a lap before returning to Seaside Hill to finish things up. Given that any stage can appear at the end of lap one, each contest feels fresh and exciting given that consecutive races starting on the same course can have radically different routes to the finish line.</p>
<p>If you want to mix things up beyond the base Grand Prix mode, there’s also a Race Park mode. Here, you participate in a variety of side challenges that task you with alternative goals beyond simply being the first to cross the finish line. One such challenge is a team-based mode in which you’re given points for how many times you can tap a teammate with your vehicle throughout the race, while another is centred on hitting as many foes with weapons as possible. Though Race Park doesn’t radically shift away from the core concept of racing, it helps to mix up the gameplay a bit and gives you some nice extrinsic rewards for doing so, such as new part unlocks.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159329/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Though there’s plenty of strategy that goes into charting a racing line and knowing when to time boosts and item drops, much of a victory can hinge on decisions made before you even get on the track. There’s an extensive selection of parts you can swap out with any given kart that affect stats like acceleration and weight that help give you the edge in a race, depending on your chosen loadout.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the Gadget system gives you a variety of passive power-ups that can stack the deck in your favour, such as increasing the frequency of specific items or reducing the time it takes for mid-air trick animations to play out. I really appreciated the customisability here, as it not only allows you to tailor loadouts to specific playstyles, but consistently rewards you and reinforces continued play.</p>
<p>Naturally, a big part of the experience here is found in playing the online multiplayer, and I’m happy to report that it‘s just as crazy and thrilling as couch multiplayer, even if it’s a bit different not having someone next to you to talk smack with.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159337/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In my experience, there were no dropped connections or notable slowdowns, and lobbies were (obviously) full in seconds. To add a bit more to chase beyond the raw fun of a race with real people, there’s also a progressive ranking system that awards points based on your race performance.</p>
<p>Visually, this racer is a little bit of a mixed bag, combining high spectacle and brilliant effects with overall low performance that notably hampers the moment-to-moment gameplay. On one hand, the courses themselves are absolutely gorgeous, and the constant twists in the track design and explosions from various items being fired make the screen a veritable feast of energy and verve. On the other, the base Switch hardware just isn’t up to the task of running this all very well.</p>
<p>At <em>best</em>, this game is running at 30fps, which is already feels barely passable for a high-intensity racer like this. But the rapid-fire action frequently sends the frame rate into the low 20s to high teens. Add just one other player for splitscreen action, and the frame rates sink even lower. Performance feels roughly the same between docked and handheld modes. Combine this with the generally low and grainy resolution (especially when viewed on a Switch 2 screen in handheld mode), and this is comfortably the <em>worst</em> way to play this otherwise enjoyable game.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159334/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s far from an unplayable mess, but take one look at footage of how this looks and plays on stronger hardware, and — however predictable it is — it’s tough not to feel like the Switch port is a notably inferior product.</p>
<p>And whether this Switch 1 version is improved when running on Switch 2 is a bit of a toss-up. On the base Switch, you trade S2's faster loading times and somewhat better frame rate for a better visual experience, with the game's low resolution being less noticeable on the 720p handheld screen.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds is a genuinely excellent game, but the Switch version is just 'alright'. The dynamic track designs, high replayability, and thrilling visuals all combine to make for a game that — judged purely on that content — stands as a strong competitor to the dominant Mario Kart series.</p>
<p>But the poor visual quality and resolution present in the Switch version drag down the overall experience and make it feel like a much more mediocre experience. I'd still give this port a light recommendation; it’s a fair choice if Switch is the <em>only</em> platform available to you, and ultimately justifies the price of admission. Otherwise, I’d suggest waiting to see how the upcoming Switch 2 version pans out, or picking it up now on another platform.</p></section>

			<p>A Kingdom Come Deliverance remaster or upgraded version is rumored to be in the works for an early 2026 release, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumor originates from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bertik11/">bertik11</a>, who shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1nuoprk/warhorse_studio_upcoming_upgrade_and_fantasy_game/">Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a> that the first entry in the series by Warhorse Studios will get an upgrade early next year, between January and April. The user added that the studio is not working on a new Lord of the Rings game as rumored, but is still working on their own fantasy game.</p>



<p>While a rumor coming from an unspecified source should be taken with a massive grain of salt, bertik11 proved reliable regarding Kingdom Come Deliverance series rumors. Last year, the user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1erxl3d/kingdom_come_deliverance_2_is_coming_in_2025/">revealed that Kingdom Come Deliverance II would be delayed to 2025</a> before the official announcement was made and that the game's Gamescom booth would have a medieval village design, which turned out to be the case, so there's a good chance they indeed have access to insider information.</p>



<p>Although Kingdom Come Deliverance was a solid role-playing game when it launched back in 2018, a remaster would improve the experience considerably if it addressed some of its most critical issues. Quality-of-life improvements, in particular, would make it a much more accessible game, improving its steep learning curve and interface to make it easier for those who only played its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">excellent sequel</a> to get into the game and experience the beginning of Henry of Skalitz's story for themselves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze has canceled&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>, its in-development live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game, and a number of employees are being laid off across the studio as well.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">first announced back in December 2023</a>, has been shut down so that the studio can deploy its resources to "accelerate the growth" of its "flagship&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise".</p>

<p>The cancellation will cost Starbreeze around SEK 255 million (roughly $27.2 million) in "non-cash impairment" form, and it'll also result in the laying off of around 44 employees. Both decisions will, according to Starbreeze, allow the studio to become "cash-flow positive" next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starbreeze-payday-focus-layoffs-project-baxter.jpg?itok=_fFjrSfj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starbreeze-payday-focus-layoffs-project-baxter.jpg?itok=1g5K_QqN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze's live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>&nbsp;game&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>&nbsp;is no more.</figcaption></figure><p>It's all part of a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-presents-updated-strategy-doubles-down-on-payday-and-expanding-the-heisting-genre/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">corporate refocusing</a> on Starbreeze's part, with the studio looking to leverage its&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise and "the heisting genre" as a whole much more in the future.</p>

<p>According to Starbreeze, the new strategy will revolve around "deepening player engagement, broadening platform reach, and diversifying revenue streams", and it'll include expanding&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>"across platforms and experiences".</p>

<p>As part of this new strategy, Starbreeze says it will create "new games and experiences that broaden the heisting genre" beyond the studio's "core projects". These will include "spin-offs, narrative-driven projects, and franchise expansion to new platforms".</p>

<p>Another pillar of the developer's new strategy is work-for-hire operations, through which Starbreeze will complete work on projects for other publishers and studios. That work could well cross over with&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>in future, as well, such as in the case of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-layoffs-baxter-canceled.jpg?itok=GDPBlpeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-layoffs-baxter-canceled.jpg?itok=wEtxbbRp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze wants to refocus its business around&nbsp;<em>Payday</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Starbreeze's strategy shift comes just days after the company was widely pilloried for the introduction of a&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>DLC subscription, which itself was introduced following a price hike for a one-off purchase of all currently-available DLC for the game.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, however, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-dropped-the-ball-starbreeze-admits-it-botched-payday-2-subscription-rollout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> that the price increase was unrelated to the introduction of the subscription model, although commercial exec Gustav Nisser admitted the studio "dropped the ball" with regards to the subscription's rollout.</p>

<p>The shift to a focus on<i>&nbsp;Payday&nbsp;</i>also follows a pretty dismal couple of years for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, the latest game in the series, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">plummeting sales</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departing executives</a>&nbsp;not exactly contributing to an optimistic overall outlook for the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn recently released native Steam Deck build delivers significant performance improvements over the original Proton Windows build, according to a new comparison video.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a>, the new build of the survival-horror game developed by Bloober Team runs much better than the original Proton Windows build in nearly every comparison.</p>



<p>While hitting a steady 60 FPS is something the Steam Deck obviously can't do, even with a native build, the performance improvement it brings makes the game often run above 30 FPS, even in demanding areas like the Apartment Complex, where the system struggles to even hit 30 FPS with the Proton Windows build.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Cronos The New Dawn: NEW Steam Deck Native Build Performance Vs Proton Windows Version" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2k1FFgbBofc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While any game benefits greatly from a 60 frames per second framerate and higher, with its slower-paced survival-horror experience, Cronos: The New Dawn is more than enjoyable even at 30 FPS, as it relies mostly on atmosphere to deliver one of the finest games released by Bloober Team. You can learn more about it by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">checking out my review.</a></p>



<p>The release of native Steam Deck builds is a relatively recent happening, but one that is extremely welcome to extend the life of the system which essentially started the PC handheld craze of the past couple of years. <span>Besides the Cronos: The New Dawn build, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/">B</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/" target="_blank">aldur's Gate 3 native Steam Deck build is also now available for download</a>, introducing performance improvements in the city of Baldur's Gate in Act 3, one of the most demanding areas in the game.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-crossed-a-line-that-shouldn%E2%80%99t-be-crossed-says-ex-capcom-designer.1314583/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Pocketpair's announcement that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/palword-launch-2026-pocketpair-polishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would launch version 1.0 of Palworld in 2026</a>, industry veteran Yoshiki Okamoto, who has worked for a long time as a designer at CAPCOM on series like Resident Evil, Street Fighter, Mega Man, Dino Crisis, and more, shared his opinion on the situation with Nintendo's Pokémon in a video message <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIhdKKNRnI0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on his personal YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p><em>I personally believe Palworld crossed a line that should not be crossed, and I don't want the world to become a place where this kind of thing is acceptable. I don't want it to be like, it's okay because it sold well, or because it was fun, or because it has good reviews. If a settlement is reached with Nintendo, then I think Palworld will become a game that is officially fine to play. However, it is currently a game that's being sued, so it’s unacceptable. By playing the game, you are supporting it, so please do not buy it.</em></p>



<p>However, Okamoto's opinion was met with a mixed reception. Several fans pointed out that some of the games he worked on also featured very similar elements to games that were released before. </p>



<p>As a reminder, Nintendo notoriously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued the developer in September 2024</a>, alleging infringement of patent rights, and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-says-game-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-palworld-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued in court</a> that game mods do not count as 'prior art'. The ongoing lawsuit forced Pocketpair to <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make some changes to the game</a>, such as removing the ability to summon Pals with spheres, earlier this year.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Pocketpair announced a farming sim spin-off (<a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-palfarm-farming-game-spin-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld: Palfarm</a>) just eleven days after Nintendo unveiled its own cozy farming game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-pokemon-spin-off-cozy-farming-game-nintendo-switch-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, currently in development at Koei Tecmo for a planned 2026 release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <p>Starbreeze has cancelled its Dungeons and Dragons project to focus on its flagship Payday franchise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">Codenamed Project Baxter</a>, it was revealed back in 2023 and was aiming for a 2026 release. Few details were available, but it was planned to have "the signature Starbreeze game cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-model, community engagement and a larger than life experience".</p>
<p>However, following a "strategic review", development has been discontinued as the board of directors and management have "concluded that resources are best deployed to accelerate the growth of" the Payday series.</p>

<p>As a result, the studio will incur a non-cash impairment of around SEK 255m (around £20m).</p>
<p>"This was a difficult but necessary decision," said Adolf Kristjansson, CEO of Starbreeze, in a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>"Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze's position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders."</p><p>The studio stated "part of the Baxter team will be redeployed across Starbreeze's projects, most prominently within Payday" and where "internal opportunities are limited, Starbreeze will provide active support for affected employees to transition to new roles across the industry". It estimates there will be a reduction in headcount of around 44 full-time employees and contractors.</p>
<p>Starbreeze boasted the Payday games have engaged over 50 million players globally, generating almost SEK 4bn in lifetime gross revenue.</p>
<p>"We are doubling down on what our players love - and what we do best - owning the heisting genre," said Kristjansson. "Payday is more than a game - it's a genre we created and continue to lead. By redeploying talent and capital, we can bring innovation to heisting gameplay faster, while also laying the foundation for the future expansion of the genre."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-acquires-publishing-rights-to-troubled-payday-3-says-move-will-accelerate-development-roadmap">Starbreeze acquired the publishing rights to its Payday 3 game</a> from Plaion, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-likens-launch-to-being-a-rock-band-when-the-whole-stage-collapses-and-everyone-leaves">launched disastrously</a> in 2023. The acquisition would enable the studio to "significantly accelerate [its] content development roadmap, and pursue broader strategic opportunities for the Payday franchise as a whole," said board member Thomas Lindgren at the time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After years of successful collaborations with different video game franchises, Sony has struck a deal with Hasbro’s Wizards of the Coast directly, selling their best-known characters directly into Magic the Gathering.</p>
<p>Launching on 27th October, seven direct-to-consumer products will arrive in a limited print run as part of the PlayStation Secret Lair Superdrop. These are:</p>


<ul>
<li>Secret Lair x The Last of Us Part I</li>
<li>Secret Lair x The Last of Us Part II</li>
<li>Secret Lair x God of War: Greek</li>
<li>Secret Lair x God of War: Norse</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Uncharted</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Horizon: Into the Forbidden West</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Ghost of Tsushima</li>
</ul>
<p>Each ‘Secret Lair’ is a set list of usually five or six defined cards, and will feature the characters and lore of the associated franchise. While the full card lists are yet to be announced, you can be sure we will cover each of them as we know more, ahead of each one launching.</p>
<p>The first drop, featuring God of War’s Kratos and his son Atreus, goes on sale on October 27th at 5pm UK time (9am Pacific Time).</p>


<p>You need to beware generally sell out within an hour, so if you’re a fan, make sure you sign up for alerts at secretlair.wizards.com.</p>
<p>Hasbro’s best-selling cash cow, MTG —&nbsp;which made a whopping 82% of their operating profits last year — has just come off <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/why-magic-is-how-it-is-in-2025-and-why-everything-changed">a record-breaking quarter for profits</a>, thanks to<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/final-fantasys-crossover-conundrum-why-nobody-can-preorder-magic-cards/"> the Square Enix collaboration</a>, at 95%.</p>
<p>‘Universes Beyond’, the subsection of Magic with direct tie-ins to real-world franchises, has been crucial to Hasbro’s bottom line, featuring the likes of Doctor Who, Cloud Strife and SpongeBob Squarepants (rather than original characters like ‘Magic’s Pikachu’ Loot, or his carers Jace and Vraska), widening the appeal of the game to new fandoms.</p>
<p>The summer’s MTG x Final Fantasy release was an unprecedented success, with its employees noting that they simply couldn’t print the product fast enough. This lead to the scenes earlier this year where Collector Booster boxes were selling for $1k apiece.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Secret Lair Superdrop is significantly smaller in scale than MTG x Final Fantasy was, which contained several hundred unique cards. Instead, this is seven sets of defined cards, which will sell for a significantly lower price — $39.99 for the regular versions or $49.99 for the foil (shiny) versions (or the equivalent amount in your local currency).</p>
<p>And unlike MTG x Final Fantasy, which could be bought from your local Waterstones, these Secret Lair drops can only be bought from WotC directly, as part of a very limited print run… before hitting the secondary market at a massively inflated price.</p>
<p>While the more recent Spider-Man collaboration with Disney’s Marvel has yet to appear in financial reports, community sentiment seems to be that it has not sold as well. Indeed, resale prices for individual cards are, on the whole, significantly lower than their Final Fantasy counterparts.</p>
<p>We will bring you more information on each of these secret lairs, and whether the cards within them are any good, as soon as we know more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is closing another Final Fantasy 11 server to new players because it's proven too popular.</p>
<p>Back in July, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/23-years-after-its-release-final-fantasy-11s-biggest-server-is-closed-to-new-players-due-to-popularity">popular Asura server was closed</a>, meaning new players would be unable to join. Producer and director Yoji Fujito said at the time the overpopulation "has led to a series of unexpected issues that have managed to affect the quality of that experience somewhat."</p>
<p>As a result, players have instead moved to the next popular server, Bahamut, which has now met a similar fate.</p>

<p>"Bahamut has consistently had the second most concurrent users out of all Worlds and has been close behind Asura in terms of total character population, leading many new adventurers to begin their journeys there," said Fujito in a <a href="http://www.playonline.com/pcd/topics/ff11us/detail/22742/detail.html">new statement</a>.</p>
<p>"While we are pleased to see these Worlds bustling with activity, having too many concurrent users can overwhelm server processes on that World, which affects server responsiveness and increases the likelihood of other related issues."</p>
<p>From 9th October, players will no longer be able to transfer characters to Bahamut, nor will they be able to create new characters. The Vana'diel Adventurer Recruitment Programme will also be suspended for the server.</p>
<p>Fujito added Asura remains closed as the server load remains unchanged despite a slight decrease in player population.</p>
<p>All of this is occurring 23 years after the MMORPG first launched.</p>
<p>So why are so many players returning or joining Final Fantasy 11? There were discount campaigns earlier in the year that have contributed, but it's also due to a crossover with MMORPG follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, which has seen a decline in players following its less popular Dawntrail expansion.</p>
<p>As for Final Fantasy 14, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-and-final-fantasy-14-are-collaborating">Monster Hunter Wilds collaboration is on the way</a>, which will add new mounts and a new battle scenario.</p>

However, not happy with the stunning attention to detail, dinky little game carts, and interchangeable screens that the vanilla Lego GB is rocking, one master builder has decided to bring hers to life.</p>
<p>In what's got to be some sort of record for a mod turnaround, Australian Game Boy modder and self-taught circuit-board designer <a href="https://nataliethenerd.com/">Natalie the Nerd</a> has got her Lego handheld playing real GB games via real carts with nary a Raspberry Pi or other modern doodah in sight.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6zuilxo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Indeed, this is the real deal, with Natalie explaining to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/790093/lego-game-boy-natalie-the-nerd">The Verge</a> that she put together a bespoke Game Boy circuit board with actual chips, and all that other stuff that goes inside these things. Magic and that.</p>

<p>Working with the "smallest screen kit on the market", the main target in this build was to get a circuit board inside the set that was smaller than the dimensions of the set itself, which she has achieved, albeit by removing one or two bricks.</p>
<p>The Game Boy's buttons, which aren't yet finished, will be set onto a bespoke PCB and, with the whole thing already wired for USB power, she says she'll release the circuit-board designs once she's done with the build, ensuring that everything can indeed be awesome for us all. Hooray!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.nataliethenerd.com/i-turned-the-lego-game-boy-into-a-working-game-boy-part-1/">Natalie goes into much more detail about the planning and build process on her blog</a> - we highly recommend you give it a read!</p>
<p>Now, you'll have to excuse us, we're off to build our own set. It won't play games, though, so Natalie has sort of ruined it now. Do any of you folks know how to build circuit boards?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dd-co-op-game-project-baxter-canceled-starbreeze/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/d-d-co-op-game-project-baxter-is-canceled-by-starbreeze-to-refocus-on-payday-franchise.1314538/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Project Baxter, the D&amp;D based cooperative game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in December 2023</a> by Starbreeze, has been canceled by the Swedish game developer. The news was <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-presents-updated-strategy-doubles-down-on-payday-and-expanding-the-heisting-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared this morning by Starbreeze</a>, which is 'refocusing' on its owned IP, PAYDAY, according to CEO Adolf Kristjansson:</p>



<p><em>I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support. Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into PAYDAY and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on PAYDAY, we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed.</em></p>



<p>Project Baxter was slated to launch in 2026, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-is-still-in-pre-production-yet-starbreeze-says-its-on-track-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still in the pre-production phase in February 2024</a>, which made us skeptical at the time. The decision to discontinue this D&amp;D game might have been a mix of problems with the project and the desire to fix the PAYDAY franchise, which has suffered due to the poor reception of the third installment and, more recently, due to the controversy surrounding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PAYDAY 2 subscription</a> and the simultaneous (<a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-admits-mistake-payday-2-subscription-infamous-collection-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now reverted</a>) price increase of the Infamous Collection DLC bundle. This cancellation comes with a write-off of a $27 million investment for the game and the decision to fire around 44 employees between internal developers and external contractors.</p>



<p>Perhaps at some point, we'll get a glimpse of footage of Project Baxter to see what could have been.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-open-world-dd-rpg-from-hidden-path-shown-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It happened in June</a>&nbsp;with the canceled D&amp;D open-world RPG that was in development at Hidden Path.</p>



<p>As a Dungeons and Dragons fan, I hope no more games attached to the franchise get canceled. There's still a healthy lineup on the way, between Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked (out in 2025), a new game from Invoke (the studio behind Dark Alliance), and an action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull. Last month, the president of Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-wizards-of-the-coast-head-wants-new-dd-mmorpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confided that he'd love to see a new D&amp;D MMORPG</a>, though he also suggested it won't be happening any time soon, if at all.</p>

            <p>I’d almost missed that that Motorslice now has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2830030/MOTORSLICE/">Steam demo</a> out, despite enticing gifs of its Brutalist wallrunning and slicey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Rising</a>-tinged chainsword combat repeatedly finding their way into my Bluesky feed for months. I’m liking it so far, though don’t let its swingbars and trundling excavator enemies trick you into thinking this is some light platformer jaunt.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It is, in fact, quite tricky. Motorslice drops hints of wackiness – its name is derived from the practice of slamming your weapon into a wall and being yanked along by its cycling, biting teeth – and yet traversing the concrete megastructure requires care, even patience. P, your waifu-bait freerunner, has strong hands and lead feet, so there’s a weightiness to movement that’s easy to underestimate, especially on the transition between moves. I hit the dirt multiple times by wrongly expecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>-tier sharpness when pinging across walls.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>I'm using official screenshots because mine all came out motion-blurred to bits. Settings slider for the full game maybe hopefully please? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Top Hat Studios Inc.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's not sluggish, mind. It’s just a matter of getting a feel for P’s pace, after which it becomes much more satisfying to chain together hops, runs, and slides into smooth, almost rhythmic sequences of hazard-dodging. Once you’ve got a handle on it, the sense of exertion becomes an outright strength, especially during the demo’s climax: scaling a titanic, malevolent dump truck, its constant rumbling only heightening the peril of making a slip. Like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, if the Colossi were the kind of industrial machinery you’re not supposed to operate after having a paracetamol.</p><p>Fighting the lesser construction 'bots is also harder than it looks, albeit in a much quicker, punchier way. While a chainsaw stroke bisects them in a single hit, you’re just as fragile yourself, and the enemy diggers are both faster and more numerous than your anime tomboy. Non-boss battles are, thus, all about getting in quick and striking first, chopped actuators forming heaps in the sand before your blade finishes revving down. Brief yet bright flashes of near-instinctive action, to counterbalance the more considered parkour.</p>
<p>No release date on this one, but I’m glad there’s seemingly more to Motorslice than <a href="https://x.com/RegularStudio_/status/1869053388518006963">parryposting</a>. Here’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2830030/MOTORSLICE/">link to the demo</a> again.</p>

<p>According to director Naoki Hamaguchi via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-says-the-key-to-a-good-looking-switch-2-port-is-not-compromising-on-lighting/">Automaton</a>, making sure the lighting from the original remake was retained on Switch 2 was crucial to making the game look great. Instead, processing load from other areas were reduced to get the game running at a stable 30fps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I believe lighting is the crucial factor in terms of graphics quality and expression in this day and age."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to express gratitude that the team has become a model-case for delivering a high-end game on the Switch 2, before delivering some wisdom that other developers would do well to take on board for their own ports in the coming years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In our experience, if you just use the hardware properly, you’ll be able to deliver games at the quality players expect. All in all, my honest opinion is that Nintendo Switch 2 is a truly amazing piece of hardware.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's only a few months to go until Final Fantasy VII Remake launches on the Switch 2 on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. We honestly can't wait to see exactly how the game holds up on Nintendo's new hardware, and we're thrilled that Rebirth and the untitled third entry will also be following suit in the months and years to come.</p>

			<p>It appears that even the developers of Silent Hill f did not anticipate such a positive reaction from critics and fans. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NhEFMQmxm1g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on an IGN Japan livestream during Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, producer Motoi Okamoto said:</p>



<p><em>I'm grateful that it was rated higher than I'd expected. I think you'll understand if you play it, but since it's a game with a lot of challenges, I thought there might be some pros and cons, but it's been very well received, and it has a Metascore of 86, the same as the Silent Hill 2 remake. Well, I was really surprised.</em></p>



<p>That doesn't necessarily mean future installments will follow the Silent Hill f formula, though:</p>



<p><em>We'll be putting out something different, with a different flavor. We want to explore all sorts of different aspects of game design and story.</em></p>



<p>Later, Okamoto clarified his statement <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1972230163380535537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a tweet published on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>As I said in the interview, not all future Silent Hill games will have the same gameplay as f, but rather I want the series to always be challenging in a good way, so that players can enjoy a different flavor of gameplay with each installment.</em></p>



<p><em>Of course, there are some things that will remain the same, the most important of which is the quality of the story. I am convinced that a psychological story is essential to what makes Silent Hill unique, and I will continue to focus on that point and release future titles with confidence.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>



<p><em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em></p>

            <p>
I have been sort of enjoying former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive producer Mark Darrah's reinvention as a Youtuber who trades insider BioWare anecdotes for merch. He's got an actual T-shirt line, including a T-shirt for babies upon which Mark threatens to "pump NFTs" unless you buy his gear. Respectable Crazy Uncle energy. Maybe don't invite him to your kid's baptism. But maybe do watch his new video about what might happen to EA's many development studios in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">the company's $55 billion acquisition</a> by Donald Trump's son-in-law, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the gilded suits of Silver Lake.
</p>
<p>
The tl;dr/tl;dw is that Darrah thinks EA's various sport game teams, like Madden and EA Sports FC, are probably fine under the new privately-owned EA. Those games bring home a lot of bacon, after all, and EA's new dads in Riyadh are keen on sports in general. He's less confident about the studios clustered under EA Entertainment, and especially those such as Darrah's old joint BioWare who might have more pronounced cultural objections to the new ownership, based on the kinds of stories they tell.

<p>
Darrah - who worked at BioWare for 23 years before leaving in 2021 - prefaces his comments with the disclaimer that he is not a proper financial analyst or a solid source of hot tips for investors, noting "that any attempt that I've ever made to predict what a stock is going to do has been wrong, even when I've tried to take my wrongness into account". Nonetheless, he argues that EA "has been looking to change its corporate structure for a while", with plans including "a potential merger with NBC Universal", and that the acquisition will likely accelerate that transformation, because the consortium who bought EA did it with $20 billion of borrowed money, and the interest on that loan is going to stack up fast.
</p><p>
There follow some hypothetical napkin calculations in which Darrah suggests that EA might have to pay a billion dollars a year, just to keep up with the debt. For context, EA<a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf"> reported net income of $1.273 billion in the year ending March 31st 2024</a>. "So, the company as it currently stands is in a dangerous position." 
</p>
<p>
Going private will save EA some money by getting rid of the "giant accounting group that's necessary to prepare your finances for your public statements", but this will be a drop in the ocean, Darrah continues. He thinks we can expect job losses across EA's organisation, and possibly even some studio closures.
</p>
<p>
Which teams might be particularly affected? Well, Darrah reckons EA Sports at large are "very safe", primarily because they make a lot of cash. Darrah notes that around three-quarters of EA's revenue in 2024 came from live service projects, and that EA's various football and American football series accounted for a large chunk of that cash. 
</p>
<p>
He also notes that Saudi Arabia's PIF - who previously owned around 10% of EA shares, which have now been rolled into the acquisition - are partial to investing in sporty things, whether as a means of relieving Saudi Arabia's dependency on oil revenue, or as a distraction from the Saudi government's tendency to treat women like second-class citizens and have critics of their rule imprisoned or killed.</p><p>"It's hard to imagine that acquiring a $55 billion media company, which is ultimately what EA is, won't play into that effort, won't be used in some way to further their own political goals in terms of public perception of the country," Darrah comments. One comparison point here is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">Ubisoft's recent collaboration with the PIF to make an Assassin's Creed: Mirage DLC pack set in 9th century AlUla</a> - it's arguably government-sponsored virtual tourism.
</p>
<p>
Darrah thinks the various developers and series grouped under EA Entertainment could be in trouble, however. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, at least, is "a consistent cash revenue source". As for Battlefield, "I guess we will see what happens with Battlefield 6". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>? "Potentially not" a good fit for the "messaging desires of the three groups that are involved in the acquisition", but the series does make money. Which leaves the studios who haven't shipped anything yet, or not in a while, or who've shipped games that did terribly.
</p>

<p>
"The groups working on the Marvel games and, of course, BioWare are, I think, going to be in a different position," Darrah notes. "If this is a PR move for the Saudi government as much as it is a financial one, the studios that don't have much of a track record, what you might do is just come in and put your thumb on the scale and push their messaging in directions that you want, in directions that make you look good or at the very least, steer them away from messaging that makes you look bad. 
</p><p>
"But for the studios that have more of a track record, especially a track record that maybe doesn't line up with your own political views - again, BioWare - you're going to look at that studio and wonder how you make them fit into your new structure," he goes on. "It's hard to imagine that you have BioWare pivot from having very progressive messaging to having the reverse, because it's what the government wants. It's hard to imagine that the public perception of a game that comes out of BioWare, even if you do do that, isn't apocalyptically bad. 
</p>
<p>
"So in that case you either have to decide that you're willing to just leave it alone, or you have to think that they don't fit anymore within the goals of this new organisation."
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, my own experience of working for arch-capitalists sitting on giant hills of money is that they are generally OK for you to swing left, providing this adds to the height of said giant hill of money. After all, Disney were happy to profit from Andor. I have no real insight on Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, but I suspect they'll be absolutely fine with BioWare expressing all kinds of progressive positions in-game, providing BioWare are sufficiently lucrative. BioWare don't, however, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/01/23/dragon-age-inquisition-performed-half-as-well-as-expected-says-ea/">appear to be sufficiently lucrative for EA</a>, at least under the old regime, so perhaps Darrah is right to suggest that the new owners will seek to sell them off or shut them down.
</p>
<p>
In addition to dangling the prospect of studio sell-offs or closures, Darrah broaches the possible sale of EA intellectual property. EA have historically avoided selling their IPs, Darrah says, because management have not wanted to risk handing off a promising property to a competitor that then proceeds to earn eleventy-squillion dollars. "But as this deal closes, those incentives could radically change," Darrah goes on. "We could enter into a situation where now the incentives are to shed costs or generate revenue if at all possible. We need to generate revenue to pay down as much debt as we can as quickly as we can. We need to cut costs to give us more wiggle room to make sure that we are not in a dangerous position when servicing our debt."
</p><p>
He notes that "EA has a huge repository of dormant IPs that are just sitting there dormant. It seems unlikely that the new resulting structure is going to be eager to suddenly revive a bunch of those IPs. So, one option might be to sell the whole lot of them for $100 million if you could get it, because $100 million can come off the debt." 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
He posits that the acquiring consortium might even try to sell the entirety of EA Entertainment to a group with "deep pockets, like say Sony". Perhaps this has been the plan since the acquisition was first discussed. "It is conceivable that EA's new structure was intentionally conceived with this action in mind. Or you could imagine that what happens is this new [owning group] plucks all the parts it wants out of EA Entertainment and then sells off whatever is left over." Whatever happens, "it's incredibly unlikely that EA stays exactly as it currently is in a private structure, especially carrying $20 billion worth of debt."
</p>
<p>
Darrah does suggest that there might be an upside to the acquisition for a studio like BioWare, in a side-commentary on the rhythms of financial management at publicly-owned companies. He argues that the quarterly earnings report cycle of a public company doesn't make much sense for how videogames are developed, because game projects tend to be an on-going cost for years followed by a "burst" of revenue. 
</p><p>
This is part of the reason companies love live service projects with steady monetisation, Darrah says: it doesn't just increase the returns but renders them more predictable. Private companies don't have to report their financials, he says, which means that "if they want to see a studio go dark for 25 years in order to investigate some sort of radical new way to develop games, they can do that."
</p>
<p>
He paints a more optimistic picture of a possible future "where you have EA Sports generating revenue, being this source of cash, servicing the debt and paying money into whatever structure ends up being formed. And then on the other hand, EA Entertainment being tasked with something different. Still making money, but with different time horizons. maybe simply with a goal of making games that sell the most that they possibly can sell regardless of when they release or making games that make EA look good".
</p>
<p>
Even if that comes to pass, however, Darrah seems convinced we can expect job losses and potentially studio closures and the flogging of entire gameworlds, as EA's new owners try to rustle up a few billion for the bank. In what is perhaps a show of Darrah's sense of the idea's viability, he doesn't discuss the recent insider claim that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">EA's new owners are gambling on generative AI as a cost-cutting measure in order to repay the debt</a>.

<p>The game was original released a decade ago for PS4 and Xbox One, but now the licenses for the core soundtrack are expiring.</p>
<p>As such, the game will no longer be available to purchase and download from 5th October, while DLC song packs will gradually be removed once they hit the ten year mark themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, if you own the game already it will remain in your library, as will any purchased songs.</p>
<p>"We're so grateful for the passion this community has shown," said Harmonix. "From the team, it's been a special experience to serve you with Rivals challenges, a super deep downloadable content library and a best in class band sim. If you've been meaning to grab a few last songs, now's the time."</p>
<p>The statement was shared on the game's subreddit.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has announced that player housing will be coming to World of Warcraft starting 2nd December, ahead of the Midnight expansion launch.</p>
<p>This initial rollout for housing will not be feature-complete, with the full suite of mechanics arriving when it enters the game proper at Midnight's launch sometime in 2026. With the housing release in December, players will be able to buy a plot of land, establish a neighbourhood with other players, and begin designing your home with a selection of decor items.</p>
<p>Future updates to housing will include hundreds of decorations, including some furnishings that come from older achievements and content from prior expansions such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-warcraft-legion">World of Warcraft: Legion</a> Order Hall completion.</p>

<p>In addition, players will be able to level up their houses over time, which provides increased interior and exterior decor placement budget, fixture budget, and room placement budget. Neighbourhoods can be both private and public, allowing those from the same guild to build up an estate of sorts together within a variety of biomes.</p>
<p>Not only that, but neighbourhoods will be able to participate in endeavors. These are monthly neighbourhood events that provide exclusive decor to use on participants' homes. As such, some level of community collaboration is intended for the housing system.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight is the second part of a three-part trilogy, which started with The War Within last year. It'll take players back to Silvermoon city, where the Blood Elves are having a rough time fending off void ne'er-do-wells. In addition players will be able to play as the Haranir as an allied race, a faction of note throughout The War Within's narrative.</p><p>When Blizzard first announced housing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-shares-first-look-at-world-of-warcrafts-housing-with-unsubtle-dig-at-rival-final-fantasy-14">it did so with a subtle jab at Final Fantasy 14, another popular MMO with its own housing system and housing-related problems</a>. It's worth noting that unlike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, housing isn't limited in World of Warcraft, so players won't be <em>unable</em> to get a house come December, which is good!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/judas-is-similar-to-bioshock-in-some-ways-but-also-radically-different-in-others-says-creator.1314469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Award-winning game designer and writer Ken Levine, known for his work on System Shock 2 and the BioShock franchise, talked about the similarities and differences of those games with his next title, Judas, currently in development at Ghost Story Games.</p>



<p>In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbdgQpA6Uc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published this week by YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>, Levine claimed that while there are familiar elements (such as dual-wielding powers and weapons), Judas will be radically different in many ways. He also said it can be considered somewhere between BioShock and the first System Shock, meaning it's more complex and offers greater player expression and depth than the most recent BioShock titles.</p>



<p><em>There are parts of Judas that are more similar to Bioshock, and there are parts of Judas that are really, really radically different and it's nice to have some things that you're familiar with. I'm sure people noticed there's a gun in one hand and you got powers in the other hand. We have an additional hacking thing which we haven't shown off that much, but the way the game works and the way the game is populated and the way you choose between these relationships is something we've never ever done before. The way the world is decorated, the way encounters come in, the way you choose paths in the game, those are all so radically different. The way the story is delivered, too. It was good to start with some basis, but this is probably the biggest radical departure we've made since, you know, since I did BioShock. This is more of a departure in some ways than BioShock was to System Shock 2.</em></p>



<p><em>Judas is sort of somewhere between BioShock and System Shock, not between BioShock and System Shock 2, in terms of its depth. It's just a bigger game and a more complex game, but it's in service of doing something we started in BioShock Infinite, which is really how do you build a relationship with characters in games that feels way more granular than you normally see in games where you're really just making a few big choices, but really low-level reaction and commentary, being able to play people off of each other and feeling people getting angry at you and then being able to pull them back from the edge of that anger to and then maybe piss somebody off at the same time. That was what we're most interested in. Also, Infinite felt a little light to me on player expression, so we went back a little more towards player expression and build depth.</em></p>



<p>Levine <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first discussed the 'narrative LEGOs' concept around ten years ago</a>. It wasn't until The Game Awards 2022 that Ghost Story Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled Judas as its debut project</a>, but fans had to wait until March 2024 to get a lot more info from the man <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a massive 75-minute interview featuring Geoff Keighley, Ryan McCaffrey, and Levine himself</a>. </p>



<p>In late August, Ghost Story Games shared the first developer log <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/388860/view/538863491448045972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, confirming that work had finished on the Villainy feature that will ensure emergent gameplay between the player and the game's three potential villains:</p>



<p><em>When you play BioShock or BioShock Infinite, the villain is always going to be the villain. Fontaine, Comstock — they’re always going to be the bad guys. In Judas, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the VILLAIN. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals.</em></p>



<p>Judas still has no official release date, but Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-mafia-the-old-country-is-a-wonderful-premium-title-seems-to-confirm-judas-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included it in the company's 2026 lineup</a>.</p>

            <p>Fresh off of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-rabbit-and-pork-is-finally-out-and-adds-30-new-quests">releasing the massive mod's first DLC</a> earlier this week, the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> have confirmed that they've still got no plans to port it to the next-gen update version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>. There is, however, one factor that could lead them to reconsider doing so.</p>
<p>Since Team FOLON's take on a post-apocalytic English capital released last summer, playing it has required downgrading your copy of Fallout 4 to an older iteration released prior to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-update-fallout-4-for-your-next-generation-pc">April 2024's next-genning of Bethesda's RPG</a>. With the next-gen update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-sized-fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-has-been-delayed-indefinitely-by-bethesdas-incoming-next-gen-update">arriving out of the blue just ahead of Fallout: London's planned initial release</a>, the modders opted to put it out on this older version for stability reasons, following a delay that allowed them to explore their options.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In response to the downgrade requirement being raised again on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1234891241184038973/1422862310489325580">Fallout: London's Discord server</a> yesterday, project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter weighed in to make clear Team FOLON's current stance on it. "We have the skill to put it on the next-gen [version], we just do not want [to]," he wrote.</p>
<p>"The current next-gen [iteration] has issues Bethesda Game Studios still [hasn't] fixed and would likely be broken by any future update that they may also do on a whim," the modder continued. "Thus, we have no plan to move it to the next-gen. If however, BGS allows console access for mods of this scale, then that is a potential different conversation."</p><p>Given the much tighter restrictions/limitations console mods have long had compared to PC, it'd take a substantial change to make a Fallout: London port possible, at least if you wanted the mod to be anywhere near as large and complex as the current version of it is. So, more of a pipedream at this point, but something it's still cool to see Team FOLON leaving the door open for.</p>
<p>For now, downgrading on PC's still your only option if you fancy checking out the mod's freshly released add-on Rabbit and Pork. It's not a problem if you're playing via a GOG-bought copy of Fallout 4 due to that storefront's built-in downgrader, but for those with Steam copies, you'll need to use the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/1">downgrader mod</a> Team FOLON put out. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-will-require-a-brand-new-save-team-folon-confirm-but-it-sounds-like-other-future-add-ons-wont">Starting a fresh save is also a requirement</a> the first time you fire up after installing the fresh update which delivers the DLC.</p>
