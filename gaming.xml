		<p>Playing Skate makes my knees creak. That’s the weight of remembering Skate the first time around. That’s the weight of expectation heaped on a series that had arguably reached its apex with Skate 3 in 2010. That’s the weight of trepidation at a new, free-to-play business model, in something that’s about vibes, not business. Fortunately for my knees, the longer you spend with Skate, the more you find that it is – in Early Access at least – an ideal way to return to this beloved skateboarding franchise.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. | Early-Access Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p14MSdRtNIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Skate is about vibes. It always has been, and that is immediately the most compelling thing about this new version. Out in the city of San Vansterdam, you can do whatever you like. Want to find the best line through an interesting set of benches and plinthes? Go for it. Want to climb to the top of a skyscraper and launch yourself off? You can do that too. Want to just pootle about, listen to music and make your character look cool? That’s also an easy, and welcome, option.</p>


<p>Skate has always acted as an antithesis to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater. Time constraints, ridiculous combos, blast furnace locations, are plenty of fun, but they only capture a very slim – and utterly unrealistic – vision of skateboarding. Skate has always aimed to capture the lifestyle – focus on one trick, hanging our with friends, the sheer difficulty of pulling off that one trick – and that’s what you’re getting here.</p>


<p>A lot of that comes down to the control scheme. Skate set out to replicate skateboarding as closely as possible, and its authentic, classic controller scheme is here in full, putting the control of your board almost entirely onto the right analogue stick.</p>
<p>Newcomers may be glad to find that there’s also a refreshed control scheme here too. It’s still based around the right analogue, but it’s more straightforward, and removes a layer of difficulty that has always made Skate the boarding game one for true aficionados. It wouldn’t be in keeping with the scene to gatekeep this skaters’ paradise. That makes this the most welcoming version of Skate, without taking anything away from it. Want the pure, unadulterated experience? That’s still here too.</p>
<p>San Vansterdam is a playground, but it’s also a full, open-world city. There’s cars, stairs and all sorts of other things that aren’t very friendly to skateboarders, and it’s fair to say that your face and the sidewalk are going to become intimately acquainted. You have to learn what kind of surfaces work for you, and the designers have thankfully made sure that there’s more spots here than you can shake a skateboard at. If you’re into skateboarding, it’s almost painful to imagine a location this good for riding. At least you can experience it digitally.</p>

<p>While Skate is freeform, it also gives you lots and lots of things to do. Missions and challenges can be found throughout the city, with the aim being to raise your rep in each area through hitting lines and owning spots. It’s all about earning points, grabbing collectables and maximising the flow of your tricks through particular sections, and it feels great. There’s rewards for most things, and within a couple of hours you’ll have a bunch of clothes and different boards to deck your character out with.</p>
<p>That brings us to the free-to-play element of the game. There are two currencies at play in Skate, one premium one and one earned through gameplay. The premium one can be used in the shop to buy specific branded items, with a rotating selection that changes every day or two. The one you earn through play can be spent on lootboxes, with different areas of the city having different gear. You can see what’s in those loot boxes, but you’ll get a random item when you buy one.</p>
<p>The whole thing reminds me of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, in that it’s completely and utterly superfluous to the game itself, but chances are you’ll end up spending at least a little cash on a cool jumper or the wildest deck in the shop, or maybe splurge on the premium reward track of Season 1. The free stuff is generous enough though, at least in Early Access, and it makes Skate practically essential to check out.</p>

<p>Much was made after the game’s reveal about the more stylised visuals and… well, you don’t notice all that much, except for in those hard-earned replays when you’ve done something really cool. While the boards and clothing all look great, the beards suck, and they look like someone has literally stuck a plastic beard on the front of your face. Here’s hoping that it’s on somebody’s radar.</p>
<p>There are some really nice touches here though. You can grab music from any speaker out in the world – my favourite is grabbing it from a passing car – and add that playlist to your library, with a great variety of music types to go with it, and there’s a nice balance between established artists and underground acts.</p>
<p>The map also shows all the other players on your server and where they’re congregating so you can head straight over there and join in. You can stand and watch others attempting cool tricks or trying to clear a crazy jump, and it just feels like you’re a part of something, part of the community, even if you’re a solo player rather than in a party.</p>

<p>I’ve been waiting for Skate. Tony Hawk’s frantic take on the sport is cool, but it doesn’t feel as good as this. The freedom, the variety, and the community, are already in place, the only thing missing, is you.</p>

<p>"Whether generative AI is involved or not"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ca3bcec3923ed"><a title="Nintendo Logo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca3bcec3923ed/nintendo-logo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has posted a short statement denying that it has lobbied the Japanese government on the subject of generative AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220">The post on X</a> was made following a tweet by Japanese politician Satoshi Asano, who originally claimed the company had been lobbying the government on the subject of generative AI.</p>
<p>Here's the full statement, as posted in English following the original Japanese version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI. Whether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Asano has since deleted his original post and issued apologies, <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974739623692644460">linking to Nintendo’s post in one</a>. Here’s the content of his second post, as translated via X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the content I posted the other day, there was a section with incorrect information, which I have corrected as follows. I deeply regret my own failure to verify the facts adequately. I would like to apologize once again to all related parties and will strive to prevent any recurrence. Additionally, regarding the original post that contained the incorrect information, it has been confirmed that it is being disseminated again after appearing in X's trends, so to prevent the further spread of information that differs from the facts and to avoid causing any more trouble, I have just deleted it. Once again, I will take this as a lesson and make use of it moving forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This comes as controversial generative AI technology is being used increasingly in the field of game development, and soon after Open AI’s Sora 2 went online and was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">quickly filled with unofficial video clips</a> created via user prompts featuring Nintendo characters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendos-bowser-comments-on-ai-and-its-uses">Back in April</a>, on the topic of generative AI, NOA president Doug Bowser said: "We still believe that what makes our games special is our developers, their artistic capabilities and their insight into how people play, so there's always, always, going to be a human touch and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake Born From a Wish DLC and the Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are likely to be announced soon, according to a known insider.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Speaking on X</a>, Dusk Golem, who correctly provided news regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-transmission-announcements/">the revival of the KONAMI survival horror series</a> before the official announcement, stated that new announcements regarding last year's remake of the second entry in the series, including the remade higly-requested DLC expansion, the Xbox Series X|S versions and a new PlayStation 5 Pro patch to address <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-playstation-5-pro-looks-better-performance-mode/">some of the issues still found in this version of the game</a> shouldn't be too far off in the future. The announcements are likely being tied to the promotional cycle and release window of the Return to Silent Hill movie, which is based on the second entry in the series and will launch on January 23, 2026.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2) Silent Hill 2 Remake, the PS5 Pro patch likely be timed with some announcements, Born From a Wish DLC should be announced sooner or later, &amp; likely Konami is tying it around the window of the upcoming Return to Silent Hill movie based off SH2.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1975058939093078093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As Dusk Golem's track record isn't spotless, we have to take today's statements with a massive grain of salt. At the same time, the Silent Hill 2 remake official website was updated over the past few days in a way that<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nyr5z9/in_bloober_teams_website_silent_hill_2_remakes/"> suggests the remake could launch on other formats in the future</a>, so there's little doubt that KONAMI and Bloober Team are likely gearing up for some announcement, in light of the game's PS5 console exclusivity ending on October 8.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake launching on other gaming systems is good news, as the remake developed by Bloober Team is a game that any survival horror fan should experience. You can learn more about it by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Chris's review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Outsiders, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-hellsinger-rock-on/">rhythm FPS game Metal: Hellsinger</a>, has been shut down as part of Funcom's <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/">recently confirmed layoffs</a>. Funcom's Stockholm studio has also been impacted as part of the cuts, though it's unclear if the entire branch has been shuttered as well.</p>



<p>Former studio creative director and founder David Goldfarb <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1975200395128610955">confirmed the news in a statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, saying, "<em>I have not had much time to process the news but all of us at The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm</em> <em>have been affected by the layoffs at Funcom and our 10 year old studio will be closing." </em></p>



<p>"<em>Many of us have survived</em> <em>a near-death studio experience years back when Darkborn was cancelled, and because of this team's loyalty and refusal to quit, Metal: Hellsinger was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.</em></p>



<p><em>We had hoped to do something even better this time - things don't always go the way you hope. But we are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form If you think you can help in any way, with business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is, I would be genuinely grateful if you reach out here. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting. Thanks so much</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Goldfarb also posted the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/locust9_friends-i-have-not-had-much-time-to-process-activity-7380961160872841216-XIbs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">same statement to his LinkedIn account</a>, where he added that writing the statement "<em>sucked</em>" and that he was "<em>afraid to press post because it will make it real. Oh well.</em>"</p>



<p>Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-acquires-majority-stake-in-the-outsiders-founds-new-romanian-studio/">acquired The Outsiders back in 2021</a>, while the two studios were already working on Metal: Hellsinger with Funcom as the game's publisher. The studio had been independent for six years before being acquired.</p>



<p>When the layoffs at Funcom were confirmed last week, Funcom did not initially say how many developers were impacted. According <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-acquires-majority-stake-in-the-outsiders-founds-new-romanian-studio/">to The Outsiders' official website,</a> at least 30 developers were employed at the Sweden-based studio. </p>



<p>In Funcom's statement regarding its layoffs, it claimed that its new survival MMO, Dune: Awakening, was "<em></em><em>the biggest release we've had in our 32-year-long history of making great games</em>." The cuts were made due to Funcom deciding it did not need the same number of developers as work on Dune: Awakening transitioned from developing for launch to maintaining it and creating new content.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Japanese gaming giant Nintendo has denied lobbying its native country's government over generative AI, although the company does say that it intends to continue taking action against anything it perceives as intellectual property infringement.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Nintendo says that it "has not had any contact with the Japanese government" regarding generative AI, "contrary to recent discussions on the internet". The studio closes by saying it will "continue to take necessary actions" against IP infringement, "whether generative AI is involved or not".</p>

<p>The message was seemingly posted in response to <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-apparently-lobbying-japanese-government-in-fight-against-generative-ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a>&nbsp;(thanks, Nintendo Everything) by Japanese House of Representatives politician Satoshi Asano, who said that Nintendo "avoids using generative AI to protect its IP" and that the company was "engaging in lobbying activities with the government".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-generative-ai-lobbying-denial-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=dcJTiuib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-generative-ai-lobbying-denial-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=qrNQ3PWb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo, the studio behind games like&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, has, in fact, not been lobbying the Japanese government over generative AI.</figcaption></figure><p>Asano himself apologized for the inaccuracy of his original statement and the misleading information contained within, posting a lengthy explanation and apology <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974812318761631821" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on his X account</a>. He's also deleted the original post in order to "prevent further dissemination of inaccurate information" (according to machine translation).</p>

<p>If Nintendo was lobbying the Japanese government over generative AI, though, it likely wouldn't come as much of a surprise, given the company's past statements about the controversial technology.</p>

<p>Back in July last year, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">said it had no plans</a> to utilize generative AI during any of its development processes, with president Shuntaro Furukawa pointing to "issues with intellectual property rights" and the responsibility of Nintendo to "deliver value" as sticking points.</p>

<p>The legendary gaming company is famously hawkish when it comes to pursuing legal action over its intellectual property. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">currently suing</a> Pocketpair, the creator of survival game&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">patent infringement</a>, and it's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">aggressive</a> on the legal field in this regard <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-subpoena-request-pokemon-teraleak-identity" rel="nofollow">before</a>, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-generative-ai-lobbying.jpg?itok=nrT_JqIb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-generative-ai-lobbying.jpg?itok=yFsqkjbK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you want to know how protective Nintendo is over its IP rights, ask the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's stance on generative AI puts it at odds with many of its peers, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow"><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>studio Krafton</a>, streaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a>, and fellow gaming titans <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, among others.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo isn't the only gaming luminary to express doubts about generative AI; others, like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow"><em>BioShock</em>'s Ken Levine</a>, have also evinced skeptical positions on the tech, so Nintendo is far from alone in being cautious.</p>

              <p>Earlier this year, Microsoft ramped up the price of its current-gen consoles. The 512GB Xbox Series S jumped up from $300 to $380, with all the models above it seeing similar price hikes. Well, <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">Microsoft is at it again</a> as the company decided to tack on an extra $20 to make it an even $400 as of October 3. This comes alongside the announcement that the various levels of Xbox Game Pass are getting some light rebranding along with, you guessed it, price increases. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/">However, looks like someone forgot to tell Amazon because right now, you can score the 512GB Xbox Series S for just $329.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Digital Gaming Console</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/">This Xbox gaming consoles comes packed with one controller and an internal storage of 512GB</a>. A full 1TB version is available but that one is not on sale at the moment. This game system is disc-free meaning all the games you play will need to be downloaded onto the consoles or onto an external SSD which can be purchased separately. Some games are avail to be streamed from the cloud with the right Game Pass subscription as well.</p>
<p>The console does not support 4K gaming, but it still produces a resolution higher than the standard HD, rendering at 1440p. Through apps and streaming subscriptions like Netflix, HBO MAc, and Disney Plus, you can enjoy TV and movies in full 4K. It’s got HDR support to really make sure those dark spots stay dark and that vibrant colors brightly pop. A game like the newly released <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> looks awesome in HDR on a proper screen as so much of that game exists in solid black areas with radiant colors sprinkled throughout.</p>



<p>You can even play&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>for free with a subscription to Xbox Game Pass. This does come with the small caveat of that price jump announced earlier this week. The top tier of this video game subscription service just went up from $20 a month to $30. A 50% price increase to the premiere game service alongside price increased for consoles across the board doesn’t exactly feel great. There are however some great titles on the Essential tier of Game Pass which is just $10 per month. On that tier you’ll find games like&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>,&nbsp;<em>Psychonauts 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tunic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>. You may not be getting day one first party launches there but there is a deep treasure trove of awesome titles waiting to be played.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-cheaters-caught-within-30-minutes-activision/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-says-it-is-catching-%E2%80%9C97-of-cheaters%E2%80%9D-in-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-%E2%80%9Cwithin-30-minutes%E2%80%9D.1317502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-october/">multiplayer beta is officially live</a> as of this past weekend and open to the entire public as of yesterday, October 5. When it launched, even in its early access state, reports began appearing online that <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-cheaters-already-running-amuck/">cheaters were already running amuck throughout the beta</a>. </p>



<p>As we come out of the early access period and into the all-public period of the beta, Activision updated players on the state of cheaters in a long post on <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1974942752485077132">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where it claimed that it was catching "<em>97% of cheaters</em>" within "<em>30 minutes of their first sign-in</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Cheaters were expected</em>," Team Ricochet writes. "<em>But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat. Those who did manage to slip through didn't last long. Most never made it into a match.</em> <em>You may have seen clips of cheaters in the Black Ops 7 Beta. We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media. We're watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>And this is just the beginning. When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet Anti-Cheat defenses will only grow stronger</em>."</p>



<p>The post continues with Team Ricochet and Activision not only claiming that 97% of cheaters were caught within half an hour, but that "<em>fewer than 1% of cheating attempts reached a match, and those who did were removed within minutes</em>."</p>



<p>Team Ricochet also went on to say that it is bringing the fight directly to cheat vendors and that is has "<em>directly contributed to the closure of over 40 cheat developers and resellers since Black Ops 6 launched</em>. <em>Vendors sharing clips during Beta were already on our radar and we will purse them beyond in-game enforcement</em>."</p>



<p>While players would generally agree it's a good thing that cheaters aren't overrunning and ruining their multiplayer experience, there are still many who aren't happy about the kernel-level protection Activision has pushed to make this work. To those players, Team Ricochet simply said, "<em>We</em> <em>understand that new security measures like TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot checks can sometimes feel disruptive. But these steps help ensure a secure, fair experience for every player, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation as we strengthen PC protections.</em>"</p>



<p>Whether what Activision and Team Ricochet lines up with your experience in the multiplayer beta or not, it's clear that Activision is trying to send a message to players that it is taking cheaters in Call of Duty very seriously. But that only works if these numbers and any future cheater reports Team Ricochet puts out accurately represent the state of the multiplayer experience on Call of Duty.</p>



<p>The first comments below this post include players <a href="https://x.com/tq57l/status/1975065774730735927">claiming they were shadowbanned when they weren't cheating</a>, players pointing out that <a href="https://x.com/JediJoystick/status/1975040453067284798">reactive measures don't do enough to stop cheaters from ruining a player's multiplayer experience</a>, that the wording in this statement <a href="https://x.com/ItsMeChalks/status/1974955542453026903">only refers to the cheaters Team Ricochet were able to detect</a>, and others <a href="https://x.com/ShutUpBruv1/status/1975056289949753564">claiming that they've still seen scores of cheaters in their matches</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, if you haven't seen cheaters in your matches, and by your experience, the anti-cheat system is working, you might be too busy having fun in the beta to comment on these posts. Spending any significant amount of time on the internet will teach you that people will complain more than they'll speak up about how good things are going.</p>



<p>And while Activision and Team Ricochet are putting on a strong face against cheaters currently, the true test will be how the game looks in six months, and if cheating is still as significant an issue as it's been in previous years. </p>



<p>"<em>The fight against cheating is an industry-wide challenge - and we're committed to leading the charge,</em>" Team Ricochet and Activision write. "<em>We continue to bring new systems online during beta, fine-tuning our protections, responding faster and gaining deeper insights. We're dedicated to transparency, community feedback, and constant evolution in our fight for fair play</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Lenovo 15.6″ Laptop (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) Crashes to Nearly Free After 82% Cut, Early Prime Day Exclusive]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-giving-away-this-brand-new-loaded-2199-lenovo-laptop-for-practically-nothing-2000631661</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-lenovo-15-6%E2%80%B3-laptop-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-crashes-to-nearly-free-after-82-cut-early-prime-day-exclusive.1317496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When is something both overpriced and a massive bargain? When it’s a brand-new 15.6-inch FHD Lenovo laptop with an Intel N4500 processor, and Windows 11 Professional pre-installed, and it has a kinda-crazy original price tag that’s marked down in a <em>huge</em> way at Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/">This limited-time deal knocks 82% from the (overpriced) $2,199 original cost to a (massive bargain) $400.</a></p>
<p>Toss that original price and look at what the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 packs into a $400 package, and the quality of this Amazon deal becomes obvious very quickly. Simply, this is a stalwart everyday laptop that can handle serious work while giving you ample options to play. Lenovo’s longstanding reputation for building durable laptops enhances the broad appeal of the IdeaPad 1 for professionals, students, or just casual PC users.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid as a Rock</h2>
<p>From end to end, everything about the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 speaks to absolute reliability. There are faster laptops, there are laptops with more memory than the IdeaPad 1’s 16GB of RAM and more storage than the IdeaPad 1’s 512GB — although both are easily and inexpensively expanded — and there are laptops with bigger and more spectacular displays. But the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 isn’t lacking anywhere — the Intel Celeron N4500 processor can reach 2.8GHz in speed, the FHD display (1920 x 1080 resolution) has anti-glare treatment, and the Intel UHD Graphics chip pairs with the monitor to deliver a solid and reliable performance.</p>
<p>When it’s time to put the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 to the test with a video conference or video call, it comes ready with a 720p HD webcam with built-in Privacy Shutter, and two Dolby Audio speakers. The rest of your everyday productivity is made easy by the preloaded Windows 11 Professional OS, which includes Microsoft Copilot for an ultra-fast AI assist whenever you need it.</p>



<h2>Connections For All</h2>
<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad 1 has all the connections you need, and perhaps even more. Start with the Wi-Fi 6 11ax 2×2 and Bluetooth 5.2 hookups that make your browsing and streaming life a cinch, and the USB ports — a 2.0 Type-A, a 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, and a 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C for fast data transfers — HDMI 1.4b port, and card reader present all the options you need for peripherals and external monitors.</p>
<p>We’re not really sure who came up with the original $2,199 price tag on this Lenovo 15.6-inch IdeaPad 1. It’s certainly not a price we’d ever recommend for an exceptionally solid and reliable laptop from a leading manufacturer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/">But for just $400 after Amazon’s jaw-dropping 82%-off limited-time discount? </a>We’re all in on that.</p>

"I have no update on timing for release," NateTheHate 2 added in response to a question about the prequel starring Arthur Morgan. The theory floated to the leaker was that Rockstar would want to release these new editions fairly soon, with the studio focusing on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> next year.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 players hopping into the beta right now are taking in all the sights of Activision's upcoming AAA FPS, though one thing they won't be able to see is the name of another massive release coming out this year. That's because the words: "Arc Raiders" are censored in the game's chat function.</p>
<p>Censoring words in-game isn't anything new, and is usually used to block out profanity, toxic terminology, and other potentially offensive words from multiplayer lobbies. Blocking out game names is a strange one though, especially given the fact that Black Ops 7's biggest competitor this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is not censored. It's worth noting the words "Arc" and "Raiders" on their own don't get censored, it's only when you put them both together where censoring occurs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1nyombu/arc_raiders_being_censored_in_the_black_ops_7/">A clip of this censorship in-action has been circulating online</a>, and Eurogamer confirmed that the term Arc Raiders is starred out in the Black Ops 7 beta. Funnily enough, Arc Raiders players found the term "Arc Raiders" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/">also got automatically censored from the EA App chat feature</a>, while other game names like Call of Duty did not. This was quickly patched out once publicised.</p>

<p>Aside from this small, peculiar quirk, the Call of Duty beta seems to be going down rather well. Over the weekend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trials-new-more-varied-matchmaking-and-tweaks-ttk-on-popular-weapons">new tweaks and game modes were added to the game</a> to the joy of its community, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-is-out-and-is-already-plagued-by-cheaters">while there were initial reports of cheaters running rampant</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-cheaters-banned-within-30-minutes-activision-claims">Activision has claimed the vast majority of them have been dealt with</a>.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is set to release on the 14th November, so this early taste of the game is meant to test features out and tide the ravenous FPS community over until next month. Arc Raiders, on the other hand, is set to release on the 30th October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-online-shooter-arc-raiders-free-next-month-in-final-test-weekend-before-release">and has an open beta on the weekend starting the 17th October</a>. It's brilliant fun and well worth trying out, at least if the first beta was any indication of quality.</p>

			<p>Blood of Mehran wears its influences on its sleeve. Part God of War, part Assassin’s Creed, and borrowing from various other action games from a bygone era, there is definitely a passion to create a game that captures the highs of a linear action game, but Blood of Mehran has issues that do not allow it to elevate above average.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blood of Mehran | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iPTk65s7SWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game follows Mehran, a warrior turned farmer, who has to pick up the sword again when tragedy strikes, sending him down a path of revenge. This journey is split into linear levels in which you go down a path while taking out waves of enemies that get in your way, until you reach the boss at the end of the level. Mehran starts with a sword, eventually unlocking a bow &amp; arrow, double scimitars, and a sword and shield combo. Each of these are good at dealing with different situations, and can be upgraded at the occasional shops you happen upon, and your abilities augmented through experience points.</p>



<p>Combat in Blood of Mehran does have a bit of depth to it, requiring you to switch weapons to deal with different threats. Archers can be a pain, so using the shield to block their arrows and then switching to the bow and arrow to hit back shows there has been thought put in. However, the combat is also a core issue in Blood of Mehran. Feedback is almost non-existent and if it wasn’t for the health bars above enemies you wouldn’t be able to tell if you were doing damage.</p>

<p>The hit boxes don’t seem to be based on your actual weapon placement either. Get in close enough to an arbalester, for example, and you might get a hit in, but they will then flip away from you. If your sword is still swinging and it slices through the arbalester while they are flipping, no damage is done. That isn’t the only situation where sword swings seem to do no damage, but it is one of the more noticeable. Parrying also feels off. When it works it is great to give openings, but other times parrying just seems poorly timed, where it looks like you are parrying at the right time but it does not register.</p>

<p>What Blood of Mehran has got is looks, at least in the environments of the levels. Each level has a lot of detail to it, and the water in some levels looks particularly good. But, you then notice the pop-in, the frame rate drops, the character models that look very smooth and a wide eyed, and the lip movements not matching what is being said. That great look in the general environment is undone by the smaller details when it comes to character models and actions.</p>
<p>There’s also how things sound. The voice acting is serviceable, with the emotions not necessarily lining up with the situations. Mehran also has a habit of addressing his enemies saying things like they are punks, while nowhere near them, like he is psyching himself up for the fight ahead. There’s no real hint of anger which you would expect, the lines instead being recited quite calmly. The line delivery from secondary characters is a bit worse, and comes across as annoying in one particular character.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Blood of Mehran is a bit of a throwback, taking its inspiration from games a couple of generations back. The foundation has been put in place, but Blood of Mehran is a distinctively average eight hour experience with combat not reaching the levels it could, voice acting that could be better, and various performance issues that need addressing.	</p></div>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/digital-foundry-delivers-a-technical-breakdown-of-switch-2s-dlss</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-foundry-delivers-a-technical-breakdown-of-switch-2s-dlss.1317451/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We've known that Nvidia's custom-built Switch 2 chip would bring some DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) magic to the new console for a good while now, though specifics around how the technology is actually working under the hood have been pretty slim. Fortunately, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> are here to shed some light on the whole thing.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDvf1gsMgmY">new video</a> (above), DF's Alex Battaglia gets into the weeds of the Switch 2's DLSS and explains how it works compared to other models on PC. There's been no official word from Nintendo or Nvidia on the matter, but this is pretty much as comprehensive a breakdown as you'll get.</p>
<p>There's a lot of technical language to get to grips with in the above video, and we'd highly recommend watching it in its entirety for all of the details, but the long and the short of it is as follows: there are <em>two</em> different forms of DLSS available on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The first is what we see used in the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on Switch 2. According to Digital Foundry, this DLSS model shares many of the same characteristics found in the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which was commonplace on PC prior to the introduction of DLSS 4. This provides more consistent image quality at 1080p resolutions and working anti-aliasing on both movement and camera cuts.</p>
<p>However, this isn't the same as <em>all</em> DLSS models found on Switch 2. Examining the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">The Touryst</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> on the console, Digital Foundry concludes that there is another, "tiny" DLSS model at work for games trying to achieve resolutions above 1080p.</p>
<p>This secondary model boasts a sharper image resolution, but far worse anti-aliasing on movement and camera cuts — the DF analysis even states that it looks like it's not working in motion. The big perk is that this model could operate at nearly half the cost of the beefier version, putting less stress on the Switch 2's GPU for upscaling.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all based entirely on DF's analysis for the time being, without any official word from Nvidia or Nintendo (as unlikely as it would be to get anything from the latter). That said, Digital Foundry has had word from a developer, who remains anonymous, that the theory is correct, and there are indeed two DLSS models at play for the system.</p>
<p>Battaglia concludes his analysis by stating that he understands why developers might want to use the less-taxing model in handheld mode, though its visual downgrades mean that he struggles to see its use in docked play.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>When Sega and Creative Assembly's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> launched in 2014, I was deputy editor at Official Xbox Magazine. I remember getting the review copy from our contributor Alex "Game Over, Man" Dale, and asking him how long the game was. 35-40 hours, he said. WTF, I said. I can't remember how Alex responded - possibly his transmission ended with a jangling scream and a burp of static, or possibly he agreed with me that 35-40 hours is indecently hefty for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/I'd%20definitely%20shorten%20it">horror</a> game, even with the qualification that you can get through the main campaign in around 20. 35-40 hours? That's a farking Final Fantasy, mate!</p>
<p>Over 10 years later, we finally know who to blame. Surprise surprise, it was the xenomorph all along. According to Alien Isolation writer Dion Lay, the Gigerbeast's increasing capability during development made certain areas more time-intensive than they were originally supposed to be. There's probably a relevant Alien quote to invoke, here, but I'm going to settle for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3j9muCo4o0">that Jeff Goldblum line</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-park">Jurassic Park</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>Speaking to FRVR in <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/alien-isolation-writer-says-the-horror-game-is-too-long-because-its-clever-xenomorph-was-dumber/">a recent interview</a>, Lay conceded that "in a perfect world, yeah, I'd kind of shrink it down a bit, get down its core".

</p><p>"The Alien really evolved as we were making it," he went on. "By the time it was perfect, it was like, 'Oh, wow, everything takes a lot longer!' So, it would be really nice to pare it down to its core, make it a lot shorter. At the time, it didn't seem that long, and then you suddenly go, 'Oh my God.' So, yeah, I'd definitely shorten it, you know. But, yeah, at the time, there was some stuff where we were like: 'Yeah, we can't take that out now, that would kind of upend everything.'"</p><p>I'd like Lay to go into more detail about which particular aspects of Jack the Ripley-killer's behaviour had the biggest impact on completion times. The xenomorph's evolving AI was one of the game's major marketing McGuffins before release. I remember devs telling me campfire stories about how distractions such as flares might gradually lose effectiveness. The third time you lob a flare, the Alien may deduce the presence or even the likely position of a flare-thrower. Eek!</p>
<p>Back in 2014, I tried to map out all the AI permutations in a big double-page magazine flowchart for OXM, which probably got a lot of launch day players killed. I can't remember how this pre-release hype stacked up to the reality. Ten years is a long time, and my Isolation memories are mostly locker interiors, at this stage. Mostly.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's credible that the creature's smarts are one reason Isolation is such a marathon. Perhaps that's something Creative Assembly will address in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-is-getting-a-sequel-10-years-later">the forthcoming Alien: Isolation sequel</a> - it's not clear how many of the old Isolation team are still there. In terms of persistent, unkillable munsters, I'd say the perfect organism's biggest competition right now is the Beast from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker">Amnesia: The Bunker</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been looking for a way to share your Formula 1 enthusiasm with your kids while keeping them entertained with quality building toys, LEGO has created exactly what you need. The <strong>LEGO F1 collectible race cars pack</strong> brings the excitement of the racing circuit straight to your living room and right now, Amazon is offering this set at a record low price during Prime Big Deal Days: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/">Down from $30 to just $20, this mystery box collection has climbed into the top 10 best-selling LEGO sets</a> on the site.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Twelve Teams, Virtually Limitless Possibilities</h2>
<p>The allure of this set is its mystery box structure: <strong>Six randomly picked mini F1 race cars out of a total of 12 varying models</strong> are received, which makes for a different combination with each purchase. The available roster consists of <strong>RB20, Mercedes-AMG, Ferrari, McLaren, Aston Martin, Alpine, Williams, VCARB, Sauber, Haas, a generic F1, and an F1 Academy car</strong>. Each model is incredibly small (being a few inches in length) which makes them ideal for little hands to hold on to and operate for creative race scenarios. The<strong> randomness provides for a surprise that children dearly enjoy</strong>&nbsp;and creates a fuss around the unboxing alone as children see which teams ended up in their individual collection.</p>



<p>LEGO did not skimp on details here: Each car comes decorated in <strong>genuine team colors with actual team logos emblazoned</strong> directly onto the bodywork so that young supporters will have the opportunity to recognize their favored teams at a glance. A <strong>team helmet occupying each cockpit</strong> adds another note of realism which F1-fixated youngsters will love.</p>
<p>The wheels spin smoothly, too, which makes these from passive display pieces into dynamic racing toys. Children can push them around the floor, prepare racing grids on the table top, or devise elaborate race scenarios pitting disparate teams against one another for the championship crown. At a total of 174 pieces divided between six cars, individual assemblies, which take between 10-15 minutes, remain small enough for little ones but still encounter enough challenge to be satisfying.</p>



<p>They’re compact enough that you can toss a few into a purse for restaurant waits, road trips, or flights when you’d like something to amuse kids without wasting valuable luggage space. They’re ideal birthday party favors when you’re hosting a racing-themed party, too. Instead of gaudy-cheap pieces of plastic that snap off after a few hours, guests depart with actual LEGO constructions they’ll be able to use repeatedly and treasure.</p>
<p>At $20 for a six-car pack, you’re out about $3.33 per model, which is extremely cheap considering each one is a complete buildable set complete with actual F1 branding. Because there are 12 distinct cars overall, acquiring two 6-packs provides a good likelihood of assembling a majority or all of the released models. As built, the little racers look great lining a shelf in your child’s bedroom, on a starting grid layout, or assembled into team alliances.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kingmakers-early-access-release-delayed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingmakers%E2%80%99-early-access-release-has-been-delayed-no-new-release-date-in-sight.1317424/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Kingmakers, the third-person action time-travelling game that gives you a truck and an assault rifle against legions of medieval-era knights with nothing but swords and horses, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingmakers-the-medieval-based-third-person-action-game-that-pits-assault-rifles-against-swords-launches-in-early-access-this-october/">initially meant to release in early access on PC later this week,</a> on October 8, 2025. Now, that's no longer the case, and the game's release has been delayed with no new release date in sight.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1974144040942625003">In a long statement posted to the X (formerly Twitter) account</a> for the game, developer Redemption Road Games confirmed it needs more time to polish the game, rather than "<em>cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door</em> <em>earlier</em>." What will be coming soon, is a half-hour gameplay deep-dive digging into the gameplay, and updating players on what the team has been working on. </p>



<p>"<em>After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled Kingmakers launch on October 8 will no longer be possible</em>," the studio confirmed at the top of its statement. "<em>We want to apologize to all the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short: it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door</em> <em>earlier.</em> <em>Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that's nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity</em>.</p>



<p><em>With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers. We currently</em> <em>have tens of thousands of soldiers,</em> <em>each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you'd expect from a AAA third-person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6-story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it's a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena...</em></p>



<p><em>...We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kingmakers is one of the few indie games that, when it first gets announced, <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1759943842466582568">has a viral moment and is suddenly in front of millions of eyes</a>. It has <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1868768562388910113">over a million wishlists on Steam</a> thanks to that first burst of virality, but hype fades as easily as it builds.</p>



<p>Whenever Kingmakers does release, we'll see if it is any deeper than the viral mix of driving a truck through hundreds of knights that can't do anything about it. Perhaps the coming gameplay deep-dive will begin to do away with those concerns, and of course, with it being an early access title, there will likely be plenty of time for it to develop and get better based on community feedback.</p>

"A Civ-like with neat ideas, but half-formed fundamentals and messy execution make your decisions feel less than impactful," wrote contributor Ian Boudreau in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/millenia-review">our Millennia review</a> from March 2024. Sounds like the kind of thing updates might fix, but alack, there shall be no more. Paradox have announced that the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">strategy</a> Civ-like's eighth patch, out now, will be its last.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"With this patch, we are sadly coming to the end of an age," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1268590/view/518599830010857584?l=english">a Steam blog post</a> from former Paradox Interactive community manager Katten. "This will be the final patch for Millennia, thanks to C Prompt for their work and support of this game. We at Paradox will no longer be active on community platforms for Millennia, but you can continue counting on us for support needs, and the game will remain available to play indefinitely."
</p>
<p>
You can read the full patch notes <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/millennia-update-8.1853194/">here</a>. I wouldn't say it's going out with a whimper, but this definitely isn't a bang. The update spans some general fixes for stuff like borked unit healing and visual errors, together with fixes for localisation. They've also added mod support for custom Age Paintings, and made modded Action Cards more consistent when loading save games.
</p>
<p>
I'm not a Millennia player, but I don't think there's anything on offer there that magically makes the game essential. The recent Steam user reviews are mostly disappointed faces, but Millennia does have a few defenders. 
</p>
<p>
In our review, Ian was both enticed and frustrated by the game's branching alternate-history format, which lets you unlock wacky epochs such as steampunk and aquatic ages by researching the right techs. This sits alongside more familiar 4X anachronisms, such as kingdoms making it all the way to the Renaissance without discovering horse-riding. I love the sound of it all, but as Ian explains, the system's drawback is that only one player can unlock the next age for all of other players, so if you pile research into a particular Age and somebody beats you to the punch, you're screwed. 
</p><p>
It should be a source of hectic competition, with sessions kept lively by the pressure to switch approaches when somebody rudely initiates the Age of Beehive Hairstyles or whatever, but in practice, it just seems to have annoyed a lot of people. Though possibly not as much as some more pervasive issues with the UI and graphics, or core systems such as diplomacy.
</p>
<p>
Millennia launched before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> - also rather a divisive game, with age mechanics redolent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/humankind">Humankind</a>. Seems like doing age progression better has been on the minds of a lot of 4X designers lately. If you're looking for a new empire builder to sponge up the leisure hours/keep you from your annoying family, maybe try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend-2">Endless Legend 2</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2s-early-access-launch-is-a-triumph-of-asymmetrical-4x-design-but-i-do-wish-it-were-even-stranger">recently entered early access</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a>, which recently received one of those bombastic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untolds-big-revolutions-v20-update-is-out-now-aims-to-improve-nearly-every-area-of-the-game">2.0 updates</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has formally rolled out <strong>Prime Big Deal Day</strong>&nbsp;which makes tens of thousands of special deals available for Prime members alone. This is one of the primary membership perks: you get sale prices at all-time lows on hottest items across the board. If you have been waiting for a Wi-Fi 7 router from a world-class manufacturer, this is the deal that you simply cannot pass up.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4520/">TP-Link Archer BE800 has gone on sale at $299 (original $599), which is a stunning 50% off one of the best routers available</a> on the market today. This tri-band giant solves the growing problem of bandwidth saturation common in homes nowadays where dozens of devices compete for connectivity, phones, laptops, smart TV and gaming devices being some examples.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4520/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>WiFi 7 Technology That Redefines Your Network</h2>
<p>The Archer BE800 takes Wi-Fi 7’s revolutionary capabilities and combines them<strong> for a total of 19 Gbps across three bands</strong>: 11,520 Mbps on the 6 GHz band, 5,760 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, and 1,376 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. These translate to real-world performance that <strong>handles several 4K and 8K streams at once</strong> without buffering, supports VR-AR gaming without lag and keeps video calls going smoothly even when other members of the household are downloading large files.</p>



<p>The 320 MHz channel bandwidth doubles the pipe compared to Wi-Fi 6’s highest 160 MHz channels and allows for more information at once. Combined with 4K-QAM modulation which encodes more information per transmission, the router provides much better throughput compared to previous generations. Multi-RU functions allow the router to support many devices at once on the same channel without creating the bottlenecks that occur when many devices contend for attention.</p>
<p>The physical connectivity choices are just as solid: <strong>Two 10 Gbps ports support future-proofed wired connections</strong> for high-end users such as NAS setups, desktop workstations, or ISP connections above the standard gigabit rates. One is a combo SFP+ fiber and RJ45 port and allows flexibility should you have your fiber broadband setup or wish to upgrade at a future date. The remaining four 2.5 Gbps ports support devices requiring faster-than-gigabit speeds but not necessarily the full 10 Gbps, such as Wi-Fi 6E access points or high-performance gaming PCs. A USB 3.0 port exists for network-attached storage or shared printing throughout your network.</p>



<p>The <strong>eight strategically mounted antennas</strong> operate with beamforming tech which emits the wireless signal straight at devices instead of broadcasting it omni-directionally. That directional method provides range extension along with stability of connections and shows a particular advantage for large homes or homes on interference hotspots.</p>
<p>TP-Link’s HomeShield security suite includes network scanning, IoT device identification, parental controls, and quality of service management in the free tier. The separate IoT network feature lets you isolate smart home devices on their own protected Wi-Fi network, preventing potential security vulnerabilities in cheap smart bulbs or cameras from compromising your main network. EasyMesh compatibility means you can expand coverage by adding compatible TP-Link extenders that create seamless roaming throughout your home.</p>
<p>For $299 on Prime Big Deal Day, you’re getting enterprise-class networking tech that will last your home networking needs for years into the future.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bye-bye-bose-airpods-max-are-selling-for-peanuts-on-amazon-right-now-2000631785</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When Prime Day rolls around at Amazon, even Apple gets on board with their biggest deals of the year. It’s no coincidence that the last time Apple offered the AirPods Max, their premium over-ear headphones, for only $429 was during the last Prime Day event back in July. But Prime Day’s back, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/">and so are the $429 AirPods Max (down from $549)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>This <strong>21% deal is big stuff for Apple</strong>, especially for their top-of-the-line wireless headphones. And the one tried and true fact about Apple is, you get what you pay for – their tech goods might run higher in price than much of the competition, but the performance backs up every penny of it. The AirPods Max are just another bit of proof.</p>

<h2>Amazing Engineering</h2>
<p>The <strong>Apple H1 chip is the secret sauce</strong> that makes the AirPods Max just that much better than much of their competition. There’s also the dynamic driver that tracks your head position in real time, instantly adjusts the sound, and all the while intelligently optimizes the output after analyzing your unique ear shape. It’s very likely as close to a live listening experience as you can get from a pair of wireless headphones.</p>



<p>When it comes to the <strong>all-important noise cancellation performance</strong> — because, honestly, what good are headphones if the sound has to compete with the noise around you? — the AirPods Max are among the very best on the market. It’s active noise cancellation that adjusts on the fly and, if you like, can almost completely isolate you so all you hear is what you want to hear from your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. But you also have the ability to take control and switch the AirPods Max to transparency mode, allowing exterior sounds and conversations to be heard while still delivering primo sound.</p>



<h2>All-Day Comfort</h2>
<p><strong>An all-day battery life</strong> is pretty much useless without the ability to wear your headphones comfortably, and vice versa. Thankfully the <strong>robust 20-hour battery life</strong> of the AirPods Max is backed by exceptional comfort with the lightweight AirPods Max sporting a knit-mesh canopy band that is breathable yet holds the phones firmly in place, and memory foam ear cushions that form a perfect seal over your ears for optimal sound, but also optimal comfort.</p>
<p>There’s certainly no guarantee that Apple will drop the price of the AirPods Max as low as $429 again come Black Friday or during Cyber Week, and do you really want to wait for the next Prime Day event in 2026 to score a pair of pro-level wireless headphones? This Prime Day deal looks like a solid winner.</p>

Its choice of setting, picturesque scenery, and expansive map seem to be resonating with local residents, with the developers receiving plaudits for their detailed research and sense of style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch’s standalone sequel to 2020’s award-winning Ghost of Tsushima moves the action to Ezo on Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido. You play as Atsu, a warrior on a quest to take vengeance on the six men who slaughtered her family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Ghost of Yotei’s scenery is getting a lot of praise from Japanese speaking commenters for its beauty, especially the titular Mount Yotei. However, one <a href="https://x.com/rina_asami_w/status/1973602091873792484" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenter</u></a>, who apparently lives in Hokkaido, shared a photo of the real Mount Yotei, saying: “You were probably thinking they exaggerated its beauty for the game, right? But Mount Yotei really is a beautiful mountain. Please come and visit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up post, they added that the developers’ decision to choose “Mount Yotei instead of (Hokkaido’s highest mountain) Daisetsuzan makes so much sense as a person born and raised in Hokkaido. Mount Yotei isn’t part of a mountain range, it stands alone, and that’s what gives it the ‘wow’ factor.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> 、北海道で一番高い山は大雪山なんだけど、大雪山じゃなくて羊蹄山を選んだの、道産子としてめちゃくちゃよくわかる。<br>羊蹄山って山脈の中にある山じゃなくてぽつんとそびえたっていて、それが「うわあ」ってなるんだよね。 <a href="https://t.co/CRKpybvzLU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CRKpybvzLU</a></p>— ⭕️りなんご⭕️ (@rina_asami_w) <a href="https://twitter.com/rina_asami_w/status/1973604258655469969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The view from the mountain in-game is also getting some love for being extremely beautiful, with one user <a href="https://x.com/YusukeORTtype2/status/1975100964572197129" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sharing screenshots</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">羊蹄山からの景色バチクソ綺麗なんよなぁ<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GhostofYotei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GhostofYotei</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> <a href="https://t.co/KBskFi6g2w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KBskFi6g2w</a></p>— 悠介二式/🌟 (@YusukeORTtype2) <a href="https://twitter.com/YusukeORTtype2/status/1975100964572197129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sharing an in-game screenshot featuring Mount Yotei, another <a href="https://x.com/ngo_nyanko/status/1973441795892847049" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> commented: “I live in Ezo but Ghost of Yotei is way more quintessentially Hokkaido than I could have imagined, lol.

And while KurtJMac may not be the first person to have reached the outer edges of the procedurally generated world, his attempt is one of the most famous, taking almost 15 years to achieve and crossing the line on October 4. He even holds a <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/115885-longest-journey-in-minecraft" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guinness World Record</a> for the Longest Journey in Minecraft without using cheats or exploits, and has raised over half a million dollars for charity.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/06/screenshot-2025-10-06-130940-1759752590775.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">KurtJMac finally reaches the Far Lands in Minecraft.

You can see the moment KurtJMac realized he reached the Far Lands on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOS10VEgpuk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel</u></a> at 3:43:27 on the video "FLoB-a-Thon — Day 69 — THE FAR LANDS." He thought he was getting close — unless his balloons had been waiting there for over a decade! — and after acknowledging the game felt "a little bit laggy," the mythical wall came into view.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ohhhhh!" he cried when he saw it. "Who had their bets on Ocean Biome?! Good gravy!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We may not be the first people to have reached the Far Lands," KurtJMac continued, "but in my book we are absolutely the first to have brought along such an amazing community, a generous community, and I would not have changed any of it to have gotten here any sooner. And I very much appreciate all of you being here."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what happens next? As KurtJMac put it: "I'm just gonna ever westward, forever forward!"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-adding-spears-for-players-but-also-for-mounted-zombies"><u>Minecraft announced a major new game update, Mounts of Mayhem</u></a>, that will be spearheaded by the addition of, well, a spear. The sharp-tipped stick is the first new weapon added to Minecraft in some time, and the first new tiered item — one that is available in progressively more durable variants — added since the hoe, back in 2010. It'll introduce some interesting new gameplay possibilities, including jousting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Minecraft fans can busy themselves with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Minecraft_The_Copper_Age_Update_Release_Date_and_Details"><u>the game's latest update, The Copper Age</u></a>, which is out now and adds those <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-developer-teases-something-big-to-do-with-copper-and-fans-think-a-long-lost-mob-may-return"><u>adorable friendly copper golems</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
