The fight is over AI protections and other issues in contract negotiations with some of the biggest studios and publishers, and will halt work from SAG-AFTRA members on future projects, as well as possibly keep them from promotion of upcoming games like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>and <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, until a deal is reached.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Exploitation is exactly what the bargaining group would have us accept for ourselves,” bargaining committee chair Sarah Elmaleh (<em>Gone Home</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>) said during a press conference on July 25. “The employers refuse to plainly affirm in clear and enforceable language that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their AI language. They insist we overlook obvious AI loopholes that imperil both movement and voice performance, which are in today’s games frequently combined.”</p><p>The game companies, which include Activision, Epic Games, EA, and Warner Bros., said in a statement that their offer “extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA (Interactive Media Agreement).” But SAG-AFTRA members say that’s not the case and that the proposals fall short of what has been established in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/video-game-strike-interim-agreements&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/video-game-strike-interim-agreements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous agreements</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sagaftra.org/production-center/contract/820/getting-started&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/production-center/contract/820/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with other studios</a></span>. </p><p>Zeke Alton (<em>Callisto Protocol</em>, <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>) disputed the companies’ characterization. “It’s disingenuous,” he said during the press conference. “I’m sorry, all right, there is a base level that protects all of the members of this union, and that is what we expect, and that is what we demand, and that’s why we’re here, because we are not getting that. So you can say something, put it in the contract if you mean it.”<br></p><h2 id="h5664"><a id=""></a>Why are game actors on strike?</h2><p>SAG-AFTRA represents over 2,000 performers in gaming on both the voice acting and motion capture sides. The last Interactive Media Agreement expired in November 2022 and the guild has been in negotiations with major gaming companies ever since to establish new safety guidelines, pay rate increases, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/beyond-the-spider-verse-generative-ai-art-third-movie-1851515894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-the-spider-verse-generative-ai-art-third-movie-1851515894">protections around generative AI</a></span>. As interest in companies like OpenAI has exploded over the past year, and people have seen the power of tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney to copy existing work and remix it on demand with simple prompts, creatives have been calling for guardrails for how generative AI is used and monetized. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-god-war-ai-voice-atreus-star-wars-1850949607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-god-war-ai-voice-atreus-star-wars-1850949607">Its potential applications in gaming</a></span>, where entire worlds, characters, and stories are made with strings of code, are especially evident, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/ea-boss-doubles-down-on-commitment-to-ai-believes-more-than-50-of-our-development-process-will-be-impacted/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/ea-boss-doubles-down-on-commitment-to-ai-believes-more-than-50-of-our-development-process-will-be-impacted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with CEOs at big publishers publicly hyping up</a></span> the prospect of using generative AI to cut down on costs to their shareholders. SAG-AFTRA members are demanding companies be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-spider-man-ai-union-1850874117&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-spider-man-ai-union-1850874117">transparent about how AI will be used in voice, face, and motion capture performances</a></span>, and be required to seek consent and sign additional agreements with actors before any of their work can be used in that regard. </p><p>The main fear is that a performer could record a single session and then have their entire likeness copied to effectively duplicate their work throughout the rest of the game without them ever knowing or being paid for it. “This technology, like I said, with a digital replica, can make a performance as me when I’m not in the room,” Alton said. “And if there’s no transparency, and I don’t know it’s even occurring, there’s no way to go back and ensure that we get proper consent and compensation.”</p><p>While game companies say they are agreeing to AI protections for performers, the union says those protections were only extended at the last minute before the strike and only for actors who are recognizable in the finished game or who play specific characters. The current protections offered would also seemingly leave out motion artists whose work is changed using generic AI tools trained on random internet data.</p><p>“The protections only extend to on-camera performers and to voice performers under their offer if the performer is identifiable in the output of the AI digital replica,” chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Aftermath</em></a></span> in an interview last week. “But the truth is, in video games, it’s not going to be identifiable, as you could be doing the stunts that form the movement for Spider-Man, but what the player is going to see is Spider-Man. So that requirement of identifiability really leaves movement performers out of the scope of coverage.”</p><h2 id="h5665"><a id=""></a>What games could be affected by the strike?</h2><p>Strike rules require all SAG-AFTRA members not to work on or promote games at any studios or publishers that are part of the current deadlocked negotiations or who haven’t already signed onto one of its existing agreements. That includes everything from voicing grunts in something like<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-playtest-wb-games-date-1850347676&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-playtest-wb-games-date-1850347676"><em>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</em></a></span> to pivotal scenes in Insomniac Games’ upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188"><em>Wolverine</em></a></span> game. Promotion, meanwhile, could include everything from tweeting about a game to appearing on podcasts. But it’s not as simple as every game from the companies involved being part of the strike. </p><p>Part of why it’s so hard to know exactly which games will be affected is because of the video game industry’s infamous penchant for secrecy, which has trickled into the SAG-AFTRA strike itself. When asked for a list of currently announced games that would be impacted by the work stoppage, a spokesperson for the union told<em> Kotaku</em> that wasn’t possible since “the majority of the titles in production are listed under code names and we are not provided with actual titles of videogames when they register.” About 30 or so existing studios and companies have signed onto recent tiered or interim agreements that allow striking members to continue working with them, though the union wouldn’t provide a list of the entities’ names. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> Is Exempt From The Game Actors Strike</a></span></p><p>There is also a long list of games that are exempted from the strike because they began production before September 2023. While <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> publisher Rockstar Games’ parent company is part of the strike, the 2025 blockbuster won’t be impacted because it’s part of that exemption. An entry in SAG-AFTRA’s database of projects lists a warning under <em>GTA VI</em> that while members won’t be disciplined for working on it during the strike, they are still encouraged to show solidarity with their fellow actors by not performing new work on it in the meantime. (Rockstar has worked with SAG-AFTRA talent in the past, including Roger Clark, the voice behind<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em>'s Arthur Morgan).</p><p> “We’re obviously not happy about that,” Rodriguez <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Aftermath</em></a></span> regarding the <em>GTA VI</em> exemption and others. “That language was bargained into one of the legacy Interactive Media Agreements before merger [of SAG and AFTRA]. It’s language that the merged union basically inherited, that I think is insane. But it’s there.” But he also noted that most game actor work is contracted on a per-session basis and that performers could still voluntarily opt out of additional sessions until the strike is resolved. “This language made its way into our contract for one reason only, to undermine our union’s most valuable tool: a strike,”  committee chair Sarah Elmaleh <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/selmaleh/status/1818724152788021343&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/selmaleh/status/1818724152788021343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a recent video</a></span>. “But you always have a choice not to undermine a strike.”</p><p>A second set of exemptions revolves around live-service games like <em>Fortnite</em> (made by Epic Games) and <em>Apex Legends</em> (made by EA). As ongoing productions set in motion years ago, those also aren’t part of the strike. SAG-AFTRA is seeking to change that though, which could impact content updates and new characters introduced in later seasons. “SAG-AFTRA has sent its notice of termination of the agreement with respect to many live service games, which will allow SAG-AFTRA to call a strike of one or more of those games at a future date,” a spokesperson for the union told <em>Kotaku</em>. “We will provide detailed instructions to members if such a strike is called in the future.”</p><p>These caveats are part of why EA CEO Andrew Wilson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-2024-07-30.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-2024-07-30.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently told investors</a></span> that the company doesn’t expect any short-term impact from the strike or a “near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development or any of the live services we’re currently running.” But even completed games could still be affected by rules against promoting games sold by struck publishers. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> is set to come out later this year. If the strike is still ongoing at the time, cast members Matt Mercer (<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>), Ike Amadi (<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>), and other high-profile actors wouldn’t be able to join the marketing junkets around it.</p><p>Big games that are further out are much more likely to run into production delays, or potentially try to replace SAG-AFTRA members with scab labor. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-cast-1851235004&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-cast-1851235004"><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a></span>, a game that’s heavy on performances due to director Hideo Kojima’s cinematic and storytelling ambitions,  is set to come out in 2025. While it stars Norman Reedus, who is covered by SAG-AFTRA, it’s possible most of the actor’s work has already been wrapped on the project. If not, however, the strike could potentially delay any unfinished work or scenes that are re-written and need to be re-recorded. While not announced, the third <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> game starring Ashely Burch is also likely in some stage of development. The strike could impact that as well.</p><h2 id="h5666"><a id=""></a>What happens next with the game actor strike?</h2><p>Despite the strike, both sides will continue to negotiate behind closed doors. Actors are expected to picket but exact locations for that haven’t yet been announced. One recent event that SAG-AFTRA members weren’t prohibited from attending was San Diego Comic-Con 2024. The guild announced that a carve-out from its promotion restrictions was made to allow actors with panels there to attend and speak out about the issues they’re striking over.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA members have also started their first picket line outside Warner Bros. Games on August 1. It’s likely to be the first of many in-person protests where members and those supporting them gather outside the offices of the companies they’re negotiating with to make their case publicly and to discourage colleagues from working during the strike. Union protections prohibit companies from retaliating against workers who refuse to cross picket lines. </p><p>In the meantime, its possible some game companies could be moving ahead with using AI for performances with non-union actors anyway. Earlier this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wired </em>reported</a></span> that Activision is already encouraging artists on <em>Call of Duty</em> to use generative AI for concept art and help with assets. When asked at a press conference last week if it or other companies SAG-AFTRA is currently negotiating with might already have begun using AI to duplicate actors’ performances, Rodriguez said he was worried it might be a possibility.</p><figure id="" data-id="daa3b41fe09efc92f99c7ca0637fa086" data-recommend-id="image://daa3b41fe09efc92f99c7ca0637fa086" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dragon Age characters stand next to each other ready to fight.

Many members at the time rallied around the slogan “Performance Matters” while calling for royalties as companies tried to pit actors against developers when it came to who was getting paid more. The voice of <em>Uncharted</em>’s Nathan Drake, Nolan North, was criticized at the time when, using the spotlight at the 2016 Game Awards, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/parsing-nolan-north-s-vague-comments-about-the-voice-ac-1789616920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/parsing-nolan-north-s-vague-comments-about-the-voice-ac-1789616920">he stressed that the performance</a></span> of every developer also mattered, which some took as a gesture that undermined the strike. </p><p>This time the conversation could be very different as developers at some of the biggest game companies also unionize.

Unlike the first batch of starter sets (which cost $60), these are a bit more budget-friendly and will presumably replace the old ones. Plus, the new starter sets are objectively better. Mario's starter set now comes with a buildable Yoshi figure and the Bowser Jr. figure is now bundled with the little villain's Clown Car. The slate of new expansions is arguably even more exciting, letting you choose from several cool new playsets for the interactive toys.

It's possible Pink Yoshi retired from his post in this course and forced his offspring to take on the role.

Naturally, Lakitu has a cloud to ride on and a fishing hook to mess with your precious bricks. If you're keeping score at home, this means all three starter sets now have flying enemies. That said, we're <em>pretty </em>sure looks are deceiving here, and none of these lovable Lego villains can <em>actually </em>fly.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Express-Para-Biddybuds-Nintendo-Birthday/dp/B0CV25S3S7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Express-Para-Biddybuds-Nintendo-Birthday\/dp\/B0CV25S3S7?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Express-Para-Biddybuds-Nintendo-Birthday/dp/B0CV25S3S7?tag=gamespot-promos-20">The Bowser Express Train (1,392 pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Express-Para-Biddybuds-Nintendo-Birthday/dp/B0CV25S3S7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Express-Para-Biddybuds-Nintendo-Birthday\/dp\/B0CV25S3S7?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Express-Para-Biddybuds-Nintendo-Birthday/dp/B0CV25S3S7?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$120</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Looking for an epic Lego Mario set to piece together?

If your Lego Mario/Luigi/Peach figures are brave, they can open the doors and step inside the pretty (but also pretty haunted) residence of King Boo. Your objective is to locate a key, unlock a treasure chest, and thwart the King Boo. The set has some cool interactive elements, including a rising sofa, a movable bookshelf, and multiple Blocks. Beyond King Boo, you get three additional figures: Yellow Baby Yoshi, Dry Bones, and a regular Boo.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure/dp/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure\/dp\/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure/dp/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Battle With Roy at Peach's Castle (738 pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure/dp/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure\/dp\/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure/dp/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$65</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Though it doesn't come with Peach, this is a great addition to any Lego Super Mario starter set.

            <p>
Avowed, the upcoming fantasy action-RPG from Obsidian Entertainment, has reportedly been delayed, moving out of its previously announced 2024 release window into 2025.
</p>
<p>
That's according to journalist Tom Warren, writing in The Verge's (paywalled) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211199/microsoft-teams-new-ui-chat-xbox-employees-studio-d-notepad">Notepad newsletter</a>. "I'm hearing that Obsidian is about to announce an Avowed delay to early 2025," he revealed, adding the decision had been made to avoid a "very busy period" for Game Pass.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian and Microsoft have yet to formally announce a release date for Avowed beyond its vague "2024" launch window, but a 12th November date was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-accidentally-reveals-an-avowed-release-date-before-deleting-it">inadvertently shared</a> - and then rapidly deleted - in a developer blog post published in June.

<p>
Despite the reported delay, Warren's sources say Avowed is in "good shape" and that the shift to 2025 is "more a matter of wanting to give the game breathing room during very busy period for Xbox Game Pass". As Warren notes, a November launch for Avowed would see it competing for attention on Game Pass with developer GSC Game World's long-in-the-works Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-again-now-arriving-in-november">saw its release date shift</a> from 5th September to 20th November.
</p>
<p>
A 12th November launch for Avowed would also see it jostling with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, while another big RPG - BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-narrowed">expected to land</a> in roughly the same timeframe. "Things are getting stacked for Xbox games in the all-important holiday season," Warren noted.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-believe-in-living-in-fear-obsidian-talks-avowed-release-date-prospects-and-xbox-studio-closures">spoke to Obsidian about Avowed</a> back in June, when the developer revealed it was "finalising" the game and "in a polish phase".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-might-be-getting-delayed-to-early-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Verge's Tom Warren has just shared in a paywalled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211199/microsoft-teams-new-ui-chat-xbox-employees-studio-d-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> that Avowed, Obsidian's action roleplaying game, might be about to get delayed from Fall 2024 to early 2025.</p>
<p>Sources cited by Warren say the game is not in any trouble. In fact, it's looking good, but Microsoft and/or Obsidian have decided to give it more 'breathing room' to get out of a busy release window.</p>
<p>To be fair, there are supposed to be four triple-A action roleplaying games due in Fall 2024: Avowed, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. However, Bloodlines 2 is missing from Gamescom and may well be delayed, too.</p>
<p>In June, following the Xbox Game Showcase, Obsidian Entertainment's Carrie Patel (Game Director on the project) <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed </a>the team's confidence in the Fall 2024 launch window:</p>
<p><em>I'll say, just having come from the studio last week, the game is looking fantastic. The team is putting a lot of love into the polish. So we feel very good about 2024.</em></p>
<p>Avowed is set in Eora, the universe originally created by Obsidian for the Pillars of Eternity cRPG franchise. This game focuses on first-person (with optional third-person view) action, removing classes and generally targeting a more mainstream audience.</p>
<p>Josh Sawyer, who spearheaded both Pillars of Eternity games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-does-actually-include-some-contributions-from-pillars-of-eternity-creator-josh-saywer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributed</a> in some fashion to make sure that the game would maintain the core tenets and overall spirit of the previous Pillars of Eternity games.</p>
<p>The game will be much <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-confirmed-by-obsidian-to-be-very-short-for-an-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shorter</a> than the cRPGs. Obsidian itself has likened Avowed to The Outer Worlds, their previous first-person action RPG, whose main quest can be completed in roughly thirteen hours of playtime.</p>
<p>Like all games published by Microsoft, it will be released on PC and Xbox Series S|X. Game Pass subscribers will find it in their libraries on day one.</p>

It was fine. The film takes place on the first day of the invasion, documenting the early days in New York City as humanity desperately tries to survive. <em>Black Panther</em>’s Lupita Nyong’o and <em>Stranger Things</em>’ Joseph Quinn are strong leads, and while <em>Day One </em>does fall into a rhythm of cheap deaths and predictable setpieces, I appreciated when it delved into pathos and the need for human connection at the worst of times. But now I’ve seen a deleted scene that would have added more depth to Quinn’s character, and I see it as a missed opportunity to speak to that need for human connection when deadly monsters aren’t raining from the sky.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Content warning: suicide</strong></p><p>The scene in question premiered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://people.com/a-quiet-place-day-one-deleted-scene-exclusive-8685120&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://people.com/a-quiet-place-day-one-deleted-scene-exclusive-8685120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on <em>People</em></a></span>, and shows Quinn’s character Eric telling Nyong’o’s Samira about why he was dressed up in a suit and tie on the day of the invasion. Initially, Samira asks if he was on the way to a job interview, but his destination wasn’t quite so hopeful.</p><p>He tells her that he came to New York City to be “accepted,” having not been in the small town he grew up in. He says his dad “had an idea of the sons that he wanted,” and he wasn’t like that. In New York, he says, people didn’t mind “that part” of him, but yet he still felt so lonely in the city. “I don’t have a home anywhere. I was really tired of feeling alone and just bored of feeling alone. So I thought it would be easier not to live anywhere.”</p><p>The implication here is that as a gay man, Eric wasn’t accepted in his small hometown, and even after coming to New York City, he still felt alone. Before the calamity began, he was planning to end things.

Gays from small towns dream of moving to the city and finding their people, and yes, while there are certainly days when I feel like I have, there are a lot of timeswhen I still struggle with feeling like I’ve yet to find my home. Being in an overwhelming city, a culture shock compared to where you once were, means a lot of feeling like the life you want is still just out of reach, even though it’s in walking distance. But it can take time to find, and I know how Eric was feeling when he headed down to the subway just before the invasion. It’s a shame fewer people will see this scene, buried in the special features of a digital copy.</p><p><em>A Quiet Place: Day One </em>is now streaming on digital platforms.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gray Zone Warfare is still flying high as a solid extraction shooter since being released on April 30. It enjoyed soaring success at launch, with more than 800,000 copies being sold in the game’s first few weeks on the market. With an enormous and gorgeous open-world map to explore and an innovative, open-ended take on the extraction shooter genre, Gray Zone Warfare has plenty of potential and a sizeable roadmap lined up.</p>



<p>Later this month, Gray Zone Warfare’s next major update will be unveiled at Gamescom in Germany.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-changes">Big Changes</h2>



<p>GZW’s next major update will introduce the sought-after day/night cycle, which will bring about an intense shroud of darkness over the fictional world of Lamang. In consideration of the new night-based excursions, MADFINGER will also offer players night-vision equipment, tweaks to AI behaviour (to account for the darkness), and new weapons.</p>



<p>That’s not all, though. Gray Zone Warfare is set to receive some key improvements, many of which have been requested by the community, which MADFINGER has leant on to no end to provide feedback about this developing, early-access game.</p>



<p>For instance, LZ wait times are being reduced, which will make it faster to get in and out of the action. In Gray Zone Warfare, players must call in helicopters that’ll ferry them around – it’s the easiest way to travel further across the map in less time, but given that the game unfolds in real-time, it can take a while for a helicopter to arrive. This next update intends to fix that niggling issue.</p>



<p>We’ll be on-site at Gamescom later this month to get a first-hand look at the next major update for Gray Zone Warfare.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/spectre-divide-hands-on-preview-nailing-that-first-impression-with-a-unique-twist-on-6v6-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Standing among the pinnacle of tactical team shooters is Spectre Divide, an upcoming team-based competitive 3v3 tactical shooter that brings some unique twists to the genre. As the inaugural title from Mountaintop Studios, the team has a lot to prove if they want to be recognized alongside Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege, and the granddaddy of them all, Counter-Strike. In an exclusive three-hour presentation, we got hands-on with Spectre Divide ahead of its initial reveal.</span></p>
<p><span>As the meta for first-person shooters continues to evolve among a growing number of titles, a team of five or six players pit against each other remains a core tenet of so many of these games. Here, there are still six members of a crew to each side but with a unique twist that hasn’t been properly pulled off in another shooter to date: each player controls two heroes at once.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, there won’t be any split-screen hijinx or transitioning between worlds like The Medium. What Spectre Divide offers is the unique mechanic of Duality, a body-swapping mechanic that allows players to swap into their partner Spectre character at a given time. When not actively controlling the second character, they’ll remain on the lookout and be able to provide real-time feedback when another player approaches. Other than this, the inactive Spectre will remain a sitting duck and can easily be snuck up on by a player who is mindful enough to slowly walk up behind them.</span></p>
<p><span>To balance the act of juggling two bodies at once, the ability to swap into a player’s second Spectre takes time the further apart each character is from the other. Both teammates and enemies alike can see a spark run across the ground as a character's mind shifts into their second body. Players can also redeploy their Spectre in a better vantage spot by throwing out an infinitely reusable puck that draws the Spectre into wherever it lands (also subject to the same timed delay). This mechanic can be used to get a player up onto a vantage spot or across a choke point without needing to run out into the open.</span></p>
<p><span>The concept of Duality makes almost everything in Spectre Divide require two separate halves to create a singular game experience. Players will customize both of their champions individually and in the preview build I got my hands on, things like outfits and cosmetic accessories were limited to only one Spectre at a time. This meant no matching tracksuits or Afros and sunglasses for the pair. The same goes for weapons: aside from the initial buy round, where players are limited to pistols and a few hundred bucks to their name, the in-round shop appears limited to forcing each champion to pick a separate weapon. Granted, this may be a smart quick-pick system at play here and there may be a way to pick which weapon to buy for each warm body manually, but I couldn’t decipher the full breadth of tactics during my few rounds with Spectre Divide. For much of my experience, I settled on a combination of heavy machine guns with a massive clip size for laying down suppressing fire into a choke point accompanied by some semi-automatic sniper rifles for longer-range engagements.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Spectre Divide | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01JX0mOjjKk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span>True to its Counter-Strike lineage, the core of the team composition lies in the Buy section that begins each round of play. Players start with a limited pool of cash that grows each round based on individual performance, both good and bad, to purchase weapons, armor, and grenades for that specific round. Survive the round, and what you’ve purchased or picked up from the ground carries into the next; die, and you’re back to your starting pistol and whatever cash the Mountaintop gods have bestowed upon you to get back up to speed. From there, players explore the tried-and-true CS-style bomb defusal gameplay, with one side actively trying to blow up one of the two bomb sites in a given stage, while the other is tasked with either taking out the enemy team before they can successfully plant a bomb or defusing it before it can explode.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to a main weapon and secondary pistol, players will also have three separate abilities to use that are purchased at the start of each round and thrown like grenades. Rather than building out a champion and selecting these abilities from a wide pool of skills, the abilities are instead given out before each round by allying with a particular Sponsor. Each Sponsor in Spectre Divide grants the player the use of three distinctively different skills that all have their tactical uses. The most basic of Sponsors grants players abilities akin to a flash grenade and explosive while some of the more complex Sponsor kits yield surveillance drones, poisoned smoke screens, and a twin-linked health booster that can restore either your health or the health of a teammate you can move your crosshair over to. With eight different Sponsors available at the launch of Spectre Divide, players will have time to explore what trio to run with will be the most advantageous on the battlefield.</span></p>
<p><span>Spectre Divide’s gunplay is insanely snappy and responsive to the twitch shooter. What’s unique to the visceral firefights that Mountaintop Studios is bringing to the competition is something they’re coining “true-to-crosshair” accuracy. For ninety-five per cent of the weapons available in Spectre Divide, that initial shot will land exactly where the player is pointing, even while moving. To balance out the one-hit kill sniper rifles, these weapons do have a very brief cooldown period where the accuracy has to recenter itself after moving. This gives semi-automatic weapons that might not fire very quickly a massive initial shot. With the Duality system, losing your active character a second chance by taking over their Spectre, no matter how far across the map they might be.</span></p>
<p><span>Spectre Divide has nailed that initial first impression with a unique twist on the tried-and-true 6v6 gunplay, but it’s only a matter of time before we see if this has the potential to be the next great competitive shooter. The concept of Duality will certainly take some practice to get the hang of, and how the Esports community reacts will be a make-it-or-break-it moment for Mountaintop Studios. Spectre Divide is one of the most fascinating new mechanics to the first-person shooter genre since the inclusion of last-man-standing and battle royale modes.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s no release date yet, but Mountaintop Studios has already confirmed that its competitive tactical shooter will initially be PC-exclusive.&nbsp;</span></p>

The third-person action-adventure game let players hop into the bounty-hunting boots of Jango Fett aka Boba Fett’s clone dad from <em>Attack of The Clones</em>. It wasn’t great, but was a fun prequel to <em>Episode II.</em> Now, 20 years later, it’s been remastered, improved, and ported to new consoles, and while it looks and plays better than ever, it’s still mostly the same not-great PS2-era action game, but now with a flashlight. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-remake-boba-fett-jango-1851564002&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-remake-boba-fett-jango-1851564002">The remastered<em> Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em></a></span>, out now on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, tells the same story as the original version did back in 2002. The game is set about a decade before <em>Attack of the Clones</em> and stars Jango Fett, who is contacted by Count Dooku and told to hunt down a Dark Jedi and criminal leader. If he can take down the leader he’ll collect 5 million credits. What he doesn’t realize is that this is a test orchestrated by Dooku and Palpatine to eliminate a threat to their plans while also finding a strong warrior to be the source of their clone army. </p><p>Needless to say, everything that happens in <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> isn’t canon anymore. But that’s not a dealbreaker. In fact, it’s nice to go back to a time when<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-14-weirdest-and-strangest-star-wars-names-1850455711&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-14-weirdest-and-strangest-star-wars-names-1850455711"><em>Star Wars</em> games got weird</a></span> and wild with the lore because nobody was worried about all of this connecting and knew that series creator George Lucas could, at any time, retcon everything in his next film.</p><h2 id="h3547"><a id=""></a>The same game, for better and mostly worse...</h2><p>Like<em> Bounty Hunter</em>’s unchanged story and cutscenes, its gameplay and levels are mostly left untouched in this new remaster. Instead, developers Aspyr have focused on improving the visuals, the game’s performance, and making it easier to control Jango Fett. And they’ve succeeded. </p><p><em>Bounty Hunter </em>is easier to play now thanks to a modern control scheme and steady framerate. It also looks about as good as a 20-year-old PS2 game can look thanks to improved textures, lighting, and resolution. And yeah, the developers added a flashlight so you can see in some darker areas, which is nice, and time now slows down when using Jango’s scanner, which is very helpful.</p><p>However, it’s time to acknowledge the Bantha in the room: <em>Bounty Hunter</em> was never a great game. In fact, I’d argue that in a lot of ways <em>Bounter Hunter</em> is a bad game. </p><p>The levels feel too big and empty. I often found myself wandering around brown and grey hallways wondering when the next group of baddies would appear and break up the mononity. But enemies aren’t much fun to fight and don’t do much to improve the game. That’s partially because enemy AI is horrible, and also because combat is repetitive. Get ready to shoot groups of the same enemies over and over again as they run at you in a straight line or fall off a ledge and die before they even reach you. </p><p>And while there are other weapons to find in the various missions you go on, those weapons are never good enough to compete with your standard dual blasters which pack a punch, fire as fast as you can pull the trigger, and have infinite ammo. You never need to swap to anything else! </p><p>There is a jetpack in <em>Bounty Hunter,</em> which you get early on in the game, but jetpacking around is more annoying than fun due to how limited it is and a wonky camera that makes it hard to use during a firefight. Worst of all: Bounty hunting in this game is a frustrating chore.</p><h2 id="h3548"><a id=""></a>Being a <em>Star Wars</em> bounty hunter isn’t much fun</h2><p>Every level in <em>Bounty Hunter </em>features a set number of bounty targets that you can optionally hunt down, capture, and collect, either alive or dead. In theory, it’s a neat idea that any NPC or enemy you encounter during a mission could be a wanted criminal. In practice, it sucks so much. </p><p>That’s because to find these targets, you have to scan every enemy and NPC you encounter first, mark any that are targets, and then either kill them or tie them up using a wire gun. If you kill a target before you’ve scanned and marked them, you get nothing. So every fight becomes a slog as you take cover and scan each enemy before fighting them.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-recommend-id="image://644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Aspyr / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-recommend-id="image://644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And sure, you can ignore the bounty targets, but then the game is just a so-so third-person shooter with some wonky platforming bits. The bounty hunting part of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is the only thing keeping this game from just becoming a dull journey through boring brown rooms. But collecting bounties is so annoying that I wouldn’t blame anyone for just skipping it all. Do that, though, and you’ll quickly discover how little <em>Bounty Hunter</em> has to offer.<br></p><p>For sure, the remaster of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter </em>is the best way to play this old Jango Fett adventure. The additions and tweaks made to the game are smart and I still like the wacky EU story it tells of Jango hunting down a Dark Jedi. But sadly, this just isn’t a good game. </p><p>In all honesty, I’d have preferred a full remake of <em>Bounty Hunter</em> that improved the combat, levels, and bounty-hunting mechanics.

<p>Avowed is being delayed into 2025. That’s according to a new report from The Verge’s Tom Warren.</p>



<p>In his latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211199/microsoft-teams-new-ui-chat-xbox-employees-studio-d-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Notepad </a>newsletter, Warren says that the game is being delayed slightly from Fall 2024 to early 2025. As far as a reason, Warren says it has nothing to do with the game’s development status.</p>



<p>“I understand Avowed is in good shape, this is more a matter of wanting to give the game breathing room outside of a very busy period for Xbox Game Pass,”  he said.</p>







<p>As of publishing, Obsidian has yet to make an official announcement of the delay. However, that is expected to come in the near future.</p>



<p>Obsidian was originally slated to release Avowed this fall, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-accidentally-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November release date</a> recently being leaked. That date was never ultimately confirmed, leaving this window open for a delay should they need it. </p>



<p>As far as game’s coming to Xbox Game Pass, the biggest is the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The first Call of Duty to come to the service on Game Pass, it seems as though pushing Avowed out of the same launch window will allow it to not become overshadowed.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Obsidian and Microsoft for comments on the report. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/core-keeper-delayed-on-last-gen-consoles-and-switch.942327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie sandbox survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>has been delayed on last-gen platforms, so if you've been waiting to check this one out on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch, then you're going to have to wait a little longer, unfortunately.</p>
<p>In a message posted on X (formerly Twitter) yesterday,&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games revealed that the game's last-gen release won't be going ahead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-release-date">on August 27th as planned</a>. Instead, the game will be launching on September 17th on those platforms, and the physical versions of the game for those systems will be arriving then as well.</p>
<p>Luckily, the release of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s 1.0 version on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S hasn't been affected by this delay; those versions will still arrive on August 27th. Sadly, the physical versions of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions will now be arriving alongside the last-gen version.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen-platforms-farm.jpg?itok=_Rtdu0Ms 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen-platforms-farm.jpg?itok=HkrTTF33 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to cook on last-gen platforms.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Fireshine and Pugstorm,&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s delay is for the usual reason; to ensure that the game is "the best experience possible at launch" and that players experience the game "at its very best".</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, it's a "mining sandbox adventure" in which players team up (or potentially head into the mines solo) in order to gather resources, build bases for themselves, and take on tough enemies.</p>
<p>Released into Early Access in 2022, the game quickly started racking up sales, amassing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-reach-100k-in-two-days">100,000 within its first two days</a>&nbsp;then hitting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-top-250k-within-week">250,000 milestone in just a week</a>. In less than two weeks,&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-top-500k-in-two-weeks">rack up half a million sales</a>, so it's safe to say there are a lot of people awaiting its 1.0 release.</p>

<p><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 27th, although you'll have to wait until September 17th for the physical versions. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive on September 17th as well.</p>

In all the matches I’ve played in the game’s beta as the Guardians of the Galaxy leader Star-Lord alongside other heroes and villains in the Marvel universe, I find myself using <em>Overwatch</em>’s terminology. Escort matches are “payloads,” Star-Lord’s “Blaster Barrage” ability is a “Reaper Ult” because both have dual-wielding gunners dancing in gunfire and shooting enemies within a small radius. As new players have joined, my friends and I have relied on <em>Overwatch </em>comparisons as shorthand for how different heroes work. <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is pretty unapologetic in inviting those comparisons, but I can’t help but wonder what NetEase’s take on the genre has to offer players if I can’t boot it up without thinking of a different game. Maybe it’s that it doesn’t have ten years of drama and fan in-fighting to shape it yet.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is unapologetic in how much it clearly draws from <em>Overwatch</em>. It has the same objective structures of escorting carts across a map or capturing points, and every hero feels like their kits were made with a handful of <em>Overwatch </em>characters in mind. Star-Lord blends Tracer’s hornet-like hit-and-run style with Soldier: 76’s aimbot ultimate. Rocket Raccoon mixes Baptiste’s healing and damage alternating weapons with an old Orisa ult that powers up every teammate within range of a device he sets down in the middle of a battlefield. Adam Warlock harkens back to Mercy’s original team-reviving resurrection.</p><figure id="" data-id="0639b7221004a05ce0fe49bb5991afc0" data-recommend-id="image://0639b7221004a05ce0fe49bb5991afc0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hella casts a magical ability on Doctor Strange." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hella casts a magical ability on Doctor Strange." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0639b7221004a05ce0fe49bb5991afc0" data-recommend-id="image://0639b7221004a05ce0fe49bb5991afc0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hella casts a magical ability on Doctor Strange." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For some, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> probably embodies the best parts of <em>Overwatch</em>, a lot of which have been patched out and tweaked in the game’s eight-year history. It hasn’t yet been sanded down to prioritize competitive play and headshots, or endlessly reworked and readjusted to avoid annoying metas. Right now, it feels like a chaotic frenzy of high-impact abilities, some incredible teamplay potential, and really endearing, off-the-wall decisions like including Jeff the Land Shark. It doesn’t feel quite as polished as its direct competitor, but maybe that’s what those who are tired of Blizzard’s botched approach might need right now.<br></p><p><em>Overwatch </em>hasn’t lived up to its promise since it was originally revealed 10 years ago, and that has only grown more apparent since the launch of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>in 2022. The sequel has shaved off nearly everything that made it a new game, from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-mode-pve-content-release-date-window-1850442457&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-mode-pve-content-release-date-window-1850442457">gutting the big PvE suite</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">reportedly canceling the promised story mode</a></span>.

It’s kinda refreshing that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is unrefined but not weighed down by all that baggage.</p><figure id="" data-id="ee8ec256691bf0040a445e5352a47a44" data-recommend-id="image://ee8ec256691bf0040a445e5352a47a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The roster of Marvel Rivals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The roster of Marvel Rivals." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee8ec256691bf0040a445e5352a47a44" data-recommend-id="image://ee8ec256691bf0040a445e5352a47a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The roster of Marvel Rivals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As players devour <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, start tier-listing heroes, and decide upon a meta, the stakes for every patch note will grow. If <em>Marvel Rivals</em> lasts as long as <em>Overwatch</em>, parts of it will probably be as unrecognizable in a few years. Right now, it’s a fast-paced, Marvel multiversified version of a game that hasn’t yet lost its way. Whether or not NetEase learns from its inspiration’s mistakes remains to be seen. I’m too much of an <em>Overwatch 2</em> sicko to jump ship, but I can see how <em>Marvel Rivals </em>might appeal to someone who hasn’t pushed a payload in a few years. Hopefully, some competition is enough to get Blizzard to examine its own failings. Perhaps, one day, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will teach <em>Overwatch </em>a thing or two.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ubisoft is teaming up with the National Football League and the National Football League Players Association on NFL Primetime Fantasy, a new mobile free-to-play fantasy-football title. Thanks to the NFL partnership, gameplay will tie in to live games as they happen.</p><p>The live tie-in element will allow players to make calls during live NFL games "by anticipating big moments or swapping out players from their bench at the right time," Ubisoft's press release says. Players who make the best game-time calls will get major boosts to their fantasy scores, and they can compete online against friends or on a global leaderboard.</p><p>The NFL's VP of video gaming Ed Kiang says the upcoming mobile title is part of the NFL's "dedication to offering non-traditional video gaming experiences for our fans," with NFL Primetime Fantasy marking "the first NFL-licensed mobile game tied to our live games."</p><p>The gameplay is card-based, with players encouraged to build up their collections of NFL player cards, which can then be upgraded through gameplay. The game will feature regular weekly events taking place all throughout the season, right up until the Super Bowl. Players will also be able to form a team with friends in order to compete in a playoff tournament.</p><p>NFL Primetime Fantasy will kick off during the 2024 NFL regular season, with a beta testing period up first, before the worldwide launch in November 2024. Players can register for the beta <a href="http://primetimefantasy.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>, and all players who participate in the beta will unlock a free early-access bundle at launch.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The dungeon experience in an MMO is sometimes the best part of the game, but grinding to get to the endgame dungeons can be a chore. A new Swedish studio is looking to ease that burden with Fellowship, a new multiplayer online dungeon adventure game--or "MODA"--coming to PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Fellowship takes the dungeon-running experience of popular MMOs and streamlines it by letting you group with up to three other players, select a dungeon, and then head right into it. Each player can choose between a healer, tank, or damage-dealer when choosing a character, and each class will have a selection of characters with different kits that allow your group to balance the

will offer "quick play" dungeons with 10-15 minute runs per sessions, as well as "ranked" dungeons set to the group's preferences--with difficulty and other modifiers available before jumping in. Dungeons will scale in difficulty as they are completed as well, which means even running the same dungeon multiple times will yield different challenges and rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is being developed by Chief Rebel, a new studio based in Stockholm, Sweden, and it has been in development since 2018. The team includes developers who have worked on top franchises including Diablo, Helldivers, World Of Warcraft, and more.</p><p>Fellowship does not have an official release window as of this reveal, but Chief Rebel will be holding a closed alpha test session August 15-20 on PC.
