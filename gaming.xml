            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>is a new, rather awkwardly-titled Metroidvania from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter" rel="nofollow">Hyper Light Drifter</a>&nbsp;</em>studio Heart Machine and indie powerhouse Devolver Digital, and it asks a very important question: what would happen if you found yourself sharing your brain with a demon?</p>

<p>Well, if this roughly 15-20-hour adventure is anything to go by, it turns out the answer is simple: you'd end up exploring a sprawling map, unlocking a suite of movement abilities, and fighting challenging bosses to progress a story about "codependency, loss, and survival", according to the devs.</p>

<p>I won't mince words at the outset:&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>&nbsp;offers a pretty bog-standard example of its genre, at least in gameplay terms, and I'm not entirely sure its narrative explores the aforementioned themes with enough depth or complexity to make it worth recommending either.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Is Metroidvania By the Numbers</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-exploration.jpg?itok=L83ybhHF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-exploration.jpg?itok=THqnYZPC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>doesn't have much new to offer in structural terms.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite an initially enthralling and fascinating setting - that of a city wracked by an apocalyptic event and still shuddering with the aftereffects of demonic invasion -&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>quickly settles into a rather rote Metroidvania rhythm.</p>

<p>If you've played the greats in the genre, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow">Hollow Knight</a>&nbsp;</em>(or, indeed, <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/castlevania-symphony-of-night" rel="nofollow">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>&nbsp;</i>and <i>Super Metroid</i>), then you'll know what to expect here.</p>

<p>You'll gradually uncover a large, interconnected space full of themed areas, using newly-acquired traversal powers to reach hitherto-unavailable spaces, all while upgrading your combat abilities and survival capacity as you go.</p>

<p>It's not a particularly inspired take on the genre's typical gameplay conceits, and short of repurposing certain household objects as weapons - main character Luca will wield kitchen knives or a baseball bat rather than swords and spears - there's not much here that's pushing the envelope.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're looking for nothing more than a structurally unchallenging exploration-based platformer with some solid combat, that may not be a drawback for you, but if you're searching for any kind of innovation from your next Metroidvania hit, it's safe to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the level design and art style will offer a diverting vista; you'll see a huge rupture in reality off in the background, for instance, or a series of floating office desks serving as platforms - but they're little more than set dressing for a very straightforward set of maps.</p>

<h2>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Is Fun, but Repetitive</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-tygo.jpg?itok=dJdGrZyW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-tygo.jpg?itok=lZZhmk0Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boss fights in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>are a rare highlight.</figcaption></figure><p>Solid is very much the word to describe the combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>. Heart Machine says the combat here contains "elements of platform fighters" like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</a></p>

<p>That's&nbsp;superficially true; you can juggle enemies and use a variety of different special attacks mapped to directional button-attack combos, and you can utilize an aerial dodge to keep yourself safe from nasty air attacks as well.</p>

<p>Honestly, though, I managed to make it through&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>without using most of the purportedly&nbsp;<em>Smash Bros.</em>-inspired moves at Luca's disposal. Early on, you'll unlock a parry (another increasingly overused mechanic, I think), and that'll carry you through the majority of <em>Possessor(s)</em>.</p>

<p>For the most part, combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>works pretty well, even if it fails to realize its full&nbsp;platform fighter potential.</p>

<p>Attacks land with a fairly satisfying heft (provided you're using a heavier weapon like the baseball bat), and knocking enemies against walls once their&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>-style poise is broken can be cathartic as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>falls into a very common trap that's littered with the corpses of lesser Metroidvanias, and that's enemy variety. Put simply, you'll have seen every enemy on offer here within the first handful of hours, and the rest is essentially going through the motions.</p>

<p>As it progresses, Heart Machine's adventure will throw enemy variants at you, but they're little more than palette swaps with slightly more powerful attacks, so dodging or parrying them is a matter of dull course.</p>

<p>As is usually the case with games that struggle with enemy variety,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>quickly devolves into muscle memory and tedium. I was begging for just one or two surprises to be hurled at me, but those surprises never came, and fighting the same set of possessed objects and animals became insanely repetitive.</p>

<p>Bosses are a slightly different matter; while there aren't many of them (and&nbsp;the sidequests reuse them in a borderline unforgivable manner), they're fun to fight and surprising in terms of their movesets. It's just the parts in between that feel boring.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Has an Okay, If Uninspired Story</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-story.jpg?itok=gDaMcKCY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-story.jpg?itok=Yzu-rYFG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Possessor(s)</em>' story isn't particularly new, but its characters are alright.</figcaption></figure><p>With combat and map exploration proving relatively unexciting, it's up to&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>' story to pick up the slack, but I don't know if it's ready to bear that kind of weight.</p>

<p>The characters here are endearing enough. Luca is a guarded young girl who's suddenly having to share her head with a demon, Rhem; they both need each other to survive at the outset of&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>, so their relationship is initially an uneasy one.</p>

<p>From that setup, however, I'm sure you can quickly guess how things are going to end up. Could it be that Luca and Rhem will find a grudging respect for one another as they both learn about their respective histories?</p>

<p>That's the core problem with&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)'&nbsp;</em>story in a nutshell; everything unfolds in an entirely obvious and predictable manner. A corporation called Agradyne, which manufactures batteries, is involved, and the fact that it's a corporation is literally all you need to know about its role in the narrative.</p>

<p>There are no twists or turns here, nothing that surprised or engaged me beyond the baseline level. At times,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>revealed information to me that I think it thought was surprising, but I just rolled my eyes and said "well, obviously".</p>

<p>With that said, Heart Machine must have been doing something at least vaguely right, because I did have a tiny little lump in my throat at&nbsp;the story's conclusion. I don't think it's a particularly memorable tale, but it serves its purpose while it's around.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-whip.jpg?itok=Xi-wx6bG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-whip.jpg?itok=tNoGmtIe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From downtown!</figcaption></figure><p>I enjoyed my time with&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>exactly enough to play through it once and then never think about it again. Its well-worn story is played out and unengaging, but its characters are fun enough to be around for exactly the time they're on screen and no more.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of Metroidvanias, like me, you'll quickly settle into the familiar Sunday-afternoon rhythm of&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>, but those who don't like the genre or who are still coming down from the high of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow">Silksong</a>&nbsp;</em>can safely wait before being possessed by this particular demon.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920"><em>Kotaku</em> has been reporting for the whole year</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Trading Card Game</em> has been in a crisis from which it’s showing no signs of recovery. As new card prices hit record highs, it naturally draws in many new collectors hoping to hit it big, which causes scalpers to swoop in to drive up scarcity and prices, attracting more new collectors, then more scalpers, and so on, a vicious circle that is increasingly tightening, strangling the hobby. This situation has now reached a spectacular new low, with reports that people are attempting to sell the Mega Gengar ex special art rare card from <em>PTCG</em> set Mega Dream ex for $800. But there’s a small problem: the card doesn’t exist yet. It’s set to be part of Japan’s Mega Dream ex special set, only officially announced on Friday, which doesn’t go on sale until November 28.</p>

 <p>Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">multiple promises throughout 2025 from The Pokémon Company</a>, it remains the case that it’s close to impossible to walk into either a specialist or mainstream store and buy a pack of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards released in the last 12 months. Since November 2024’s pre-orders began for the Eevee-themed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-pull-rates-rares-1851742071">Prismatic Evolutions</a>, new sets have sold out before human beings can click on sites to buy them, while <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-scalpers-mega-evolution-tiktok-2000638182">stock in stores has been stripped from shelves by camping scalpers</a> before kids can spend their allowance. The only solution is to outprint the demand, but as yet The Pokémon Company has demonstrated that it either can’t or won’t do this, and in fact <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">seems to be going out of its way to make the situation far worse</a>. And following on from the gold card fiasco of Mega Evolutions, the latest English-language set that goes on sale November 14—Phantasmal Flames—ups this ante by including a single gold card, and having it be the most desired Pokémon on cardboard, Mega Charizard. It’s going to be&nbsp;<em>crazy</em>.</p>

 <p>But if there’s one card that could potentially prove more popular than Mega Charizard ex (which is also getting a Special Illustration Rare version that will inevitably fetch more than $500), it’s Mega Gengar ex, and that ghostly beast is appearing in&nbsp; Japan’s Mega Dream ex later this month. And as reported by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/mega-gengar-ex-240-pre-sale"><em>Wargamer</em></a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/weve-reached-unprecedented-levels-of-cooked-the-mega-gengar-pokemon-tcg-is-selling-for-usd800-even-though-it-doesnt-actually-exist-yet/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>), people are <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/397243002072?_skw=Mega+Gengar+ex+%23240%2F193&amp;itmmeta=01K9PPMWXCK456FFJQCCGRDSZG&amp;hash=item5c7d872cd8:g:T~kAAeSwdQlpD~Dz&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA0FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1dNIO%2F55w8M20oPYIKOiRGJYfOPTDZbfsqACeI0yA58V9SgTbGZAjx5jzskijh0KLARlhOnqiyoxGbOxSSqCge0%2Fc0KZ51o9SqnbF%2FvDvkeODnztPa3GHAB%2BdPoLIll6UNOAteF9UtmUl1DdKYKfJ4sEn%2BqZ68kmmWn5CgG5Q40dXRGfJwlfFbSfRUxLH6Lo8fGHPhuzdakr%2Bec9lHbZ3BGZaeMOv9DjJbMFexcO2HnxbjHI2M48amPrcvzaMFjiIk%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR-bO09bNZg">already putting the card up for sale on eBay</a>. For $797.99.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643010" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643010"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643010">© eBay / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To be clear, even though you will see American YouTubers ripping open packs of international cards long before their street dates (either because they are sent samples by TPCi, as we are, or because they get retail stock ahead of sale), this isn’t the case for the Japanese sets. No one has these cards yet. The art for the Mega Gengar ex Special Art Rare was only revealed digitally on Friday. Then cut and pasted onto eBay with a price tag.</p>

 <p>Japan is having all the same problems with stock as the rest of the world, such that even physical Pokémon Centers over there are—I’ve been told—limiting customers to four single packs each. Scalpers will likely be abusing retail options to get hold of the booster boxes, stripping them down to resell valuable cards, and then dumping the bulk. That’s how someone could be confident enough to believe they can honor a sale of a card that is probably still in production right now.</p>

 <p>Presumably the only thing stopping people from trying to hawk copies of the English version of the Mega Gengar ex is that they haven’t got an image of it yet. It will likely be included in whatever January’s special set of Pokémon cards proves to be, and guarantees that this tiresome situation will drag on into at least the start of 2026. It’s a bubble, and it <em>will</em> burst, but the concern is just how much harm it will have done by that point. Not only is <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-magic-the-gathering-scalpers-cards-2000632017">an entire generation of children being excluded from the hobby</a> (and thus from becoming the next generation of collectors), but it’s having a real-life impact on specialist card stores. Store owners are telling me they’re unable to get stock, and that TPCi is actively refusing to engage with them about the issues, meaning customers aren’t coming in. One store owner told me he’s resorted to getting up in the early hours of the morning to try to buy packs online from other retailers, just so he has something to sell on his shelves, while knowing he’s driving the problem by doing so. It’s miserable.</p> <p>So, don’t buy from these scalpers. Don’t endorse those selling sealed product at double or triple the MSRP. Refusing to participate is the only action we can take to address the situation, and thinking, “Well everyone else is doing it, so…” makes you part of the problem. Yes, it’d sure be great to pull that gold Mega Charizard—it could pay for a vacation—but you most likely won’t. (The pull rates for one of the Mega Evolution golds were one in every 2,250 packs, ffs.) Oh, and especially don’t buy from people claiming to sell you a card that’s not even printed yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Game Awards, the final major video game industry event for the year, will take place at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles on December 11, 2025, and will be available to watch on YouTube, Twitch, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok, as per usual. This year, however, for the first time, the trailer-show masquerading as an awards show will be available to watch on Amazon Prime Video as well.</p>



<p>Game Awards creator and host Geoff Keighley announced the news <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1988291558417068465">with a post on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, where he writes, "<em>We’re excited to welcome</em> <em>Prime Video as another distribution partner for</em> <em>The Game Awards live on Thursday, December 11. For the first time, The Game Awards will stream live on Prime Video around the world in more than 200 countries and territories</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's a significant move for the awards show and for Amazon as it is seemingly finding ways to keep ties to the video game industry through its TV show adaptations and now the live streaming of its most popular awards show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">but not through the actual development of video games</a>. </p>



<p>As part of the partnership, not only will Amazon be livestreaming the show, it will launch a Game Awards-dedicated store for users to purchase Game Awards merchandise and take advantage of "<em>Prime-exclusive, limited-time deals across nominated games, new releases, hardware, and more, revealed in real time</em>."</p>



<p>In a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/game-awards-streaming-amazon-prime-video-twitch-1236574939/">Variety</a>, Keighley said, "<em>The great news about this is that it's additive and we still get to air everywhere we already air the show, and we're adding Prime Video as a partner, which is really exciting for us. We've had lots of conversations with people over the years, and we're like, there's no way, there's no world where we could ever really take the show off YouTube and Twitch - where it was born back in 2014</em>."</p>



<p>Keighley also added that Amazon's involvement will not "<em>change</em>" the show. "<em>We're still making the same show. I came out of a life of working on television networks. And you had television folks that would give opinions and things on what you want the show to be. This is still The Game Awards. It's the exact same show. They're really just another distribution outlet, and they're really letting us build the show the way</em> <em>we always do. We're not changing anything about the show to accommodate a new platform</em>."</p>

<p>Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé says he’s surprised that Microsoft hasn’t released more Xbox games for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In an interview with The Game Business, Reggie discussed Xbox’s third-party strategy and admitted he expected to see far more crossover between the two platforms by now.</p>







<p><strong>“I’m surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective,”</strong> <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">Fils-Aimé sa</a><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">i</a><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">d</a>. <strong>“Certainly, some games could easily be ported over to Switch 2. And I’m surprised that we haven’t seen more of that.”</strong></p>



<p>Fils-Aimé went on to say he thought Xbox would have announced several new titles ahead of the holidays.</p>



<p><strong>“I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday,”</strong> he said.<strong> “All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I’m surprised it hasn’t happened.”</strong></p>



<p>Currently, Microsoft has released Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 on the Switch 2 with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle set to come sometime in 2026. Aside from that, however, there hasn’t been any other first-party port or new released announced for Nintendo’s latest console. </p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-says-they-want-to-support-the-switch-2">Xbox Says They Want To Support The Switch 2</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, just after the Switch 2 was announced, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said that he wants to support the Switch 2. He even went as far to say that Nintendo has been a “great partner” for Xbox.</p>







<p><strong>“I’m really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them,”</strong> Spencer said at the time. “<strong>And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future.”</strong></p>



<p>While many expect more first party Xbox games to make their way to the Switch 2, when it happens remains anyone’s guess. In the meantime, all fans can do is hope.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1904a2299f646"><a title="romancing saga 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1904a2299f646/romancing-saga-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>I think it's fair to say we got a bit of an unexpected gift when Square Enix re-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_3">Romancing SaGa 3</a> for Switch back in November of 2019.</p>
<p>While it may not generate quite the same level of excitement as your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasies</a> (and that's understandable), Romancing SaGa 3 deserves any plaudits it gets for bringing a level of freedom and randomness to the RPG genre that was quite unique back in 1995. In fact, the whole series does.</p>
<p>With 3 in particular, we have a game that was bold, and still feels bold, in how it gave players a selection of eight protagonists to get stuck into the story with. Just like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, and its (much better) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler_ii">sequel</a>, you can journey through Romancing SaGa 3's narrative multiple times thanks to the clever, criss-crossing storylines that make for a genuinely engrossing experience.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xyoihm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>It helps that the actual story here is fairly strong as these things go to boot, with players assuming control of their chosen protagonist in the immediate aftermath of a Death Eclipse (or Morastrum), a horrifying event that occurs every 300 years that sees all newborns in the year of the Eclipse die, save for one, who becomes a Child of Destiny.</p>
<p>Right, I didn't come here to spoil the story, so that's enough of that. It's a cracker of a premise, and the game does a solid job of exploring it. Back in 1995, RPGs were very much still on-rails for the most part; they didn't allow for much in the way of "experimentation" in some of the ways that Romancing SaGa 3 does.</p>
<p>And it's experimentation that comes through allowing you to choose who to roll with, leading to events playing out from shifting perspectives, whilst also imbuing the whole endeavour with a striking sort of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laissez-faire">'laissez-faire'</a> attitude, thanks to levelling up systems that sort of just go "yeah, mate, eh...here, have some random boosts for your efforts." In true SaGa style.</p>

<p>Rather than being able to count on a fixed upgrade rate to any specific aspect of your character, here it's random all the way, and it feels great. There's a ramshackle sort of approach...perhaps ramshackle isn't quite the correct word as it feels organised, but there's certainly an attempt - and a successful one - to make things feel <em>organic</em>, to make the world feel like one you can inhabit and meander around in, rather than just blowing through in a straight, precise and calculated manner. So, maybe it allows <em>you</em> to approach <em>it</em> in a ramshackle manner is a more appropriate description.</p>
<p>The weapon "sparking" system (returning from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_2">Romancing SaGa 2</a>) continues this approach, which gives each of the characters the chance to gain new skills randomly as they fight. Whilst some players may not gel entirely with this I personally love it, and I think it's a system that enhances the organic vibe in a smart way, whilst also ensuring that you still upgrade and progress.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do agree it probably works to the detriment of the overall focus of the gameplay loops, and that's something picked up on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_3">in our 6/10 review</a> of the re-release. It can be frustrating and off-putting if you want to methodically improve and do the usual sort of RPG things with character progression. For me, though, it's successful in what it sets out to do with being a little bit free-wheeling, that the loss of some direction in the more traditional video game sense is acceptable.</p>
<p>I also love how the underlying ethos of all of this is carried into Kenjo Ito's soundtrack for the game. Again here, rather than have a plan or specific theme in mind, the composer approached it with the idea of allowing its sound to develop and evolve over time. It's all very zen, lads.</p>
<p>Have a happy birthday, Romancing SaGa 3. I'd ask you if you'd planned anything, but I don't see that being your style.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Have you played Romancing SaGa 3 in its original or remastered form? Agree that its uniqueness outshines its frustrations? Let us know!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>ARC Raiders is, at the time of this writing, one of the most popular games in the video game industry. There are currently more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">300K people on Steam alone playing it right now</a>. Its developer, Embark Studios, just celebrated <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-continues-strong-launch-hits-700k-concurrent-players/">700K+ concurrent players over the weekend</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">over 4 million copies sold since it launched less than two weeks ago</a>.</p>



<p>Embark is also a relatively small studio making huge waves in competitive genres, with its free-to-play first-person shooter, The Finals, and now with its third-person extraction shooter, ARC Raiders. In many ways, it's great to see a small to mid-size team have such an impact where historically only juggernauts can survive, and yet, a cloud of controversy hangs over the game, and conversation around that controversy has bubbled over in online spaces, thanks to debate surrounding a single review.</p>



<p>In its review, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer gave ARC Raiders 2/5 stars</a>, and specifically called out Embark Studios' use of generative AI voices for NPCs as a core criticism (it's worth noting that the same writer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-review-mechanically-thrilling-thematically-wanting">reviewed The Finals for Eurogamer</a>, and gave it 3/5 stars, while also critiquing the use of GenAI voices).</p>



<p>What has followed in the wake of this review is a large conversation across the video game industry about how we should talk about games that use generative AI, how we should review those games, and what should or should not go into a review. Game developers, players, YouTubers, and now, even Epic Games' chief executive officer, Tim Sweeney, have joined the conversation to give their two cents.</p>



<p>Sweeney entered the conversation by first saying <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1988053268535406695">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> responding to the review, "<em>Political opinions should go into op eds folks</em>." While it's worth pointing out that a review is inherently a person's opinion (which other users point out to Sweeney), the point that Sweeney expounds on is his argument that falling one way or the other on GenAI is 'political.'</p>



<p>Responding to a user asking him if it is political or not to dislike and critique GenAI within the context of a game review, Sweeney writes, "<em>Yes. This technology increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples, and views on whether this is a net good and should be rewarded, or bad and should be fought against, are speculative and generally distributed along political lines</em>."</p>



<p>He continues, "<em>Since the author states the pessimistic case, I'll put the optimistic one here. Game developers compete to build the best games in order to attract gamers. When tech increases productivity, competition leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people</em>."</p>



<p>Sweeney further claims that he sees GenAI voices as "<em>an even bigger opportunity for in-game voice and voice actors</em>," and that he "<em>always found pre-written lines of fixed dialogue super limiting. It was painful to write text dialog in ZZT in 1991 after writing more dynamically-composed text adventure games in the 80s! AI dialog generation</em> <em>+ human personality tuning could totally transform gaming</em>."</p>



<p>It's difficult to understand how generative AI voices tuned by humans create "an even bigger opportunity" for actors, since those production pipeline models would inherently be designed to use fewer actors, resulting in fewer acting jobs available and ultimately less opportunity. Also, while any writer will tell you that writing can be a painful exercise at times, any writer worth their salt would rather work through those pains than let someone else, and even worse, something else, do it for them. Writing, like practically anything else in life, is a 'no pain, no gain' craft.</p>



<p>All that aside, Eurogamer's review has clearly hit a nerve and sparked further conversation about using generative AI in games, particularly in ways that directly replace jobs historically done by humans. Last month, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1988053268535406695">Starfinder: Afterlight developers told Wccftech that "<em>there's no point in using AI for any creative endeavor</em>."</a>  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games is addressing the launch issues of <em>Riftbound: Origins</em>. The debut launch of the official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> trading card game has been marred by production and supply problems, negatively impacting the user experience.</p>

<h2>Riot Games' Response to the <em>Riftbound: Origins</em> Launch</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/announcements/riftbound-origins-launch-learnings/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Riot Games starts with gratitude at the reception to <em>Riftbound: Origins</em>. Furthermore, they confirm that the next set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-teases-league-of-legends-fans-with-riftbound-spiritforged-teaser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em></a>, is still on set to launch some time next year.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-starter-deck-promo.jpg?itok=bYk0kZZq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-starter-deck-promo.jpg?itok=CCZLwWpf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The focus on the post then shifts to the various production issues players have found while opening their first cards. For collectors, there was the fact that a certain percentage of booster packs were missing a rare card. Since each booster is supposed to contain 2 rares, this is a big deal. Worse still, it is an issue that won't be addressed until the game's third set.</p>

<p>The good news is you can get replacement rares. You simply have to fill out a form on UVS Games' website, then wait to see if you're approved. But if you bought packs in bulk, you may still miss out since the program is limited to 3 per person and 6 per household.</p>

<p>The second issue is a more subtle, textural issue regarding the cards themselves: Riot explains that due to the card stock used for printing, more wear was applied to the cutting tools, leading to burred, or rough, edges on the cards. The good news is this process has been mitigated and shouldn't be present for any future sets.</p>

<p>Issue three affecting the <em>Riftbound: Origins</em> launch is one most tabletop players may be familiar with: shipping delays. While Riot isn't specific on what is causing these delays, they do state they are dedicated to shipping out all of the first wave of product by the end of the week. To achieve this, products you bought will be shipping to you the minute they are available. So expect multiple packages.</p>

<p>Lastly, Riot will be making Proving Grounds cards more available. Certain promo packs containing many Proving Grounds cards (Legends, Champions, Signatures, etc.) will be available at Nexus Nights. These packs will contain foil versions of cards currently not available in Proving Grounds. There is currently no concrete info on price or availability.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has announced&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5's release date, and the two heroes who will be joining the game's roster are none other than iconic X-Men Gambit and Rogue.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer, the Cajun card shark and the Mississippi power-sapper will be part of the hero shooter's fifth season, which will debut across all platforms on November 14th (so in just a couple of days!).</p>

<p>Usually, one of the two heroes arrives alongside the season's start, while the other will be added to the roster a few weeks into the cycle. We don't yet know which of the two will be the first to enter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' arena, nor has it been officially revealed what class the two heroes will occupy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-5-gambit-rogue.jpg?itok=LhtVKXPH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-5-gambit-rogue.jpg?itok=ZgQrsMoG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 will add two fan-favorite X-Men to the roster.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer for the two heroes, titled "Love Is a Battlefield", suggests that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' fifth season will revolve around Gambit and Rogue's marriage, which is interrupted by "destiny". This prompts Gambit to set out on a journey to "win back the moment time itself stole from [him and Rogue]".</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 follows on from the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-4" rel="nofollow">fourth season back in September</a>, during which Daredevil and Angela were introduced. The former is a Duelist and the latter is a Vanguard, which might well suggest that Gambit will be another Duelist and Rogue will take the form of a Strategist.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 right here. It doesn't give too much away about what you can expect from the season, but it does show off the designs for Gambit and Rogue, which are pretty nice.</p>




<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 will arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on November 14th, and you can also check the game out for free right now across all of those platforms.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-year-later-i%E2%80%99ve-forgotten-i-even-own-a-ps5-pro.1350178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One year ago this week, Sony launched one of its most expensive video game consoles ever: <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-unboxing-inside-review-comparison-1851688605">the PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. The company promised improved performance and visuals over the standard PS5 as well as DLSS-like upscaling. And while some games definitely benefit from the power, I’ve mostly forgotten I even own a PS5 Pro.</p>

 <p>When Sony announced the PlayStation 5 Pro last year, it received a mixed reception. While some were excited to have a more powerful console that could run games at higher framerates, many weren’t convinced it was necessary.<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442"> And then Sony showed everyone the $700 price tag</a>, and it became even harder to justify the new console. But despite all that, I was still excited to get a PS5 Pro. I have a big ol’ 4K TV and I care about framerates and all the minutiae that impacts how a game looks. And over the last year, I’ve enjoyed some great games on my PS5 Pro. <em>Battlefield 6,</em> for example, looks and runs wonderfully on Sony’s beefier machine. Likewise, <em>Death Stranding 2</em> looks incredibly sharp on PS5 Pro while still running flawlessly.</p>

 <p>Yet, many other games I play on my PS5 Pro either don’t look or feel noticeably better, or feature no improvements at all. It doesn’t help that the PlayStation Store still lacks detailed information about what PS5 Pro enhancements are included in a given game. Sometimes I have to go digging around online to find a blog or Reddit post to determine what, if anything, has changed because I’m playing a game on PS5 Pro. That’s not a great experience for a console that now <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">costs $750.</a></p>

 <p>I can confirm that after a year of use, the PS5 Pro hasn’t given me any troubles. It runs quietly, still feels snappy to use, and hasn’t broken in some other way. In comparison, my base PS5’s USB-C port stopped working after just a few weeks. So at the very least, the PS5 Pro seems well-built and sturdy, which is nice, I guess. But is all of that worth $750?</p>

 <h2>Should you buy a PS5 Pro in 2025?</h2> <p>After using the PS5 Pro for a year, I find it hard to recommend. While I do think there are some people out there who will get some benefit from owning a PS5 Pro–<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112">mainly folks with 4KTVs who really care about performance</a>–most people don’t need Sony’s more powerful console. Heck, I’m a bit of a graphics snob who loves running games at 120FPS, and I often forget the PS5 Pro is sitting in front of me because games so rarely feel like they’re benefiting from its enhanced specs.</p>

 <p>The lack of third-party support is disappointing, too. It’s surprising how many games are still launching on the PS5 via the PlayStation Store without any PS5 Pro benefits. You’d think at this point, Sony would be pushing devs and publishers to support the pricey console more. But it doesn’t feel like that is the case, which I find very strange, and that makes it even harder to recommend plopping down the cash for this thing.</p> <p>At this point, I’d suggest sticking to your PS5 (if you have one) and just enjoying it for a few more years and buying a PlayStation 6 instead when that console finally launches in the next few years, likely at a similar price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>California governor and likely presidential aspirant Gavin Newsom is dogshit at <em>Fortnite</em>. Over the course of an hour, he awkwardly exclaims that he’s “on his hands and knees” multiple times without even once recognizing the double entendre (Twitch chat is thrilled). But skill at <em>Fortnite </em>isn’t really the point of <em>Fortnite </em>Friday, despite its name. Instead, Twitch streamer ConnorEatsPants (who has not publicized his real name), 26, uses the battle royale as a pressure cooker, piling on a mix of deadpan jokes, legitimate questions, and comically-timed reminders to pay attention to the game – all in the name of keeping guests ever-so-slightly off-balance.&nbsp;</p><p>Newsom, during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inuZ7mcNlq0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>an October episode of the show</u></a>, wants to talk about Intellivision, the game console of his youth.

Sometimes they’re rude. Sometimes they commit genocide. It’s a couple of different things. It just depends.”</p><p>After that, they argue over the merits of a two-state solution (which Newsom favors) versus a one-state solution (which Connor came to prefer, he tells Newsom, after Netanyahu’s controversial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZvCmAgRWI0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>appearance on the Nelk Boys podcast</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“I want you to see the tweet that [the show] is happening tomorrow, and you're already laughing at the fact that it's happening.”</blockquote><p>This is Connor’s shtick: He jokes, he pushes, and he jokes again. He rarely, if ever, loses his cool. He does not break character. As a result, no guest fully settles in, especially if they’re figures of political significance like Newsom, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeoNHG4gG5U&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>George Santos</u></a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIBrxWKve-Y&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Adrian Dittmann</u></a>, aka that guy we all thought was Elon Musk for a second. What’s remarkable about <em>Fortnite </em>Friday is that, despite lines of questioning far less predictable than your standard press or talk show interview and a distinctly unserious backdrop – or perhaps because of those things – <em>Fortnite </em>Friday keeps securing bigger guests, the kind you’d never see coming. That, Connor told Aftermath at TwitchCon last month, is by design.</p><p>“I want you to see the tweet that [the show] is happening tomorrow, and you're already laughing at the fact that it's happening,” said Connor. “People reach out like 'Oh, I'm a State Congressperson from Massachusetts.' Well, I don't really care, because that'd be a de-escalation."</p><h2 id="for-the-bit"><strong>For The Bit</strong></h2><p>Like all good things, <em>Fortnite </em>Friday began as a bit. Actually, a bit born of a bit: Connor repeatedly made jokes about Soulja Boy until he manifested an actual appearance from Soulja on his stream into existence.&nbsp;</p><p>"Over the pandemic, I played <em>Fortnite </em>on a Friday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta6AG513tLs&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>with Soulja Boy</u></a>, and it was really funny,” Connor told Aftermath. “So I would joke for a couple of years when coming across a celebrity about 'We've got to get them on <em>Fortnite </em>Friday' as a bit. And then about a year and a half ago, I actually started doing it."</p><p>Slowly but surely, week after week and month after month, things escalated.</p><p>"I had the Musical.ly kid, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wEYHE4UgNo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jacob Sartorius</u></a>, on, and then I had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfbMQAcJEAI&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Baby Gronk</u></a>, who was an [Instagram] and TikTok [sensation],” said Connor. “And then that built up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehe1cTazEEM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>the Tiger King one</u></a>, where I had Tiger King [Joe Exotic] calling from jail, and that was really funny. That got a lot of attention, which led to George Santos and so on."</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">if you have free time before your new job, you should join me on the Battle Bus (free fares)</p>— connor (@ConnorEatsPants) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1986013197527339461?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>This snowball effect is how Connor – whose following across Twitch, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter is large but not eye-poppingly enormous – managed to land Newsom in what remains his most surprising interview to date. If you follow Connor on Twitter, you’ll see the outline of a simple yet effective strategy: <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1986013197527339461?ref=aftermath.site"><u>tweet</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1984013128892608649?ref=aftermath.site"><u>at</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1982361994297810945?ref=aftermath.site"><u>famous</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1980409570750288225?ref=aftermath.site"><u>people</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1974280801052471455?ref=aftermath.site"><u>until</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1968761004809949229?ref=aftermath.site"><u>someone</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1968414554133823892?ref=aftermath.site"><u>says</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1966973007286640696?ref=aftermath.site"><u>yes</u></a>.</p><p>"I would tweet at a lot of people and try to gather whatever I could, to see who would want to do it,” said Connor. “I know certain agents of celebrities and people, but with [Newsom], I think his communications guy knew about the George Santos [episode] and DM-ed me on Twitter. He got in touch through that, and then over a couple months, we just figured out a time to do it."</p><p>Also, while Connor does have a talent agent who represents him, the ball is entirely in his court when it comes to procuring guests for <em>Fortnite </em>Friday.</p><p>"It's all me,” he said. “I don't have a booking agent. It would probably help to get one or figure one out, but every single person that's come on has been direct – like, through contacting them."</p><figure><figcaption><span>The mood board for Fortnite Friday's Gavin Newsom episode</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is not the only element of Connor’s approach that walks the fine line between haphazard and brilliant. Instead of diligently referencing a list of questions during interviews, he uses a “mood board” made up of relevant imagery. The Newsom mood board, for example, was a collage that included images of George Santos, Hasan Piker (seductively posing), Donald Trump Jr, the Israeli flag, Asmongold, Taylor Swift, Jeffrey Epstein, a meme-ified version of JD Vance, a trans flag, Kamala Harris' book, and Netanyahu next to a much smaller picture of the Nelk Boys.</p><p>"I think it's both just because of how my brain works,” said Connor, “but also when doing a discussion, playing a video game, and balancing reading Twitch chat, it's easier to have this board on the right [of my main screen] that's more [visual]. I mean, I'll write questions in my notes app on my phone beforehand and then make this mood board, and then I just know when I look at this image or something reminds me of the question I'd thought of, it's easier than having a list that I'm reading. Because that slows me down."</p><p>It is not a flawless method: "I forgot what some things meant during [the Newsom episode],” Connor said. “Like I had Donald Trump Jr, and I forgot I put that on there to ask about Kimberly Guilfoyle, [Newsom's] ex-wife, who dated Donald Trump Jr."</p><p>In the case of political figures who have something to gain by reaching a younger audience, like Newsom and Santos – or even those with an ideology to propagate, like sadsack MAGA-is-my-whole-personality <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMC21Dh4O40&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>UFC fighter Colby Covington</u></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TnjH1aBaN4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Shazam </em>star Zachary Levi</u></a> – Connor recognizes that he’s walking a fine line. He can’t just let them spout off because a) that’d be a poor use of his platform, and b) it just wouldn’t be funny.</p><p>"There's a responsibility, I think, when you're interviewing someone with that amount of power and that amount of influence, that if you're given the opportunity to talk to them, you need to ask them certain hard questions about things they've done or they support,” said Connor. “Otherwise, you're kind of giving them a platform to humanize themselves without the weight of their actions and decisions. So I have to balance that when someone like that is on the show. I mean, I'll ask funny things, and we'll joke about stuff, but I can't finish the episode without making sure I bring up his comments on, say, Israel or things like that, because otherwise I lose credibility with people, too."</p><blockquote>"There's a responsibility, I think, when you're interviewing someone with that amount of power and that amount of influence, that if you're given the opportunity to talk to them, you need to ask them certain hard questions about things they've done or they support."</blockquote><p>Connor does not, however, view himself as any sort of political commentator or expert. Venturing into the political realm has forced him to learn on the job, and he admits that he doesn’t always nail it. After the Newsom stream, for example, he agreed with chat that he could’ve pushed harder on trans issues (Newsom has repeatedly come out against trans athletes and, the week after the <em>Fortnite </em>Friday episode, ended up <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/gavin-newsom-vetoes-important-hrt?ref=aftermath.site"><u>vetoing a key trans health bill</u></a> after bragging about his pro-trans legislative track record during the episode). Connor also acknowledged that he failed to engage Newsom on the topic of homelessness – another area in which Newsom has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/12/newsom-california-ban-homeless-encampments?ref=aftermath.site"><u>proven notoriously cruel</u></a> – citing his own lack of expertise.</p><p>"To be honest, I tried to do research on the homeless stuff because people were really upset at the way he acted toward homeless [people] in California,” Connor said during a stream immediately following the Newsom interview, “but honestly I could not understand the issue of unhoused people and housing enough to feel like I could comment on it – at least to that extent. With Israel/Palestine, I feel like I knew enough with how much I've learned over recent years to at least talk about it [competently]."&nbsp;</p><p>Connor’s willingness to challenge influential figures – after lulling them into a false sense of security with jokes and one of the world’s most famous family-friendly video games – makes him an outlier. To wit, shortly after the <em>Fortnite </em>Friday episode, Newsom – whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThisisGavinNewsom/videos?ref=aftermath.site"><u>prolific podcasting track record</u></a> mostly includes figures from the center and the right, rather than the progressive left – returned to his traditional ways, <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979327053431476566?ref=aftermath.site"><u>taking private meetings with high-profile Twitch streamers</u></a> outside Twitch’s Hasan-Piker-adjacent left flank at TwitchCon.&nbsp;</p><p>"The reason I wasn't invited [to a meeting with Newsom]," Mike "Mike From PA" Beyer, the second biggest leftist political commentator on Twitch, told Aftermath, "is because I'm actually political and have my own opinions. Whereas Gavin Newsom is trying to figure out how to manipulate Twitch and use Twitch for his own campaign. He's not interested in give-and-take where he gets where young people are politically and changes his platform to appeal. He wants to have creators who he can offer his cooperation with their platform-building in exchange for them cottoning onto whatever he wants. So it's the same old Democratic party."</p><p>Connor’s approach to shoring up his own strengths and weaknesses – and the recognition that he can’t do it overnight – also informs his decision of where to draw the line in terms of potential future interviewees.</p><p>"Lately people are like 'You've gotta get [antisemetic white supremacist] Nick Fuentes on,'” Connor told Aftermath. “That wouldn't be funny because he's good at being funny and playing the media, and I would just kind of give him a platform to do that more. I'm not an expert political guy, either. I'm just trying to be funny. So I'm not ready to debate these issues with people that I think are super ready for that. I'm more here to have a good time and humanize the guests. Regardless of who they are, whether good or bad, it does show people who they are."</p><blockquote>"Being more casually open about being progressive while being funny, I think, has opened a door for political discussion."</blockquote><p>He does not believe that comedy as a primary aim absolves him of responsibility, though. It’s a tool, like anything else. As someone who grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta surrounded by right-leaning peers and then learned more about the world via the internet, Connor recognizes the power of humor as a means to win people over.</p><p>"Even early on, in 2016, I remember the Reddit for Trump was posting memes and stuff, and what's crazy is that hasn't progressed at all for them,” he said. “They're still very much stuck in this 2016 era: really edgy humor and dated memes. It's just kind of cringey now if you are at all not stupid. It just dates them."&nbsp;</p><p>He hopes to pull people in the opposite direction by actually being funny, albeit not in a way that relentlessly punches down. He thinks his approach resonates because, again, the sort of right-leaning comedians who’ve dominated pop culture in recent years only have one trick, and because as the country careens ever closer to a state of all-out upheaval, people – even <em>Fortnite </em>players – don’t want entertainment that simply distracts them anymore.</p><p>"I think it's harder for people to put their head in the sand [where politics are concerned],” he said. “I think a lot of comedians people look up to now are losing a bit of their credibility and trust with their audience. A lot of them are going down a Joe Rogan route. Being more casually open about being progressive while being funny, I think, has opened a door for political discussion. And it's not just me. People like Adam Friedland are doing it too. I think that's a good thing."</p><h2 id="all-aboard-the-battle-bus"><strong>All Aboard The Battle Bus</strong></h2><p>Though Connor at one point during the Newsom stream said he’d “do <em>Fortnite </em>Friday on a Tuesday” if it meant getting <a href="https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway"><u>disgraced still-technically-mayor of New York City Eric Adams</u></a> on, he has no desire to transform the show into a purely political vehicle. Past guests have included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0hi4f1uegw&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Rizzler</u></a>, who despite immense overnight fame showed himself to be a shockingly normal and video game-obsessed kid, and with whom Connor still plays the odd <em>Fortnite </em>match off-stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"He's a really sweet kid," said Connor. "I know people say he's gonna grow up [to be a disaster] or people talk about the parents of these young stars, but [his dad] was asking me advice on what to do. Like 'Should I let him do this, this, and that?' There's no guide on how to do that as a parent when your kid suddenly becomes a huge celebrity. If the kid's enjoying it, you don't want to take that away from them. But at the same time, you want to balance being a normal kid. It's not easy, but he's got a good family, so I'm optimistic [about his chances of growing up into a well-adjusted adult]."</p><blockquote>"People say that streamers are fake, and I've always disagreed with that."</blockquote><p>Connor’s dream non-political guest is Miranda Cosgrove from <em>iCarly</em>, a show he believes “embraced and almost predicted” modern internet culture. He’s also been campaigning to get Justin Bieber, who now <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/justinbieber?ref=aftermath.site"><u>streams on Twitch himself</u></a>, but to little avail so far. Rapper Lil B, Connor says, was supposed to be the first <em>Fortnite </em>Friday guest, but technical issues prevented it from happening. All these years later, he’d still like to revisit that idea, though at this point, he’s not putting any money on it.</p><p>"Whenever the vibe is there, I'll text him like 'Lil B, <em>Fortnite </em>Friday?'” said Connor. “And he'll just heart the message and be like 'It's love, family.'"</p><p>Connor’s goal, more than anything else, is to keep both guests and viewers on their toes. At TwitchCon, he told me his next guest would be yet another who would make people laugh the moment he made their name public. It turned out to be Haliey "Hawk Tuah" Welch, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwpYzF1d9wo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>made her appearance on <em>Fortnite </em>Friday</u></a> late last month. More guests, Connor said, are “loosely lined up” for the future, but beyond that, anything is possible. It all depends on who responds to his tweets. For now, he just wants to keep talking to people who are worth talking to, as long as it’s funny.</p><p>"I think that's something I carried with me since I was younger: I always try to see the real person in people and the good part of people – see where their heart is at,” Connor said. “I think that lends itself to Twitch, too. When you're interacting with so many people and you're live and people are seeing a lot of you a lot of the time, it's hard to [conceal who you are]. People say that streamers are fake, and I've always disagreed with that. When people are live so much, you really are seeing a lot of them. That's typically how they are, even if it's a played-up version. And I think that lends itself to <em>Fortnite </em>Friday."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>After its launch on PC, PlayStation and Xbox earlier this year, Dead Mage and Humble Games have announced that the magic roguelike sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wizard_of_legend_2">Wizard of Legend 2</a>, will be appearing on Switch on <strong>25th November</strong> (from a puff of smoke, presumably).</p>
<p>Much like its predecessor, Wizard of Legend 2 will see you building magical loadouts from a wide range of elemental arcana, and casting spells to take out waves of enemies, navigate elemental hazards and tackle bosses.</p>
<p>All this can be played alone or with three friends in local or online co-op, and the dev promises "refined controls for Joy-Con and Pro Controllers, and optimised performance across both handheld and docked play" in this Switch version.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from Humble Games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4-player Co-op:</strong> Play solo or with up to three friends in seamless online or local multiplayer. The Switch release incorporates refinements introduced during 1.0, including faster Arcana responsiveness, improved camera tracking, adjusted boss HP scaling, and streamlined item interactions for smoother co-op runs.<br>
<strong>Diverse Biomes and Bosses:</strong> Each region presents new elemental hazards, enemy archetypes, minibosses, and area bosses. From the heights of the Sky Citadel to the depths of the Chaos biome, every area features distinct mechanics and rewards for players to uncover.<br>
<strong>Elemental Arcana System:</strong> Experiment with 77 Arcana spanning Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Chaos elements. Mix and match to discover synergies, from chain lightning combos to earth-based crowd control, and adapt your spell kit to each Trial’s demands.<br>
<strong>Expansive Language Support:</strong> Support in 13 languages, including English, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), French, German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Persian, and Turkish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wizard_of_legend">The first game</a>, developed by Contingent99 launched to much acclaim back in 2018, quickly racking up thousands of '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445980/Wizard_of_Legend/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445980/Wizard_of_Legend/">Steam</a>. With Dead Mage now in the dev seat, its sequel has not been as well-received since it first launched in ver. 1.0, though the promise of playing on the go might be enough to bring some people around to the idea.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The YouTube channel People Make Games has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a video interview</a> with several workers who were suddenly fired by Rockstar Games earlier this month and have been protesting outside Rockstar North ever since. Right away, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it was a pure act of union-busting, as the workers had just secured a 10% agreement from the workforce at the Edinburgh office to unionize. Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that they had been leaking information on a public forum; however, the employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim</a> there was no evidence of that, and that they were rushed out with no due process or representation.</p>



<p>The author of the video notes that they had already been contacted about the new union, which was set to be announced shortly, and planned to create a video about it before the layoffs occurred. Throughout the interview, the employees express their dismay at the circumstances of their termination, which could also negatively impact their resumes due to the studio's claim of 'gross misconduct' as the cause. But they would also like to be reinstated into Rockstar and get back to work to finish Grand Theft Auto VI (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now slated for November 19, 2026</a>, following another delay). Bran said:</p>



<p><em>If I have gross misconduct on my CV, on my resume for the rest of my life, that is a huge detriment to any future career prospects. Something important to notice as well is you feel shame to be kicked out of work this way. Like, all of us still want to be here. We want our jobs, we want to finish what we were working on. And now the internal shame feel of having this gross misconduct with you forever, it's hard to explain.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>What's happening next? Fred, an organizer from the IWGB, explains it:</p>



<p><em>The immediate goal here is very clear. It's the reinstatement of all 31 workers in the UK who've been fired and the three workers in Toronto. We know that our sister union in Canada is working to support. It's a reinstatement for those workers. It's full compensation for pay lost during this period. It's clear accountability for the way these dismissals have been handled, these very clear, unfair dismissals without procedure, without evidence. So clear accountability from the company, and a commitment to following employment law in the UK in the future.</em></p>



<p><em>What happens next is up to Rockstar. I just wanna be really clear. [...] We've just submitted our legal claim. The ball is in their court to respond. We hope they'll resolve this with us amicably, right? This is, in the end, egregious, and to be honest, shocking. I have never seen a thing like this, not just in the game sector, but in UK trade union organising in the last 20 years. This is the moment where Rockstar can make that right. These are workers who just want to go back to work, to work on a game that they love. If they don't, they've seen what they have to contend with. The force of public feeling is against them on this, and we'll continue to put pressure on them through legal, through demonstrations, speaking about what these workers have experienced.</em></p>



<p>The layoff timing would seem odd if you consider that the studio wouldn't want to part with experienced workers while finishing a project of the magnitude of Grand Theft Auto VI. However, the UK is currently on the verge of passing the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67f6711f555773bbf109e21a/employment-rights-bill-overview.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Employment Rights Bill</a>, which will enhance security for workers starting next year, making this the best time to lay off people if someone really wanted to.</p>



<p>For his part, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-our-culture-is-extraordinary-amid-accusations-of-union-busting-at-gta-6-dev-rockstar-games">told IGN</a> that the work culture at the publisher and at Rockstar is 'extraordinary', though he did not make any further comment on the actual layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First, I’m telling you to <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966">stop exploiting the ledge grab</a> in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, and now I’m telling you to stop obsessing over something that probably isn’t worth your attention. Sorry to be “mom” here, but I’m pretty sure the Hidden Bunker mystery in Spaceport isn’t really a mystery at all.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966"><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Ledge Grab Exploit Is Bad, Actually</a></p> <p>Each map in <i>Arc Raiders</i> will see various timed events come and go. Some just see the map swapped over to a night theme, while others have dangerous electrical storms. Most recently, a mysterious hidden bunker underneath the Spaceport map was thrown into the rotation. It works like this: After an activation sequence on the surface, players can explore the corridors beneath the map to find some decent loot as well as some computer terminals to download data from. You get 500XP for downloading the data, and earn progress on your weekly Trials, but not much else happens. Fans, however, are not convinced that’s all there is to it (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/arc-raiders-new-hidden-bunker-puzzle-has-players-completely-stumped-3281779/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>).</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://youtu.be/yhQIigWZcZ4">documented by YouTuber The Gaming Merchant</a>, downloading the data in the Hidden Bunker <i>feels</i> like it should make something happen somewhere else or deeper in the Bunker, or like it’s part of a larger puzzle. You press a button, a meter fills up, a light turns green and you get XP, but if you walk away without doing this, the light turns red. There are multiple computer terminals that do this within the Bunker, which has led some to believe that they all either need to be activated at the exact same time or in some unknown sequence. There are more terminals than players the game allows for in a single party, so you’d have to gather together a bunch of randos to fully exhaust the options here, but I’m pretty sure that earning XP and making progress on your Trials is the whole point here: Activate the terminals and defend the room until they’re finished downloading.</p>

 <p>Downloading the data is not as easy as just flipping a switch and walking away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2oTiy1D6l6Q">Gamers Heroes’ video on the Hidden Bunker</a> documents this well. There’s a bit of <i>Siege</i>-esque Defend-The-Room™ required as the Hidden Bunker is likely to be swarming with players looking for other loot.</p>

  <p>Do this successfully, and you earn three stars in your Trials progress.</p> <h2>Is there a secret beneath the Spaceport?</h2> <p>Some folks are not convinced the XP and Trials progress is the point here. They’re running around trying to crack sequences they think exist, or they’re trying to activate them all at the same time, but to no avail.</p>

 <p>Honestly, I think too many folks still have their spinfoil hats on from <i>Destiny</i>.</p> <p>A megathread on the game’s subreddit is presently documenting some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no81af1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">borderline Charlie-Day-meme</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no379fo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">theory crafting</a> about what’s going on here.</p>

   <p>The biggest piece of evidence, in my opinion, that there’s no <i>there there</i> is in a lone comment indicating that the download progress of each computer is different for each player, which would mean it’s a different instance for players outside of your squad and that timing the downloads is nigh impossible because, well, they’re not designed that way. You get your data, you get your XP, you get your Trials progress. That’s it!</p>

When you download the data, a light on the computer turns green. That light, as it turns out, is the same model as found on <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">Field Depots</a>, of which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no2j64j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">there is one sitting right on top of the Hidden Bunker’s location</a>. Another theory concerns the language found on <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ official website describing the event, particularly that “whatever is inside [the Bunker] must be worth the static.” This has folks obsessing over what “static” means.</p> <p>Comments in the megathread indicate that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no2hhan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a variety of attempted solutions</a>, such as downloading everything at the same time, or downloading the data and then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no66rp9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">racing to a suspicious location on the map</a>, offer no alternative outcomes. Also, while exploring the Hidden Bunker, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no299el/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">someone managed to fall through the map</a> and, based on their screenshots, there doesn’t appear to be any secret sublayer below. So, various activation methods don’t trigger anything and there don’t appear to be any unlockable portions of the Hidden Bunker.</p> <p>But curious minds aren’t so easily dismayed. Even the fact that the data downloads are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no57p16/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">required for this week’s Trials</a> has folks suspicious: “I feel like this could either mean that collecting the data for that 500 XP is its own reward,” one reply says, “or this is to incentivize people to run it more and more until someone figures it out.”</p> <p>I think ya had the answer right the first time there.</p> <p>But maybe I’m just a wet blanket of a skeptic as always. I’d like to believe!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fortnite-loot-boxes-gambling-roblox-2000642980</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-opens-the-loot-box-flood-gates-in-its-race-with-roblox.1350145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Epic Games ended controversial loot box purchases in<em> Fortnite</em> back in 2019, but it’s bringing them back <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">to the battle royale platform</a> as an option for creators in the form of “paid random items.” While there are rules in place about disclosing odds and not targeting minors, loot boxes are essentially back on the menu for the larger <em>Fortnite</em> creator island platform as Epic tries to compete with <em>Roblox</em> for players’ attention and wallets.</p>

 <p>A new developer blog post details Epic’s rules for “<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-restrictions-in-fortnite">In-Island Transactions Restrictions</a>” that will be available in creator islands in the future, including transactions fueled by RNG. “In addition to your responsibility to comply with laws, you must comply with certain restrictions that apply when offering Paid Random Items,” the company, which makes billions a year from microtransactions, writes. “Failure to utilize the functions described below will constitute a violation of Epic policies. ”</p>

 <p>The policies governing how creators can deploy loot boxes in their games are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Paid Random Items are restricted in Singapore, Qatar, Australia, Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK/Brazil for players under 18 years old.</li> <li>Developers must “disclose the actual numerical odds of what the player may receive before the player makes a purchase.”</li> <li>They must “ensure the language you use relating to transactions is not misleading or overtly pressuring.”</li> <li>They can’t “directly prompt a minor” to buy something.</li> <li>Bundled items in Brazil must be available to purchase individually.</li> </ul> <p>And that’s it. Outside of those restrictions, or any other legal requirements unique to individual countries, <em>Fortnite</em> creators have free rein to design and sell loot boxes however they want. With no shortage of imagination, I’m sure some of them could design very clever and very lucrative systems for both entertaining players and extracting lots of V-Bucks from their virtual wallets.</p>

 <h2>Epic promises it’s not promoting gambling</h2> <p>But Epic Games is adamant that none of this will amount to gambling and that random paid items themselves do not count as such. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> that the company reached out to the outlet to ask it to remove references to gambling in a recent article covering leaked info about the update, noting that gambling is against <em>Fortnite</em>‘s rules.</p>

 <p>“Don’t implement playable gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games. These are prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency,” read Epic’s <a href="https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/fortnite/developer-rules">developer terms of service</a>. “Islands that teach or prominently feature images or activities that are typically associated with real-world gambling, casino style games, or games of chance that offer a prize, even if they are not directly simulating a gambling experience, are not permitted in any form.”</p>

 <p>Epic and other companies have been making this argument about loot boxes <a href="https://kotaku.com/esrb-says-it-doesnt-see-loot-boxes-as-gambling-1819363091">for years</a>, claiming that if odds are disclosed and the items can’t be easily resold for actual money, then they don’t count as gambling, even though they otherwise perfectly mirror the experience of a lottery scratch-off. No matter how you define gambling, though, it’s clear loot boxes are <a href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592">designed to exploit people’s psychology</a> to get them to spend money they wouldn’t otherwise part with.</p>

 <h2>The race to keep up with <em>Roblox</em></h2> <p>Why is Epic Games tip-toeing back into a pond that was once so controversial it <a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-loot-boxes-and-pay-1834612226">led to Congressional hearings and legislative proposals</a>? The most obvious reason is that it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/arts/grow-garden-roblox-record.htm">currently competing with Roblox</a> to operate the platform of choice for user-generated games and the millions of people who play them. It paid out over $350 million <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead?team=personal">to its island creators last year</a>, and announced <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">plans in September</a> to let them start selling in-game items just like regular <em>Fortnite </em>does.</p>

 <p>Roblox, of course, was already doing this. <em>Grow a Garden</em>, one of its biggest surprise hits with concurrent players peaking at over 22 million, is essentially a farming sim with a daily shop that refreshes and where you can spend Robux on microtransactions to acquire rare seeds or make harvesting more efficient. The game isn’t popular in spite of the pay-to-win mechanics underlying it, but in part because of them. The success of gacha games like <em>Genshin Impact</em> and card pack modes like <em>EA Sports FC</em>‘s Ultimate Team shows this isn’t isolated to UGC games either.</p> <p>Epic is currently trying to beat Roblox with a more generous cut of the profits. <em>Fortnite</em> creators can earn 74 percent of in-game sales through the end of the 2026, after which it will drop down to 37 percent. That’s still substantially more than the cut creators are currently getting at Roblox, which only pays out 25 percent of in-game sales. I’m sure none of this will create perverse incentives for what <em>Fortnite</em> creators make moving forward.</p>

<p>The Game Awards continue to grow, and have a new broadcast partner to show for it. Show creator and host Geoff Keighly announced on Tuesday that The Game Awards 2025 will stream on Amazon Prime Video for the first time.</p>



<p>In addition to being on Prime, The Game Awards will continue to stream on YouTube, Twitch, and other platforms. </p>







<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/game-awards-streaming-amazon-prime-video-twitch-1236574939/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> about the news, Keighly said that the fact it’s an additional platform instead of a replacement makes it a “really exciting” addition for the show.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve had lots of conversations with people over the years, and we’re like, there’s no way, there’s no world where we could ever really take the show off YouTube and Twitch — where it was born back in 2014,” </strong>he said.</p>



<p>Keighly also said that despite being on a large platform like Prime Video, it won’t change how the show is produced and air. He also said that Amazon was receptive about a non-exclusive deal with the show.</p>



<p><strong>“It’s important people know it doesn’t change our show at all,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re still making the same show. I came out of a life of working on television networks. And you had television folks that would give opinions and things on what you want the show to be. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“This is still The Game Awards. It’s the exact same show. They’re really just another distribution outlet, and they’re really letting us build the show the way we always do. We’re not changing anything about the show to accommodate a new platform.”</strong></p>







<p>As mentioned, The Game Awards 2025 will air on Twitch and YouTube like always. On Twitch, however, another first will happen as the show will air in 2K. There will also be Twitch Drops for those watching on the platform.</p>



<p>Are you going to watch The Game Awards on Amazon Prime Video this year, or stick with a traditional platform like YouTube or Twitch?

<p>Players already knew that Rogue and Gambit are coming to Marvel Rivals Season 5, but a new trailer has made it official. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 5 is something players have been looking forward to a lot, especially after knowing which two characters will be taking the center stage in the new season. Rogue and Gambit were already revealed through several leaks and an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ad-rogue-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertisement on TikTok</a>. Now, players have received an official trailer, providing a background for the upcoming season’s plot. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-rogue-and-gambit-revealed-through-new-trailer">Marvel Rivals Rogue and Gambit Revealed Through New Trailer</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1987913327197016501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) for Marvel Rivals teased yesterday that something new was coming with an invitation to Rogue and Gambit’s wedding. This invitation was followed by a new trailer, where we see the duo gearing up to tie the knot; however, their plans are met with an unforeseen roadblock as a timestream entanglement tears their world apart before Gambit and Rogue can say “I do” on Krakoa. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Love is a Battlefield | Marvel Rivals Season 5 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXOUHb64164?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, Gambit will not let this go so easily and will set forth on a “daring cosmic heist to steal the universe’s rarest ring – and win back the moment time itself stole from them.” The new trailer offers no gameplay details or abilities for the upcoming characters; instead, it features a cinematic video that primarily sets up the narrative for the next season, “Love is a Battlefield”. Marvel Rivals Season 5 is set to release on November 14, 2025, and we can expect to receive more details about the two characters leading up to this date. </p>







<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals’ PvE Zombies mode helped provide <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-steam-player-count-spike-pve-mode-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major player spike on Steam</a> recently. Additionally, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delay-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to late 2026</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/ignfirst-routine-3-finalpreview-banner-1762810914943.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As a lover of puzzle games, what can elevate my puzzle-solving experience more than having horrifying monsters breathing down my neck and ready to snap said neck if I fail to solve their puzzle in time? I love these types of games that keep me on edge for hours on end, so Routine is exactly the type of aesthetically pleasing and brutally tense kinds of horror experience I’m always on the lookout for. And with a deeply cool 80’s-tech lunar setting and the beginnings of a story that has me interested in seeing more, I’m willing to overlook some of the things I was less impressed by during the roughly 90-minute demo, like the fact that the monsters searching for me were about as bright as the desks I hid behind and underneath. It remains to be seen if the story will pay off as much as its promising setting and compelling vibe might imply, but I’ll definitely be diving deeper in the future to see how it shakes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Routine is one of those horror games where you’re forced to run around solving little puzzles while absolutely horrifying monsters stalk the halls, ready to kill you on sight if you fail to avoid their notice – you know, in the same vein as something like Alien: Isolation or My Friendly Neighborhood. That comes with  all the same pros and cons as its genre peers, where you have these really tense moments as you manage to solve a puzzle and rush through a door just before the bad guy you can’t possibly hope to kill catches up with you. But you then also have plenty of instances where you’re stuck in a room waiting for the dumb bad guy to turn around and walk away, leading to lots of moments where the tension sours into a monotonous waiting game. I tend to really enjoy these kinds of protracted hide and seek sequences, even if they do occasionally involve a bit of waiting, so this was right up my alley.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In this particular case, I found myself on a moon base that had been taken over by killer humanoid robots, whose lidless, unblinking eyes searched for me as I repaired various broken electrical systems and tried to get through each area unnoticed. The ambience of this dilapidated lunar base with an ‘80’s tech aesthetic really worked for me, clearly drawing inspiration from fellow retro-tech science fiction worlds like Alien. But Routine also brings with it a unique sense of humor, with silly arcade games to play in between sweat-inducing horror sequences and cheeky, non-murderous robot helpers to find along the way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Routine's immaculately creepy vibes, unique retro aesthetic, and tongue-in-cheek jokes in between bouts of utter terror, all coalesce in a way I haven’t seen before.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the biggest ways in which Routine sets itself apart, as its immaculately creepy vibes, unique retro aesthetic, and tongue-in-cheek jokes in between bouts of utter terror, all coalesce in a way I haven’t seen before. I didn’t get a very strong sense of whether or not the story will deliver something worth all the stress and jump scares along the way, but hopefully all this neat worldbuilding will translate into something as awesome as the setting. With some solid environmental storytelling and hints at some kind of mysterious viral disease at work, it has certainly piqued my curiosity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The areas I explored ranged from= fairly unremarkable metallic hallways filled with busted droids and signs of something catastrophic having happened recently to really neat areas like an abandoned arcade with janky retro games to play and a shopping mall littered with debris. And, of course, since the whole thing takes place on a base on the moon, they take every opportunity to give you a nice view of the beautiful majesty of good ol’ Selene. Gotta love that. I’m a tad skeptical that they can manage to keep things interesting when you’re stranded on a fairly generic space station on a barren rock in outer space, but hey, so far so good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although much of the demo I played featured some fairly by-the-numbers puzzles, like finding codes around the world to enter into a keypad to unlock a door, it also had some neat mechanics built around the C.A.T device you’re given early in the story. This tool is basically just a handheld camcorder that can also do things like fire an electrical bolt at targets in your path. What’s cool, though, is that it evolved as I progressed, like when I unlocked an ultraviolet mode called the Ultraview Module that allowed me to see trace substances like bloodstains that helped me solve some of the space station’s more unintuitive riddles. I only unlocked two modes in my time with it, but it’s clear that upgrading this bad boy is going to be the primary way in which you power up, and so far I like that idea quite a bit. It’ll be interesting to see what clever new uses they find for it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While you upgrade your C.A.T., read snippets of lore around the space station, and solve puzzles, you’ll find yourself almost constantly hunted by extremely violent robots that chase after you on sight with intent to kill. Naturally, that makes even the most simple brain teasers that much more stressful, as you spend every other second double-checking over your shoulder, or wincing when you hear a robotic sound come from somewhere nearby. It’s not exactly an original premise, but it’s certainly the classic type of horror gameplay I’ve come to know and love over the years – and something we could definitely use more of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that was a bit disappointing, at least during my extremely early time with the story, is just how easy it was to outsmart the fairly dim robots hunting for me, to the point where I never actually was killed during my time playing. They make a ton of noise as they march around electronically, give up the chase as soon as you start running away since they can’t hope to compete with your speed, and don’t do a very thorough job searching for you if you’re hidden in an obvious corner they haven’t bothered exploring yet. What’s more, one of the abilities you unlock for your C.A.T. early on, is a mode where you can tase the robots chasing you, shorting them out for a second or two to buy valuable time you need to get away, as if it weren’t already easy enough as-is. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t still as intimidating as hell – the robotic shrieks they make every once in a while made my skin crawl, and the few times where they were able to get close without me noticing sent me screaming in the opposite direction. They may not actually be very deadly killers (at least early on), but they’re still pretty damn stressful to be around nonetheless.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-the-final-preview-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> will cost $70 and only be available physically as a Game-Key Card, it appears — something that has stunned some Nintendo fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-confirmed">confirmation of the game's March 5, 2026 release date</a> earlier today, store pages for the highly-anticipated Pokémon life simulation have now gone live, detailing its price and status as a Game-Key card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the U.S., Pokopia is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available</a> to pre-order now for $69.99. In Japan, meanwhile, Pokopia costs 8,980 yen — the same price point as Mario Kart World ($80 in the U.S.), and more than other Nintendo-published titles such as Donkey Kong Bananza and even Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's Japanese <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/pocoapokemon/ja/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> specifically lists Pokopia's physical edition as a Game-Key card, and while the same information isn't shown in the U.S., Nintendo has simulataneously published a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY&amp;t=15s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> instructing users on how "Game-Key Cards on Nintendo Switch 2" work — which uses Pokémon Pokopia as an example. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game-Key Cards have proven controversial among Nintendo fans who dislike the fact that the cartridges only contain a prompt to download the game, rather than its full game data. That means you do need to connect your Switch 2 online after buying the game, and then also need to wait while it downloads. However, Game-Key Cards differ from digital downloads as they can still be re-sold or shared with others — just like a regular game cartridge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that it had "no plans to use Game-Key Cards for Nintendo-developed titles" — something some fans today have pointed to as a broken promise. But, of course, Pokémon is not a solely Nintendo-owned franchise and Nintendo does not develop Pokémon games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Nintendo <em>is</em> publishing Pokémon Pokopia, and this does appear to be the first Nintendo-published game offered on a Game-Key Card. But this is also a game developed by Koei Tecmo — which, last time we checked, was not a Nintendo development studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, Nintendo announced a new trailer for Pokémon Pokopia will debut later this week on Thursday, November 13 at 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern, or 2pm UK. Eagle-eyed fans believe the video will feature over 10 minutes of gameplay — suggesting Nintendo is confident in what it has to show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shuhei-yoshida-reveals-his-top-games-and-how-he-cheated-at-his-exams.1350079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Former President of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, indie game and PS Vita champion, and much-missed industry star Shuhei Yoshida has appeared on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Perfect Console with Simon Parkin</a> podcast and revealed his top five games.</p>
<p>Before we get into those, can I recommend you check out the full podcast at some point, it’s a really great listen with lots of wonderful stories about PlayStation and game development. You can find the podcast on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/my-perfect-console-with-simon-parkin/id1665581266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6PzHHkwpOs8YFgzqoKRXAi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify</a> and all the usual places.</p>


<p>On to his game choices and the first title he picked was PlayStation 3 and Vita classic,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/journey/"> <strong>Journey</strong></a></p>
<p>“The impact the game had to human emotions was so powerful,&nbsp;I don’t remember any other game (doing that) before Journey,” said Shu. “People played the game and had tears in their eyes, so that shows the power of the medium and at the same time power of indie games.”</p>
<p><iframe title="JOURNEY | 10 Year Anniversary Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FZkTXs3Td8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up was another PS Vita game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sound-shapes/"><strong>Sound Shapes.</strong></a></p>

<p>“What was brilliant about the game was it allowed ou to create your own levels. As you play the game, you gain these objects and you are free to lay out and draw things. That was such a creative game,&nbsp;especially when you play on PS Vita. (PS Vita) has touch, so it is very easy to lay out your level and because you play with headphones and the music, it’s really kind of perfect on PS Vita.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Sound Shapes™Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfPbJE6XDxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>His third choice is<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/inscryption/"> <strong>Inscryption</strong></a>, a PC game published by Devolver Digital that eventually made it to PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>“It’s very hard to talk about the game because I don’t want to create a spoiler,” said Shu. “I really want people to try this game without any knowledge. This is one of the games that makes me want to erase my memory so I can replay the game.”</p>
<p>“I played through the game twice because I really, really loved it, but the first time I played, I went, “What?”, you know, “What’s going on?” It’s such an amazing creative work by this, you know, young individual Daniel Mullins, and it was really fun.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Inscryption | Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aneRbQGRIMc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fourth game is another indie title, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/before-your-eyes/"><strong>Before Your Eyes</strong></a>. The game is the story of a young boy and it has a unique method of control, the game advances when you blink. Shu explained how he convinced the young developers to bring the game to PS VR2.</p>
<p>“I met them at a BAFTA pre-event gala. Everybody is dressed up and there are these two youngsters who looked like the didn’t know what to do, and so I talked to them! Because PSVR 2 has the eye tracking it’s the best way to play Before Your Eyes because you are put in exactly the position of the boy and you’re able to see the scene from boy’s perspective. I want every single human being to try this game because this game’s amazing.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Before Your Eyes - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9OhfCk51Mo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Finally is a PC and console game from last year, <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nine-sols/">Nine Sols.</a></strong></p>
<p>“It was my Game of the Year game last year,” said Shu. “There are many Souls-like games and Metroidvania game but they came up with unique, secular-like, 2D action game with beautiful graphics and really interesting stories and amazing, amazing gameplay.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NineSols - Console Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NYJLa2HOQhI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shu also revealed that his degree in Economics is probably not worth the paper it is written on.</p>
<p>“I majored in economics,” he explains. “Not that I was interested in economcs, but I knew that it’s so easy to graduate from university if I major in economics. Especially at Kyoto University, it was notorious that they just let people graduate. I didn’t even have to attend the classes.”</p>
<p>“There’s only one exam per year for each class and it was pre-announced so people who attended the classes created the ideal answers, and that was distributed. We just copied that into our paper and submit it!”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Reggie Is "Surprised" We Haven't Seen More Xbox Titles On Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reggie-is-surprised-we-havent-seen-more-xbox-titles-on-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reggie-is-surprised-we-havent-seen-more-xbox-titles-on-switch-2.1350076/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>In the last year or two, Microsoft has been very vocal about its desire to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/xbox-reiterates-its-support-for-switch-2">support Switch and Switch 2</a>. We've seen a couple of examples of this on the new hardware with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> and the soon-to-come <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, but where's the <strong>Gears</strong>? Where's the <strong>Call of Duty</strong>? Where's the <strong>Halo?</strong> As it turns out, we're not the only ones who are a little surprised by the lack of support so far.</p>
<p>Reggie Fils-Aimé recently took a break from playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> on his Nintendo 3DS to sit down with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a>' Christopher Dring and talk all things Switch 2. Microsoft's pledged support was one of the topics that cropped up in conversation, and the former NoA president confessed that he'd expected to see more.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective," Reggie said, "Certainly some games could easily be ported over to the Switch 2". He even went more specific with his predictions, stating, "I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday. All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I'm surprised it hasn't happened."</p>
<p>Recent months have seen <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gears_of_war_reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> blast onto PS5, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/halo_campaign_evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> will be making a similar leap at some point next year. Phil Spencer has said, time and again, how keen he is to support Nintendo systems, so it makes sense that Reggie might have been expecting more, particularly with two of the studio's biggest franchises already venturing to pastures new.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that Mr. Fils-Aimé has necessarily been disappointed with the Switch 2's software slate so far, though he admits that he's found Nintendo's output a little confusing: "From a business perspective, when I first saw that lineup, I scratched my head a little bit" — come on, who honestly had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> on their launch year bingo card?</p>
<p>"What I underestimated was the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, which I think has been compelling," he continued. "The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a> was a key driver for them.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Reggie discusses the console war, Switch 2's meaty sales numbers and what the future of the industry might look like. You'll find a video version at the top of this article, or you can check it out in writing over on <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a> website.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-pokopia-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-2-in-march-2026-seems-to-be-another-game-key-card-release.1350073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The cozy farming Pokémon spin-off game from Koei Tecmo, Pokémon Pokopia, finally has a release date after being <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-pokemon-spin-off-cozy-farming-game-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">announced this past September during a Nintendo Direct event</a>. At the time, it was slated to arrive sometime in 2026, though now we know it'll arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 on March 5, 2026, and that it appears to be a game-key card release.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia, if you need the reminder, is the game where you play as a Ditto that transforms itself into an imitation of a human, who then begins to operate a Pokémon farm and create a paradise for its fellow Pokémon, while those Pokémon help plant, water, maintain crops, and carve out a peaceful life.</p>



<p>Nintendo did not initially clarify that Pokémon Pokopia would be a game-key card release, but in a new video published today showcasing how game-key cards work, it was featured as one of the examples. If it is a game-key card release, then, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-pokopia-appears-to-be-the-first-nintendo-published-switch-2-game-to-be-on-a-game-key-card/">VGC</a>, this would mark the first Nintendo-published title to be a game-key card version.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though game developers have spoken out about <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-forced-choice/">game-key cards as a means of overcoming the limits that come with using cartridges</a>, that hasn't stopped the feature from being controversial among players, with many decrying game-key card releases on the grounds of game preservation, since they are physical cartridges that do not contain any actual game data.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Using Game-Key Cards on Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ldQYMwzWrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nintendo has claimed its first-party titles, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-nintendo-switch-2-mario-and-zelda-games-wont-be-game-key-card-versions-nintendo-says/">Mario and Zelda games, would not be game-key card releases</a>, but the distinction of what will be released as a game-key card and what won't be now seems to be between Nintendo first-party developed titles and titles Nintendo is simply publishing. Pokémon Pokopia is developed by Game Freak and Koei Tecmo, with The Pokémon Company publishing it in Japan, and Nintendo publishing it globally.</p>

            <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-awards-confirms-its-future-class-program-will-remain-on-ice">Game Developer</a> reported that the organisers of Geoff Keighley-fronted industry awards show/advertising extravaganza The Game Awards had revealed that they've got no plans to do anything with their Future Class initiative this year. That's left the programme, founded in 2020 with the goal of highlighting up and coming talents in and around game development, facing a black hole of a future. Even worse, those featured by the initiative during the years it did run have been left feeling frustrated and unable to access the webpage which confirms they were ever part of the programme.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A number of developers featured by the Future Class initiative and who remain part of its dedicated Discord server have now spoken to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/11/future-class-gamings-oscars-game-awards">The Guardian</a> about how the programme's fate's left them feeling. They've also documented some back-and-forths between themselves and The Game Awards' organisers, including face of the games man Geoff Keighley, over improvements the members wished to see made to the programme and a desire for the 2023 edition of the show to acknowledge <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go">Israel's ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza</a>.</p>
<p>The former push was reportedly rooted in negative experiences nominees in the early years of the Future Class had when attending the show. "We were effectively props," game producer and 2020 class member Dianna Lora said, with examples like a Starbucks meetup which the members felt sidelined them, seats for the main show being camped behind camera risers that obstructed views, and mentorship programmes over the following year being limited to brief Zoom chats with industry figures.</p>
<p>While that advocacy has resulted in generally more positive experiences for more recent nominees according to the report, members' efforts to convince Keighley and co to read out a statement during 2023's Game Awards expressing support for Palestine and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza resulted in their <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-game-awards-israel-palestine-open-letter-future-class/">open letter</a> being ignored. Keighley, who didn't respond to The Guardian's request for comment (I've also reached out), is alleged by one of the members to have sat looking "incensed" during a subsequent call in which some members recommended the awards ceremony feature the likes of more female presenters and acknowledge that year's mass developer layoffs.</p><p>Many members have been left frustrated, especially after the Future Class archive of inductees was removed from The Game Awards' site, while some have also been left questioning whether their efforts to advocate for improvements to the programme and acknowledgement of key issues might have contributed to the initiative being left in limbo. "Ever since [we pushed back] it was like, ‘This is too much trouble, might as well peace out’," Lora said, while community manager Natalie Checo added: "As a result of advocating for ourselves (the very thing that we were inducted for), we were punished for doing the same thing that they ostensibly celebrated us for."</p>
<p>A silver lining to the situation is that the members have apparently stuck together as a Discord community and continue to do so. So, as flawed and cynical as The Game Awards' Future Class has reportedly been, at least it's seemingly helped bring some like-minded folks with noble goals together.</p>

              <p><span>It is exhausting seeing how many aspects of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>experience people try to exploit as part of some money-making scheme. The cards are obviously the most prominent example of this, as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers and the content creation mill</span></a><span> have turned the act of buying and selling packs into a lucrative business at the expense of players being able to derive </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>any joy from the hobby</span></a><span>. But people selling </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-related stuff</span> <span>for a profit isn’t limited to physical goods. Nowadays, you can find someone asking for real-world cash for a Shiny Pokémon in games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><span>how much easier </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>makes it</span></a><span> to find the rare, alternate-colored ‘mons in Lumiose City, some folks would rather just fork over some of their hard-earned money to save themselves a few hours of grinding to make one of them spawn. At least, that’s what some sellers on places like eBay are banking on. If you search for Shiny Pokémon on the site, you’ll find dozens of listings, some selling specific creatures and others letting people specify the Shiny they’re seeking. One of the most expensive offerings includes a </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/167871843921?_skw=pokemon+legends+z-a+shiny&amp;itmmeta=01K9SS6250KZXESVT648WYM062&amp;hash=item2715f10e51:g:qrYAAeSwNkRo-Pgk&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cmZMWT%2BJmOrrmcpCm9OPCOq%2F6C5X%2FOvRyhCN6Xbr3piM4Xf0yos%2Bgp99jZhgqUClMlqLGYsp%2Fijcj6Fn92F5x8KzHOf%2BYl6iTUbSbF67RqNNpK2soagMaN3RJ3fd%2BLuzrXiris2fOv5f9FwaYiG4IUgsCYY35bTh354GI2XLjyRcZnn%2BC6VAfT1oLyhUq%2Bt2gyS9DOMuwqTv8AVsDe8gKXlah20yBDsXzsouFU%2FpRLVXX4XcR7e7D%2FrHAT4dZZFEfjtuW1nAo3YDWCSnNJj59y%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9SimLnOZg"><span>full “Living Dex” of every Shiny Pokémon in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> for $300</span></a><span>. There’s also a cheaper (but still very expensive) </span><a href="https://ebay.us/m/kYPhJ1"><span>$80 listing for every Shiny Mega Evolution Pokémon</span></a><span> in the game thus far. That’s more than it costs to buy the game itself.</span></p> <p><span>I understand that for a lot of people, the joy of shinies is not in the exhausting hunt and they just want to put these rare creatures in their party or in a box so they can say they have them. But man, I can’t imagine being that devoted to Shiny Pokémon that you’d be willing to fork over real-world money for one, especially when they aren’t limited-time offerings. I wasn’t surprised when scalpers were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-koraidon-miraidon-gamestop-codes-scalper-2000629926"><span>selling free Shiny Miraidon and Koraidon codes</span></a><span> because GameStop had made that an issue of false scarcity. But people are often willing to spend money to save themselves time. So I guess this isn’t that different from spending money on microtransactions to skip through a waiting period in an app. But at least with those, you don’t have to haggle and negotiate on something that was never meant to have a real-world monetary value. Go with Arceus, friends. Make responsible decisions.</span></p>
