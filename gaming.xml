            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unboxing-seagates-genshin-impact-le-external-ssd/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Back in my day, branded storage solutions were lucky to have more than a small decal slapped onto the side of it. Even my Outsiders-themed external drive that powered my PlayStation 5's extra storage was little more than a silk-screened logo atop one of Western Digital's WD_Black P10 drive. For many gamers, picking a themed hard drive to match the aesthetic of their setup, or merely support their favorite character or franchise, meant sacrificing performance for style. Seagate has proven this wrong with their numerous Limited Edition HDD and SSDs to date. Their latest release is a special collaboration with mihoYo for Genshin Impact, which Seagate sent me to try out for an unboxing and to take on the road to GDC next week.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Today, we're unboxing the latest in Seagate's line of Limited Edition Gaming SSD's based on one of Genshin Impact's earliest Electro Units: Cyno. This pocket-sized 1TB external drive is smaller than your average deck of playing cards. Coming in at just under 100x50x11mm, this&nbsp; drive was a no-brainer to throw into my everyday carry for when I need to capture some footage or snag a recording off a capture station.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The bright purple styling representing Cyno immediately stands out among the packages of other drives and headsets on my office wall, but no one buys a hard drive just to leave it sealed in box. Inside the package are just enough goodies to take this drive for a spin and immediately start storing your favorite content on-the-go. All around the unit are some runic designs, with a logo on the underside not quite the usual icon you'd see for Cyno in game but recognizable enough by the Anubis motif. Similar to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/seagate-releases-starfield-xbox-game-drive-but-your-xbox-series-wont-play-the-game-from-it/">Starfield</a> line of Seagate's Limited Edition drives, there is a full LED ring around the bottom of the drive, although this particular model only comes with a simple purple colorway. A small status LED also pokes out through the short edge of the drive opposite the USB Type-C 3.2 port.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>With only a 65 gram weight, this Genshin Impact-themed drive can easily fit in a knapsack without even noticing it's there. Thumb drives used to be my transfer method of choice when it comes to snagging screenshots and video footage off my PlayStation 5 for reviews, but now that external SSD's like these have become more readily available and lightweight, I've reformed my ways. Seagate claims that the drive comes with both a three-year warranty and three years of their Rescue Data Recovery Services, so if one of my transfers does wind up going back, at least there's a chance to recover it.</p>

<p>The Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition SSD is truly a limited affair, being limited exclusively to their <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/special-editions/genshin-impact-external-ssd/">online webstore</a> at $139.99. While the price comes in higher than most of their other themed drives, this one is a unique bit of kit that I could see Genshin Impact fans picking up for more Cyno merch representation in their homes.</p>

		<p>When it comes to game studios that thrive on the personalities who founded and lead them, none are quite as exciting to me as Too Kyo Games. Founded in 2017, it’s a team that has spent the last seven years producing games and even anime based on the combined creative visions of three incredible figures of the industry – <em>Zero Escape</em> series director Kotaro Uchikoshi, <em>Danganronpa</em> director Kazutaka Kodaka and series character designer Rui Komatsuzaki. Since their careers skyrocketed off the cult success of the death-game focused visual novel thrillers all three spent years working on, they’ve developed a variety of other projects that have either been exciting advancements of the ideas from their prior works or entirely new visions altogether. None of these have been a major breakout hit on the scale of <em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape,&nbsp;</em>though. That fact and the common tone of detective death-game mystery that runs through them all has made it hard not to see a game like <em>The Hundred Line – Last Defense Academy,&nbsp;</em>sporting familiarly zany character designs by Rui Komatsuzaki, and assume it’s just another one of those. After spending time with its demo, though, it’s clear this game is so much more than that.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-｜English Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLjz8umrD1E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For one thing, this isn’t another game about a bunch of amnesiacs locked inside a school. Our protagonist Takumi Sumino is a regular red-haired anime teenager living in the totally normal Tokyo Residential Complex – which is a place separated from the rest of the world by a giant overhead dome but don’t even worry about that. You also shouldn’t worry about the daily siren alerts indicating nearby monster activity – except one day, those monsters actually break through the giant dome, and amidst the chaos and bloodshed, a weird little mascot character approaches Takumi and hands him a knife – instructing him to transform and fight off the invaders by stabbing himself in the chest with said knife.</p>


<p>Soon after, Takumi wakes up inside a mysterious classroom with no idea how he got there (okay so I lied there’s a <em>little&nbsp;</em>bit of amnesiacs locked inside school in this one), and no idea why he’s surrounded by a bunch of other people. It turns out, the stab-yourself-to-transform deal was pitched to a bunch of other people, and they’re now all tasked with living inside this school and fending off any invading monsters for 100 days in order to save humanity. It’s a pitch that leaves far more questions than answers – both for the player and the characters wrapped up in it. This is the kind of mystery and intrigue that made the very first&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>game so iconic – the story could go anywhere with how layered the mysteries of the game world are, and even after wrapping the demo up I could so the full release going in any direction.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the demo does paint a pretty clear picture of what you’ll be doing for each of those 100 days – and it’s a refreshing blend of tactical RPG combat, life-simulation hangout events, and environmental exploration that will hit hard for fans of <em>Persona 5</em> or&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses.&nbsp;</em>Tactics battles are pretty standard grid-based encounters, where each of your characters has a different shaped grid for their attacks – one character might strike in a straight line, while another hits in a wider cluster of grid squares. Each turn you’ve got a set amount of Action Points to spend to bust out your actions, but there’s a couple other options mixed in that keep things a little fresh. A Voltage gauge fills up as you attack, letting you spend a bar from it to either give a student an additional move or let them perform a special technique.</p>
<p>On top of that, though, characters can bust out an extremely powerful attack that comes at the cost of their own life – just for the battle, though. They’ll come back after the fight, and you even get additional level-up points from that sacrifice, encouraging a risk-reward balance where you’re tempted to axe your characters in every fight to grind out as much upgrade currency without losing so many characters that you can’t actually win the battle. I was surprised by how much this one mechanic improved the excitement of every battle for me – basic RPG bouts suddenly became resource management mania and I was addicted to min-maxing every encounter I could.</p>

<p>The demo for<em> The Hundred Line – Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>is an extremely small slice of the full cake, but it’s already promising to be a more feature-rich and varied experience than prior titles from the creators involved. I’m excited to see just how far this game goes when the full release arrives in April.</p>

            <p>Here's one for the sci-fi slurping doomers among us. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hello-sunshine">Hello Sunshine</a> is a "survival mystery RPG" from the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/draugen">Draugen</a>, in which you must navigate a blistering desert by sheltering in the constantly moving shadow of a friendly robot. A collapsed corporation called Sunshine has turned the planet into a scorched wasteland leaving behind only warring mechs and dusty vending machines. "You play the final employee," say developers Red Thread Games. "Walk in the shadow of a giant robot during the sweltering days; stay close to keep warm during the cold nights." I wonder if any of this is a metaphor. Ah, who cares, it's got a cool trailer.</p>

<p>You're trying to reach a distant tower, where you'll "help decide the fate of what remains of this world." But to get there you have to take advantage of your big metal friend's shadow to survive the otherwise skin-frying sun rays. Along the way you'll scavenge food, salvage mechanical bits 'n' bobs, upgrade your big bot, and deploy smaller drones to help map the surroundings and gather useful gear. When night falls the temperature plummets and you'll have to snuggle up to the robot, where you can cook food and tinker with equipment. </p>
<p>"At first, the colossus barely acknowledges you," says the blurb on the game's Steam page. "Over time, your bond strengthens. Assist the robot with repairs, install upgrades, and unlock new ways to interact. In return, the metal giant will aid you on your journey — locating secrets hidden in the desert, lifting you past obstacles, shielding you from threats, fighting back against hostile war machines."</p>
<p>You'll also be able to give your post-apocalyptic pal a paint job, and add decals to his shiny metal chassis. Interestingly, it looks like there'll be a co-op mode too, which seems to pit one player as the human and another as the sand-stomping big lad.</p>
<p>"Team up with a friend (or workmate) to experience the journey from different perspectives," say the devs. "Coordinate scavenging runs, trade resources, and explore how your peculiar partnership shapes the unfolding narrative."</p>
<p>Red Thread Games previously made road trip adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dustborn">Dustborn</a>, which saw a bunch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dustborn-is-the-latest-addition-to-the-nascent-misfits-on-a-road-trip-genre">misfits crossing a dystopian United States</a> with a comic-booky "words are magic" schtick. Before that they made first-person mystery Draugen, in which you explored an abandoned Norwegian village called Graavik for clues about your missing sister. Alice B (RPS in peace) thought it was OK. "Draugen does a lot of tropes very well," she said <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/draugen-review">in her review</a>, "but it does others in a tired way that garners side eye from me... Graavik, meanwhile, remains a nice place to visit. But you wouldn’t want to live there."</p>
<p>Hello Sunshine doesn't have a release date yet. It's only listed as "coming soon". We'll let you know when more information comes trudging over the horizon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> hath been Patched, Adorning the Right Goode <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with the Wondrous Art of Barbering and the Dark Science of Steamworks Modding, together with Sundry Fixes for Quests, Crashing and Performance Problems, Skills and NPC Behavioure. Yes, I'm aware the previous sentence can't work out which century it's in. In a perfect world I'd have had the time to dig out a medieval dictionary and translate this introduction into proper 14th century English. As it is, you'll have to make do with the one middle English word I can reliably remember from university: ywys! It means "indeed". This latest Deliverance 2 update? A mighty addition, ywys.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The full patch notes are <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2">here</a>. Be warned that they are long. Easily as long as The Canterbury Tales, and almost as exciting, because while The Canterbury Tales has more scenes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miller's_Tale">paramours accidentally kissing their beloved's hairy bottoms</a>, the Deliverance 2 patch notes have Chaucer beat in terms of minutiae such as "improved physics of the parsnip". Here are a few other tweaks I enjoyed: "Shops no longer sell cobwebs"; "fixed looped drinking sound after being killed when drinking"; "fixed raining inside of a barn in Zhelejov"; "fixed the issue where a civilian would not stop banishing the player's horse".
</p>
<p>
As for the new features: you'll find the above-mentioned barbers across Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. They operate out of festive white tents, and offer a range of period-appropriate makeovers. No textured drop fades, I think. The patch notes also make mention of some significant tune-ups for the pickpockets and cat burglars amongst you: Warhorse have "created new clothing and equipment specifically supporting stealth gameplay and rebalanced stealth stats for all clothing".  That said, "stealth kills are now more likely to fail", and people now scream when they're stealth-killed. 
</p>
<p>
I don't think I ever did any stealthing in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 unless required to by a quest. I had my heart set on being an upstanding citizen who improves his prospects by way of honest industry and charisma. Being nudged to "break playstyle" by a quest is one of the chief criticisms in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review</a>, incidentally. Still, I'm happy that the shadow-hugging blaggards amongst you are getting some love.</p>
<p>Are you still playing KCD2, or have the draconic wiles of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> lured you away from rustic Bohemia? KCD2 does have "dragon bones", it must be said, though I've yet to work out whether they're from an actual dragon, or what they're even for beyond tantalising the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> players.

            <p>While Nintendo itself is still keeping any firm <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> details under wraps until its dedicated showcase next month, analysts believe the company is on course to deliver the biggest launch in game industry history.</p>
<p>According to several <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus">Bloomberg</a> analysts, it is expected that the Switch 2 will be more expensive than its predecessor, with the upcoming console potentially retailing for $400 or more - around £310 here in the UK.</p>
<p>"The original Switch's Nvidia chip is estimated to cost $80 per unit, while the Switch 2's chip is likely to be in the $130-$150 range," Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said. "I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo goes ahead with $499."</p>

</figure>
<p>While Yasuda expects a slightly higher price point than others, fellow industry analysts including Serkan Toto, Yijia Zhai of UBS and Robin Zhu of Sanford C Bernstein believe Nintendo's upcoming console will see an increase of around $100 or more over the original Switch's $299 price point. External factors will also be a consideration on the console's debut, such as the US tariffs.</p>
<p>But, even with this expected higher price tag, the analysts all agree that the Switch 2 will have an auspicious debut.</p>
<p>"They will sell boatloads of Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price," Toto said. "We can expect a great software line-up in year one, from new Mario Kart and 3D Mario after eight years to Pokémon Legends: Z-A and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>. There will also be third-party support from day one, most probably including blockbusters like Call of Duty."</p>
<p>Zhu currently expects Nintendo to release its Switch 2 console this June, adding the company has a first-day inventory of 6m to 8m units, which would make it the biggest console launch ever. As Bloomberg notes, the Switch sold 2.7m units during its first month on the market, while Sony's two most recent PlayStation launches each sold 4.5m units in their respective first quarters.</p>
<p>Macquarie Capital analyst Hiroshi Yamashina, meanwhile, forecasts sales of 20m units during the console's first year on the market.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is overhauling its trade feature following pushback from players.</p>
<p>The ability to trade Pokémon has been a key feature of the series since its beginnings, and in January it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-brand-trading-system-a-joke-and-downright-greedy">finally added to the digital card collecting game</a>. However, due to new currency and restrictions, fans heavily criticised the trading feature calling it an "insult".</p>
<p>A few days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-admits-restrictive-trading-system-stops-players-enjoying-the-feature-as-intended">The Pokémon Company acknowledged the backlash</a>, admitting trading restrictions were "preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" the game.</p>

<p>Now, massive changes are coming to the trade feature, including the complete removal of trade tokens. Instead, trading will use Shinedust, an existing currency found simply by opening booster packs.</p>
<p>However, the changes will be implemented by the end of autumn 2025, so exact dates are as yet unknown.</p>
<p>As per the announcement, the following changes will be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade tokens will be completely removed and players will no longer need to exchange cards to obtain the currency required for trading.</li>
<li>Instead, trading cards of three-diamond, four-diamond, and one-star rarity will now require shinedust.</li>
<li>When you open a booster pack, shinedust will be automatically earned if you obtain a card that is already registered in your Card Dex. Currently, shinedust is also required to obtain flair, so we are looking into increasing the amount offered since it will also be needed for trading. Altogether, this change should allow you to trade more cards than you could before this update.</li>
<li>Trade tokens you currently own can be converted to shinedust when the item is removed from the game.</li>
<li>There are no changes in how one-diamond and two-diamond rarity cards are traded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, a new feature will be included to allow players to share the cards they're interested in trading in advance.</p>
<p>"We hope that these changes will make trading cards more accessible and allow more players to enjoy making trades," the announcement reads.</p>
<p>"In addition to the changes above, we are also looking into how to accommodate cards that are currently unavailable for trades, such as promo cards and two-star rarity cards. Keep an eye out for more information about this topic in the future."</p> <div>

			<p>Obsidian Entertainment has <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134488-patch-130-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new update for its action roleplaying game Avowed. Version 1.3 brings several community requested improvements, such as providing an extra talent point for the main character at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. Players who have already leveled up to the max won't have to worry, as their characters will also retroactively receive the extra talent points.&nbsp; While playing the game, I did have the feeling that the game was a bit stingy with talents. This will definitely help with build creation.</p>
<p>Obsidian also introduced several quality of life improvements with this Avowed patch:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new option to increase font size and apply bold styling to all documents, tutorials, in-game pop-ups, and the ledger's quest tab in an effort to improve readability</li>
<li>Improved customization for the HUD (Heads-Up Display), including a new keybind (set to backslash by default) that hides all interface elements to help with screenshot captures and an opacity slider</li>
<li>A new FOV (Field of View) slider for third-person camera</li>
<li>A static compass option that always points to the north instead of rotating</li>
<li>Full support to customize controller keybinds</li>
<li>A toggle between walking and running for mouse and keyboard users</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are also several balance tweaks, bug fixes, and minor performance improvements, too.</p>
<p>So far, Avowed has <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemingly done well enough</a> to satisfy Obsidian and Microsoft. It rightfully should. While perhaps not quite a masterpiece, it comes close, as I explained in my review:</p>
<p><em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through. The visuals and performance are also praiseworthy. There are a few shortcomings, but if you're a fan of Western RPGs, you don't want to miss Avowed. It may have started as a spin-off, but it could go on to be the main series in Eora.</em></p>
<p>Will there be a sequel? It's too early to say. Game Director Carrie Patel shared her enthusiasm to do more with the team now that they had found their groove. However, in a more recent interview <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Eurogamer</a>, she seemed a bit more tentative, hinting that there may be a new IP in the cards for the studio, too.</p>
<p><em>The wonderful thing about the reception Avowed has gotten is it shows that there is certainly an appetite for new fantasy IPs. I recognise that some of our players are coming from Pillars and Deadfire, but I think for the majority of people, this is their first time in the world of Eora, so it's heartening to see that there is appetite for that novelty, that players are interested in jumping into something new. It certainly gives us a lot of enthusiasm and optimism for continuing to be ambitious, continuing to introduce players to new worlds, and bringing them into the games we're making and the things that are exciting to us. I know we're always excited to try new things.</em></p>
<p>Should Obsidian make a sequel to Avowed or something else entirely after they're done with The Outer Worlds 2? Let us know your opinion below.</p>

			<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPKJevpvZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's Silent Hill Transmission developer stream</a>, KONAMI shared a new trailer and many details about the upcoming horror game Silent Hill f. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-announced-60s-japan-higurashi-ryukishi07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in October 2022 alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and the spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill Townfall</a>, it features an original story set in 1960s Japan, more specifically in a remote mountain town called Ebisugaoka.</p>
<p>Here, teenager Shimizu Hinako has led a fairly unremarkable life, until a thick fog descends, transforming her home into a desolate and terrifying place. With the town seemingly abandoned and an unknown, creeping menace lurking in the mist, Hinako must navigate the spectral remnants of her past, solve intricate puzzles and battle terrifying entities to survive. Faced with impossible choices, she must ultimately choose between beauty and madness, and face the horrors that await within the mist.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is being developed by NeoBards Entertainment, which previously worked as a developer partner on games like Resident Evil: Resistance, Resident Evil Re:Verse, Marvel's Avengers, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. This will be their first high-profile game as a lead developer.&nbsp;The producer is Motoi Okamoto, who has already worked on the highly successful Silent Hill 2 remake, while the writer is Ryukishi07, renowned for Higurashi When They Cry and Umineko When They Cry. On the developer stream, he said:</p>
<p><em>To this day, I remember the feeling of my first encounter with the strangling and oppressive atmosphere of SILENT HILL. It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me. It's an honor to find myself involved with a series I have so many memories with. I've poured all my efforts into this story, so much so that I don't think I would mind if it was the last thing I ever wrote.</em></p>
<p><em>To me, the SILENT HILL series is more than just a collection of stories, it's a medium; an amazing, phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person's heart and mind. It's my hope that players out there will come to appreciate it in the same way. To all of our overseas friends, I hope you'll enjoy a look at what SILENT HILL might be like if set somewhere a little different, like Japan.</em></p>

<p>Ryukishi07 is not the only famed artist involved with the creation of Silent Hill f. Illustrator and monster designer kera is working on the game's artistic style, while legendary series composer Akira Yamaoka returns to compose the music for the game's Fog World. He's splitting work with fellow composer Kensuke Inage (Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, Tekken 8), who's composing the music for the game's Otherworld.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with no announced release date. However, the game's Steam page already includes the minimum and recommended PC requirements.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/have-websites-considered-simply-watching-a-tv-show-and-finding-out-what-happens.1134321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/severance-reviews-criticism-roundups<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love all my friends and colleagues here at Aftermath, but part of loving someone is acknowledging they are not perfect. Take Nathan, for example. While he has beautiful, perfect hair, he also has a fatal flaw: he enjoys going online to read about TV shows.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/severance-theories-lumon-goats-clones-instagram-threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One of those shows is <em>Severance</em>, and as we've already seen this week, there's a lot of <em>Severance</em> talk out there right now, much of it dogshit</a>. But there's a lot of talk about all kinds of TV shows online these days,<a href="https://aftermath.site/true-crime-north-country-bad-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and like I've written previously, a lot of it ends in very angry and frustrated and unhelpful places</a>. So I come to you all today to repeat the same advice I gave during <em>True Detective's</em> run: instead of going to Reddit or Twitter or the comments section of your favourite website to read a review about a TV show that's full of mystery but is also in the middle of a season, have you considered <em>not </em>doing that?</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/severance-season-two-episode-eight-reactions-b2711036.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This </a>is a serious article on The Independent, a serious website!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Severance</em>, a show where none of us know what is going to happen, is not finished. Season two of <em>Severance </em>is a series of ten episodes (at time of publication we've had nine of them), continuing on from the first season and leading into others. Each episode in that season tells a story that is part of a wider, ongoing story. That's how stories work; they're told over time. It's unreal I'm spelling this baby shit out, yet as I look around social media and seemingly serious websites, here we are.</p><p>Week after week, the Discourse surrounding <em>Severance </em>simply cannot wait for that story to be told before leaping into the breach. We live on an internet where media and commentators routinely review each episode as though they are independent works, some even scoring them like blockbuster video game releases, a 7/10 in episode two simply not achieving the same level of visual fidelity and replayability as the 8/10 from episode five.</p><figure><figcaption>"There are few thrills throughout"</figcaption></figure><p>I'm not here to try to police your thoughts, to say<em> you can’t talk about TV</em>. From the safety of your own couch or office or private Discord, <a href="https://aftermath.site/our-thoughts-and-theories-on-severances-second-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you should always talk with friends and loved ones about a TV show, your theories about what's going to happen, whatever</a>. That's some of the fun of television, of shared fandom and community! I'm just saying: maybe keep those conversations within your closest circles. Don't bring them to the public internet, which in its current, ruinous state will poison them beyond all recognition.</p><p>The modern internet--particularly the algorithm-driven weaponization of commentary, and the<a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> accompanying decay of genuine criticism and online media</a>--has eroded humanity's ability to discuss an in-progress TV series en masse. It has turned the serialisation of story-telling into an attempt by websites and talking heads to min/max our consumption of art. It has destroyed too many people's ability to simply watch something, to think something about it then get on with their lives.</p><p>Take last week's "<a href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-ep-8-sweet-vitriol-harmony-cobel-1851768452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divisive</a>" episode, the eighth in the series, of <em>Severance</em>. An episode where a major character has their backstory completely upended, doubles our understanding of the show's villainous corporation <em>and </em>signposts the future arc of the series' resistance, all in just 37 minutes. Yet despite all that--and I honestly believe this has been caused by the media's click-driven, growing disregard for the beating heart of various artforms--too many websites went beyond just writing some thoughts about the episode, and decided to not only review it as though it was a 37-minute feature film, but make <a href="https://thetab.com/2025/03/12/explaining-why-the-severance-cobel-episode-has-been-review-bombed-as-worst-ever-on-imdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news about what some random people on the internet thought about it</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>This isn't an Amazon listing, it's IMDB's rating breakdown for a single episode of a television show. Nobody needs to know this shit!</figcaption></figure><p>This obsession with the opinions of media illiterate viewers and per-episode reviews (as opposed to <em>recaps</em>, which are usually fine!) is so common now across all online spaces you may not even stop to survey the machine in its entirety anymore, but let's do that now for a second: do you realise how insane it is to do <em>any </em>of this?</p><p>Whether you think that episode was any good or not isn't even the point; the point is that websites and commentators performing critical services couldn't look past those 37 minutes to understand it was serving a purpose, and that trying to "review" it in isolation--or care what some random person on the internet thinks about it--is pointless. We simply won't know how effective episode eight will be until the series, or maybe even the whole show, is finished. If by the end of <em>Severance </em>this ultimately meant little, then sure, fire away. But if it turns out to be one of the most pivotal episodes of the entire show, and you called it boring at the time because it had "few thrills throughout", or thought it was important to tell your readers <em>other </em>people thought it was boring, it's not a great look.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Imagine if my review of a <em>Yakuza </em>game didn't finish the game first, to best consider the events that had unfolded over the last 100 hours</a>, but had instead stopped once a week to write a short blurb that simply said "this bit was zzzzz, 5/10", "Kiryu didn't fight anyone, 6/10", or "not enough karaoke, eh, 5.10". I'd be booed out of this industry, and rightly so, because without context those snapshots would be meaningless. Yet that's what too many websites and popular critics, all members of a species that within just a few short years has forgotten entirely how to watch a weekly television show, are doing with shows like <em>Severance</em>.</p><p>Again, to be clear, I am not telling anybody to stop talking about television. But the specific type of television that <em>Severance </em>is, a serialised story that relies on mysteries being revealed and a story unfurling itself in slow motion, should be given the basic courtesy of letting that story be told before we start handing out verdicts, or polling the masses for their kneejerk reactions. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification"><h3>Why Did No One Tell Me Duolingo Is Like This</h3></a><p>I thought it was just, you know, a learning app</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms"><h3>Log Off, Tim Sweeney</h3></a><p>Again, if I had $5 billion you would never see or hear from me ever again</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-best-plain-potato-chip-the-wirecutter-wrong"><h3>The Wirecutter Is Wrong About The Best Plain Potato Chip</h3></a><p>This is not just about how a chip tastes, this is a matter of the soul.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is on the way soon, and various Japanese analysts are expecting the console’s price to be around $400 or more when it releases.</p>



<p>In a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, many expect the system to be the most expensive in Nintendo’s history—the original Switch launched at $299—but still have no problem moving units right away.</p>



<p>“They will sell boatloads of Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price,” Tokyo-based analyst Serkan Toto told Bloomberg. “We can expect a great software lineup in year one, from new&nbsp;Mario Kart&nbsp;and&nbsp;3D Mario&nbsp;after eight years to&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;and&nbsp;Metroid Prime 4.&nbsp;There will also be third-party support from day one, most probably including blockbusters like&nbsp;Call of Duty.”</p>



<p>As far as a release date is concerned, multiple analysts expect a June launch for the console. One analyst, Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein believes there will be inventory of 6-8 million consoles available on day one. </p>



<p>“That suggests that if early sales go as planned, the new console would mark the biggest console launch ever,” Bloomberg writes.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> is getting a "cutting-edge ray tracing" overhaul courtesy of Nvidia's RTX Remix modding tools, and there's a playable demo coming on 18th March ahead of a full release.
</p>
<p>
As Nvidia explains it, RTX Remix is a way to "modernise classic games, enhancing their visuals while preserving the core gameplay that makes them special." And Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-portal-with-rtx-and-the-new-retro-ray-tracing-revolution">impressed by the tech's potential</a> when he took a look at Portal RTX back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Now though, after a year in beta, Nvidia's RTX Remix tools have been officially launched into the wild, gaining the likes of DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and RTX Neural Rendering along the way. More pertinent to this story, however, is the news Nvidia's marking the occasion by releasing a Half-Life 2 RTX demo, showcasing the technology's capabilities, on March 18th.

<p>
Half-Life 2 RTX is being released in conjunction with Orbifold Studios, and its impending Steam demo - which is only available to owners of Valve's full Half-Life 2 - will specifically feature Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt, both given an RTX Remix makeover. A full version of Half-Life 2 RTX by Orbifold is planned to release "at a later date". And if you don't already have Half-Life 2 in your Steam library, you might like to know <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">there's currently 80 percent off</a>.
</p>
<p>
"RTX Remix requires a GeForce RTX GPU to create RTX Remix Mods," Nvidia notes, "while mods and games built using Remix are compatible with any hardware that can run Vulkan ray-traced games." Full details of today's release can be found in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-half-life-2-rtx-demo-launching-march-18/">Nvidia's announcement</a>. All of which should stand you in good stead for Half-Life 3, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-fans-desperate-for-half-life-3-news-say-they-have-evidence-its-hidden-in-steams-back-end">might just happen after all</a>.

It was also confirmed Silent Hill f was being written by Ryukisshi07, the acclaimed Japanese visual novel writer behind the Higurashi and Umineko series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After almost three years, we are finally learning a lot more about Silent Hill f, and you can read all about it below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Silent Hill f Aims to 'Find the Beauty in Terror' and Present Players With a Beautiful Yet Terrifying Choice in 1960s Japan</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami shared a brand-new trailer for Silent Hill f and a ton of new details, including that it will aim to "find the beauty in terror" and present players with a beautiful yet terrifying choice in 1960s Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team wasn't ready to spoil what the decision would be, but it did unveil a bit of the story, and we'll leave it to Konami to set the stage;</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Shimizu Hinkao was living her life as an ordinary teenager," the official description reads. "That is, until her town is suddenly shrouded in fog and begins to change in a horrific way. Now, she must explore a town she no longer recognizes while solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and doing everything she can to survive... in order to face the ultimate decision that she must make. This is a tale about a beautiful yet terrifying choice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new game will be an original story that will be a great place for new players to jump in, but there will be certain Easter Eggs waiting for series veterans. Konami also discussed a few more details on the game, including that it will take place in the fictional Japanese town of Ebisugaoka - which is based on a real place called Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, creature &amp; character designer kera presented a message that should excite fans, as it teases what horrors await them in Silent Hill f.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I love the Silent Hill series, and it's been a big influence on me," Kera said. "In particular, I am constantly remembering Silent Hill 2, and the messages on the walls, the music, and the monster designs. So, when it came to Silent Hill f, and bringing the setting to Japan, we had to come up with something that felt just a little different, and I had to really think about how to get that feeling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The monster designs were the hardest. I had to consider everything that's come in Silent Hill before, and figure out how to take this game in a different direction, but still be Silent Hill. It might not be the exact same blood-smeared, rusting scenery, but I sincerely hope you'll enjoy our vision and the world we've created."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Music will also be a very important part of Silent Hill f, and the team is bringing together long-time Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka and Kensuke Inage (Dynasty Warriors series and more) to create music for both the Fog World and Otherworld, respectively. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I have composed music for an unsettling yet beautiful world that uses imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes," Inage said. "I wove in various techniques that will connect the player to the protragonist's agony, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we didn't get a release date, it was confirmed that Silent Hill f will be released on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?

                <p dir="ltr">As I take the field in Vanderbilt's iconic gold, I know the pressure is on. Scouts are watching, and this is my shot to fly up their draft boards. I take my place at third base, locked in and ready. There’s a runner on first, one away, as the pitcher deals from the mound. The batter jumps on the first-pitch fastball; the loud ping of his metal bat pierces the air. The ball rockets up the third-base line, far too fast for me to get a glove on. As the left-fielder chases the ball in the corner, the runner from first is passing second. I take my position, lined up between the left-fielder and catcher. The runner rounds third as the outfielder launches the ball. I cut it off, turn, and take aim at the catcher's glove just past the runner and fire...</p><p dir="ltr">It’s these high drama moments that stood out when GameSpot was invited to visit Sony’s San Diego studio to meet with the team behind MLB The Show 25. While there, we were treated to a deep dive and hands-on time with all the new additions coming to the latest iteration of the long-running baseball sim. With fresh gameplay wrinkles, new single- and multiplayer options for Diamond Dynasty, revamped free agency, and more, there’s a lot happening on and off the field. Let’s play ball.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458571-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458571" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458571-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458571"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458571-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_2.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458572-bulletjoerogan_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458573-calstatefullerton.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458574-coolpapa3_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458575-lsu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458576-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458572,1300-4458573,1300-4458574,1300-4458575,1300-4458576" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458572-bulletjoerogan_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458573-calstatefullerton.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458574-coolpapa3_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458575-lsu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458576-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_1.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458572-bulletjoerogan_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458573-calstatefullerton.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458574-coolpapa3_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458575-lsu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458576-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">On the diamond</h2><p dir="ltr">This year’s updates begin on the field. Ambush hitting brings yet another real-world strategic element to batting. As Chris Gill--Gameplay Director at Sony Diego and a former pro ball player in the Cincinnati Reds' system--describes, good hitters take advantage of scouting and observing tendencies, adjusting to sit on certain pitches. In game, that translates to optionally focusing on pitches inside or outside of the center of the plate. The side you focus on gets a bump to the size of both your good contact area and timing window, while the side you don’t choose is shrunk. That means a pitcher with a go-to finisher (like my favorite, a fastball up and in) may want to try another strategy against a hitter who has experienced their MO. Conversely, if a pitcher has been pounding the inside of the plate, they might be able to surprise the batter with an unexpected pitch away. It’s the sort of cat-and-mouse game that makes an at-bat feel like a contest of strategy as much as stick skill.</p><p dir="ltr">Defense is seeing its own slate of updates. According to Gill, the goal was to make defense matter more. Last year, the focus was on how outfielders react to balls in the air. This year, the focus is on infielders and their start transitions. They’ve long had a stat to determine reaction speed, but often the true difference between a mediocre and great defender is in the first step. Are they fast and smooth, going right to where they need to be? Or do they hesitate, stutter-step, and lose crucial fractions of seconds? It can be the difference between a play looking routine for one fielder and hard or impossible for another--potentially turning a would-be out into a hit. That, in turn, opens up the possibility of building a team around preventing runs, rather than just loading a lineup with power bats.</p><p dir="ltr">When playing as one specific ballplayer, like in Road to the Show, you will now find even more quick-time events to simulate key moments in the game. Impact plays like a ball in the dirt with runners on base give catchers a chance to be the hero or let the game slip through their fingers, while corner infielders now have to contend with cleanly fielding hard-hit line drives or properly cutting off throws. One new addition that could prove to be a big difference-maker is the swim move for baserunners. Close plays when you are diving for a base now trigger a small opportunity to reach out with one hand, then quickly pull it back to avoid the tag and slide in safely, Fernando Tatis Jr.-style. It looks slick in action, though it isn’t clear yet how often it will come up, or how difficult it will be to pull off at harder difficulties.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Return of the Negro Leagues</h2><p dir="ltr">One of The Show’s signature features is Storylines mode, featuring the Negro Leagues. Equal parts mini-documentary and gameplay challenge, this mode features Bob Kendrick, charismatic president of the Negro Leagues museum, regaling players with stories of legends and athletes from the past.</p><p dir="ltr">Ramon Russell is the Director in charge of Storylines, and he tells us this year the headliners are James “Cool Papa” Bell and Wilbur “Bullet Joe” Rogan. Bell is famously one of--if not <em>the--</em> fastest player to ever play pro ball. Rogan, meanwhile, was Shohei Ohtani before there was a Shohei Ohtani, mixing elite pitching with a dynamite bat. Cool Papa Bell and Bullet Joe Rogan are some of the biggest stars from the Negro Leagues, and Ramon tells us that, as in previous seasons of the Negro Leagues, the intention is to mix in the most famous players people know, with the great players that they should. The full roster this year will be eight players, with a few available at launch, more added two weeks later, and the rest added two weeks after that.</p><p dir="ltr">As before, each player will have vignettes narrated by Kendrick mixed with gameplay of key moments from their careers. What we saw looked as fascinating and exciting as the last two iterations, and the appeal of leaning more and more into the history of baseball is easy to see. More era-accurate uniforms, equipment, stadiums, and crowds continue to enhance the authenticity of the mode. According to Russell, sometimes the dev team can obtain the actual equipment to recreate it in-game. Other times, they need to do a lot of research, studying faded or colorless photographs , flyers, and even bobbleheads to get the details just right.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Franchise focus</h2><p dir="ltr">Baseball has one of the densest offseasons in sports, with sprawling farm systems, layered rules around player finances and team control, and a very, very long draft. While last year's game focused a lot on scouting and the draft, this year, Free Agency is a big emphasis. Whereas the previous iterations of The Show involved day after day of going through your list of needs, now you highlight three targets on your Big Board to pursue. The idea is to create scenarios like we see in MLB, where the Juan Soto sweepstakes dominates the early going, and teams determine whether they are in on it or pivoting straight to plan B.</p><p dir="ltr">All teams aren’t equal in MLB, and it will take more than just making offers to attract a free agent. That’s represented in Motivation, a stat that reflects how interested a player is in signing with you. Factors like competition at a player’s position can decrease their motivation, while playing for a contender can increase it. Your three targets are ranked first, second, or third in priority. They will increase in Motivation each week, with larger gains going to the higher-priority players. Once they are above 50%, you can offer them a contract. You could wait until their motivation is even higher, which gives you a better chance to win the free-agent sweepstakes at a lower cost, but that runs the risk of another team scooping them up in the meantime. You also need to be thoughtful not to come in with a lowball offer that could offend a player, and suppress their Motivation quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, your team won’t be the only one looking to load up on talent, and that’s where the rumors come into play. You’ll get some idea through the grapevine about who other teams might be looking at, and it’s up to you to decide if you trust the information and whether you'll act on it. Is a big market team in the hunt for your free agent? Maybe it's time to cut your losses and devote those resources elsewhere. Is your division rival making a push to bring in a star? It might be time to go all in and lock that player down for yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">Player value is getting a rebalance, too, which will affect both contracts and trades. A greater emphasis on defense comes with a higher value placed on great defenders. Meanwhile, true unicorns, like Shohei Ohtani, now command the record-setting deals and franchise-altering trade compensation reflected in reality. Similarly, elite players who reach free agency will reset the market for other players at their position, altering the deals that others are willing to take. The idea is to get the GM and player logic to more closely match the economics of baseball, bringing the simulation more in line with reality.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Diamond Dynasty</h2><p dir="ltr">I will freely admit that the live-service focused Diamond Dynasty is far and away where I spend most of my time in MLB The Show. The introduction of the Sets and Seasons model, in which cards are available in some Diamond Dynasty modes for a fixed amount of time before becoming unusable for ranked play in favor of newly added cards, is something I have never been a fan of. That’s why, like many DD aficionados, I was glad when it was announced that Sets and Seasons were going away, and cards no longer came with an expiration date. That doesn’t mean they are simply rolling Diamond Dynasty back to an earlier form, as popular programs to earn cards over the last few years will remain, which will hopefully mean a happy middle ground between cards expiring and good rosters taking too long to build.</p><p dir="ltr">Diamond Quest is a new single-player experience somewhat adjacent to Conquest. While Conquest functions like a mix of baseball and a strategy board game like Risk, Diamond Quest is more in the vein of a deck builder/roguelite. Each run puts you on a board with a fixed shape, and a roll of a die sends you across to tiles that can randomly contain perks that make games easier, penalties that make them harder, and gameplay challenges like three-inning games or brief sink-or-swim "Gameplay Moments." Boss battles offer a mix of risk and reward; winning can net you prizes like card packs, while losing will end your run, forcing you to restart with reshuffled tiles.</p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate goal is to get to the Stadium(s) on the board and win one final battle to have a shot at collecting one of the Exclusive Chance rewards. Playing at higher difficulties gives you a better chance at the top rewards, but you can also replay the map as much as you want in hopes of getting lucky with your drops. Over time, new maps will be added with different rewards, and some will have certain themes, requiring you to construct specific lineups. Examples given were an all-righties team or a cap on power hitters, which can lead to some interesting team builds.</p><p dir="ltr">Weekend Classic, meanwhile, is the new bite-sized competitive mode. Unlike Ranked Seasons, which unfold over multiple weeks, these contests play out over a few days. The idea is to create a faster experience anyone can jump into without necessarily being an all-in competitive player. Teams play six games, matchmade based on their rating, with better rewards for winning more games. After those six are over, you are put into a 100-team leaderboard that'ss also matched based on skill, giving you a chance to improve your standing and earn even more rewards. Ideally, that will give hardcore competitive players another event to circle on their calendars, and provide people who don’t traditionally play head-to-head an on-ramp to dip their toes in with a lower commitment. As always, it will depend a lot on how well balanced the PvP matches are, but it’s an interesting idea.</p><h2 dir="ltr">On the road again</h2><p dir="ltr">The biggest change to Road to the Show (RTTS) is the addition of amateur baseball. According to Steve Merka, the Game Director for RTTS, your career now begins in high school, where you have a chance to showcase your talents and earn a place in one of eight different college programs, including LSU, TCU, and Texas. The attention to detail is very apparent when you see it in action, from each set of faithfully recreated uniforms up to the distinct <em>PING</em> of the aluminum bat squaring up a baseball. Merka tells us there are two tracks you can follow to reach your MLB dream. You can forego college, and work your way from the bottom up in the minors, or you can focus on developing your talents in college, try to win a championship, and aim to be the first pick in the draft.</p><p dir="ltr">Player progression is seeing a bit of an overhaul, as well. Previously, attribute increases were tied directly to your performance in games or related drills. You had to hit for power to become a better power hitter, and you had to steal bases to be better on the basepaths. Now, it’s shifting toward a token system, allowing you to invest upgrades in any attribute you want. You can also unlock permanent perks for performing in clutch moments, like adding to your exit velocity on batter balls in certain counts. I do have a little concern that progression will feel less like a baseball sim and more like an RPG, but I’m optimistic it will be worth it if I can take a player who excels at hitting for contact, for example, and invest the effort into turning them into a power bat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458577-ucla.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458577" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458577-ucla.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458577"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458577-ucla.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458578-mlb25paulskenes_ps5_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458579-mlb25sonnygray_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458580-mlb25tarikskubal_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458581-mlb25yordanalvarez_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458582-southcarolina.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458578,1300-4458579,1300-4458580,1300-4458581,1300-4458582" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458578-mlb25paulskenes_ps5_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458579-mlb25sonnygray_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458580-mlb25tarikskubal_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458581-mlb25yordanalvarez_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458582-southcarolina.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458578-mlb25paulskenes_ps5_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458579-mlb25sonnygray_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458580-mlb25tarikskubal_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458581-mlb25yordanalvarez_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458582-southcarolina.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The one addition I’m not quite sold on is the optional first-person camera. At a touch of a button, you can switch from the standard third-person angle to a view from the eyes of your player. It’s quick and easy, which I appreciate, but any time I tried to field that way, it became much, much harder to see what was happening and get in front of the ball. More options are certainly a good thing, though it remains to be seen if this is an immersive new mechanic, or a largely superfluous gimmick.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, the latest edition of MLB The Show is bringing a lot of new things to the table. Between new gameplay features, brand-new modes, and another chapter in the excellent Negro Leagues Storylines, it’s clear that this team is looking to take big swings. As for how many of those hit? We’ll have to wait a few more days to find out.</p><p dir="ltr">MLB The Show 25 releases on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on March 18.</p>

It's been a good long while since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022. But now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its curious Japan-set follow-up. And thanks to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPKJevpvZI">latest Silent Hill Transmissions stream</a>, we've got an eerie new trailer and a few more hints at what's in store.
</p>
<p>
Back during its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">initial 2022 announcement</a>, Konami revealed Silent Hill f is being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07. And courtesy of its latest update, we now know a little more.
</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is, for instance, set in the 1960s, its events unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture. Here, we meet our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager" who suddenly finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.

<p>
That idea of "beauty in terror" is a theme Konami repeatedly returned throughout its latest Transmissions episode, explaining that while Silent Hill f retains the elements of psychological horror long-time fans will associate with the series, its setting allows it to deal with some more classically Japanese ideas, such as the notion that "when something becomes too beautiful and perfect, it instead becomes deeply unsettling".
</p>
<p>
It also spent a bit of time addressing Silent Hill f's notable shift away from the titular town that's been the focus of the series since its debut in 1999. Sharing his own perspective, Ryukishi07 explained that while Silent Hill can be considered a physical place with a dark history, it's equally a series "about portraying characters' struggles with the evil within themselves - sin, discontent, and conflict - in a visually striking way". And this, he noted, is a concept Silent Hill f retains, adding, "It's a gateway into the psychological battles of the human mind."
</p>
<p>
Konami also confirmed the return of long-time Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka, although this time he'll only be creating music for Ebisugaoka's Fog World. Music for its Otherworld (known as the Dark Shrine in Silent Hill f) will be composed by Kensuke Inage, whose musical credits include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, Samurai Showdown, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox-guard">Star Fox Guard</a>. In a message shared during the stream, Inage explained his compositions will use "imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes", all interwoven with techniques intended to connect the player to the protagonist's "agonies, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Konami teased "creatures that really infiltrate players' psyches", alongside easter eggs for long-time fans to uncover, despite Silent Hill f's new setting. And that's pretty much all we're getting for now. Silent Hill f doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC - and Konami says it'll have "plenty more to share in the future". Until then, there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag157nqMV0Q">new trailer</a>, which you can watch above.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f was one of four new Silent Hill games to be revealed back in 2022. PlayStation 5 freebie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s Silent Hill 2 Remake launched last year, and its fourth project, Silent Hill: Townfall, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">being developed by Stories Untold and Observation developer No Code</a>. Annapurna Interactive is still set to serve as the latter game's publisher, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">a "mass exodus" of staff</a> at the end of last year.

It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me. It’s an honor to find myself involved with a series I have so many memories with. I’ve poured all my efforts into this story, so much so that I don’t think I would mind if it was the last thing I ever wrote. To me, the <em>Silent Hill</em> series is more than just a collection of stories, it’s a medium; an amazing, phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person’s heart and mind. It’s my hope that players out there will come to appreciate it in the same way. And to all of our overseas friends, I hope you’ll enjoy a look at what <em>Silent Hill</em> might be like if set somewhere a little different, like Japan.”</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Creature [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a> and Character Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/kera_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kera</a></strong> – “I love the <em>Silent Hill</em> series, and it’s been a big influence on me. In particular, I am constantly remembering <em><a title="Games > Silent Hill 2 (2024) [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/silent-hill-2-2024">Silent Hill 2</a></em>, and the messages on the walls, the music, and the monster designs. So, when it came to <em>Silent Hill f</em>, and bringing the setting to Japan, we had to come up with something that felt just a little different, and I had to really think about how to get that feeling. The monster designs were the hardest. I had to consider everything that’s come in <em>Silent Hill</em> before, and figure out how to take this game in a different direction, but still be <em>Silent Hill</em>. It might not be the exact same blood-smeared, rusting scenery, but I sincerely hope you’ll enjoy our vision and the world we’ve created.”</li><li><strong>Composer <a href="https://twitter.com/akirayamaoka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akira Yamaoka</a></strong>&nbsp;– “Although this is set in Japan, we focused on portraying it in a way that is based solely on the conception of <em>Silent Hill</em>. While incorporating plenty of Japan’s unique identity, we sublimated it as fiction and expressed this unique culture as entertainment. By doing so, we believe we were able to blend the charm of Japan in a new way into the unique worldview of <em>Silent Hill</em>. We hope that through this game, you will enjoy the look and feel of what makes this title truly <em>Silent Hill</em>.”</li><li><strong>Composer <a href="https://twitter.com/ken_inage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kensuke Inage</a></strong> – “The first time I played <em>Silent Hill</em> was about 20 years back. I’m extremely honored to have been offered such a great opportunity for a series with a rich history. I was in charge of composing the music for the Otherworld, known in this game as the ‘Dark Shrine.’ I have composed music for an unsettling yet beautiful world that uses imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes. I wove in various techniques that will connect the player to the protagonist’s agony, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions. I hope you get to experience it for yourself in the game.”</li></ul><p>*Other composers include&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/higu_dai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dai</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://twitter.com/xaki_k_sakita" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xaki</a>.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p>This game contains depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence.</p><p>This game is set in Japan in the 1960s and contains depictions based on the customs and culture of that time.

<p>Everyone has a one or a few personal favorite heroes they lock in to win in Marvel Rivals, but the win rate data says that some are just plain better than others. While a higher win rate doesn’t automatically mean they’re a better hero, it’s certainly nothing to scoff at or take likely.</p>



<p>So which heroes in Marvel Rivals win the most? Let’s take a look at the top performing heroes according to win rate.</p>



<h2 id="h-hero-win-rates-in-marvel-rivals-march-2025-season-1-5">Hero Win Rates in Marvel Rivals (March 2025, Season 1.5)</h2>



<p>Similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-popular-marvel-rivals-heroes-highest-pick-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our highest pick rates piece</a>, we’re taking into account competitive and quick play. For competitive play , we’re using current data from tracker sites&nbsp;<a href="https://rivalstracker.com/heroes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a>. For quickplay, we’re using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero Hot List</a>&nbsp;from the official Marvel Rivals website. Even though the Hero Hot List was last updated February 17th, it’s a better source of quickplay rates than the incomplete data on RivalsTracker and RivalsMeta.</p>

<p>The Human Torch and The Thing have not been included because the quickplay win rates for them are not available yet.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-strategists">Best Strategists</h3>



<h4 id="h-rocket-raccoon">Rocket Raccoon</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rocket Raccoon’s sheer healing output and duelist-buffing teamup options establish him as the winningest strategist. He has a <strong>54.04% win rate in competitive, and a 55.23% win rate in quick play</strong>. His secondary fire healing can rapidly heal a group of allies stacked together, and both Punisher and Winter Soldier thrive when teamed with him. His damage amplifying ultimate also swings any teamfight in his side’s favor.</p>



<h4 id="h-mantis">Mantis</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mantis’ ability to provide healing and damage buffs, plus her individual firepower, make her on the same winning level as Rocket Raccoon. She has a <strong>53.99% win rate in competitive, and a 55.85% win rate in quick play</strong>. Mantis is especially strong at lower ranks, as her heals and buffs are easy to apply. She can also use her sleep and a personal damage boost to solo kill a squishy DPS that tries to challenge her.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-vanguards">Best Vanguards</h3>



<h4 id="h-peni-parker">Peni Parker</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Peni Parker is the winningest vanguard hero in Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>52.44% win rate in competitive, and a 54.82% win rate in quick play</strong>. Peni has arguably the best ranged damage capabilities of any vanguard, and she’s an infuriating nuisance to dig out of an objective once they get their mines down.</p>



<h4 id="h-thor">Thor</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thor has the second highest win rates of any vanguard in Marvel Rivals. He has a <strong>52.15% win rate in competitive, and a 54.71% win rate in quick play</strong>. Thor’s ability to close the distance and thrive in the chaos of a hectic teamfight translate into huge winning potential.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-duelists">Best Duelists</h3>



<h4 id="h-storm">Storm</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Storm is the winningest hero in all of Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>54.29% win rate in competitive, and a 58.11% win rate in quick play</strong>. Storm is a mobile, hard-to-hit, damage-dealing menace that can lead a teamfight with her thunderous Goddess Boost. There’s virtually no escape from her Omega Hurricane ultimate, especially when she can combo it with The Human Torch.</p>



<h4 id="h-magik">Magik</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Magik is the second most winning duelist in Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>52.60% win rate in competitive, and a 53.14% win rate in quick play</strong>. Magik is one of the few pure melee characters in the duelist class, dashing through portals and swinging her sword at anything in range.</p>

            <p>
Point-and-click fans rejoice! After a long (and, if you're me, impatient) wait, Wadjet Eye Games - the dependably brilliant studio behind the likes of Unavowed and the Blackwell series - is finally ready to share a release date for its intriguing time-travelling adventure, Old Skies. And it's close, launching for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Switch on 23th April.
</p>
<p>
Old Skies, which was originally announced all the way back in June 2022, cast players as Fia Quinn - a time agent for the ChronoZen agency who's been tasked with keeping a close eye on seven travellers as they take their own trips to the past. "Some are simply curious," explains Wadjet Eye. "Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they've all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it's vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."
</p>
<p>
Seven travellers means seven distinct time periods spanning over 200 years of history to explore, with Old Skies taking players from speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age, and even the morning of September 11th where a murder is waiting to be solved. It's got paradoxes to escape, puzzles to overcome - some requiring a spot of temporal thinking - and even the possibility of your adventure coming to a fatal halt. Although, as Wadjet Eye notes, the whole time travel thing means death is not the end.

<p>
Away from the story stuff, Old Skies features some (by Wadjet Eye's standards) positively futuristic 1920x1080 artwork - it marks the first time the developer has eschewed the chunky, distinctly old-school pixels of its past adventures - as well as music by Unavowed composer Thomas Regin, and full voice acting from the studio's "largest cast yet". You can get a general idea of how all that comes together in the trailer above, and Wadjet Eye's also released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAQ9UMzqZUQ">new trailer focusing on one of Old Skies seven cases</a>.
</p>
<p>
So there you go! Old Skies launches on 23rd April via Switch's eShop and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1346360/Old_Skies/">Steam</a>. And speaking as big fan of Wadjet Eye's consistently excellent back catalogue (which, incidentally, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/WadjetEyeGames">currently cheap as chips thanks to the Steam Spring Sale</a>), I can't blimmin' wait.
