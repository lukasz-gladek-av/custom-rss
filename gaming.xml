<article id="post-6484">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<p>As the world’s biggest <em>Alan Wake 2</em> Fan (a title I awarded to myself), I was excited to learn that a physical collector’s edition would be made available months after launch. My enthusiasm died off, however, when I looked at the package. <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/alan-wake-ii-collectors-edition/products/alan-wake-2-collectors-edition-ps5">For $200 at Limited Run Games</a>, you can get a physical copy of the game —&nbsp; the only place where you can do so — along with a copy of <em>Alan Wake Remastered</em>, an angel lamp replica, an art book, a keychain, and some digital cosmetics. It’s alright as far as collector’s editions go, but the kicker was that I had already bought the deluxe edition at launch, which included around half of what comes in the box. And there was no way to upgrade. I’d have to spend $200 <em>on top</em> of the $80 I already paid. Even beyond the fun collectibles, that’s basically $300 just for a physical copy, to own the game outright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking around, I can see similar frustration bubbling across a lot of the video game industry, and it’s reaching a boiling point. As games become more expensive to produce and are therefore becoming more costly to buy, players are lashing out at studios who want to get them to spend more for increasingly diminishing returns, whether through microtransactions or premium editions that offer “free” extras. While many might be worth it, some, like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s collectors edition, don’t offer enough for the exorbitant cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everything is very expensive right now. I’m not spending hundreds of dollars on stuff I already own or digital products that aren’t important or useful. And I know I’m not alone in this, either. Something has to change in the video games industry, and looking at special editions becoming increasingly sketchy is an area I think is being overlooked.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While games are more expensive than ever, with $70 being standard for many AAA games these days, the situation could be way worse. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/are-video-games-really-more-expensive">Analysts</a> <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2023/02/10/why-more-new-video-games-now-cost-70/">generally</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/7/21314545/console-video-game-price-increase-70-video-game-ps5-xbox-series-x">agree</a> that based on inflation and rising development costs, games should cost even more than they do now. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-03/ex-playstation-chief-mulls-future-of-gaming-and-his-new-job?srnd=technology-vp">Former Sony Interactive CEO Shawn Layden told Bloomberg</a> in 2021 that many PlayStation 4 games were topping $100 million, and he expected that number to only get higher. At the time, he said $200 million, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233">according to a presentation in the recent Insomniac Games leak</a>, the budget for the PS5’s <em>Spider-Man 2</em> was around $300 million. And while the game sold very well, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ps5-hardware-sales-hit-quarterly-high-but-that-isn-t-good-enough-for-sony">Sony said in its February financials</a> that it was bolstered by its sales of third-party games, not hardware or in-house development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lot of these costs have been offset over the years by purchases made outside of just buying the base game: microtransactions, gacha mechanics, paid DLC, games-as-a-service (GaaS), and premium collector’s editions. As scummy as many of these tactics can be, they do what they’re supposed to do. Live-service games like <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Fortnite </em>do well because players continue to invest in them over time. Regardless of whether you need a <em>Fortnite</em> skin that makes you look like a member of Metallica or not, these companies have become experts at getting you to buy things, which in turn has contributed to keeping full game prices low.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A premium edition has microtransactions built in — “for free,” in a way. Usually, you’ll see a cosmetic pack or a season pass for post-launch DLC in an $80 deluxe edition. Sometimes the studio will put up a limited-time collector’s edition for a couple hundred bucks for the big spenders who want a unique piece of merch or an artbook. The <em>Alan Wake 2</em> deluxe edition, for instance, came with two costumes, a weapon skin, an extra charm for protagonist Saga, and the story DLC expansion pass for an extra $20. While the majority of people will simply buy the standard edition, many will still pay extra for one of these special versions. The deluxe edition here was worth it to me just for the expansion pass. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pay-more-to-play-why-video-game-prices-could-rise-in-2023">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine put it</a>, “many games are already much more expensive than $70, and people happily pay for them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately for studios, as games get more expensive and other factors contribute to higher costs everywhere else, people are becoming wary of premium editions and extra purchases. When the standard edition of a AAA game can cost $70, a higher price tag has to be worth it. They can’t be <em>too</em> expensive, and if they are, the stuff included needs to ensure you that your wallet won’t start crying. You also can’t lock critical features behind paywalls. The same standards for microtransactions apply here as well; if you offer, say, a weapon that gives players a huge advantage, you’re saying you only care about money, not about the players themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While most developers and publishers these days are better about not offering pay-to-win items (or at least are better at hiding it), that hasn’t stopped them from breaking cardinal rules. Recently <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> developer Battlestate Games announced its The Unheard Edition. For $250, players got access to a highly sought-after offline PvE mode and features that gave them a huge advantage at the beginning of seasons. This was especially frustrating for players who purchased other premium editions with a season pass that promised to provide access to all future DLC. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140541/escape-from-tarkov-the-unheard-edition-250">Battlestate initially refused</a> to offer an upgrade discount or any other avenue for players to get PvE, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/05/23/all-escape-from-tarkov-eod-owners-now-have-access-to-250-pve-mode/">although it eventually relented</a> after immense community backlash.</p>



<p>Big studios have been trying out other ideas, with features that are appealing but fleeting. A recent trend has been including early access periods in special edition pre-orders. Although, even that might not be enough anymore when a game like <em>Concord</em> is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/">offering a brief beta period</a> for pre-order owners before launching an open beta the next week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ubisoft hasn’t done anything as openly egregious, but it’s made a habit of giving special edition owners exclusive missions. Its upcoming open-world RPG <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>is now up for pre-order, and people who buy the Gold or Ultimate editions get access to a season pass that features an exclusive Jabba the Hutt mission. The publisher has gotten around more widespread criticism with this strategy by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dont-spend-115-on-star-wars-outlaws-ultimate-edition">offering missions up later through Ubisoft Connect</a> with easy-to-obtain in-game currency, and in the case of <em>Star Wars</em>, players will still get to interact with the big slug boy in the main game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, just because games companies offer up decent extras doesn’t mean players will react accordingly. When <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> released on Steam, people noticed that the store page featured some extra purchases, which you could buy either in the “A Boon For New Adventurers – New Journey Pack,” as a part of the deluxe edition, or piecemeal. While people went to leave negative reviews on the page to complain about it, all of the items — rare as some of them were —&nbsp; could be found or earned in game. So on paper, Capcom was acting fairly. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108587/dragons-dogma-2-microtransactions-dlc-steam-reviews">Oli Welsh wrote for Polygon</a> that a lot of the backlash was due to the restrictive nature of <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2’</em>s game design (you could buy a Portcrystal to initiative fast travel, which is highly discouraged in-game, for instance).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, people were so quick to jump on Capcom for alleged exploitation in this case, and it’s mostly unfounded. You don’t <em>have</em> to get any of the items and you can earn all of them by just playing the game. But you can just tell from how quickly people reacted to this and other recent editions: They’re tired of being taken advantage of.</p>



<p>But to keep making profit (among other things like having to appeal to investors who want consistent growth every year and going into debt through constant, ridiculous acquisitions), studios will keep using the strategies that work. Microtransactions and collector’s editions aren’t going anywhere while they still bring in that much cash. If we must continue down this path, companies need to make purchases fair, listen to feedback, and understand that many just can’t afford digital nonsense. Players don’t need to experience opening their <em>Fallout 76</em> special edition only to find out the canvas bag was actually made of <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/fallout-76-power-armor-edition-canvas-bag-swapped-with-nylon-bag/">cheaper, shittier nylon</a> or that the DLC they were promised might not apply to them. And if I’m going to be surrounded by little tchotchkes from my favorite games, I better not regret paying $200.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Leading video site said action applies to all exisiting channels and any Beahm may create in future</p>

            <p>Streamer and influencer Guy 'DrDisrespect' Beahm continues to lose partners and support in the wake of allegations concerning his ban from Twitch, with YouTube now preventing him from earning money via his channel.</p>
<p>In a statement issued to <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-youtube-sexting-allegation-minor-1851565750">Kotaku</a>, a YouTube spokesperson said the platform has "suspended monetisation on DrDisrespect's channel for violating our Creator Responsibility policy."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that this channel, which has 4.7 million subscribers, has also been removed from the YouTube Partner Program "following serious allegations against the creator."</p>
<p>This will apply not only to Beahm's existing channels,but any he creates in the future.</p>
<p>The allegations emerged last Friday, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a> reported a former member of Twitch's trust and safety team claimed Beahm was banned from that site after sending inappropriate messages to a minor and attempting to arrange to meet them at TwitchCon.</p>
<p>In the wake of the report, Beahm claimed the matter had already been resolved and that "no wrongdoing was acknowledged." After <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">Twitch banned permanently banned him in 2020</a>, he sued the site and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">the case was settled in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, game developer Midnight Society – which Beahm co-founded – announced it had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/midnight-society-parts-ways-with-co-founder-dr-disrespect">parted ways with the streamer</a>, while peripherals firm Turtle Beach dropped its partnership with Beahm.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/took-%E2%80%98em-long-enough.914841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nickmercs-twitch-ban-transphobia-slur<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last night, Nick “Nickmercs” Kolcheff – an associate of <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm</a> who’s recently done a spectacular job of digging his own grave – got <a href="https://x.com/StreamerBans/status/1806584079996899816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended from Twitch</a>. Following months of sustained anti-trans rhetoric that ramped up in recent weeks, the bro-y streamer is finally facing tangible consequences after dropping the T-slur during a stream. On the upside, it seems like he's learned his lesson and plans to turn over a new leaf.&nbsp;</p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>“Banned for using the word ‘Tranny’ on Twitch,” Kolcheff, who has over 6 million followers on Twitch, <a href="https://x.com/NICKMERCS/status/1806640207216664777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “Apparently that’s a derogatory term. That’s on me. Next time I’ll use ‘mental health disorder.’”</p><p>This raises a lot of questions about the usefulness of Twitch’s rules in a situation like this. These rules <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#11HatefulConduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explicitly forbid</a>, among other things, “expressions of contempt, hatred, or disgust based on a protected characteristic” including “statements that a protected group should not exist.” During a recent stream, Kolcheff literally said that trans people <em>do </em>not exist: “There’s no such thing as trans people,” <a href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1800327448879612330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he said</a> while playing <em>Elden Ring</em>. “That’s something that you created. So have fun with your little dream land, but that shit is not even real.”&nbsp;</p><p>Other incidents have included a 2023 Pride Month invocation of “leave little children alone” rhetoric in response to transgender rights protesters in Florida – which ultimately led Activision to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23755282/call-of-duty-nickmercs-homophobic-comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yank his in-game skin from <em>Call of Duty</em></a> – and a recent dust-up with Ava Kris Tyson, a close friend of Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson who is trans. Tyson was criticizing defenders of Dr Disrespect, which prompted Kolcheff to <a href="https://x.com/NICKMERCS/status/1804626242194362502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reply</a>: "You should be ashamed of yourself. Leaving behind your wife &amp; child, to play pretend. One day you’ll wake up and realize what you’ve done."</p><p>These are just a few examples of a clear pattern of behavior on Kolcheff’s part, one that stretches back an entire year and demonstrably demonizes a marginalized group. But Twitch only opted to ban him after he used a slur, at which point he responded by immediately giving up the game: Cruel language is just the tip of the iceberg, and the substance behind it is the actual point. Kolcheff wants people to know that he believes trans people are delusional – that a desire to embody a different gender is a disorder, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/19/health/is-gender-dysphoria-mental-disorder-treatment-wellness/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is factually untrue</a>, by the way – and he’ll keep saying it until he’s blue in the face. The kinds of ideas he’s propagating are much more harmful than an admittedly shitty term; they are what convince people to fear, loathe, and even <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-religion-arrests-riots-race-and-ethnicity-c65c1090ed923687716114be371e9fdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do violence</a> to trans folks. On and around Twitch, the damage has already been done, and it sure seems like Kolcheff plans to do more.&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when Kolcheff returns from <a href="https://x.com/CommanderRoot/status/1806596115921240208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what appears to be a temporary suspension</a>? It seems unlikely that Twitch will suddenly start taking action against things Kolcheff has been saying for a year. Meanwhile, he’ll need to be a little savvier about how he says them – he’ll just have to tiptoe around the gargantuan, unmissable minefield that is using a slur – and that’ll be that. That in mind, who is this ban serving? Who benefits from it? Unless Twitch decides to actually enforce its rules when it comes to transphobic dog whistles, plausible deniability be damned, it may as well not be doing anything at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This set isn't one mentioned in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-2024-roadmap-stars-fallout-modern-horizons-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 roadmap</a>, nor is it another Universes Beyond crossover with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-x-fallout-mutant-menace-review-and-improvements" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/assassins-creed-magic-gathering-set-has-me-hooked" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Assassins Creed</em></a>. <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> is designed for players of all skill levels, and as a starting point for newcomers.</p>
<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundation</em>s announcement</h2>
<p>Wizards of the Coast recently held a preview panel at MagicCon: Amsterdam. That panel, now available in its entirety on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is_ghoPFjrw">YouTube channel</a>, revealed what <em>Magic</em> fans could expect going into the second half of 2024. It opened discussing <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> alongside sneak peeks at the upcoming <em>Bloomburrow</em> and <em>Duskmorn</em> sets.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-anthem-of-champions-artwork.jpg?itok=HjynPzvz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-anthem-of-champions-artwork.jpg?itok=DigR3_CV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to teach someone what an anthem effect is? Here it is.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the panel, <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> is a new Standard-legal set. As the name implies, it is meant to establish a foundation for the new era of the popular card game and help new players get into the hobby. If you have never played <em>Magic</em> before, this set is designed to show why fans love it so much.</p>
<p>The set will contain reprints of fan-favorite cards across the game's history. In addition, the set will contain brand new cards; essentially a 50/50 split of new and old.</p>
<p>The panel briefly showed new card art. It confirmed the return of older cards like <em>Llanowar Elves</em>,<em> Day of Judgment</em>, and <em>Omniscience</em>. They also revealed new cards such as <em>Anthem of Champions</em>, an aptly named Green/White anthem Enchantment, and <em>Nine-Lives Familiar</em>, a literal cat with nine lives.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-borderless-card-artwork.jpg?itok=BdGDP6vp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-borderless-card-artwork.jpg?itok=etmnDJx8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fans, enjoy hunting these down.</figcaption></figure><p>The card artwork in <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> showcases a focus on accessibility and approachability. Cards in this set will contain succinct text and straightforward effects. Furthermore,&nbsp; Enchantment cards going forward will feature Nyx borders. This means Enchantment and Artifact cards will have their own frame, making them more readable.</p>
<p>Naturally, <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> will contain alternate versions of these cards. The panel confirms extended art variants and borderless variants of both the reprints and new cards. The panel even teases the return of certain legendary creatures and Planeswalkers, one even alludes to fan-favorite Chandra Nalaar.</p>

            <p>
It's funny to think about names. If circumstances were just a tiny bit different, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkUVRGCidjE">Chuck Spadina</a> could have been up on stage winning over E3 by telling it how breathtaking it is; we might have all have been round the arcade <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-could-have-been-called-kong-dong-nintendo-court-documents-state">giggling at a Kong Dong cabinet</a>; or perhaps sitting down over breakfast for a quick game of Mr Bugs Wordys Nugz.
</p>
<p>
That's the unlikely title developer Josh Wardle once considered for his daily word game phenomenon Wordle before settling on the one that's since become a household name. "Had I called the game Mr. Bugs," Wardle admitted to an audience at the recent <a href="https://config.figma.com/agenda/session?session_id=d418949a2beb&amp;lang=en">Figma Config conference</a>, "I like to think it would not have been successful."
</p>
<p>
Wardle was speaking during a presentation detailing Wordle's long development (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24186786/wordle-original-name-mr-bugs-wordy-nugz-wardle">The Verge</a>), revealing some of decisions he'd made along the way. That journey began in 2013 when, while trying to make something that might appeal to his partner, he mashed together words and Mastermind to make an Android game. Perhaps surprisingly, the core of Wordle was there right from the start, giving players six turns to guess a five-letter word.

<p>
There were detours and deviations along the way, however. One prototype shown during Wardle's presentation was endless in design, quickly following one word with another, while a second attempt to refine Wordle's essence introduced lives. Nothing quite clicked, and eventually Wardle lost interest, putting the game "on the back burner" for six years. It wasn't until he started regularly playing New York Times games like Spelling Bee in 2020 that an idea struck and, returning to Wordle the following year, he built a version inspired by their once-a-day design.
</p>
<p>
And the rest is history. For the first six months of its existence, Wordle was played solely by Wardle and his partner, but one day they shared the website with family, who shared it with friends, until it turned into the global phenomena it is today. Wardle, of course, stunned the world in January 2022, when he decided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-buys-puzzle-game-phenomenon-wordle-for-seven-figure-sum">sell his meteorically successful game</a> to the New York Times for a seven-figure sum. And this, he told conference attendees, was simply because, "I didn't want to run a games business. I'm interested in creating things."
</p>
<p>
Nor did he want to monetise the game to turn it into a career. "All of this comes back to [the fact] I'm building the game for my partner," he explained. "I'm not going to show her ads or try and upsell her on a premium subscription... [but] it quickly became apparent to me that there were other people who were going to make money off Wordle, whether I was involved or not." In the end, he added, "selling to The New York Times was a way to just to step away." Would the publication have been quite so interested in Mr Bugs Wordys Nugz? Who can say.
</p>
<p>
In the end, though, Wardle's closing advice for fellow developers was simple: "Don't try to make Wordle. Make the thing that you're passionate about that is meaningful to you. And then everything else will follow from that."
</p>

He says much of the problem boils down to characters not feeling “tanky” enough, and it requires support heroes to focus all their healing on them just to sustain a fight. This means support players are somewhat tethered to tanks, so two of three roles are struggling, while he damage heroes light everyone else up.</p><p>As a result, the team has started using a new internal metric of “tankiness” that measures the number of hero deaths a tank character has compared to how many they “ought to experience.” Keller says that he can’t go into detail for what an expected death rate entails, but says that players’ struggles with the tank role are backed up by the data Blizzard uses internally. Some of this was intentional and a result of recent changes, but most tanks (except Wrecking Ball) moved “a lot further” down in survivability compared to other roles. The headshot damage reduction for tanks helped, but it’s still not where the team wants it.</p><p>Now that the problem’s been identified, Keller says the team is looking to see how they can address this, both with broad changes across the game and targeted tweaks for different heroes.

One hope the studio has for its upcoming sequel is to do a better job of pushing the envelope in its commentary on social issues. </p><p>During a recent episode of CDProject Red's <a href="https://youtu.be/lHBpEDCZMvo?t=3725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>AnswerRed Podcast</u></a>, associate game director Paweł Sasko underscored how, despite the game's nature of not hand-feeding players answers to prevailing social issues, Cyberpunk 2077 didn't go far enough in its social commentary. </p><p>"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," Sasko said. "Like, let's say, the homeless crisis. When I look at it, I'm like, 'We weren't far enough in '[Cyberpunk 2077.'] We thought that we were dystopian, but we just touched the surface."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Dan Hernberg, the executive producer for Project Orion, agreed with Sasko that Cyberpunk's portrayal of social issues was flawed and voiced his optimism for Orion furthering the game's social commentary in ways 2077 fell short. </p><p>"I think the really cool thing about Cyberpunk—and the dystopian future that it has—is there's so much relevance to today, of megacorporations, of people on the fringes, you know, of people just being exploited resources, of the wealth gap, of all these things," Hernberg said. "I think that 2077 allows us to tell these stories in ways where—at the heart of it—there's always relationships and people, but we're in a really broken world and that we can call out some of these things.</p><p>"I think for me that's what Cyberpunk is about, exploring those themes but in a very poignant way," Hernberg continued. "I love the world, and I think that's what we're going to try to do with Project Orion. Really continue to lean into that and continue to say, 'What is [the state of the world ] today,' and what does it look like in a couple of years."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Back in March, CD Projekt Red hired Hernberg, a former head of production at Amazon Games and lead product manager at Blizzard Entertainment, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-hires-veterans-from-mortal-kombat-diablo-control-and-more"><u>one of the veteran developers working on Orion in its Boston studio</u></a>. Although details on Project Orion are scarce, one thing we know for sure about the follow-up title is that the company wants it to follow in the footsteps of The Witcher's evolution. Meaning, that CD Projekt Red aims to have Orion usher in more gameplay enhancements and features than its predecessor once it finally releases. Another rumored idea for the title is that it might include <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-considering-adding-multiplayer-to-cyberpunk-2"><u>Cyberpunk 2077's scrapped multiplayer feature</u></a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review"><u>our review</u></a> of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, we gave the game a 9/10, writing, "Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty completes an immense turnaround for CD Projekt Red's future RPG kickstarted with the anime spinoff, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and its latest 2.0 Update."</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

                <p>After two years, Elden Rings' highly-anticipated DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-world-map-guide/2900-5487/" data-ref-id="2900-5487">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, is finally here. But despite Elden Ring's high praise and nearly universal acclaim from critics, the DLC currently rests at a 70% positive on Steam--and that's after a significant jump up from its former rating. So, what happened?</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ngvBy8YiA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N6ngvBy8YiA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Upon release, many players realized that the game's newest region, the Realm of Shadow, was filled to the brim with tough enemies. Like, <em>extremely </em>tough enemies. Despite the DLC emphasizing the importance of its new leveling mechanic, which relies on items called Scadutree Fragments to help balance the Shadow of the Erdtree so players don't, ya know, immediately wipe the floor with Messmer and his cronies, many players quickly grew frustrated with the DLC's difficulty.</p><p>From Software's games are no stranger to difficulty discourse--just Google the origin of the well-known phrase "get good." But this time, players are review bombing the studio's latest title for being too difficult. Yet on top of the DLC being <em>intended</em> to challenge players the way Elden Ring did back in 2022, we can't help but be a bit frustrated that From Software is more well-know for its games' difficulties rather than, well, just about everything else the studio does.</p><p>In this week's episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss review bombing, why the mantra "get good" is very outdated, and how games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne aren’t just hard for the sake of it. The pair also dig into how the games' actually set players up for success, reward their time and triumphs greatly, and offer so much more than brutal boss battles.</p><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

According to police, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/us/new-jersey-man-arrested-gamer-attack.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/us/new-jersey-man-arrested-gamer-attack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as reported by <em>The New York Times</em></a></span>, Kang had never met Dinh in person, but the two allegedly interacted in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/archeage&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/archeage">MMORPG <em>ArcheAge</em></a></span>. </p><p>At this time it’s unknown exactly what happened between the two men online in the  MMORPG, but police said the hammer attack was caused by “an online altercation” within <em>ArcheAge</em>. </p><p> “I don’t know what transpired between the victim and the suspect, but something made the suspect want to come down to Florida and injure the other individual,” explained Sherif Bill Leeper. </p><p>According to police, Kang flew from Newark to Jacksonville and then checked into a Florida hotel on June 21. Allegedly, Kang told his family that he was traveling to Florida to visit a friend. After arriving in Florida, Kang visited a local hardware store and bought a hammer and a flashlight. Then early on Sunday morning, while dressed in all black clothes and wearing a mask, Kang arrived at Dinh’s house and entered via an unlocked door. Once he got in, Kang reportedly began attacking the victim with a hammer. Dinh’s stepfather heard the commotion and intervened. The two then worked together to subdue the attacker and called the police. </p><p><em>The New York Times </em>reports Dinh was treated at a hospital for server head wounds and was later released. Kang has been charged with attempted murder as well as armed burglary. He’s currently being held in a Nassau County jail without bond. Kang reportedly called his mother and admitted to attacking someone, but said he had no plans to kill Dinh. </p><p>“This is a weird one,” said Sheriff Leeper during a news conference. “Some things make you say, ‘Hmm.’ Some things, you just can’t make up. There are some things that make you say, ‘What in the world was he thinking?’ And there are some things that make you say, ‘You’re not going to believe this.’ This case makes you say all four of those.” </p><p>Police questioned Kang about why he attacked Dinh with a hammer and he simply said: “He is a bad person online.”</p><p>Ironically, <em>ArcheAge</em>—the MMORPG in which Kang and Dinh interacted and which led to this whole attack—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-ten-years-korean-mmo-archeage-is-closing-its-european-and-north-american-servers&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-ten-years-korean-mmo-archeage-is-closing-its-european-and-north-american-servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shut down due to a lack of users on June 27</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-metaphor-refantazio-escape-the-shadow-of-persona-exploring-one-of-2024s-most-interesting-games.914805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-the-first-hands-on-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Eight years ago, Japanese director Katsura Hashino announced that he was forming a new team within Atlus after more than a decade spent working on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona series</a> (and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/07/26/catherine-review">Catherine</a>), saying he wanted to try something new. Last summer, his game was finally revealed – <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, an RPG that features plenty of similarities to the Persona games, but has a personality all its own.</p><p>In broad strokes, Metaphor retains many familiar elements from Hashino’s previous games. Like its spiritual predecessors, Metaphor utilizes a turn-based command system built around exploiting the weaknesses of enemies. The main character, an outcast who uses forbidden magic, looks a great deal like the hero of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a> thanks in no small part to the art of Shigenori Soejima. Even some of the terminology is the same, a notable example being Tarukaja – a spell that boosts attacks in Persona and now Metaphor (though Hashino denies any link between the two).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Its pedigree and excellent production values has been enough to generate excitement in some RPG circles, with some going so far as to call it their most anticipated game of the year. But others in the broader gaming community are a bit more perplexed, either because of the similarities to Persona, because of the unconventional name, or both. </p><p>So what is Metaphor: ReFantazio really all about? And does it have a chance to step out of Persona’s shadow and establish a fanbase all of its own? These are still open questions, but I did get a little closer to developing my own understanding of Metaphor when I played it at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-of-gaming-2024-schedule-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">Summer Game Fest</a> earlier this month.</p><h2>About Metaphor's name, and why it doesn't have romance</h2><p>First, that name, which is definitely a mouthful. The Metaphor part is easy enough to understand – Hashino says that he wants players to be able to relate the story to their own lives. In short, he wants it to be a metaphor. “We had all these different ideas. We couldn't think of many good ones so we were like, ‘Okay, just Metaphor. It's easy.’"</p><p>As for the second part, Hashino says, the team wanted to rethink the idea of a fantasy world. Hence, ReFantazio. Okay, so it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue, but you can’t say it’s not memorable.</p><p>As for the game itself, the demo I saw consisted of three different sections – a story sequence, a dungeon crawling sequence, and a boss battle. The demo begins by establishing some of the world through Gallica, a fairy companion who brings a bit of an 80s D&amp;D vibe to Metaphor. </p><p>In the sequence, Gallica relates the legend of a place that looks suspiciously like New York City, with Gallica amazed by a world with no magic, no tribal conflict, and “towers of glass that reach the heavens.” It’s a story that seems to suggest that discrimination is a recurring theme through Metaphor, with many of the main cast members battling prejudice of some sort.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As we developed the concept of the game, we realized our interest in exploring the idea of inner strength and how people overcome limitations</p></div><p>Speaking with IGN in a follow-up email, Hashino confirmed that Metaphor’s story is “closely related to the theme of changing the world for the better.”</p><p>“As we approached this project, we wanted to challenge ourselves to do something different from our past works while still leveraging the comprehensive strength and experience of Atlus as an RPG maker. As we developed the concept of the game, we realized our interest in exploring the idea of inner strength and how people overcome limitations. Essentially we wanted to explore how we can become the best possible versions of ourselves,” he said. </p><p>“To achieve this, we focused on how people perceive each other based on personality or personal interactions. This led us to the idea that biases or prejudices can form around judgements of these characteristics. We created a backdrop to this world around the idea that various characters in this world are exposed to some form of bias or prejudice in this regard."</p><p>While the fantasy world of Metaphor is different from ours in many ways, if we are able to convey it well, we believe fans will be able to find various similarities between it and our own.”</p><p>Ultimately, Hashino says, his main goal for Metaphor was to move away from Persona’s modern setting while sticking to the format he knows best. That means that Metaphor plays a great deal like Persona on a moment to moment basis, which is especially evident in the dungeon crawling and boss battle sequences. It even has summons that look a lot like the demons from Personas. Admittedly, there’s plenty of nuance to be found in these comparisons – among other things, a big part of the strategy is positioning your characters in the front or the back row, and the battles overall are much faster – but on the surface the resemblance is clear.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Persona Review Scores</h3></div></output><p>The most meaningful change can be found in the third section of the demo, which in addition to the boss battle showcases a bit of how the story progresses. Where the latter day Persona games are built around a linear daily school calendar, Metaphor is structured more like a road trip where you have the freedom to go where you please (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-more-than-a-stylish-persona-spin-off/1100-6524497/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hashino compares it to a vacation</a> where you won't be able to see everything in one playthrough).</p><p>Setting a destination on the Gauntlet Runner, the crew’s landship, will take a certain amount of time to reach, during which you can build up your stats by reading books with titles like “Pride and Persuasion” or doing laundry.</p><p>Notably, Metaphor doesn’t have any romantic connections to build, unlike Persona, which Hashino attributes to the desire to avoid making a “romance game.”</p><p>“We made [Persona] as a RPG story about teenagers. And teenagers, they date, they have romance. That's part of the joy of being a young person exploring your boundaries. So that was why we included it in the game…because if we didn't have this in, it wouldn't really feel authentic. For our new gam…we didn't want to include it because it didn't feel as natural, if that makes sense,” Hashino explains.</p><p>“The second point I would like to make is the main plot focus is that there's this character, the protagonist, who is trying to become the next king. And rather than focusing on his love life, we wanted to make sure we have this whole follower system. So we wanted people to focus on that.”</p><h2>Metaphor draws heavily from 80s and 90s fantasy</h2><p>This approach sits at the core of what separates Metaphor from Hashino’s previous work. I’ve often compared the latter day Persona games to something like an anime <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/08/16/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-review">Buffy the Vampires Slayer</a>, featuring Japanese teenagers who deal with high school drama by day and battle demons by night. When I played Metaphor, though, the first show that popped into my head was Aura Battle Dunbine – an early example of the isekai sub-genre featuring a young motorcycle enthusiast who is transported to a fantasy world populated by giant robots resembling bugs.</p><p>Hashino acknowledges that he’s a fan of Dunbine, but chalks up any influence it might have to its significant popularity in the 1980s. More significant may be what Soejima calls “the fantasy boom” of the 1980s and 90s, which gave rise to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/17/record-of-lodoss-war-2">Record of Lodoss War</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a>, and a host of other well-known properties.</p><p>“So I lived through the late '80s and early '90s when there was a fantasy boom over here, and all the fantasy stuff that existed in that era and that previously came from overseas was part of my artistic DNA,” Soejima says. “After that, I read a lot of really serious fantasy stuff, which came into me and mixed into this other base layer and helped form my DNA as well. The first fantasy I interacted with was [Dungeons &amp; Dragons] way, way back in the day. Probably more than books, Wizardry would be what really influenced me from the fantasy genre.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One way or another, Metaphor figures to be an interesting experiment for Hashino and company. Given a new canvas, the team seems keen to put their own stamp on the fantasy genre, drawing from well-known influences and giving them a new spin with their distinct verve and style. It feels at once familiar and invigorating – a fresh approach that still leans into their individual strengths, with a heightened art style and even faster battle system. Atlus, for its part, is treating it like the launch of a new franchise, giving it a global launch with a prime release slot in October.</p><p>“When we were creating this game, we thought, okay, we know that people do like the approach that we take,” Hashino says, “so we have more confidence to realize our vision without fear of how people will react, because we think people will like our game.”</p><p>We’ll be able to see for ourselves when Metaphor: ReFantazio releases October 11 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p>Kenshin Kazama, a 27-year-old Japanese resident in Hitachi, recently admitted that he made death threats to Nintendo via inquiry forms on its website between August 22 and November 29 last year. The reason? He was upset while playing Nintendo's games.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by<a href="https://www.ktv.jp/news/articles/?id=13276" rel="nofollow "> Kansai Television News</a> (via<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/27-year-old-man-admits-cancelling-nintendo-japan-events-by-threatening-to-kill-everyone-for-shitty-games/" rel="nofollow "> Video Games Chronicle</a>), Kazama sent 39 threats and was accused of saying that he would make sure people at Nintendo would regret making a bad game. Kazama went on to threaten to kill those who were involved in making the game. Then he went as far as to threaten spectators at an upcoming event.</p><p dir="ltr">The event Kazama mentioned was believed to be the Splatoon Koshien 2023 National Finals. As the name suggests, it's an event based on Nintendo's popular shooter, Splatoon. The Splatoon Koshien 2023 was originally set to take place in December 2023 and January 2024, but due to the threats, the event was canceled.</p><p dir="ltr">Kazama went on to explain that he made these threats because he was getting angry while playing Nintendo games, and every time he lost, he would get more frustrated. The prosecutors in the case revealed that Kazama's threats cost ¥700 million, which equates to roughly $4.36 million.</p><p dir="ltr">Kazama's sentencing is scheduled to take place next month on July 24 and the prosecution is asking for him to be sentenced to one year in prison.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/28/football-manager-25-will-feature-womens-teams/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/28/football-manager-25-will-feature-womens-teams/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new development update for Football Manager 25 has been released by Sports Interactive, highlighting how this will be a new start for the series. That is because Football Manager 25 will mark the franchise moving to the Unity engine, and it will likely be the main engine for the next 20 years. The first look at the user interface has been shown too, showing the tile and card system.</p>

		
		

<p>What the screenshots show are how Football Manager 25 will be changing the way players interact with the game going forward. The first screenshot shows the updated information screen players will see between highlights during matchdays. On it, you can see that the pitch takes centre stage as normal, with both team tactical line ups on either side of it. Below these are the match stats, match events, and other match scores from around the league. Under all of that is the team line up with player condition. The second screen shows the new Portal, with the Inbox being consigned to history. With the Portal you will have an Agenda list showing tasks that need to be completed, news from the football world, the calendar, and messages from everyone you interact with. The final two screens show player form details, detailing their performance over the last five matches, and how they have contributed to the team.</p>


<p>Football Manager 25 will see other things taken out. Matchday touchline shouts will not be present in the game. They may return in future Football Manager releases, but only if the development team believe they fit properly. The data chalkboard will not be back in Football Manager 25. Create A Club will not be in the game either, though Sports Interactive are aiming to bring it back for Football Manager 26 with major improvements. Versus mode is another mode that will not be in the game, as only 0.5% of players were playing it. Challenge Mode is being revamped as well, with it returning in either Football Manager 26 or Football Manager 27. Fantasy Draft will be part of Football Manager 25 but not day one. This will instead come further down the line in an update.</p>
<p>Miles Jacobson also confirmed in the development update that Football Manager 25 will be the first game in the series to include women’s football, and multiple licenses have been signed. However, the details of which leagues and teams will be playable has not been released yet, with that information coming at a later date.</p>

                <p>Hearthstone's next expansion, Perils in Paradise, is launching on July 23. And while the tropical-themed expansion is mostly about kicking back and relaxing on the beach, everybody knows that when you go on vacation, you should keep a close eye on your wallet. Sure enough, the Rogue package for the upcoming expansion has big burgle synergy, with cards that reward you for exercising the old five-finger discount.</p><p>The leader of the gang is <strong>Treasure Hunter Eudora</strong>, a Rogue legendary card (with a lovely Signature variant). The 6-mana 4/5 Pirate has a Battlecry that gives you a Sidequest token, Eudora's Treasure Hunt. The Sidequest challenges you to play three cards from other classes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325790-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325790" data-ratio="1.4343971631206" data-width="564" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325790-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325790"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325790-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325791-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325792-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_signature.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325793-rogue_vac_464t_enus_eudorastreasurehunt-112025_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325791,1300-4325792,1300-4325793" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325791-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325792-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_signature.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325793-rogue_vac_464t_enus_eudorastreasurehunt-112025_normal.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325791-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325792-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_signature.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325793-rogue_vac_464t_enus_eudorastreasurehunt-112025_normal.png"></figure><p>To help you complete the task, Eudora has brought a couple of scurvy scalawags along with her, and a big spell that will help remove threats while you plan your heist. <strong>Sea Shill</strong> is a 3-mana 3/2 pirate that gives you a 2-mana discount on the next non-Rogue card you play. <strong>Conniving Conman</strong> is a 4-mana 4/4 pirate that lets you double up on your stolen goods by replaying the last card you played from another class. And <strong>Snatch and Grab</strong> is an 8-mana spell that removes two enemy minions--but gets cheaper and more efficient for every stolen card you've played.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325799-rogue_vac_332_enus_seashill-107757_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325800-rogue_vac_333_enus_connivingconman-107759_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325801-rogue_vac_700_enus_snatchandgrab-106681_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325799,1300-4325800,1300-4325801" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325799-rogue_vac_332_enus_seashill-107757_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325800-rogue_vac_333_enus_connivingconman-107759_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325801-rogue_vac_700_enus_snatchandgrab-106681_normal.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325799-rogue_vac_332_enus_seashill-107757_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325800-rogue_vac_333_enus_connivingconman-107759_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325801-rogue_vac_700_enus_snatchandgrab-106681_normal.png"></figure><p>And your reward for pulling off Eudora's Sidequest successfully, likely with a little help from her crew, is some incredible loot.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/28/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-goes-gold-pc-specs-and-20-minutes-of-gameplay-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.</p>

<p>The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion&nbsp;Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.</p>

<p>We last saw Flintlock during the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-sets-july-launch">Xbox Games Showcase</a> a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."</p>

Unfortunately, the arrival of the Lich King's weapon is also accompanied by portals filled with undead, which players will need to battle against over the course of the July 4-26 event. They'll receive a little undead help of their own, however. A new power, Chill of the Frozen Throne, will see players earn a 10% damage increase after killing five monsters, as well as the ability to raise up to five skeletal minions to fight by their side, no Necromancer required.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ov-entertainments-quest-to-unite-latin-american-games-firms-begins-with-kokku-3ogs-acquisitions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>CEO Thiago de Freitas tells us "the future of games development is coming from South and Latin America"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The newly-formed OV Entertainment Group has made its first two acquisitions: Brazilian developer Kokku and Argentinian tools and tech specialist 3OGS.</p>
<p>Both were acquired for an undisclosed sum and form the basis of a group that aims to unite Latin American games companies in order to accelerate their growth and give them access to resources they would otherwise be unable to reach.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> sat down with key execs from all three companies during Gamescom Latam in São Paulo this week, where the vision for the group was described as the brainchild of Thiago de Freitas, founder of Kokku and now CEO of OV Entertainment.</p>
<p>De Freitas (pictured above left) explained that the idea began following a string of acquisition offers for Kokku, one of the largest studios in Brazil and one of the few with AAA development experience. Kokku provides services ranging from art production and co-development to full game development, and has contributed to games such as Horizon Fobidden West, Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War, Prison Architect 2, and more.</p>
<p>"We always wanted to show the world that the future of games development is coming from South America and Latin America, but we decided it's not for us to sell the company to any of these other groups or institutions," the CEO told us. "We really understand the culture, we don't want to be diluted into a different brand. And since we are Latin Amercians and we're proud of that, we know how to work with the culture, with the politics and labour laws, and all the weird financial taxes you need to pay here. Having this kind of understanding helps us to grow business here.</p>
<p>"That's one of the big reasons why Kokku was never sold to anyone, and why we decided to start uniting the Latin America game companies."</p>
<p>De Freitas added that Kokku's reputation and established contacts will help elevate other companies in the group, ones that may not have had the same opportunities before or lacked the structure and resources to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>"Companies like 3OGS, they're very talented, extremely skilled but they were struggling to find better companies and to reach other clients because they didn't have access to investment money and go beyond what they were already doing," he said.</p>
<p>3OGS, which stands for Three Ordinary Guys Studio, is a tech specialist based in Argentina and the team first met with De Freitas nearly two years ago when they were seeking investment. Co-CEO Pablo Navajas (pictured above right) said that when he heard the overall vision for OV Entertainment, it was "beyond our imagination."</p>
<p>"It was aligned with what we wanted to do in future, but we had that ambition alone and with [OV] we have the opportunity to accelerate that process," he said.</p>
<p>"We've also had companies trying to acquire us in the past, but this was the first time we felt like, 'Yes, this is the sort of future we want to shape.' This is going to be the huge step we wanted to do, just more quickly."</p>
<p>Navajas added that being part of a larger group will enable 3OGS to be involved in more complex projects and recruit larger teams to handle them.</p>
<p>De Freitas also hinted that this group will go beyond video games development and services, expressing a "broader vision of tapping into film, TV and other areas."</p>
<p>While OV Entertainment will focus on acquiring companies from Latam markets, the parent company itself is registered and based in the UK, with chief strategy officer Chris Bergstresser (pictured above) telling us this will make it easier for the group to access capital and operate with a more global focus.</p>
<p>Crucially, Bergstresser said the company has been watching other, larger games and services groups carefully and aim to learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>"The idea [Embracer] got correct is operational independence," he said, by way of example. "Ultimately, the only value in any company is the teams that are there. The reason why you get the best talent is because people love the working methodologies and the culture of those companies. Those are preserved.</p>
<p>"While Kokku and 3OGs are all part of OV Entertainment, it's the same shareholders so I wouldn't say they've lost independence. No one will do that in the future. It's effectively the same guys running the companies as it was before."</p>
<p>De Freitas added: "When we created OV Entertainment, it was to make sure we would use the company not like a Keywords or Embracer or these other groups, but we want to be a backstage kind of group. We're not here to take the lead or to dilute brands."</p>
<p>Navajas concurred, emphasising that a key reason 3OGS agreed to this acquisition was because the team can "make our own decisions [and] keep our clients."</p>
<p>"I think this is going to be a great group, and the next few years are going to be great. If we went alone, this sort of thing would have taken us another ten years, and now we can be there in two to three years."</p>

Where were you all when I was the last holdout of my middle school lunch period trying to do synchro-summons because I thought they were the coolest thing in the world? I ask this because there has not only been a discernable uptick in the trading card game and video games’ popularity of late, but some guy is now pulling out cards and winning Olympic qualifying races like some kind of mad man.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="191665" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Hearthstone Deck Will Kill You In One Turn" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="141" data-playlist="191665,194718,194547" data-current="191665"><div><p>This Hearthstone Deck Will Kill You In One Turn</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17440.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Noah Lyles, who’s evidently on his way to representing the US in the Paris Olympics later this year, is also apparently the Olympics preeminent <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>scholar. Before his recent heats (or races), Lyles has been flashing popular <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>cards to the cameras, including Blue-Eyes White Dragon and the head of Exodia, before tucking them back <em>into </em>his running suit. To top it all off, or perhaps to add insult to injury, he’s been <em>winning </em>these races as well. Folks, I think we may have discovered the fastest geek alive.</p><p>After flashing the head of Exodia just the other day, Lyles has followed it up in the most delightfully predictable way: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1806679621313720498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1806679621313720498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two<em> more</em> pieces of Exodia</a></span>. For the uninitiated, unaware, and unbothered, Exodia is a legendary monster in the fiction of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em>. It’s so powerful that when it was sealed away as a card, it was split into several pieces in the hope that they would never be used for fear of its literal destructive power. Thus, there are five pieces of Exodia: a head, two arms, and two legs.</p><p>In practice, Exodia is one of the most potent monsters to have in your deck because simply drawing all five pieces immediately wins the game. The modern version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em> features mechanics that allow for Exodia to be taken out of play, or at the very least mitigated, so it isn’t <em>all </em>powerful like it used to be. Still, a player stunned a crowd by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/yu-gi-oh-legend-uses-the-iconic-exodia-to-win-a-modern-tournament-match-as-the-crowd-chants-one-more-piece-and-even-his-opponent-claps-for-him/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/yu-gi-oh-legend-uses-the-iconic-exodia-to-win-a-modern-tournament-match-as-the-crowd-chants-one-more-piece-and-even-his-opponent-claps-for-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">winning a tournament using Exodia</a></span> just last year, so they’ve still got the juice, and that’s seemingly what Lyles is suggesting about himself.</p><p>In the same interview where he flashed both the right and left arms of Exodia, Lyles claimed that “Now it’s time to build the whole thing. I got the left and right arms, and I got the legs coming tomorrow.” When the interviewer had <em>zero </em>clue what Lyles was telling him, he clarified, “All the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>fans know. Something big is coming.”</p><p>Lyles isn’t just pulling out the cards because he’s a huge fan of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>and anime though. In an incredibly cute twist, he’s actually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/24/noah-lyles-yu-gi-oh-cards-olympics/74194959007/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/24/noah-lyles-yu-gi-oh-cards-olympics/74194959007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flashing them as part of a bet</a></span> with another athlete, the world champion shot putter Chase Ealey. According to Lyles, they have a running bet which stipulates that if he flashes <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>cards before his heats throughout the ongoing Olympic trials, Ealey will wear Rock Lee’s (of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/naruto-live-action-shang-chi-director-1851283058&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/naruto-live-action-shang-chi-director-1851283058"><em>Naruto</em></a></span>) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDzse1-2W8Q&amp;t=1s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDzse1-2W8Q&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leg weights</a></span>—which ironically make him super fast-–and take them off during her own finals. This might be the best sports anime I’ve ever seen.</p><p>It now seems incredibly likely that we’ll see Lyles pull out the entirety of Exodia over the course of his Olympic trials, and seeing as how he keeps knocking wins back, only time will tell what else he’s got up his suit. I only pray that he makes it to the Olympics and keeps this bit up for the hell of it. In the meantime, do you think he’s taking suggestions? If so, bring out Black Luster Soldier next, king. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With adequate levels and enough Scadutree Fragments collected, she’s one of the more straightforward and easy major bosses of the DLC.<br></p><p>When Metyr, Mother of Fingers falls to your might, head back and interact with the throne a second time to spawn the Swordhand of Night Jolan invader. This is a simple NPC fight and doesn’t take long to tackle. However, when she dies, Count Ymir will reappear, so be prepared for another fight.</p><figure id="" data-id="7e3ef182fcb2af5149f4ae27821bf1be" data-recommend-id="image://7e3ef182fcb2af5149f4ae27821bf1be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Swordhand of Night Johan, making a pain in the arse of himself." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Swordhand of Night Johan, making a pain in the arse of himself." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e3ef182fcb2af5149f4ae27821bf1be" data-recommend-id="image://7e3ef182fcb2af5149f4ae27821bf1be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Swordhand of Night Johan, making a pain in the arse of himself." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Count Ymir, Mother of Fingers boss doesn’t have a ton of HP, so you can beat him down pretty quickly with high damage spells or abilities. The only major concern of the fight is the Fingercreepers he spawns, but you should be able to rid the arena of those with a handful of quick attacks.<br></p><p>When Count Ymir is finally defeated, fast travel away and return a final time to the throne room. Leaned against a pillar near the throne is Jolan. Provided you’ve found the Iris of Grace and/or Iris of Occultation items throughout your journey, you’ll be given the option to give her only one of these.</p><figure id="" data-id="08c277009d0565435c8f099bd4a85020" data-recommend-id="image://08c277009d0565435c8f099bd4a85020" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="At last, the Iris of Occultation." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="At last, the Iris of Occultation." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="08c277009d0565435c8f099bd4a85020" data-recommend-id="image://08c277009d0565435c8f099bd4a85020" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="At last, the Iris of Occultation." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Choose the Iris of Occultation. When Jolan perishes, you can loot the glowing item she leaves behind to receive the Sword of Night at last.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you haven’t found an Iris of Occultation yet, one can be easily found by defeating the Lesser Omenkiller in the Fort of Reprimand in Scadu Altus. Alternatively, you can slay a Lesser Ulcerated Spirit in the Shadow Keep’s Church District, though this will require a bit more work.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Along with providing easier access to the original trilogy, DRM-free, GOG has also revealed that the original version of Resident Evil 2 is based on the 1998 Windows PC version. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's been hard keeping this secret but I'm happy to announce that GOG is doing the impossible and is bringing back the classic Resident Evil Trilogy! I've played the ports of RE1/2, and here are my thoughts on what I've experienced! RTs very appreciated! <a href="https://t.co/lh4dHfsnYd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/lh4dHfsnYd</a> <a href="https://t.co/p15HI87qTO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/p15HI87qTO</a></p>— Suzi Hunter (@TheSphereHunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSphereHunter/status/1805934519943569909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The news was <a href="https://youtu.be/o38wFuD3Wag?si=cU4011hLRCva3cr3&amp;t=436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first reported by YouTuber The Sphere Hunter</a>, who revealed she had the chance to play the first two games in advance — revealing that Resident Evil 2 classic was based on the original Windows PC version, not the Sourcenext version. A GOG spokesperson also confirmed this detail to IGN in a statement sent via email. </p><p>If you're unfamiliar with these two ports, the former was released in 1998 for Windows 98, while the latter, developed by software company Sourcenext, was a WindowsXP-compatible port released exclusively in Japan in 2006. </p><p>The biggest difference between these two versions is that the Sourcenext version provided higher-quality full-motion videos (FMVs). Many Resident Evil fans have argued that the Sourcenext version was the definitive way to play Resident Evil 2 on PC. Though this version was only released in Japan, as content creator Ultra Creed <a href="https://youtu.be/N-XB8ctbteE?si=maRyIcp949ZKlPDE&amp;t=759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a>, fans have used the Resident Evil 2 Classic REbirth mod to not only translate the Sourcenext version to English (minus the FMVs) but also add support for modern controllers and added optional gameplay features you could enable, such as quick turns and tactical reloads.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/23/resident-evil-2-7">our review of the original PC version of Resident Evil 2</a>, IGN wrote: "It's just too shallow for the average PC gamer. With such little change over the Playstation version, it makes you wonder why it took Capcom three months to get this one out on the PC." </p><p>The original Resident Evil is now available on GOG. Resident Evil 2 and 3 are not available yet.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.
