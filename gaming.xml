<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 you the reigns to various characters throughout the Campaign. However, one character stands out above the rest—Case. We’re here to give you a rundown of what happened to Case, and clear up any confusion.</p>



<p>Many Call of Duty games have taken the liberty of making multiple, integral characters playable through the Campaign. I still remember switching between CoD 4’s Sgt. Paul Jackson and the legendary Sergeant ‘Soap’ McTavish, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> doesn’t quite reach this extent, one mission moves you around a lot.</p>



<p>Case is our main character for the majority of BLOPS 6 though, and his story unfolds shockingly throughout the main story missions. Once you’re done with distractions such as solving the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-safe-code-and-complete-every-safehouse-puzzle-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Safehouse Puzzles</a>, you eventually come to the end of the Campaign, and the resolution is a subjective one.</p>



<p><strong>*Spoiler Warning: The end of Black Ops 6 is about to be discussed, so be warned.*</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-does-case-die-in-black-ops-6">Does Case Die in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The end moments are chaotic. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve done some digging, and no one seems to know for sure if Case really did die at the climax of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign—nor has Activision, Treyarch, or Raven Software confirmed this.</p>



<p>I know this isn’t the answer you hoped for, but it does mean if you like Case, and want more of his involvement, I reckon there’s a good chance he’s still alive and kicking. To recap, the conclusion of Black Ops 6 sees Pantheon forces invade the Rook in a bid to wipe out the team and rescue the good-turned-bad Harrow.</p>



<p>Case thwarts Harrow’s escape effort, resulting in the helicopter crashing into the water near the Rook safehouse. With water slowly consumingthe vehicle, Case and Harrow fight. After a sample of The Cradle breaks and infects Case, our hero kills Harrow, and the water and surrounding environment seems to get the better of Case—as the screen fades to black.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-case-alive-in-black-ops-6">Is Case alive in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>This isn’t official, but <strong>I believe Case is still somehow alive in Black Ops 6</strong>—I could be proven wrong though.</p>



<p>I can’t think of many instances in CoD games where a major death isn’t given some kind of on-screen attention or an off-screen mention. We either see the character in question die, or their death is mentioned in a post-credits cutscene, or in a commemoration to the individual’s life and legacy.</p>



<p>Black Ops Cold War carried on its story through seasonal multiplayer content; so I think we either see Case return at some point in the next year, or he could end up being the main villain in the next Black Ops installment. If it happens, you owe me a Pepsi Max.</p>

            <p>SAG-AFTRA, the US actors' union, has signed an agreement with AI service Ethovox in a continued bid to safeguard performers.</p>
<p>The service offers a "fully-authenticated foundational AI model for voice" that provides the basis for digital replicas. With this new agreement, SAG-AFTRA aims to ensure performers are protected and will be compensated fairly for their work.</p>
<p>Video game performers from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">SAG-AFTRA union are currently on strike</a> following a dispute over the use of AI in game development. As the union's chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland explained, SAG-AFTRA aims to recognise AI companies to ensure protection for its performers.</p>

<p>"What will safeguard voice actors' livelihoods in the AI age is more contractual protection, not less," said Crabtree-Ireland. "That's why SAG-AFTRA will continue to recognize AI  companies, like Ethovox, that agree with our union's AI guidelines. Not everyone will want to work with an AI company, and that's understandable. But for those who intend to utilise the opportunities AI offers, it's important that agreements require companies to secure informed consent, and provide fair compensation. Without informed consent and fair compensation, this new era will become a 'Wild West' of AI misuse and exploitation."</p>
<p>Ethovox was co-founded by BAFTA award-winning actor Cissy Jones, known for her roles in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> as well as voicing characters in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and more.</p>
<p>"Ethovox is the only voice AI company owned and managed by voice actors, and we are pleased to be partnering with SAG-AFTRA on building a foundational voice AI model that prioritises the interests of voice actors," she said. "AI should be a choice. For that reason, we have reached out to the voice actor community throughout this process. Ethovox will continue to do so as we demonstrate that artists can, and should, be compensated for contributing to ethical AI development while also maintaining consent and control over their voice data."</p>
<p>Voice actors have overall been sceptical of AI usage. Last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and Metal Gear Solid actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-a-hammer-that-can-smash-your-skin-and-destroy-who-you-are-says-jennifer-hale-following-sag-aftra-strikes">Jennifer Hale described AI</a> as a hammer that can "smash your skin and destroy who you are".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">UK actors' union Equity has not authorised its own equivalent strike</a>, but said it stands "in solidarity" with its sister union. This is partly due to the restrictive nature of UK industrial relations legislation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, Sony announced it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-firewalk-studios-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down<em> Concord</em> creator Firewalk Studios</a>, whose game released in August and was <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken offline</a> less than two weeks later. CEO Hermen Hulst <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> that “The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title.” But I wouldn’t put the blame on the genre or on Firewalk’s work–I’d put it squarely on Sony.</p><p>Was <em>Concord</em> a “good” game, however you define that? I didn’t play it, so can’t weigh in from personal experience, but it saw <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/this-really-doesnt-look-promising-concord-pc-players-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-matches-thanks-to-ridiculously-low-player-counts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tremendously low player counts</a> in its brief life, never a good thing for a multiplayer game. It set itself up for a challenge as a paid game in a space dominated by free-to-play, and its <em>Overwatch</em>-meets-Marvel-meets-Joss-Whedon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cinematic reveal </a>didn’t help matters.&nbsp;</p><p>After its awkward reveal, <em>Concord</em> found itself in a weird place in Sony’s stable. It was set to be part of Amazon’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/08/playstation-concord-to-feature-in-amazon-primes-secret-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Secret Level</em></a> show (and, at least as of September, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still is</a>), signalling a kind of confidence in its world and characters, but at the same time Sony <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/concord-raises-questions-over-sonys-live-service-competence-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t market it much</a>. All of this was despite Sony purchasing Firewalk as part of its <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-our-live-service-games-will-target-different-genres-release-schedules-and-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push into live service</a>, scooping up the studio in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2023/sony-interactive-entertainment-to-acquire-firewalk-studios-from-probablymonsters-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2023</a> “to define a new generation of live service experiences for PlayStation gamers” before Firewalk had ever released a game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku</a> reports that&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The initial development deal for the game was just over $200 million, according to two sources familiar with the agreement but who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. But <em>Kotaku </em>understands that amount was not enough to cover the game’s entire development and did not include the purchase of<em> Concord</em> IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself, which Sony acquired only last year.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This investment and promotion of the game’s narrative stands at odds to how quickly Sony seemed to lose confidence in <em>Concord</em>. I wouldn’t say throwing the game, especially as a paid product, into the waters of the live service space was a good bet, but as part of a push into the genre, I would have expected Sony to stand behind it, or at least try to make the best out of the situation with its vast resources. Instead, Sony took the game offline–the possibility of it being revamped and coming back always felt like a pipe dream–and now it’s shuttered the studio. Hulst’s statement mentions the possibility of reassigning team members across PlayStation, and I sincerely hope it does, but I’m skeptical.&nbsp;</p><p>In its own <a href="https://x.com/FirewalkStudios/status/1851327043956592781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> about the shutdown, Firewalk listed its accomplishments. Among them were that it managed to</p><blockquote><p>- Navigate growing a new startup into a team during a global pandemic:&nbsp; Firewalk was founded in 2018 and was very small for its first couple years, only entering full Production in 2022.</p><p>- Build a new, customized next-generation FPS engine in Unreal 4 -&gt; 5, delivering top-tier gameplay feel, beautiful worlds, and a performant 60fps technical experience on a stable and scalable backend on PS5 and PC to hundreds of thousands of players in our beta.</p><p>- Manage an acquisition / integration while readying technical and preliminary tests.</p><p>- And ultimately ship and deliver a great FPS experience to players- even if it landed much more narrowly than hoped against a heavily consolidated market.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>However the game performed with players, that’s a lot to be proud of. It’s certainly what you’d expect a studio you purchased to do, and it certainly seems like enough of a track record to keep a studio around to try again, especially if Sony is serious about its aim to, as Hulst wrote, “take the lessons learned from <em>Concord</em> and continue to advance our live service capabilities.” But instead Sony has decided to dump the whole thing in the bin, letting Firewalk and its staff pay the price for Sony’s misguided push into a crowded space, failure to market, and inability/unwillingness/just plain refusal to support a studio it clearly once had a lot of faith in.&nbsp;</p><p>Firewalk wrote that the studio “began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience… We took some risks along the way… and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward.” If Firewalk had made this gamble under its own steam and with its own money, the shutdown might be an understandable end. But all of this happened under the live service fervor and via the deep pockets of a massive company. If this is anyone’s failure, and if anyone should be facing the consequences, it’s Sony.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>We're only a day away from the official launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Following the early critic reviews and initial industry <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-high-praise-from-larians-director-of-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressions</a>, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson shared the company's excitement about the game's sales potential. Speaking to investors during the Q2 2025 earnings call (<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/electronic-arts-ea-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcribed</a> by The Motley Fool), he said:</p>
<p><em>It's an amazing time at EA, and in two days, we will launch Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It's been ten years since we launched its predecessor, Game of the Year winner Dragon Age: Inquisition. Early critic scores are strong and reflect the high quality, depth, and detail in this year's action-packed adventure. We expect Dragon Age to be a great example of how our blockbuster storytelling engages and connects fans in truly unique ways.</em></p>
<p><em>I certainly think Veilguard has breakout potential. Again, 10 years ago, Dragon Age: Inquisition was Game of the Year and a very strong performer for us. This is entertainment. While much of our business has moved to live service, this opportunity to bring in incredibly high-quality, creative storytelling set in an amazing world with rich characters living out those stories, you are able to capture that moment in entertainment and success almost certainly follows. We see that in the context of movies, TV seasons, and videogames. When we think about what we have with Veilguard right now, we have a storied studio in BioWare and a storied IP in Dragon Age.</em></p>
<p><em>We have a team that took extra time to make sure the world was rich and the characters were interesting and the story was compelling. I think we're going into a market that has limited competition for this category of game given some of the moves that have happened across the broader industry. While I think it's too early to predict the outcome, the critical reviews have been incredibly strong. The team feels really energized by what they have delivered, and my sense is that yes, it has breakout capabilities.</em></p>
<p>We recently learned from Executive Producer Mark Darrah that Dragon Age: Inquisition sold 12 million units lifetime, becoming BioWare's best-selling game. We'll have to see whether Veilguard can achieve similar success, but EA certainly is confident based on pre-orders and critical reception.</p>
<p>Personally, I loved my time with the game, as you can read in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>If the game sells well, there's a chance we might get some DLC, a topic on which BioWare hasn't commented at all so far. The DLCs made for Inquisition, Trespasser specifically, were some of the best content released for the previous game, so here's hoping.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio's next big project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next Mass Effect</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has quietly released an NFT game by the unfortunate name of&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</em>. Yes, you read that right, and no, you haven't blacked out and woken up in the year 2022.</p>

<p>The tactical RPG was released last week as a free-to-play PC game, but you'd be forgiven for missing its launch completely, because Ubisoft doesn't seem like it's particularly eager to market the game.</p>

<p>There's no mention of its launch on the studio's <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) feed</a> from around launch day, nor does it appear on Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ubisoft/videos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, despite the fact that this is a game that was developed in-house by Ubisoft and not farmed out to a third party.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-ubisoft.jpg?itok=t44WejQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-ubisoft.jpg?itok=nohDDi8D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles&nbsp;</em>is an NFT-based tactical RPG battler, and yes, it has launched this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As noted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by IGN</a>,&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics</em>' NFT system comes in the form of buyable figurines, which you can technically also craft using in-game currency. This being an NFT game, though, I'm assuming its in-game economy will incentivize you to buy NFTs.</p>

<p>According to IGN, figurines (i.e. characters) in&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics</em>' NFT marketplace range from around $7 to an eye-watering $63,000, although whether the seller actually expects players to pay that much is another matter.</p>

<p>You haven't turned over two pages at once here, either; this is absolutely a full-blown, honest-to-goodness NFT game launching in the year of our lord 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, Ubisoft isn't the only company that's still got some skin in the NFT game. In August, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-launching-its-own-blockchain-for-nfts-and-play-to-earn-games">launched its own blockchain</a> for NFT and play-to-earn games, and last year, Sega <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/immensely-popular-classic-sega-franchise-will-become-nft-game">declared its intention</a> to create an NFT Web3 game based on an "immensely popular" franchise.</p>




<p>Still, NFTs don't exactly feel like the place Ubisoft needs to be in right now, especially given that the company is having a pretty rough year so far thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">investor threats</a>, major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">game delays</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy">a lawsuit</a>, among other things.</p>

<p>That's not to mention the very public failure of&nbsp;<em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>, the long-awaited pirate MMO that limped out of the gate back in February to a lukewarm reception, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already">not least from us</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles&nbsp;</em>(and don't blame yourself if you immediately forget that name after you close this article) goes anywhere remains to be seen, but if you want to, you can <a href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out here</a>.</p>

            <p>Hark! Comments have been temporarily turned off on Rock Paper Shotgun. We and all of our sibling websites are moving to a new commenting platform and the existing comments need to be ported across. This process will take some time - days, perhaps - and we'll update this post once it's complete and commenting functionality has been restored.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In brief, we need to take a snapshot of the almost 2 million comments posted on RPS over the last seventeen years, then import them into the new system. It's better if new comments aren't being created in that time.
</p>
<p>Once comments return, you shouldn't need to do anything differently. Your login and site account will remain the same as before, but the comment section itself will have a different look and feel and probably a few different features. We'll share more details once the switchover happens.
</p>
<p>If we had been able to plan this further in advance, we would have published a series of articles containing our most controversial opinions, to take advantage of your brief inability to yell at us. But alas, it wasn't to be. Instead I'll say that I truly value the comment community here and I look forward to hearing from you all again on these pages soon. In the meantime, you can make yourself heard by <a href="mailto:graham@rockpapershotgun.com">emailing me</a> with  any thoughts, questions or feedback.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Charlie Cox was so brilliant as the lawyer-cum-crime-fighter, but human shapeshifter Vincent D’Onofrio was the stand-out star as Wilson Fisk, his performance so utterly mesmerizing and terrifying. Both reprise their roles in <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>, along with, well, the whole cast! Deborah Ann Wolf and Elden Henson are back too, despite not appearing in the clips, as well as Jon Bernthal returning as Frank “The Punisher” Castle. The only disappointment for me is no sign of Krysten Ritter returning as Jessica Jones.</p><h2 id="h10307"><a id=""></a><em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em></h2><p>However, it’s far from alone in looking promising. There’s the new <em>Spider-Man</em> animation, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em>, which, while doomed to lie in the shadow of the impeccable <em>Spider-Verse</em> movies, is set in the MCU! It features live-action actors reprising roles, such as Charlie Cox playing Daredevil and Vincent D’Onofrio as Kingpin, along with the likes of Paul F. Tompkins and Eugene Byrd (as Lonnie Lincoln, rather than Jefferson Morales who he played in <em>Spidey and His Amazing Friends</em>). However, rather sadly there’s no sign of Tom Holland, with Spidey himself played by Hudson Thames, who voiced the character in season one of <em>What If? </em>It streams on January 25.</p><h2 id="h10308"><a id=""></a><em>Ironheart</em></h2><p>There’s also <em>Ironheart</em>, which sees the character—Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne)—who first appeared in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> spin off into her own show. She’s a genius teenage inventor, and has created a suit that might be better than Tony Stark’s. This one’s been held back forever, with filming apparently completed in 2022, suggesting a horrendous amount of post-production meddling. It’s finally on Disney Plus June 24.</p><h2 id="h10309"><a id=""></a><em>Wonder Man</em></h2><p>A show I’d never heard of before now, <em>Wonder Man</em> looks immediately intriguing. It’s based on the extremely long-running comic character, but seems to be making an origin story of its own. Ben Kingsley is once again playing his bonkers role, originally from <em>Iron Man 3</em>, of Trevor Slattery, seemingly casting a new superhero TV show called <em>Wonder Man</em>... Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Morpheus in <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> and Black Manta in DC’s <em>Aquaman 2</em>) auditions for the role of Wonder Man, and seems to have powers of his own? Very early days on this one, as it’s not airing until December 2025.</p><h2 id="h10310"><a id=""></a>The Rest</h2><p>Along with <em>What If?</em>, there are two other animations—<em>Marvel Zombies</em> and <em>Eyes of Wakanda</em>. The former is a <em>What If?</em> spin-off and I’m struggling to care, but the latter is much more interesting, an exploration of Wakandan warriors throughout history. <em>Eyes</em> is out August 6, 2025, with <em>Zombies</em> following October 25.</p><p>Marvel’s TV outings have come to be known by many as “homework”; an obligation to sit through in order to understand what is going on in the big-screen movies. It’s hard to argue against that when it comes to  sitting through something like the snore-fest of <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, if you want to know what’s going on in the forthcoming <em>Thunderbolts*</em>. (Don’t look for a footnote, that’s the dumb name of the film.) But turning your back also means you’d miss out on the complete joy of <em>Ms. Marvel</em>, and all its setup for the lovely and hilarious movie <em>The Marvels</em>. It’s a minefield, and one distinctly not helped by the way Disney Plus refuses to create a section just for its TV shows on its app.</p><p>Oh, and if you aren’t watching <em>Agatha All Along</em>, you’re doing life wrong.</p><p>However, this slate certainly looks more promising than the recent disappoints of <em>Echo, Secret Invasion, </em>and the god-awful second season of <em>Loki. </em>Perhaps less homework and more enjoyable screen-time.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> aims to run "smoothly" at 60fps across both Xbox Series X and its lesser-powered sibling, the Series S.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/indiana-jones-great-circle-runs-at-60-fps-on-xbox-series-x-s-interview">Windows Central</a>, creative director Axel Torvenius touched on the game's technical performance.</p>
<p>"It might be that we will release even more details in terms of specifics, technical details, as we get closer to launch, once we see all the telemetry on performance," the developer began. "But what I can tell you is that the ambition is that the game runs at 60fps on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, and that, you know, it shouldn't be compromised in the visuals or the experience of the product."</p>

<p>Torvenius said the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle team want the experience to feel "cohesive" for players, meaning the game should run "smoothly at 60" across both Xbox Series X and Series S.</p>
<p>The Series S console has tripped up developers in the past. Earlier this year, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> admitted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-developer-says">getting the game ready for Microsoft's lower-powered Xbox Series S would be a "challenge"</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">Baldur's Gate 3 famously released several months later on Xbox</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-xbox-version-still-coming-but-compromises-may-have-to-be-made">difficulties with split screen co-op</a> on the Series S console.</p><p>Things are looking up for Series S owners, however. Recently, the Stalker 2 team said it hopes to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/stalker-2-xbox-series-s-pc">provide a performance mode at 60fps</a> at some point for its upcoming release on the Series S console. While it hasn't promised anything at this time, developer GSC said: "We think it's possible."</p>

<p>"I think it's going to be something truly special and I can't wait to play more of it. It's shaping up to be a wonderful love letter to Indiana Jones, just like Rogue City was to Robocop, and anyone who counts themselves a fan of the movie trilogy (there's definitely only been three movies, don't know what you're talking about) should definitely have this on their radar," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-3-hours-of-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-it-nails-the-films-whip-cracking-sense-of-adventure">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A second crack at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> isn't something EA is looking into at the current time.</p>
<p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson chatted to investors last night, during the company's quarterly earnings call. Here, Wilson was asked about the company's live-service efforts, and the next season of Respawn's shooter, Apex Legends.</p>
<p>The EA exec said the "level of innovation and creativity has to continue to scale with the community over time" in order to "maintain growth, and not just maintain size". He noted Apex is in "an incredibly good position" within the live-service market, with a "strong brand, a really strong mechanic, and a very committed global community".</p>

<p>EA understands a "need for meaningful systematic innovation that fundamentally changes the way the game plays", the exec continued, stating the development team is actively working on realising this. When further asked if EA and Respawn would consider an "Apex 2.0" or "a whole studs-up rebuild", Wilson said current trends show a second go at something typically doesn't perform as well as the original.</p><p>Said Wilson: "Typically, what we have seen in the context of live service-driven games at scale is, the 'version two' thing has almost never been as successful as the 'version one' thing. And so actually the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global player base that we have, and deliver them new, innovative, creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they've made or the investment that they've put into the existing ecosystem.</p>
<p>"Anytime we cause a global player community to have to choose between the investments they've made to date and future innovation and creativity, that's never a good place to put our community in."</p>
<p>Wilson said EA and Repsawn's objective is to "continue to innovate in the core experience [as shown in Apex Legend's seasons], and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers". The exec said the team believed it "can do those two things together", and it doesn't "have to separate the experience in order to do so".</p>
<p>Wilson's comments bring to mind Blizzard's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> series. Despite huge popularity for the original, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-the-moment-overwatch-1-died-forever">pulled Overwatch as it was out of service</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/so-far-overwatch-2-is-a-clever-but-underwhelming-free-to-play-compromise">replaced it with the free-to-play Overwatch 2</a>.</p>
<p>On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-apologises-still-working-on-overwatch-2-launch-woes">Overwatch 2 users were left unable to play for long periods</a>, stuck in queues, left without access to previously-unlocked characters and items, or locked out of the game entirely by the requirement to log-in using their mobile phones.</p><p>This year, things remain lukewarm for the rejigged shooter, and in February <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-is-revitalising-the-overwatch-2-experience">make "major changes" to Overwatch 2</a> as part of a "revitalisation" of the shooter that hoped to "make PvP gameplay more rewarding and fun", as well as "provide greater transparency for players in-game". In May, the developer announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-pve-mode-dropped-after-just-three-months">remove the Hero Mastery Gauntles PvE mode from the game three months after it launched</a> as it hadn't "resonated with players".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Pocketpair has released a set of seriously spooky&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>Halloween skins, with four of the game's Pals getting terrifying new looks just in time for tomorrow's scarefest.</p>

<p>The update sees Cattiva, Croajiro, Katress, and Pengullet getting different Halloween-themed looks, although in the case of Pengullet, the new skin might be stretching the definition of Halloween a touch.</p>

<p>Cattiva gets a new pumpkin-themed skin, while Croajiro gets an adorable-looking witch outfit. Katress gets some fetching spectacles to complement its already-Halloweeny look, and Pengullet gets a pirate costume. I guess pirates are sort of scary!</p>

Aww.</figcaption></figure><p>All four of these skins are completely free of charge, and you should receive them the next time you boot up&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, although naturally, you will need to have at least one of the Pals the skins are for in order to reap the benefits.</p>

<p>It's not just the Halloween skins that are coming as part of this update, either. The multiplayer text chat character limit has been "significantly relaxed", so you can now type longer messages to your friends.</p>

<p>Bug fixes, including memory leak patches and a fix for a strange PS5-specific issue wherein a tree would respawn inside a structure that's built over it, have also been implemented. The update is free to download now, so make sure you check it out.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's an open-world survival game with a focus on creature-collecting and base-building.</p>

<p>Developed by Japanese studio Pocketpair, the game was released earlier this year to massive success, passing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet">the 25 million player mark</a> just a month or so after its release (although a day-one Game Pass release certainly didn't hurt those numbers).</p>

<p>The game has been remarked upon for its creatures' apparent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-show-more-pokemon-like-mayhem-how-you-cook-them">resemblance to Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, and Nintendo itself has also apparently been taking notice; the gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">is suing Pocketpair</a>&nbsp;for "patent infringement".</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011027" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can play it as part of Xbox Game Pass if you're a subscriber. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton">mobile version is also apparently in development</a> at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton.</p>

                <p>Google is in big (fake) trouble right now, as a Russian fine against it has ballooned to $2.5 decillion over the last couple of years. In case you're wondering, that's $2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 when written out with all 33 zeroes, and when converted, 2 undecillion Russian Rubles. The reason for this astronomical sum being levied against Google? The company blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda channels on YouTube, its video-hosting platform.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/29/10/2024/671fd2389a794726b01d3af3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RCB</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/russia-has-fined-google-usd2-500-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-or-more-money-than-actually-exists-on-earth-all-because-its-upset-about-some-youtube-channels/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Russia originally issued a fine of 100,000 Rubles four years ago after the media outlets Tsargrad and RIA FAN won their lawsuits related to YouTube's channel restrictions, and under state law, the fine doubled for every week that it wasn't paid. The channels were part of the Patriot Media Group that was headed by former Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died last year in a mysterious mid-air explosion after his short-lived rebellion against the Russian military leadership.</p><p>That initial fine has ballooned into something impossible to pay off, even for Google, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/alphabet-google/net-assets/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which has net assets of over $300 billion</a> as of June 2024. It'd probably need to sell several trillion YouTube Premium subscriptions to get enough cash, but it's highly unlikely that it ever will, nor will it likely pay any of the fine. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Google stopped advertising in the country and its Russian subsidiary declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter.</p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine had massive ramifications for several games in development, but for one of the most heavily impacted, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornorbyl</a>, the finish line is drawing close after a turbulent period of development.

			<p>A new Red Dead Redemption comparison shared online a few hours ago highlights the differences between the PC and console versions of Rockstar Games' glorious open-world game, which finally made its debut on PC 14 years after its original release.</p>
<p>The comparison put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@geracaopowerup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geração Power Up</a> puts the PC version of the game side by side with the Switch and the Xbox 360 versions of the game, highlighting how the biggest improvement is the higher resolution, which returns a sharp image quality over the other versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption - Graphics Comparison (PC, X360 &amp; SWITCH) | 4K ULTRA HD" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qQqnp3l8hE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption being essentially the same on PC as it is on consoles, at the very least, ensures it runs well on a variety of system configurations. An RTX 4070 GPU, for example, is capable of running the game at 8K resolution with the help of NVIDIA DLSS at playable framerates, as highlighted in a new video by MxBenchmarkPC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption PC | RTX 4070 8K, 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.7 Frame Generation | PC Performance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rjk6a9CTrEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To see proper visual improvements in Red Dead Redemption PC, we will have to wait for mods. A stunning visual overhaul called <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality Redemption</a> will soon be released for the new version of the game, bringing improvements such as better reflection quality, draw distance for vegetation and map, particles and particle count, and more.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Xbox consoles via backward compatibility.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-q2-2025-financial-results</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-enjoys-record-q2-thanks-to-live-service-games.1023033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-q2-2025-financial-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has enjoyed its most successful second quarter in history, largely thanks to the performance of the company's sports games portfolio.</p>

<p>According to the company's latest <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Q2-FY25-Earnings-Slides-FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial results presentation</a>, the $2.1 billion in net bookings EA raked in this year sets a record for Q2, with live service games like&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana">driving 74%</a> of those bookings.</p>

<p>The studio notes that its American football offerings are "on track to exceed $1 billion in net bookings" for this fiscal year, demonstrating just how savvy a decision it was for EA to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-deal-covers-4-games">get back into the college football gaming space</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-dive.jpg?itok=zZkZ3aR_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-dive.jpg?itok=-SSBYdR6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA is having a pretty good year so far, and it has its sports offerings to thank for that.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just sports games, though;&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>is also part of what's made the year so successful for EA so far.</p>

<p>The free-to-play life sim has apparently drawn in more than 15 million players over the past year, although EA doesn't go into detail about how many of those players stuck around or bought anything within the game with real-world cash.</p>

<p>Still, those numbers will likely give EA a good reason to be proud of its decision <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">not to pursue&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a>&nbsp;</em>and to focus on development on&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>instead.</p>

<p>It's also no surprise that it's mostly live service offerings that are driving EA's success so far this fiscal year. Since the beginning of April, EA has released precisely one non-live service game,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>, and that clearly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice">hasn't had the impact</a> the publisher had hoped it would.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-ea-financials.jpg?itok=IVWA_k27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-ea-financials.jpg?itok=JKu0qDwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA has released one non-live service game so far this fiscal year, and it doesn't seem to have done much to contribute to revenue.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that the reporting period for this fiscal presentation ends on September 30th, which means that whatever sales&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>manages to achieve</a> will be counted in the figures for the third quarter.</p>

<p>EA's record quarter comes after the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">laid off around 5% of its workforce</a> back in February (which technically falls under last fiscal year), cancelling a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>first-person shooter in development at Respawn in the process.</p>

<p>Those layoffs didn't stop CEO Andrew Wilson from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">making more than $25 million</a> last year, but given today's results, I guess we now know why EA's board is so keen on Wilson.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-halloween-run-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Techland has revealed what’s next on Dying Light 2’s expansive roadmap – a special, limited-time event called ‘Halloween Run’. This event will be delivered alongside update 1.19, and it broadens the Tower Raid mechanic, adds special spooky characters, and introduces new rewards and shop items, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Players dedicated to the game will be able to purchase two new bundles – Cursed Pirate and Count Skull, both of which are bursting with cosmetics that you can don to celebrate Halloween.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-get-spooky">Get Spooky</h2>



<p>From October 30 to November 20, Dying Light 2 players can participate in an extended Halloween event that’s open to even the newest players just starting their adventure in Villedor.</p>



<p>Each week, Techland will add new features and activities to Dying Light 2, just to keep things fresh. This content injection introduces a terrifying Tower Raid loop, new bounties themed on Halloween, and more cosmetics and new rewards than you can shake a pumpkin (?) at.</p>



<p>Players taking part in the Tower Raid can pick from four unique classes, each of which has traits specific to that character. It boosts the replayability factor of Halloween Run, which is great for players hungry to grind. </p>



<p>With Patch 1.19, the Techland team has also introduced a new control scheme that makes controlling firearms much more satisfying and intuitive. That’s along with the typical quality-of-life improvements and community-led changes that you’d expect with an update like this.</p>



<p>In the patch notes, Techland confirmed that some of the most niggling issues in Dying Light 2 have been addressed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Co-op spawning in Tower Raid</li>



<li>Broken quests and soft lock issues</li>



<li>Improved physics for certain heavy skills</li>



<li>Tweaked filter presets</li>



<li>Replaced missing dialogue and subtitles in some quests</li>
</ul>



<p>Are you looking forward to sinking your teeth into Dying Light 2’s Halloween Run update? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to use a weapon in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> that is easy to control and has enough bullets to go on a killing spree, then you must choose the XMG. It’s an LMG and here are the best attachments, Perks, and Equipment you can use along with it to make a solid loadout.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-xmg-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-xmg">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-xmg">Best Secondary for XMG</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-xmg-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock XMG</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-xmg-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the XMG any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-xmg-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-xmg-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best XMG loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Infiltrator Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>Unlike other weapons where five attachments are more than enough, I recommend using eight attachments for the XMG – thanks to the Gunfighter Perk. </p>



<p>Start with the <strong>Kepler Microflex</strong> as it’s clean enough to land your headshots accurately. The <strong>Suppressor</strong> suppresses the gun sound and also hides you from the mini-map.</p>



<p>The <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> will greatly increase the damage range and bullet velocity of the XMG thereby improving the weapon’s firepower. The <strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will slightly increase Sprinting Movement Speed and Horizontal Recoil Control.</p>



<p>Yes, the <strong>Fast Mag II</strong> will significantly reduce the ammo capacity of the magazine but in return, you are getting quicker reloads, better ADS, and Sprint to Fire Speeds. The <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> comes in handy with a further improved Aim Down Sight speed.</p>



<p>Combine that with the <strong>Infiltrator Stock</strong> and your Aim Walking Movement Speed will also increase significantly while using the XMG. Lastly, <strong>Recoil Springs</strong> will be the cherry on top as it slightly improves both horizontal and vertical recoil of the LMG. </p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-xmg">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for XMG</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Combining <strong>Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time</strong> will activate the <strong>Enforcer</strong> Specialty as it grants a temporary buff to movement speed and health regeneration rate – a combination that goes well with the XMG</p>



<p>For the Wildcard, use <strong>Gunfighter</strong> as it will enable you to use eight attachments on your XMG. The sacrifice you’re making here is letting go of the fourth Perk slot (Perk Greed helps you achieve that) but it’s worth it.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shot</strong> should be your go-to Equipment choices here for quick damage and health recovery. Lastly, keep the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> and place them wisely for cheeky free kills.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-xmg">Best Secondary for XMG</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the XMG are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-xmg-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock XMG in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the XMG by reaching <strong>player level 13</strong> in Black Ops 6. This should be fairly easy as it won’t take a lot of time to unlock the weapon and you can start leveling it up early in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-xmg-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the XMG any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Despite the XMG being a heavy weapon, you get a very fast TTK from it. On top of that, controlling the weapon is easy due to its low recoil, allowing you to easily spray down enemies at long ranges.</p>



<p>The only downsides of this weapon are its slow mobility and ADS speeds but the attachments I’ve recommended above should get that sorted.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-xmg-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the XMG in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If the XMG is too much for you, then the best alternatives are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS VAL</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a>. These two weapons are two of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Assault Rifles in BO6</a> as they are ruling the meta right now, offering fast TTK similar to the LMG.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has released its first-ever blockchain game, the tactical <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a> battler Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-first-ever-blockchain-game">company announced the game last June</a> after years of dabbling in blockchain, but has only now quietly launched it.</p>
<p>The game is on PC and free to start, though players can purchase figurines with which to battle using either in-game gold or cryptocurrency. These figurines are NFTs and can be bought on the <a href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace?sort=price_desc">game's marketplace</a> from anywhere between $7 to $64,000 (almost £50k).</p>

<p>It appears to be possible to play the game without purchasing figurines, though those willing to pay the extortionate prices will surely have more success in battles.</p>
<p>Battles themselves are turn-based affairs against other players with squads of three figurines.</p>
<p>Francois Bodson, studio director at Ubisoft Paris, told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game">IGN</a> the game "offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations", comparing it to a physical trading card game.</p>
<p>Here's the statement in full: "The team inside the Ubisoft Paris studio developing Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles partnered with Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab and Oasys to ensure that our use of blockchain was done in service of delivering new and innovative gaming experiences for our players. Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership. Champions Tactics offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations. These include millions of procedurally generated figurines, each with distinct stats, assets shaped directly by players' choices, and an open marketplace letting players compose their teams on a peer-to-peer basis - much like a physical trading card game. For months, we have collaborated closely with our community through events and beta phases to build and refine Champions Tactics. We’re excited to keep expanding and enhancing the experience together."</p>
<p>Ubisoft did not comment on the game's Adults Only rating, presumably for its blockchain basis and use of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Back in December 2021, Ubisoft launched its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quartz-is-an-energy-efficient-nft-platform-for-aaa-games">NFT platform called Quartz</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</a> Breakpoint as the first game to offer a beta trial. It did not fare well, appearing to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts">initially only sold 15 NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-nft-bosses-say-players-just-dont-get-it">Ubisoft's NFT bosses stated in an interview afterwards</a> that players just "don't get it".</p>
<p>It's interesting, therefore, for Ubisoft to have still released this project, considering other developers have slowly backpedalled on their enthusiasm for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>That includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-seemingly-backtracks-from-earlier-nft-enthusiasm">EA boss Andrew Wilson</a>, after describing NFTs as "an important part of… the future of our industry".</p>
<p>"I believe that collectability will continue to be an important part of our industry and the games and experiences that we offer our players," he later said during an earnings call in February 2022.</p>
<p>"Whether that's part of the NFT and the blockchain? Well, that remains to be seen. And I think the way we think about it, is we want to deliver the best possible player experience we can. And so we're going to - we will evaluate that over time. But right now, it's not something that we're driving audience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo subsidiary Mario Club Co., Ltd. isn't laying off employees.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a report from Japanese outlet <a href="https://leakpress.net/2024/10/74/">Leakpress</a> claimed Mario Club Co., Ltd. was letting go of approximately 150 of its 400 employees. It was said the layoffs were happening across various groups within the company.</p>

<p>However, in the time since this initial report, Nintendo has debunked these claims. In a statement provided to Eurogamer, a Nintendo spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"We have confirmed with Mario Club Co., Ltd. that the rumoured information in the report is untrue."</p>
<p>Mario Club Co., Ltd. is a game-testing and debugging team for many of Nintendo's games. Its credits include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/princess-peach-showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> and Super Mario Bros.

<p>The initial report claiming layoffs at Mario Club Co., Ltd. said the condition was a little different from so-called 'eviction rooms', which is something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-reportedly-cuts-japanese-workforce-but-denies-pressuring-voluntary-leave">Bandai Namco was recently accused of</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was reported Bandai Namco staff were not being laid off directly, but were rather being sent to rooms with nothing to do. Essentially, the company was said to be putting pressure on staff to resign voluntarily, to avoid having to formally lay them off.</p><p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, yesterday the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-wii-u-exclusive-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-coming-to-nintendo-switch">company announced Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, a souped up version of the acclaimed 2015 sci-fi action-RPG released on Wii U, which will bring enhanced visuals and more on its Nintendo Switch release next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
