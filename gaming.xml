            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/daily-rewards-coming-back-to-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a post published on social media by a Call of Duty dataminer, it was suggested that a daily rewards system could be coming to Black Ops 6 when season three drops in March. The season is expected to bring back Verdansk in Warzone for the first time since 2021, so it makes sense that teams are anticipating ways to retain players to make the comeback much more worthwhile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-day-new-rewards">Every Day, New Rewards</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 doesn’t feature a daily login bonus system – even the free rewards periodically unlocked in the store have been paltry. Most players report getting endless strings of Double XP tokens and nothing else, whereas in previous games, players could get charms, sprays, calling cards, and emblems, all for free.</p>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1895867334948241728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post from realityuk_</a> on Twitter, that might be set to change.</p>



<p>While the dataminer has uncovered nothing more than a menu and a prompt, it’s enough to assume that daily rewards are coming back when season three hits later this month.</p>



<p>In one image, Reality found a ‘Daily Login Reward’ pop-up that read:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To earn all rewards, log in on 7 seperate days before unclaimed rewards expire.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This hasn’t been addressed or even alluded to by the teams working on Black Ops 6, and as it’s a datamined asset, it’s worth taking the imagery with a pinch of salt. These things are always subject to change, unfortunately.</p>



<p>It’s nice if it’s true, though. Despite the state of Warzone right now, the return of Verdansk is guaranteed to bring players flooding back, and nothing makes players happy like free items.</p>



<p>It was suggested recently by a Call of Duty leaker that Verdansk is returning to Warzone as ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/">pretty much the OG version</a>‘ that was released in 2020. That was when Warzone was created, becoming one of the most popular battle royale games in history as tens of millions of players flocked to the title.</p>



<p>Will you be taking advantage of free daily rewards if they come to Black Ops 6? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>PlayStation's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">recently cancelled Twisted Metal game</a> was reportedly a battle royale.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/cancelled-twisted-metal-live-service-a-battle-royale-featuring-out-of-vehicle-combat">MP1st</a>, the abandoned game - known internally as Project Copper - allegedly blended third-person shooting mechanics alongside the vehicular combat the series is known for.</p>

<p>How do we know this? A UI programmer working at Firesprite from April 2022 to October 2023 has <a href="https://www.hugoflsilva.com/project/1">uploaded</a> obscured screenshots from the work-in-progress to their portfolio. Whilst the game isn't explicitly mentioned and the images are blurred, you can nonetheless still see early prototypes of the third-person action both in and out of vehicles.</p>
<p>"I was part of Project Copper leading the UI team," the developer wrote on their online portfolio. "I was tasked with creating a generic UI system to be used in multiple projects in the company, I was also managing a team of 2 UI Programmers while working with other teams."</p>

<p>As for the game itself? The dev describes Project Copper a "third person vehicular action combat game based on a classic IP owned by PlayStation developed by Firesprite (PlayStation Studios)".</p>
<p>"It had third person shooter mechanics wrapped with third person vehicle combat with the objective of being the last one standing," they added.</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects cancelled, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">including two more in January</a>.
</p>
<p>In related news, just last week, Peacock shared its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-twisted-metal-season-two">first trailer for the second season of Twisted Metal</a>. The upcoming second series stars Anthony Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz, Joe Seanoa, Will Arnett and Anthony Carrigan.</p>
<p>"As they try to survive an onslaught of dangerous new foes and familiar faces alike, including the murderous clown Sweet Tooth, things get complicated for John when he reunites with his long-lost sister, the vigilante Dollface," reads the official blurb.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Warhorse has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-will-get-official-mod-support-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> official mod support&nbsp;<span>for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 soon, but in the meantime, modders continue to find ways to improve the highly successful first-person open world role-playing game that just celebrated selling</span>&nbsp;two million units in the first two weeks.</p>
<p>Nexus user nimbul recently <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a utility mod that loads configuration (CFG) variables correctly even after level loading. Without it, the game reverts to default variables. Thanks to this mod, Nexus user vktrfly worked on those variables to improve the global illumination quality in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with great results</a>, as you can see in the screenshots and the footage below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>According to the modder, the following two variables can be used to further enhance indirect lighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>e_svoTI_DiffuseConeWidth = 4 ; Reduces light leak, default is 8</li>
<li>e_svoTI_NumberOfBounces = 2 ; Medium performance impact. Default is 2 at Ultra and above</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter can go up to 3 but will have a greater performance impact and may not be worth it, according to the author. Still, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-polished-impeccable-smoothness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is extremely well optimized</a>, so users with the latest GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards may be tempted to try it - especially if they are subscribed to PureDark's Patreon and can, therefore, access his DLSS Multi Frame Generation mod for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 - RTX5090 nearly REALLIFE GRAPHICS - third Person Gaming ASMR" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sb84_c3iKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is a downside, however: this global illumination mod cannot be used in conjunction with the previously covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-async-compute-mod-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Async Compute mod</a>. The author wrote:</p>
<p><em>If you encounter strobing, flickering, or pulsing lighting effects, they are not caused by this mod. Make sure you are not using AsyncCompute Enabler and e_svoTI_AsyncCompute = 1 is not in your user.cfg. AsyncCompute causes issues with global illumination, and Enhanced GI makes those issues extremely apparent.</em></p>
<p>Warhorse is currently preparing <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's first free content update</a>. Scheduled to launch in Spring, it will add barbers to change Henry's look, horse racing, and a proper Hardcore mode. Later this year, three premium DLCs will also be released.</p>

While news of <em>Legends: Z-A</em> was very welcome, what was not mentioned—nor ever rumored to be mentioned—was Pokémon’s next mainline entry. And yet, based on the pattern of the last decade-and-a-half, this should have been the day we learned of a new core title in the world’s most popular franchise, and got our first few hints about a whole new generation of pocket monsters.

Following Warner’s mishandling of so much talent and so many otherwise reliable franchises, the creatives who made great games like the <em>Middle-earth </em>series have now been caught in the crossfire. One deeply frustrating wrinkle in this is that one of Monolith Productions’ greatest claims to fame has been patented by the same company that just shut down the studio. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-middle-earth-nemesis-system-patent-1851766437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-middle-earth-nemesis-system-patent-1851766437">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="43ccf1ba9cd6f04288fc24f775371936" data-recommend-id="image://43ccf1ba9cd6f04288fc24f775371936" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43ccf1ba9cd6f04288fc24f775371936" data-recommend-id="image://43ccf1ba9cd6f04288fc24f775371936" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What is a role-playing game?

With stints working at big-name studios like Valve and Arkane, Antonov’s work was a key part of some of the most loved games of all time. It was his unmistakable style that defined <em>Half-Life 2</em>'s City 17 and <em>Dishonored</em>’s Dunwall, two of the most distinctive and unforgettable locations in game history. We spoke to people who knew and loved him to learn more about Antonov and his work. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/viktor-antonov-half-life-2-dishonored-artist-obituary-1851765954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/viktor-antonov-half-life-2-dishonored-artist-obituary-1851765954">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="194bb21b9b1121933768ab65bc86d19f" data-recommend-id="image://194bb21b9b1121933768ab65bc86d19f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Two Point Studios / Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="194bb21b9b1121933768ab65bc86d19f" data-recommend-id="image://194bb21b9b1121933768ab65bc86d19f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/two-point-museum&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/two-point-museum"><em>Two Point Museum</em></a></span><em>—</em>out March 4 on PC and consoles<em>—</em>is the latest game in the <em>Two Point</em> series of wacky British business simulators.

<p>Raven Forge have announced two brand-new full-scale replica swords from Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Both Yasuke’s Wakizashi &amp; Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;from Assassin’s Creed Shadows are <a href="https://ravenforge.com/collections/the-raven-forge-legend-collection-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available now for pre-order</a>, with Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;costing £139.99 and Yasuke’s Wakizashi costing £199.99. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first full-scale replica from Raven Forge on Assassin’s Creed either, as late late year the company announced&nbsp;a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-scale-replica-of-assassins-creeds-altairs-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-scale replica of Assassins Creed’s Altaïr’s Sword</a> from the original game.</p>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-s-wakizashi">Yasuke’s Wakizashi&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The wakizashi, a revered sidearm of the samurai, was traditionally worn alongside a katana—a symbol of status, duty, and skill. This exceptional replica features an intricately wrapped faux rayskin handle and saya (scabbard), custom menuki (handle ornaments), and a tsuba inspired by the crest of the Oda clan. Every detail has been thoughtfully recreated to bring Yasuke’s weapon to life.</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 670mm<br>Blade Length: 500mm<br>Grip Length: 170mm<br>Blade Width (base): 30mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 776g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></p></div>



<h2 id="h-naoe-s-tanto">Naoe’s Tantō</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A weapon of both practicality and prestige, the tantō served as a trusted sidearm of the samurai and was also wielded with remarkable skill by the Onna-musha, the warrior women of feudal Japan. This faithful reproduction features a beautifully wrapped faux rayskin handle, ornate menuki (handle embellishments), and a strikingly detailed saya (scabbard).</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 430mm<br>Blade Length: 295mm<br>Grip Length: 128mm<br>Blade Width (base): 26mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 425g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel&nbsp;<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></strong></p></div>



<p>You can <a href="https://ravenforge.com/collections/the-raven-forge-legend-collection-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pre-order both swords at Raven Forge here</a>.</p>

Here's a quick summary:</p><ul><li>Chapter 3-5: Monster Hunter is the conclusion of the story proper.</li><li>When you're done with the story, quests become more free-form. You simply need to take out targets and complete quests so you can continue to increase your Hunter Rank.</li><li>Upon reaching Hunter Rank 20, you're given the Wyvern Sparks and Rose Thorns mission, which takes you back to the Ruins of Wyveria.</li><li>This leads you to a battle against a Lala Barina that you're tracking, as well as a Guardian Fulgur Anjanath, the first Tempered Monster type that you encounter.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452184"></a><figcaption>Tempered Monsters are scarred veterans of countless battles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="How_to_track_down_Tempered_Monsters">How to track down Tempered Monsters</h3><p>The Monster Hunter Wilds Tempered Monsters offer the most difficult bouts in the game. These creatures are battle-hardened, as you can see by the scars and old wounds on their bodies. They're tougher compared to normal variants, so don't underestimate them.</p><p>If you plan on tracking down a Tempered Monster, you can do so by opening the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/monster-hunter-wilds-world-map-biomes-regions/2900-6290/" data-ref-id="2900-6290"><strong>world map biomes</strong></a> to see which ones are currently active in a particular location.

These are used to craft Artian Weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds--i.e. rank 6, 7, and 8 (currently the highest tier in the game).</p><p>Once you've collected enough materials, talk to Gemma at your base and select the Forge Artian Weapons option.

If all three materials have different properties, then the result will be a non-elemental gear piece.</li><li>Example: 2x Thunder and 1x Sleep results in a weapon with the Thunder element. However, if you pick 1x Thunder, 1x Sleep, and 1x Dragon, then the combination would yield a non-elemental result.</li></ul><p>It's also worth noting that weapon categories require different part classifications:</p><ul><li>Great Sword - Requires 2x blade and 1x tube.</li><li>Long Sword - Requires 1x blade and 2x tube.</li><li>Sword &amp; Shield - Requires 1x blade, 1x tube, and 1x disc.</li><li>Dual Blades - Requires 2x blade and 1x disc.</li><li>Hammer - Requires 2x disc and 1x tube.</li><li>Hunting Horn - Requires 1x disc and 2x device.</li><li>Lance - Requires 1x blade and 2x disc.</li><li>Gunlance - Requires 2x disc and 1x device.</li><li>Switch Axe - Requires 2x blade and 1x device.</li><li>Charge Blade - Requires 1x blade, 1x disc, and 1x device.</li><li>Insect Glaive - Requires 1x blade, 1x tube, and 1x device.</li><li>Light Bowgun - Requires 1x tube and 2x device.</li><li>Heavy Bowgun - Requires 1x disc, 1x tube, and 1x device.</li><li>Bow - Requires 2x tube and 1x device.</li></ul><p>That does it for our Monster Hunter Tempered Monsters and Artian Weapons guide. Once you've crafted a couple of these high-end armaments, keep eliminating tougher creatures so you can continue to increase your Hunter Rank.</p><p>Soon, rarer and more difficult Tempered Monsters will appear. Of course, this also means that you'll be able to create rank 7 and, eventually, rank 8 gear pieces.</p><p>Need more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?

            <p>Once Human's cross-platform test for PC and mobile is now live.</p>
<p>Running from now until 30th March, players in Europe, Japan, and North America are able to jump into NetEase's free-to-play PvPvE sandbox action horror before the mobile port - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">back in September</a> - launches in April 2025 and test the "seamless" cross-progression features across PC and mobile.</p>

<p>"Once Human's cross-platform test uses the current global server environment that's being used by the PC version of the game," NetEase explains. "This means that all of the content from the PC version, including all the Scenarios and the Visional Wheel/Lunar Oracle, can be experienced by mobile players throughout the test."</p>

<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates.</p>
<p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its Steam Next Fest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671570/Out_and_About/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> has all the bright colors and cheerful local people you’d expect of the genre, but the core of the game is surprisingly realistic, asking you to correctly identify various real-life plants.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Out and About - Short Steam Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3lqJUUH76B8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>At the start of the demo, a storm destroys the town where you’re visiting your grandmother. On your way from your campsite you meet the local forager, who tasks you with finding plants to heal an injured resident. Developer Yaldi Games says the game contains over 100 real-world plants; each one you find grows next to one that looks very similar. Some of these similarities are no big deal–the consequences of mixing up chamomile and daisy are fairly minor–but others have toxic lookalikes, like hemlock and yarrow.</p><p>The plant identification mini-game is pretty simple: after taking a photo of your finds (<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alas</a>), you’re given two cards with clues to each plant’s identity. Verifying which plant is which involves clicking around on the plant until you check the various details listed on the card. Then, you can harvest the plant, taking care not to take too much of its flowers and leaves. You’re also tasked with sorting the plants you’ve collected, which presents a slightly harder identification game that only gives you bits of cuttings and less clues. None of it is too taxing, but I really enjoyed studying the game’s renditions of real plants and learning about their uses.</p><p>You use the plants you’ve gathered to craft–in the demo, you make a stinging nettle soup, a green I’ve sometimes seen at the farmer’s market and never understood why people buy, and which I am now really curious to use; thanks, video games! You sell the stuff you craft at the local market, where customers come to you with various needs that can be met by your snacks, balms, and medicines. Again, it’s not too hard, but it’s fun to think about what might be best for the townsfolk from your stock. Yaldi writes that “All 150+ recipes in the game are real, and we'll give you step-by-step instructions on how to make them at home,” which sounds very cool. (The game also opens with a giant-font warning that it is not a guide to real-life foraging, which feels like a very necessary caveat.)</p><p>Aesthetically, <em>Out and About</em> looks like the kind of game I tend to find a little too twee, but your mileage will vary there given your own personal tastes. In a press release, Yaldi described itself as having "a mission to craft hobby games infused with real, actionable knowledge that enriches players' lives." I’m intrigued by that claim to fidelity and really enjoyed what I experienced of it in the demo. The full game is set to release later this year.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman"><h3>Major Publishers Can’t Keep Making Fewer, Bigger Games</h3></a><p>"Destined to fail.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO announced earlier this year that we'd be getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-movie-lego-sets-gives-insight-into-which-mobs-will-appear-in-the-jack-black-film">new Minecraft Movie sets</a>, and the time has finally come for them to be released into the world. There are four new Minecraft sets that you can now buy, with two of them featuring scenes from the upcoming film. These new sets are added to an ever-growing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-minecraft-sets">list of LEGO Minecraft sets</a> that have been accumulating over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the new Minecraft Movie sets features minifigure mobs, but only two of the sets offer up a tiny Jack Black as Steve. You can currently purchase all of these sets from Amazon, LEGO direct, or any of the other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-sets">best places to buy LEGO</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New LEGO Minecraft Sets Available Now</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Although there are four new LEGO Minecraft sets coming out, the two that are associated with the movie are The Ghast Balloon Village Attack and Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring. Both sets give us an idea of what to expect from the upcoming film. The Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring depicts some sort of gladiator style battle with Jason Momoa fighting a baby zombie on a chicken. Meanwhile the Ghast Balloon Village Attack set reveals a marshamallow-like villain from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Nether">Nether</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other two Minecraft sets that are releasing are The Parrot Houses and The Trial Chamber. For more like these, you can check out more of our favorite LEGO Minecraft sets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Does the New Minecraft Movie Come Out?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO tends to release new sets tied to movie releases about a month before the actual release of the film. The new Minecraft sets are following the same timeline by coming out on March 1 seeing as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/a-minecraft-movie">A Minecraft movie</a> is hitting theaters on April 4, 2025.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will There Be More Minecraft Movie Sets?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So far the two sets we've featured above are the only ones set to release alongside the film. It's possible this could change if the live-action Minecraft movie is a success. Either way, there are new LEGO Minecraft sets released fairly consistently and we can likely expect more to release later this year, even if it isn't directly tied to the movie.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-my-favorite-pop-albums-is-a-video-game-%E2%80%94-and-now-it%E2%80%99s-on-the-ps5.1122756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/621706/sayonara-wild-hearts-ps5-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Of all of my favorite games, <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> might be the hardest to describe. It’s a rhythm game, but also you ride on a motorcycle and a dragon, wield giant swords while dodging fireballs, and teleport to a retrofuturistic VR world. It’s structured like a pop album, telling a story of love and loss, and is narrated by Queen Latifah. It’s <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> meets <em>R-Type</em> crossed with <em>Rhythm Heaven</em> as directed by Carly Rae Jepsen. It makes sense once you play it, trust me.</p><p>This was all true <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882183/sayonara-wild-hearts-interview-switch-ps4-apple-arcade-simogo">when the game first launched in 2019 on the Switch and PS4</a> (it was also on Apple Arcade, but has since been removed). But now is a good time to check it out if you haven’t. The game just launched on the PS5 — it’s a free upgrade if you have it on PS4 — which adds some performance improvements and a new endless mode called remix arcade that you can read more about <a href="https://simogo.com/work/sayonara-wild-hearts/sayonara-wild-hearts-remix-arcade/">here</a>. Really, though, the new platform is just an excellent excuse to dive back into this world.</p><p><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> follows the story of a young heartbroken woman who is transported to an alternate realm where she must restore harmony by collecting lots of hearts. To do this, you play through a series of 23 short levels, doing everything from racing through city streets to fighting biker gangs to flying amid the ruins of a destroyed city. It’s an arcade-style game, where you’re racing through levels in search of a high score (which you get by collecting hearts and other items), and most of what you’re doing is in time to the beat of the dreamy pop music that plays throughout.</p><p>The game only lasts around two hours, but it packs so much into that space. What you’re doing is <em>constantly</em> changing. Vehicles shift from skateboards to motorcycles to cars to human flight to dragons, and there are about a half dozen different styles of games, from old-school arcade shooters to early 3D platformers to racing games. Almost all of those genres are then filtered through the lens of rhythm action, for a twitchy experience that feels very cohesive. It’s also pretty approachable. If you keep failing a section — like me during any of the first-person driving sequences — you have the option to simply skip it and move on.</p><p>Just as important, <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> is incredibly stylish. The dream world is slick and beautiful, rendered in pinks, blues, and purples, with characters that dance as they fight and, uh, mechs made out of robotic wolves. It’s as weird as it is cool, and it’s carried by an incredible pop soundtrack from composers Daniel Olsén and Jonathan Eng, alongside vocalist Linnea Olsson. It’s all bangers, and I’m listening to it right now as I write this story.</p><p>Just like a great album, <em>Sayonara</em> is something I find myself coming back to again and again. I’ve replayed it several times over the last six years, and each time, I’ve been struck by just how bold it is. Those feelings haven’t been diminished over time. It helps that it’s just the right length so you can easily soak it all in.</p><p>If you haven’t heard of <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> before, you might be surprised to learn that it comes from Simogo, the same Swedish studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam">last year’s cryptic noir puzzler <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a>. If you <em>have</em> heard of Simogo, well, then nothing will really surprise you. The studio’s games have covered everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/21/4013456/year-walk-iphone-ipad-vision-quest-game">folklore horror</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/21/4013456/year-walk-iphone-ipad-vision-quest-game">audio dramas</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/17/4844472/device-6-iphone-ipad-report">interactive spy novels</a>. It’s an eclectic lineup, but also one that’s impressively consistent and inventive, and <em>Sayonara</em> might just be the team at the height of its creativity.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
