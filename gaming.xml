			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is a smashing good time. With Pauline clutching onto the fur on his back as the pair race to the centre of the world, you’ll be rampaging across the landscape of each level, slapping rock-encased enemies around, and dig-punching yourself in a gluttonous frenzy of screen-filling button mashing as you search for the moreish bananas that DK goes ga-ga for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review –&nbsp;Oooh! Banana!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA7cS_bLuLA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s been an awfully long time since the last Donkey Kong 3D platformer –&nbsp;he literally only had Rare’s Donkey Kong 64 collectathon to his name –&nbsp;and gaming tech has moved on such that this is a completely different feeling game. Having experimented lightly with voxel deformation in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, Nintendo EPD Tokyo has now made this a core part of Donkey Kong Bananza, changing everything from how the world appears visually, to how DK can get around, and how you can transform the levels just by smashing stuff.</p>


<p>It’s utterly rambunctious stuff, letting you punch and smash through the world and enemies alike. You’ll feel a bit naughty as you do so. Should I really just be cutting a straight line to the banana-shaped sonar pulse? Isn’t there a hardworking level designer in Japan who’s shedding a tear because I’m ignoring the carefully designed, visually signposted path through to the next story beat? Am I not “breaking” the game by clipping the camera through the world and then filling the screen with shards of rock, gold, and glass as I hammer the punch and jump buttons?</p>


<p>In truth, this must be exactly what Nintendo intends. Arguably, just as with the chaotic messiness of Mario Kart World’s larger world and races, there’s some key areas here where Nintendo is giving in and accepting that this is just going to be a messier style of platformer. They’ve designed around that, ramping up the dopamine hits with more regular collectable Banandium Gems to find, more upgrades and costumes to unlock, more opportunities to branch off for another punch-filled frenzy, another challenge level, before returning to the main path and getting distracted again two seconds later. As intentional as this is, you can easily get lost in the underground button-mashing, the camera flipping back and forth between obscuring the world outside with a foggy haze and revealing it with a no clip-like view, and the tunnelling becoming overwhelming until you stop, take a breath and try to figure out how to get back outside.</p>
<p>As indulgent as the digging and deformation can be, DK still plays with all the natural, effortless control that you’d expect from a Nintendo platformer, it’s just that instead of that coming in the form of triple jumps, hat twirls and dives, DK’s movement is more about lumbering in a chosen direction, no matter what’s in the way. He can just clamber up vertical surfaces with ease, getting up and over in fast and fluid fashion, even if he’s holding a big chunk of rock in his hands, unless there’s spiked vines, lava or something slippery that he can’t grip onto. Add to that forward tumbles, unlockable skills like double jumping off a rock, and there’s a good deal of core 3D platforming to master.</p>

<p>And then there’s the Bananza transformations. Learned from the towering Elders that lead each underground animal tribe, Bananza transformations give DK big and bold new abilities. It starts with Kong Bananza, who’s basically just a bigger and smashier version of DK, but you quickly get Zebra Bananza for speedy running across soft surfaces other forms fall through, Ostrich Bananza who can glide and drop egg bombs, and goes on from there. Kong Bananza is the go-to form for much of the game, almost universally appropriate in combat, for souped up digging and when you need to get a bit meaner. The other forms are often better suited to areas and challenges designed specifically for them, and I rarely used them outside of that. Yes, the Zebra’s faster, but since I’ll need to recharge the Bananza meter once I’ve used this form for a bit, I might as well just rock surf or take a few extra moments to get where I’m going.</p>
<p>And where we’re going is deep down to the planet’s core in a race against the Void Crew. A trio of devious Kongs, they crash DK’s own mining operation down to a sublevel of the world, inadvertently pairing him up with what turns out to be a younger version of Pauline, whose powerful singing is what transforms DK each time. She’s the only English-speaking character in the tale, though her Bananza songs are gibberish and sound like a cross between Splatoon and Patapon’s Fever song. She’s a great addition, though, and while her motivations are still pretty basic, she adds a little more heart to the tale when DK’s just dreams about bananas.</p>

<p>She’s also there to provide the co-op mode, handing her shouting and control over transformations to a second person, whether locally using pointing or mouse mode, a second switch with GameShare, or online via GameChat. We’ve only tried out the same-console co-op. Her shouting manifests itself as rocks, but can also absorb other materials, and this works really nicely to support the main player. It’s an experience that lands somewhere between the co-op modes of Super Mario Galaxy and Odyssey. Joy-Con 2 mouse controls also get a workout in the sculpting DK Artist mode available from the main menu, sculpting and painting.</p>
<p>As the pair journey on, heading to the planet’s core to have their dreams made true, they find that the Void Crew has cursed each level with some kind of plight, leaving impediments and enemies to get in your way. Combat brings us back to that almost mindless bludgeoning. Most enemies have got an outer shell made of one of the world materials, and this really highlights some of their interactions.</p>

<p>DK can easily clobber his way through soft sand to get to a golden enemy skeleton inside, but it will take a bit more hitting to get through stone –&nbsp;which means you need to watch for attack timing. But if it’s concrete, nasty spiky vines, or even lava, you need a different approach, ripping up chunks of harder materials out of the ground, throwing rocks or even explosive materials at them to bust through their armour. While that changes how you approach them, Donkey Kong Bananza does lean pretty heavily on these material variants of half a dozen basic enemy types. It does get a bit repetitive in that regard.</p>
<p>You also feel that with the boss battles. Some are just straight up punchathons that can last moments in a flurry of Kong Bananza’s fists, while others have a more traditional three-part structure, or are best tackled with a particular Bananza form. But you’ll face most of them two or three times as you work down the world’s levels, and I think that’s part of why a portion of the game’s final third felt a bit stretched out to me, in addition to the need to make more use of certain Bananza powers.</p>

<p>But on the whole, the game’s pacing and variety is great. For the more traditional stages, you start off at a round 100th level, reach a village or meet an Elder, and then branch off to tackle objectives that can take you one or two sublevels below, changing the tone, adding more challenge and variety as you go. But that’s not true of every layer, and there’s some great change of pace moments and environments that are wholly unexpected, beyond the variety of mini challenges that you find around each world. And did you say cameos? Yeah, there’s a few of those too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-absolutely-smashing-but-can-it-beat-mario-odyssey.1244856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>Even though it confirmed my suspicions, the reveal that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> was coming to us from the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> couldn't help but strike a <em>little</em> bit of fear into my heart. We know that the group within Nintendo EPD is a talented bunch, but how was I ever going to be able to fully throw myself into another 3D adventure, with the all-timer 'Jump Up Superstar' sequence lurking at the back of my brain?</p>
<p>This was my overwhelming thought as I made my way through Bananza's opening layer. It was all fantastic, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd seen these slick moves and shiny object hunts before, albeit with a touch more punching this time around.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 1 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157291/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And then it happened. Rather than following the suggested approach, I ripped up a chunk of earth, solved a puzzle in a way that I never expected to work, and laughed as DK goofily ooh'ed and ahh'ed at the reward. On the surface, Donkey Kong Bananza has more than a little Odyssey in its DNA, and the comparisons are on display right from the jump; but once I dug beneath, I realised this is the devs swinging for something more chaotic, more destructive and — dare I say it — at times, more entertaining. Simply put, it's the most fun I've had with a platformer in years.</p>
<p>DK storylines generally go as deep as 'Big monkey loses big banana hoard', and Bananza doesn't stray a million miles from that format. While mining for Banandium Gems (Are they rocks? Are they fruit? I'm still not sure) on Ingot Isle, ol' DK has his collection ripped from him before being plunged underground by the Void Company, a mining operation bent on reaching the planet's core to have their deepest desire granted.</p>
<p>It doesn't make too much sense, but nor did a sentient cap with eyes, so stay with me here. Keen to catch up with the terrible trio and get his bananas back in the process, DK stumbles across Pauline — the artist formerly known as OddRock — who assumes the position of back companion and quickly learns that she can assist the titular tie-wearer through the magic of... song.</p>
<p>The pair dive through a series of underground worlds, or Layers, in pursuit of Void Co., collecting straggling Banandium Gems, helping out the locals, and picking up shape-shifting Bananza Transformations from huge underground Elders on the way, all in the hope of reaching the core first.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 2 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157297/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a simple, if somewhat ridiculous, set-up that only really comes into its own in the game's later stages, but it provides a strong enough backbone for the gameplay, and <em>that's</em> the important part.</p>
<p>Much like Odyssey's cap-throwing, Bananza has a big new mechanic to get to grips with in the shape of DK's fists. Equipped with nothing more than his primate palms, DK can punch, dig, and throw just about anything that he can see through the magic of Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dk-bananza-devs-needed-to-know-more-about-donkey-kong-so-they-went-to-miyamoto">voxel tech experimentation</a> — which you might remember from the cheese digging in Odyssey's Luncheon Kingdom. Bananza wastes no time introducing you to this newfound strength, with the opening tunnels of Ingot Isle serving as little more than a demonstration of just how much you can smash. And boy, did I put it to good use.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 3 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157286/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>To my own detriment, my first hours were spent doing just this. I <em>couldn't</em> bring myself to follow the mission marker because what if there was something under my feet? Nintendo's promise of everything being destructible holds true (mostly), and there's a certain dopamine hit to be had in levelling a cliff face just for the sake of it, but it quickly loses its impact if that's <em>all</em> you're doing.</p>
<p>And I think Nintendo knows this. I eased up on the 'Punch' button, put DK's smoking fists back in their holsters, and started to see Bananza differently. Because yes, everything <em>can</em> be broken, but that doesn't mean everything <em>should</em> be. Each layer is set up not to be destroyed, but to be explored, and I soon learned that while the odd Fossil or Treasure Chest may be waiting underground, the real attraction lies in the creativity on top.</p>
<p>When you put the digging to one side, DKB <em>is</em> all about the platforming. DK has a silky smooth moveset, consisting of three directional punches, a jump, a roll, and a hand slap. Oh, he can also climb just about any vertical surface in front of him. If that sounds pretty pared back, it is, but there's sweetness in that simplicity.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 4 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157293/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can roll, jump, and roll again to clear more ground, rip up a chunk of earth and surf on it, then throw said chunk into the ground to double-jump all without pausing for thought. Bananza has a fast travel system, but I found it much more enjoyable to take the scenic route on foot.</p>
<p>That's not to say that digging and punching don't have their place — they are absolutely the headline mechanic — but if, like me, you feared Bananza would be nothing more than a smashathon, you can rest easy knowing that it's quite the opposite.</p>
<p>You see, each layer brings a new idea about <em>how</em> DK should use his surroundings. Whether it's surfing over slime in the mud-filled Hilltop Layer, growing paths in the Forest Layer, or pulling up chunks of floating Liftoff Ore in the Resort Layer, each level of DK's early descent demonstrates another way to get around, with none sticking about for long enough to become frustrating.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 5 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157279/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>All of these introductions serve their purpose, too. The second act feels like Nintendo firing on all cylinders to up the inventiveness, and it uses your base understanding of the game's ruleset to showcase even wackier ideas. Part of the joy is finding out how these all work yourself, but rest assured that by the end, the uncanny Bananza Transformations will feel like old news compared to some of the originality on display.</p>
<p>Would you look at that, I made it 1,000 words in before touching on the abomination that is DK's Bananza forms! In truth, I never warmed to the sight of Donkey Kong melded with an ostrich or a zebra, but the devs needed to work in Mario's Power-Up prowess, and the time limit given to each transformation meant I didn't have to look them in the eye for long.</p>
<p>Kong Bananza is your Hulk-like big hitter and can crush just about any material with ease. Zebra Bananza is all about speed, and Ostrich Bananza can momentarily fly through the air when you inevitably see something shiny glimmering in the distance.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 6 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157296/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At first, each form felt a little too overpowered, particularly in the early boss fights, which are proper blink-and-you'll-miss-'em affairs if you have the right power-up equipped. Fortunately, things calm down in the later game and into the post-credits content (of which there's <em>a lot</em>), where the transformations feel like more of an integral piece of the puzzle than an OTT superpower for a quick insta-win. Heck, the difficulty of some of the later challenges, particularly the boss fights, had me wishing for that earlier sense of ease.</p>
<p>What's more, they feel strangely at home in Bananza's world. Walking the same path as Odyssey, each layer down to the planet's core presents a different flavour of off-the-wall weirdness. There are ice cream-loving zebras who all talk like frat boys, googly-eyed 'Fractone' rocks that look like they've been swept off the Rare cutting room floor, underground eels that will spit you between layers like a slimy Tube train. And DK reacts to it all with such a wonderful range of expression. He'll shiver in cold areas, sweat in hot ones, and you'll want to pay particular attention to how his interactions with Pauline shift as their relationship changes. No, <em>you're</em> crying at an idle animation.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 7 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157285/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>All of this means that each layer is a pleasure to explore, which is a relief, because they are packed, and I mean <em>packed</em>, with things to do. Odyssey's Power Moons are succeeded by Banandium Gems picked up in main story missions or by exploring the surroundings. Battle and Challenge Ruins crop up on every corner, too, shuffling a certain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> Shrine-esque pit stop into the proceedings, and occasionally calling out specific DK touchstones like Mine Cart Madness or Bramble Blast to brilliant effect.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, Bananza's score is wonderful — stay with me for this quick musical sidebar. The atmospheric environmental tunes are one thing, but Pauline's Bananza songs are some of the catchiest damn bops I've heard from a game for a long time, which is a relief, because you'll hear them every time you want to transform (you can turn it off in settings if that's not your jam, don't worry). I dare you to listen to Kong Bananza <em>without</em> throwing in a little shoulder shimmy whenever you hear the main riff. And yes, much like those aforementioned Challenge Courses, there are musical cameos aplenty, so make sure you've brushed up on your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Country</a> music — and we don't mean Dolly Parton — before diving in.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 8 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157282/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, back to those bananas. The Gems serve their in-game purpose well enough — collect five to unlock a Skill Point, which can be used to level up DK's stats, Bananza Transformations, or grant some bonus abilities — but we all know they're <em>really</em> there to encourage exploration. Nintendo has crafted gorgeously detailed worlds, and it would feel like a waste if all I did with them was dig. Instead, the collectibles encouraged me to scour every corner and speak to every NPC, all while keeping things completely optional for those who'd prefer to storm ahead with the main quest. There's no 'Collect XX Bananas to power up the Odyssey' to see here.</p>
<p>I picked up around 600 gems throughout my roughly 35-hour playthrough (it would be <em>much</em> shorter, had I not been such a fiend for shiny collectibles), and I know that even more are still waiting. That's not to mention the Fossils, Smashin' Stats, and Outfits, all of which are calling me back for that sweet 100% completion.</p>
<p><em>And then</em> there's the entirely optional sculpting DK Artist mode, which gobbled up more of my time than I was expecting in my crude attempt to build DK a Waluigi hat. The tools are deeper than I had imagined, and it's nice to see Mouse Mode in action, though it doesn't add much to the overall experience other than the worrying thought of what people will do with that poor banana model. Still, it's a nice little addition.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 9 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157283/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I spent the majority of my time playing solo, but you can bring a pal along for the ride to make the collectathon that bit more manageable. The co-op is more Mario Odyssey than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">3D World</a>. Player two stays tethered to DK as Pauline, and is on hand to dish out attacks and pick up collectibles.</p>
<p>It's a perfectly pleasant time playing with two adults — even if the option to have <em>both</em> players control the camera feels like a mistake — but it really feels designed for a parent-child paring, where a less-experienced player can still be part of the adventure without having to worry about all the pesky platforming and punching. You can even try this out between Switch 2 and Switch 1 systems via the magic of GameShare, though I wasn't able to test this during the review period. Elsewhere, an Assist Mode accessed from the menu at any time can make DK's health last a little longer and point you in the right direction. There are also tools for button remapping, language options for Pauline's dialogue (though the text language is set at a system level), and subtitle toggles.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 10 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157292/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, Donkey Kong Bananza is a prime example of the Switch 2's beefed-up performance, running at a smooth 60fps for <em>most</em> of the time, with some genuinely stunning vistas and a nice touch of that swanky 3D audio thrown in for good measure — you'll hear the gramophone of a safe Getaway and know exactly which direction to head. The destruction left in DK's wake is permanent (until you leave the layer or opt to reset the terrain, that is), and while the environments don't obey the real-world laws of physics to the letter — you can punch through the base of a tree and the rest of the trunk will remain standing — some sections see hundreds of objects, each with their own physics, realised on screen at once, lifting the lid on a new console generation in style.</p>
<p>It's truly impressive stuff, but there are some hiccups along the way. More intense digging sequences see the camera get a little squiffy as it tries to realise DK <em>without</em> showing the underground areas around him. Distant textures lose their detail, and speeding towards them reveals pop-in aplenty. And, when you really put the game through its paces in the later layers, where new paths are being created, destroyed and moved all at the same time, the frame rate takes a noticeable dive before springing back.</p>
<p>All that said, it didn't come close to ruining my experience. This is an ambitious game where you can head in any direction at any time, make or break new routes to your will, and tear up the terrain knowing full well that the damage will still be there next time you come back.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 11 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157295/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So, can I say that Donkey Kong Bananza is <em>better</em> than Super Mario Odyssey? No, I can't. And honestly, what is? But if you loved Jumpman's planet-hopping adventure, you'll have no shortage of smiles on this underground descent.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play. The punching and crashing is a passing novelty that, once you get your fill, quickly becomes just another way of exploring the wonderfully varied and beautifully presented layers.</p>
<p>Whether it's smashing through the scenery with a Bananza Transformation or carefully planning a route to a hidden Banandium Gem, you'll have trouble finding more originality and, crucially, more enjoyment from a platformer in recent years. As the DK Rap so wisely said, "Donkey Kong is here." Now let's just hope he stays.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neverness-to-everness-second-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-gacha-anomaly.1244853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Judging from its current immense popularity, the gacha RPG genre isn’t going anywhere. If anything, it's going to become even bigger, as games like HoYoVerse's Genshin Impact have proven how there's a rather big audience for ambitious and immersive open-world RPGs powered by gacha mechanics. Back in 2021, Chinese studio Hotta Studio tried getting into the trend with Tower of Fantasy, which provided a competent open-world experience featuring a solid visual design and gameplay, but failed to become a worldwide phenomenon due to issues that inevitably impacted the good the game has to offer, such as a confusing user interface, average balancing which renders some characters useless after a certain point in the adventure and some technical issues. Still, Tower of Fantasy proved Hotta Studio already had what it takes to create a compelling open-world gacha RPG back in 2021, and the experience made developing the game is going to serve Neverness to Everness well, judging from the second closed beta test.</p>



<p>Doing away with the fantasy setting with sci-fi elements of Tower of Fantasy, Neverness to Everness is set in the futuristic metropolis of Hethereau, where the amnesiac main character finds themselves after a Level VII anomaly disaster strikes New Helios. Possessing special abilities that allow them to deal with the strange occurrences known as Anomalies, the main character agrees after spending time in prison for observation, to participate in Code Zero containment operations, joining the Anomaly Hunter team at Eibon Antique Shop. Just from this premise, it's clear how the game has been heavily inspired by the latest entries in the Persona series, as the episodic, almost short anime show narrative arc, nature of the story, the character interactions and the Anomalies being not too dissimilar from the Shadows are clearly based on the ATLUS series. Though the second closed beta test only features a small part of the story, the episodic format works great to develop the overarching story while providing some self-contained, anime-styled fun, although the comedic situations and banter between characters sometimes diminish the unique, almost horror, feel that the vast majority of investigations possess. Thankfully, this isn't a major issue, at least for now, as the characters, although a little bit on the tropey side, are charming and personable, thanks to great design and animation works, and a decent spread between male and female characters, which tends to be a little unbalanced towards the female side in a good portion of the most popular games around.</p>



<p>As a gacha RPG lives and dies by how charming characters are, Neverness to Everness already seems to have everything needed to become a success, but I expect the setting and the open-world mechanics to become the defining feature of the game. When the game was revealed, it was often described as anime Grand Theft Auto, and this definition is not too far from the truth, although the opportunities to be a criminal are limited compared to the Rockstar Games series. Still, the police will start looking for you if you start stealing cars left and right, and in the game's current state, don't expect to be able to get away from officers too easily, as they put up quite a fight. Aside from committing crimes, Hetherau offers a lot of different side activities already, which include purchasing and managing businesses, car races, Spacetime Projector missions, where players need to rewind recordings of incidents to pinpoint the exact moment an Anomaly has appeared, hunting hidden items, and so on. Considering this is only the beginning for the game, the open-world mechanics and activities show a lot of promise.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Besides spending a lot of time roaming around Hetherau, players will spend quite a bit of time fighting Anomalies in Neverness to Everness using a big cast of characters. In this regard, the game looks promising as well, with a functional yet simple combat system which incorporates elements from character action games like perfect dodges and parries without feeling overwhelming, although the system would benefit from some additional depth, as the moveset of many of the characters available in the closed beta featured some interesting fighting styles that could have incorporated more than a special skill, an Ultimate and a basic single-button combo string. The room to grow and expand the combat, however, is definitely there, so hopefully the developer will provide a slightly deeper experience down the line. Character customization also feels to have potential with the Arcs system, which grants passive skills to characters, and a unique "artifacts" system that has the player slotting Tetris-like pieces to further enhance a character.</p>



<p>As for every similar game, however, it's the fairness of the gacha mechanics that can make or break the experience, and in this regard Neverness to Everness definitely has what it takes to be successful, as unlocking characters and leveling them up to use them in current content without any trouble promises to be less painful than in other games. Sure, there are still rolls and multiple currencies to keep track of, but players are guaranteed to get an A-Class item within 10 rolls, and an S-Class character within 90. Better yet, if multiple S-Class characters are available as part of one of the virtual tabletop boards, which represent the traditional banners seen in similar games, the player can choose which character they want, which is a great option that will likely make Neverness to Everness an extremely player-friendly gacha.</p>



<p>Neverness to Everness might not revolutionize gacha RPGs, but it shows how much more engaging and polished these games are becoming. The urban open world has a lot of potential with satisfying traversal and varied side activities,, and the overall presentation feels closer to what you'd expect to find in full-priced title. While there's still work to be done regarding performance, balancing, and speed of traversal on foot. Neverness to Everness definitely has the chance to become one of the best gacha games of the past few years.</p>

						<h5>Donkey Kong Bananza</h5><p><span>July 17, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Despite being the franchise that started it all for Nintendo, Donkey Kong has never been as meticulously managed as, say, Mario or Zelda. For decades, DK was largely entrusted to teams outside Nintendo’s core Japanese development structure, with the likes of Rare, Retro Studios, and the occasional third party offering their own varying spins on the franchise. That said, between a major role in the recent Super Mario Bros. movie and new Universal Studios attractions, it seems clear Nintendo is interested in returning Donkey Kong to true top-tier franchise status. As part of this, Nintendo is rolling out <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, a new Switch 2 3D platformer from the EPD Tokyo team behind the likes of Super Mario Odyssey.</p>



<p>Does Donkey Kong Bananza see Nintendo’s ape swing to new heights? Or does this one go Donkey Wrong? Time to dig into DK’s latest…</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It seems DK has become more of a go-getter since his last original platformer, as Donkey Kong Bananza opens with him leading a mining operation, as he uses his fists to dig up “Banandium Gems” (this game’s equivalent of Mario Odyssey’s Power Moons) and scads of sparkly “Banandium Gold.” Unfortunately, a villainous crew of apes, known as VoidCo, crashes a meteor into DK’s mine, sinking all its precious treasure (and DK himself) further underground.</p>



<p>DK initially teams up with a funny little creature named Odd Rock, although it’s soon revealed the stony sidekick is actually Pauline (that’s not a spoiler, as Nintendo has heavily promoted her in trailers and PR materials). In previous games, Pauline has played the role of Donkey Kong’s unfortunate kidnapping victim and, later, the stylish Mayor of New Donk City, but here, she’s a somewhat naïve 13-year old who dreams of becoming a singer. DK and Pauline soon learn that getting back to the surface actually requires them to go deeper, down to the “Banandium Root,” which is said to grant wishes. And so, a journey to the center of the planet, through many colorful and strange locales, begins.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was quite surprised, pleasantly so, by how much attention Donkey Kong Bananza paid to its characters and story. The new DK and Pauline models are bursting with skillfully-animated energy and the two make a charming pair, both in big cutscenes, and during more low-key moments. DK Bananza has a system of “getaways” where you can rest and recharge your heart meter, and each time you go down for a nap you get to overhear fun, sometimes poignant, snippets of conversation between Pauline and her simian companion (DK sticks to grunts, but Pauline is fully voice acted). Pauline even has a nice little character arc, starting out unsure of her singing abilities then gaining confidence as the game progresses.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And yes, while I’ll provide no spoilers here, if you’re perplexed about some of the mysteries Nintendo have presented, like, say, why Pauline is a precocious tween now, I can confirm some actual answers are offered. Nintendo has a history of simply shrugging at continuity, and while I’m sure there are things that still don’t fit, Bananza ties into other games, and the greater Donkey Kong lineage, in ways I think will satisfy, and perhaps surprise, fans. Donkey Kong Bananza is a fulsome celebration of the franchise’s long and storied history.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for how Donkey Kong Bananza plays, our hairy hero doesn’t just use his fists to smash baddies anymore, he can now use them to plow into the terrain with a large portion of most environments being destructible. DK can punch forward, downward, and up, as well as slam down from above after a jump. Additionally, he can grab chunks of rock and dirt to throw, swing, or use as a handy surfboard, and can clamber up pretty much any vertical surface. It's a versatile set of tools for traversing and shaping the world, which makes Donkey Kong Bananza almost feel like a mixture of Super Mario Odyssey and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>



<p>Granted, it may take some players a while to get used to the feel of DK Bananza’s minute-to-minute gameplay. Bananza’s actual platforming is rather rudimentary, particularly in the early stages of the game. DK only has a single, relatively limited jump, and many of Mario's more advanced tricks like wall jumping aren’t present here. Really, the game is often more of a <em>climber</em> than a traditional platformer, with much of the game’s traversal revolving around your near-unlimited ability to scale most surfaces (although you will encounter a few smooth or slick surfaces you can’t get up). This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but again, it's something you may have to adapt to. This isn't just Mario with a gorilla skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another thing that sets DK Bananza apart are its destruction mechanics, which allow you to smash most of what you see (down to an underlying hard base layer underneath most stages) and yes, it’s quite satisfying. You can tunnel your way into hills and rock formations, creating your own tunnel systems or, alternatively, rip up pieces of soft dirt and stick them together to make new bridges and other structures. Of course, everywhere you dig is positively chock full of all manner of goodies, including Banandium Gems, Banandium Chips, collectible fossils, treasure chests, and lots and lots of gold.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Admittedly, sometimes this freedom to smash whatever you want can make the game feel a bit messy. Often I’d find myself digging into the ground when I just wanted to attack an enemy, and the camera can sometimes be a bit unruly once burrowed in there. There’s also an odd visual issue I encountered fairly often where most of the environment would disappear into a purple-ish void for a second. I think this is related to the digging mechanic – most of the background is <em>supposed </em>to disappear when you’re fully immersed underground so as to eliminate visual clutter, and it seems like there are moments where the game detects you as being underground for a moment when you’re really not. It isn’t a huge deal, but it is a rather distracting issue in what’s otherwise a very visually-polished game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to DK’s core moves, you’ll also gradually unlock various Bananza forms, which allow you to transform into a muscled-up version of DK, a fast-dashing zebra, a flying (yes, flying) ostrich, and other animals. These transformations are on a timer, after which, you need to collect more gold to reactivate them. As such, Bananza forms aren’t as deeply integrated into level designs as, say, Mario Odyssey’s Cappy transformations. Most of the time, you can get by just playing as vanilla DK, with only certain obstacles – a fragile bridge you need to run over as Zebra DK here, an air-vent you can glide on as Ostrich DK there – requiring a transformation.</p>



<p>Most of the Bananza forms are fairly fun to play as, although that doesn’t mean they’re all created equal (I definitely have my favorites). DK Bananza also takes a surprisingly long time to introduce challenges that require switching between multiple forms – most of the game’s main stages are based around a single Bananza form. In addition to the various transformations, DK Bananza also introduces some light RPG elements, including a skill tree that allows you to upgrade your capabilities and an array of unlockable outfits that confer upgradable buffs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This version of DK is certainly a resourceful guy with a lot of different abilities to keep track of, but, of course, all the skills in the world don’t matter if a game doesn’t have good levels to put them to the test. Thankfully, Donkey Kong Bananza delivers on that front. DK Bananza is divided up into multiple descending layers, with DK diving between them in a similar fashion to how Link plunges into the Depths in Tears of the Kingdom. Most layers are further divided into multiple sublayers, with players sometimes having to travel up and down in order to access certain locations. A number of these individual sublayers are as large and complex (maybe even larger in some cases) as the biggest Kingdoms in Mario Odyssey. It all adds up to a world that feels more interconnected, and notably more complex, than Mario Odyssey's.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Individual layers run the gamut from more typical jungle, icy, and grassy plains settings, to more original themes, like one based around a full race track and even more out-there examples I can’t discuss at the moment. Even the more predictable level themes usually have some quirky twist that set them apart (like the fact that the artic layer is inhabited by desert-loving, parka wearing zebras for some reason).</p>



<p>Graphically, DK Bananza is a hearty feast for the eyes, with nearly every layer standing out as visually unique, impressive in scope, and packed with fun details, big and small. There are some layers that are arguably a bit over-busy, with efforts to create something original resulting in some clashing visual elements (think the Luncheon Kingdom from Mario Odyssey taken to another level) but these stages are the exception. By and large, DK Bananza is an impressive-looking game that usually runs well on the Switch 2 hardware, with only occasional performance issues during particularly frantic boss battles.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thankfully, DK Bananza’s stages aren’t just varied and nice to look at, they’re also plenty of fun to play. That feeling of there being a secret or unique challenge around every corner you got in Mario Odyssey returns and is taken to a new level. Almost every layer of the game offers some sort of unique gameplay mechanic, some of which are truly wild and wonderful, like the glowing rocks you pluck in the Resort Layer that send you hurtling into the sky or the seeds from the Forest Layer that produce creeping vine bridges.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It should also be said, unlike Mario Odyssey, which took a relatively laid-back approach to progression, DK Bananza offers a more structured core campaign replete with a continuous series of missions, big cutscenes, and lots of boss fights. While there's certainly still plenty of room for aimless exploration, those looking for a game with more of a core driving force will find it here. Almost all the main campaign missions are fun, balancing unique challenges, epic moments, and a nicely-balanced level of difficulty. If there's one somewhat weak aspect of this core campaign, it may be the bosses, with many early ones being trivially easy and later ones becoming more challenging in a sometimes-frustrating way. That said, there are still some good boss fights in the game, they're just not as consistent as they could be.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza’s core campaign is certainly substantial – even with a fairly lean and focused playthrough, it took me around 16 or 17 hours to roll credits. Of course, like Mario Odyssey, there’s a seemingly-infinite amount of extra stuff to collect and some specific incentives for doing so. You're going to be tallying everything Bananza has to offer for some time.<strong></strong></p>

					<h2>Donkey Kong Bananza</h2>

						<section>
				<p>Donkey Kong Bananza doesn’t monkey around, as it’s inarguably the biggest, most ambitious 3D platformer Nintendo has ever produced. Taking the formula established by Super Mario Odyssey as a starting point, Nintendo goes deeper, wilder, weirder, and punchier. Donkey Kong Bananza is perhaps a bit less refined than the near-immaculate Odyssey, but if you can overlook a few minor brown spots, this banana is very much worth peeling.</p>

            <p>Publishers Krafton have told workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds they would still get a promised bonus if they ship enough of the game by the end of 2026. In other words, they've been given an extension to hit their targets. The bonus money was in question after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">the surprise firing of senior staff</a> a couple of weeks ago, and the enforced delay of the survival game by Krafton. After worker concerns and fan outrage, now the corp says "don't worry, we'll pay!" Although it's not the huge $250 million they were originally supposed to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?">Bloomberg</a> says the sweetener would include a $25 million payout to be shared (unequally) among roughly 40 specific developers at the studio. All other workers would meanwhile get a bonus paid this year, an advance on the "projected 2026 profit-sharing bonus pool". Although the amounts involved for those employees isn't specified.</p>
<p>It's a big wad of cash. It is also just one-tenth of the $250 million Krafton were due to pay out to the studio if it achieved certain sales figures by the end of 2025. So a relative bargain for the South Korean corporation. The reasons for all this are muddy. So let's go mudlarking.</p>
<p>In 2021 the studio were bought by Krafton for $500 million, with a further $250 million "earnout" promised if the studio hit a certain level of revenue by the end of 2025. The bulk of that earnout would be claimed by the leadership at the studio, who've since said they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/">planned to share some of that money</a> with other employees. Meanwhile $25 million of the earnout was ringfenced for the 40 employees mentioned above, with each getting a different sum, "most in the six or seven figures" according to paperwork seen by Bloomberg.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With all that cash at stake, things went wrong. Subnautica 2 was due to come out this year. Studio co-founder Charlie Cleveland <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">believed the game was "ready for early access"</a>. Krafton disagreed. They wanted more work done on it. Naturally, whoever lost this argument would potentially lose quite a bit of dough. Presumably at an impasse, Krafton pulled out an axe and decapitated the studio heads Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max MacGuire, and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">claim that they abandoned their duties</a>. The publisher installed Steve Papoutsis, a producer from Striking Distance (another Krafton studio) as new CEO, then publically delayed the game until 2026.</p>
<p>This left remaining workers concerned they too wouldn't see their promised bonuses. But Krafton have now extended their deadline by a year, until the end of 2026, says Bloomberg. Seems promising for those who'll benefit, although we haven't seen what Krafton consider as "ready" for release, nor know if it's achievable in that year.</p>
<p>Basically, it looks like Krafton understand that they have created a legal and financial headache for themselves - the three ousted devs are now suing the publisher, for one thing. They now look to be throwing some money at the problem. If one were inclined to think like a spreadsheet-brained corporate entity, one would surmise that as long as said throwin' money soothes current staff and does not exceed the $250 million they have been avoiding so far, it will all work out in the green. </p>
<p>It's a dirty mess soaked in cash, and it will likely get dirtier in court. Earlier this week, a document was "leaked" on Reddit that purpotedly showed how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">Subnautica 2's scope was reduced in the last two years</a>. Krafton still haven't responded to our question asking if they themselves were the source of this leak.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The third season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation is slated for release in 2027.</p>
<p>That's coming from HBO's CEO Casey Bloy, who in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-casey-bloys-the-penguin-season-2-the-last-of-us-future-1236461127/">Variety</a> said the third season "is definitely planned" for 2027. Meanwhile, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbo-expects-the-last-of-us-to-run-for-four-seasons">there has been previous chatter about the show running for four seasons</a>, this third outing may well in fact be its last.</p>
<p>"[Showrunner Craig Mazin] is still working it out whether it will be two more seasons or one more long season," Bloy said. "It hasn't been decided yet, and I'm following Craig's lead on that."</p>

<p>Bloy's comments come after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from The Last of Us TV series</a> to move his complete focus back to the studio.</p>
<p>"Obviously it was great to have Neil involved in the beginning. The whole reason that I wanted to do Last of Us is after Chernobyl, I said to Craig, 'what do you want to do next?' And Last of Us was what he wanted to do," Bloy said when asked about Druckmann's decision to step back from the show.</p>
<p>"That's what was most important to me, Craig's creative excitement about the show. It was fantastic to have Neil involved. A lot of people don't realise that Neil has a full time job creating video games and running <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>. It's a really big job that he's got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that. But I believe he's given us a good blueprint with the show. And obviously Craig is a pro, so I think we'll be in excellent shape.</p>
<p>"I'm not worried at all."</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is expected to be a record-shattering game that will generate over $7 billion in revenue in its first 60 days of availability.</p>



<p>In a new post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8">LinkedIn</a>, Josh Chapman, Managing Partner at Konvoy, an investement firm focusing on the video gaming and interactive entertainment industry, shared some predicitons on the sixth entry in the series by Rockstar Games, confirming the firm predicts that the game will generate $7.6 billion in revenue in the first 60 days of availability, and Take-Two Interactive will break even on the $2 billion investement into the game within 30 days of release. Grand Theft Auto VI is also expected to be a record-shattering game in terms of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time, player count and viewership.</p>



<p>Long before we knew when Grand Theft Auto VI would come out, many have predicted it will be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, so it will be very interesting to see if it indeed will indeed be the monumental release everyone expects it to be and if it will manage to go even beyond the boldest predictions. One of the records GTA VI already shattered, however, is likely to remain unbroken for a long time. The game's development costs will likely continue to remain the highest for an entry in the series, as Grand Theft Auto 7 is expected to cost less to make, as a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-most-expensive-gta-7-ai/">development work is going to be taken over by AI.</a></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on May 26, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

While <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has been optimized for a variety of Macs, from early M1 models up, if you want the top “very high fidelity” config then you’ll need an M3 Ultra or M4 Max machine with 36GB of unified memory.</p><p>CD Projekt Red is using dynamic “for this Mac” presets that will assign settings and resolutions based on your Mac’s hardware. M1 Macs will be able to run <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, as long as you have 16GB of unified memory. That gives you the “minimum” config, which runs at 1440 x 900 resolution or 1600 x 900 (using MetalFX dynamic resolution scaling) with a target performance of 30fps.</p><p>If you want 60fps then CD Projekt Red is recommending an M3 Pro or higher with 18GB of unified memory, which will run at 1080p resolution (using MetalFX DRS) with a target of 60fps. You’ll likely be able to achieve 60fps by dropping the resolution below 1080p on some older Apple silicon hardware, though.</p><p>The remaining “high fidelity” and “very high fidelity” configs will be reserved for some of the most powerful Apple silicon chips. High fidelity requires an M2 Ultra or M3 Max chip with 36GB of unified memory, and will enable 60fps gameplay at 1440p with MetalFX DRS. Very high fidelity is reserved for M3 Ultra or M4 Max chips with 36GB of unified memory, and will also deliver 60fps gameplay at 1440p with MetalFX DRS enabled.</p><p>None of the “for this Mac” presets enable ray tracing by default, though. If you want to play around with ray tracing then <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2897/ray-tracing-on-mac">CD Projekt Red recommends</a> an M3 or newer chip. An Apple M3 Pro device with 18GB of unified memory will be able to handle the medium ray tracing preset at 1080p (with MetalFX DRS) and 30fps. If you want <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> ray-traced at 60fps on Mac then you’ll need an M3 Max or higher chip with 36GB of unified memory, which will run the medium ray tracing preset at 60fps at 1080p with MetalFX DRS.</p><p>AMD’s FSR upscaling and frame generation will also be available in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Mac, so it’s possible with a mixture of settings you’ll be able to find an even sweeter spot for playing this game on a Mac than the presets provide. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> will be available from Apple’s own Mac App Store, Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.com on July 17th, and the game supports cross progression across all platforms.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708100/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements-modes-ray-tracing]]></content:encoded>

        <p>According to their own "rules and standards"</p>

            <p>Valve have updated Steam's rules and regulations to prohibit games that "may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam's payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers". And in particular, "certain kinds of adult only content". In other words, they are giving banks, ISPs and credit card companies some degree of control over Steam's definition of acceptable "adult only content". All of which potentially has rather dramatic ramifications, given that banks and payment companies have a track record for pressuring platform holders to nuke what they deem to be NSFW material.</p><!--more-->
<p>The new rule appears on Steam's <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5">onboarding page for developers</a>. I've verified that it was recently added using the ole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250217163251/https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5">Internet Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
<p>Valve's policy towards "adult content" and what separates this from pornography has always been rather foggy, partly because humans in general struggle to agree on what "adult" and "pornography" really mean. For a time, the platform holders tried to enforce a no-porno approach. This came to a head - probably not the best choice of words, so let's swiftly and humorously add "of steam" - in 2018, when Valve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-threatening-removal-of-visual-novels-with-adult-content-some-authorised-years-ago-say-mangagamer">issued a bunch of rather arbitrary warnings</a> to various developers and publishers, demanding that they edit "pornographic content" out of games that ranged from horror sex comedies to puzzlers that are arguably far less raunchy than, say, the wham-bam scenes in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>Following an outcry, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1666776116200553082">announced</a> that they were stepping back from the enforcement of definitions around porn and adult content, and would instead focus on equipping players with tools and systems for labelling and filtering anything they'd rather not see. The current Steam rules require adult content to be "appropriately labeled and age-gated". Still, Valve continue to intervene to remove "adult" games that, for example, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-steam-rape-day-controversy-how-it-became-a-scandal-and-why-its-further-testing-valves-policies">glorify rape</a>, in line with Steam's other prohibitions against hate speech, games that simulate the exploitation of children, nude or sexually explicit images of real people, and any content "that is patently offensive or intended to shock or disgust viewers".</p>
<p>Handing over authority to banks, ISPs and other payment providers may result in further arbitrary rejections of games, given that companies such as Stripe, Mastercard and Paypal are in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators/">the</a> <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/patreon-continues-to-crack-down-on-nsfw-content-creators">habit</a> of nudging sites like Patreon to crack down on "NSFW" or "adult" material.</p>
<p>In particular, this could lead to a stifling of games that are in any way non-conforming, particularly given the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/">current climate of repression</a> in Valve's home country, the USA. I know about the rule change thanks to Youtuber and self-described former game developer NoahFuel Gaming, who has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/noahfuelgaming.bsky.social/post/3lu2ngnm3hc26">posted on Bluesky</a> about the potential fallout for projects the banks and financial corporations consider "adult" because they deviate from reactionary framings of sex and gender. As the Youtuber writes: "Queer content gets flagged as 'explicit' even when it's PG. A trans dev making a personal story? 'Too controversial.' A surreal queer VN? 'Sexualized.' Financial deplatforming in action."</p>
<p>I'll ask Valve if they'd like to comment on all this.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content]]></content:encoded>

                <p>So far, there have only been a handful of third-party games confirmed for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/" data-ref-id="1100-6532411">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but an industry insider has claimed that many studios don't yet have development kits, and this is to blame for the limited announcements.</p><p>That's according to YouTuber Nate the Hate (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-games-delay-lack-of-dev-kits/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), who discussed the console's noticeable lack of titles from third-party studios and indie partners in his most recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y"> podcast</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> episode</a>.</p><p>"This has been a talking point amongst Nintendo fans really since the Switch 2 has come out, and it's definitely spurred up once again in the most recent days," Nate the Hate said. "And that is the question of, 'Where are the games? Where are the game announcements from third parties and indie partners?

"And it's not just indie developers. It's also those double-A and low triple-A developers who currently lack access to dev kits. And for a lot of them, they're kind of sitting there scratching their head wondering, 'When is Nintendo going to give us access?'"</p><p>Nate the Hate's co-host, Modern Vintage Gamer, also claimed that there are "quite a few" studios and publishers who don't have Switch 2 development hardware right now, and suggested that there are roughly two-thirds that made games for the original Switch that don't have access to dev kits.</p><p>"I think one-third of developers, publishers, that have worked on Switch 1 titles have access to Switch 2 hardware, but the remaining are still waiting for their hardware to come in," said Modern Vintage Gamer.</p><p>While there's no official word on what third-party games have yet to be announced, Nate later claimed that there are several companies, including Capcom and Sega, still waiting for dev kits, and that although Microsoft is planning to support the console, the dev kit issue will push these plans back to 2026.</p><p>"I also know studios like Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, Bandai Namco, and many others are just waiting," he said.

Drag x Drive, the Nintendo-developed wheelchair basketball game unveiled alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> back in April, is getting a limited-time demo.
</p>
<p>
Drag x Drive was one of the more unusual additions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">April's big Switch 2 news blow-out</a>, taking advantage of the console's new mouse controls in a distinctive dual Joy-Con configuration as two teams of three players propel themselves around the court in an effort to score the most points before a match ends.
</p>
<p>
If that sounds intriguing, there'll be an opportunity for Switch Online subscribers to take Drag x Drive for a spin ahead of its full release on 14th August this year. Nintendo's calling the event the Drag x Drive: Global Jam, and it'll run across three four hours slots starting 9th August in the UK.

<p>
Slot one runs from 11am-3pm UK time on Saturday, 9th August, while two additional slots - running 1am-5am and 5pm-9pm - take place on Sunday, 10th August. If you happen to live in the US, the Saturday slot runs from 3am to 7am PT, and the Sunday slots are scheduled for 9am-1pm and 5pm-9pm PT.
</p>
<p>
Drag x Drive will cost £16.99 when it arrives on 14th August as a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Drag-x-Drive-2785803.html">Switch 2 eShop exclusive</a>. Former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Phillips described the fast-paced experience as "exhausting" after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">brief hands on with Drag x Drive earlier this year</a>, but hopefully the full experience will be entertaining enough to balance out that arm-based exertion.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-2-ray-tracing-implementation-would-be-a-challenge-tech-experts-say.1244775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Implementing ray tracing in Red Dead Redemption 2 would be a bigger challenge than in Grand Theft Auto V for a few reasons, including the game's world diversity.</p>



<p>Replying to a supporter's question regarding the possibility of the rumored next-gen updated release adding ray tracing to the game, the tech expert at Digital Foundry highlighted how the possibility is there, as ray tracing getting added to Grand Theft Auto V on current generation consoles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-patch-new-ray-tracing-settings/">PC</a> suggests that it has been backported to older versions of the Rage engine. However, it could be challenging to implement ray tracing features in Red Dead Redemption 2, as the entire rendering has changed in the time between Grand Theft Auto V and the second entry of the wild west open-world series. Also, world diversity and the presence of a lot more vegetation than in GTAV add to the challenge, as the visual return would be different, as the game, for example, lacks a lot of man-made glass structures, and most of its world is green and brown, which would make bounce lighting less obvious than occlusion.</p>



<p>Even if Rockstar Games finds this challenge worthwhile, it's unlikely the entire RT suite would be implemented, and only some ray-traced effects would be a good fit, like ray-traced global illumination, which would enhance the game's use of SSAO with a static AO contribution with changes brought by the time of day. Ray-traced ambient occlusion would also be a good fit, while ray-traced shadows may not make much of a difference, as Red Dead Redemption 2 already features great shadows.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Despite being released in late 2018, Red Dead Redemption 2 continues to be among the best-looking open-world games ever released, so most fans would be happy to experience the game at 60 FPS on current-generation consoles even without any other visual improvement. Even in its current state, however, the game is one worth experiencing, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">review.</a></p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>Yes, it’s still meant to be out next week</p>

    </div>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>What happens when an unenforceable force meets an un-shut-uppable object? Cooperative monsterman shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> found out this past Sunday, as players of its closed online stress test were asked to agree to a nondisclosure agreement (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/killingfloor/comments/1lyxr4w/a_5_year_nda_for_2_hours/">shared on Reddit</a>) that would stay in effect for <em>five years</em>. Or four years, three hundred and fifty-four days after KF3 is supposed to launch, on July 24th.</p>
<p>Naturally, this was broken almost immediately, including by Twitch streamers clicking through the agreement <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2511631428">live on air</a>. In a <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-wednesday-stress-test-details.2341991/">forum post</a>, developers Tripwire Interactive have since declared that they stopped bothering to enforce within the test’s first hour, and apologised for making such a mad demand in the first place. The post also confirms that another stress test – which PC players can still apply to join – is happening later today, Wednesday 16th, and won’t insist on any legal gagging at all.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>NDAs are commonly wheeled out when developers run limited pre-release play sessions like these, though the half-decade duration is plainly nonsense in KF3’s case. Tripwire’s statement attributes it to essentially misused paperwork, claiming "5 years is our standard boilerplate language for internal tests and was too heavy handed for this context," adding that "It was never our intention to enforce a 5-year ban on discussing the game." The same post infers that at least some time <em>was</em> spent clamping down on agreement breakers, but then that wouldn’t have been weird at all were they only told to keep schtum for a few days. Not, y’know, the same time it took to build the Hoover Dam.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It's not like gamers have a particularly proud history of nondisclosure compliance, either. Take the Fortnite tester who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-games-sue-tester-for-spoiling-chapter-2">let slip its Season 2 details</a>, or the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-streamer-played-an-hour-of-marathon-early-before-bungie-cut-him-off">rogue Marathon streamer</a> who managed to beam an hour of the upcoming FPS like that doomed Rebel Alliance soldier passing the Death Star plans out of Darth Vader’s murder hallway. Or my personal favourite case, YouTuber and arch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> Engie main Uncle Dane <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1cxveqf/uncule_dane_leaks_the_deadlock/">leaking Deadlock</a> so hard that Valve abandoned their secrecy altogether.</p>
<p>Anyway, this new, unbound stress test begins today at 2pm BST / 9am EST, and will run for 12 hours, making it a much meatier opportunity to test drive Killing Floor 3 than Sunday’s two-hour sesh. You can request access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/">via Steam</a> if you’d like to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>Fuss has certainly been in no short supply for KF3; it was previously delayed from a planned March 2025 release after a disastrous open beta that produced widespread complaints on the game’s performance, gunfeel, and switch from having freely mix-matchable characters and perk classes – as in Killing Floors 1 and 2 – to a more hero shooterish Specialist system. By many accounts from the Sunday stress test, encouraging improvements have been made, though Tripwire say that unjoining characters and perks won’t take place until after release.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/killing-floor-3s-next-stress-test-launches-today-and-wont-share-the-last-ones-five-year-nda]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, Atlus' critically acclaimed RPG, has now sold 2m units worldwide.</p>

<p>It means the game has taken a further nine months to double its sales, suggesting its initial sales were from Atlus fans eager to play a new game from the developer outside of its famed Persona series, but longterm it perhaps hasn't resonated with a wider audience.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced who will play Link and Zelda in its forthcoming live-action The Legend of Zelda film, with two relatively unknown actors taking the lead roles.</p>
<p>Zelda will be played by Bo Bragason, while Link will be played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth. The news was shared in a social media post from series creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, adding: "I am very much looking forward to seeing both of them on the big screen."</p>
<p>Bragason is a young English actress with a very slight filmography, having most recently been in the Disney+ series Renegade Nell and the 2024 film The Radleys. As for games, she played Young Luna in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a> animated film Kingsglaive.</p>
<p>Evan Ainsworth, meanwhile, is a 16-year-old English actor with roles in Netflix series The Haunting of Bly Manor and comic book adaptation The Sandman.</p>
<p>The film is due for release on 7th May 2027, having been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">recently delayed from a March 2027 release</a>.</p>

		<p>If you are a developer and you want to ground your video game in a compelling era of history, then the late Ming Period could well be for you. This was an era in Chinese history identified with great sweeping change, and the societal tension that accompanies it. Indeed, the potent series of crises – including the old favourites of ineffective leadership resulting in famine, rebellion, and war – that afflicted the Imperial Court were significant enough to bring an end to the near 300-year-old Ming Dynasty. But don’t take my word for it, take the word of Xia Siyuan, Co-Founder/CTO of Leenzee Games and Game Director and Art Director of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>, a brand-new <a href="http://theixthaxis.com/tag/soulslike">soulslike</a> that sees the player taking on hideous mythical beasties, and a game that just so happens to delve into this historic setting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wuchang: Fallen Feathers 2024 Showcase Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPf0b55ixE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“The late Ming Dynasty was a period filled with conflict, cultural richness, and philosophical tension…all of which fit the kind of story we wanted to tell” said Xia “The lands of Shu, especially in Sichuan, gave us a unique backdrop with deep historical roots and regional myths that many of us on the team grew up hearing. It offered the perfect mix of real-world texture and space for dark, imaginative storytelling.”</p>


<p>“Real historical events gave us a strong foundation. The turmoil during the late Ming Dynasty — especially the chaos in Sichuan during Zhang Xianzhong’s invasion — helped shape the atmosphere of collapse and unrest that runs through the game. We took those real moments of instability and layered in myth, using them to imagine how the world might have unravelled if something like the Feathering had taken hold.”</p>
<p>What is this Feathering that afflicts the land? Well, it’s a particularly cruel condition, one that causes the poor unsuspecting victim to sprout feathers from their limbs before ultimately going mad and transforming into a hideous monster. Lovely stuff, but where did the initial idea for this disease originate from? That’s what I wanted to know.</p>

<p>“According to existing records,” Xia dramatically intoned, “the Feathered People first appeared in the <em>Classic of Mountains and Seas</em>, and a significant number of unearthed artefacts also depict them. These relics, texts, and folk legends have all served as sources of inspiration for us.</p>

<p>“Many of the creatures in Wuchang draw from Chinese mythology, regional folklore, and ancient archaeological finds. We looked at stories about resurrection, spiritual corruption, and shape-shifting beings, then imagined what those myths might look like if they were warped by the Feathering disease. Sanxingdui relics, with their abstract, otherworldly designs, were a major visual influence, and we used them to help create enemies that feel both ancient and unsettling but woven into the world in which they live.”</p>
<p>If I wasn’t intrigued enough already, now my Indiana Jones senses were really tingling… ancient archaeological finds? Relics? Otherworldly designs? What exactly are the archaeological discoveries of Sanxingdui? Well, Sanxingdui is an archaeological site in modern Guanghan, Sichuan. Initially uncovered way back in 1927, it has since proven a treasure trove for bronze age artefacts, which archaeologists have attributed to the ancient Kingdom of Shu.</p>
<p>“The archaeological discoveries at Sanxingdui are a fascinating topic” continues Xia, “We’ve incorporated those elements not only into the design of certain bosses, but also throughout the environments and the story’s background. As players continue exploring, these cultural references will gradually become more prominent — eventually culminating in the ancient capital of the Bo people, where this unique cultural thread reaches its narrative peak.”</p>
<p>Sanxingdui excitingly consists of numerous sacrificial pits, which in total are crammed with over 13,000 relics, with more than 3000 items intact. This is mighty impressive, considering many of these artefacts are millennia old. My smart phone barely sees the year out before promptly self-destructing. Some of the relics uncovered depict half bird half man figures – human bodies transmogrified with feathers, wings and bird claw feet. It is these that proved the inspiration for the Feathering disease, and for many of the bosses that will repeatedly kill you until you get good.</p>

<p>“The game’s world, it’s actually set in a parallel timeline—one shaped by a small divergence during the time of Du Yu” explains Xia, “In this alternate world, the worship of the Feathered People and legends of resurrection have taken root.”</p>
<p>Which is all very well and good, but if players are going to fight hideous monsters inspired by the relics of an ancient mysterious culture, they’re going to need a range of weapons to dish out some damage, right? Well, don’t worry, Wuchang has you covered, with twenty-five brutal weapons to assist you in cleaving feathered wing from feathered body, like an overenthusiastic KFC chef.</p>
<p>“Several of the weapons are rooted in real historical designs from the Ming Dynasty, as well as legendary arms from Chinese mythology” begins Xia, “The Ming era was a transitional period in terms of warfare — moving from traditional cold weapons like swords and spears to early firearms and explosives. That shift gave us a lot to work with, both mechanically and visually. We incorporated these changes into the game’s weapon variety, blending grounded historical detail with mythological symbolism. Some weapons are stylised interpretations of relics from the period, while others are tied to specific folklore or spiritual beliefs, adding another layer of meaning to how they function in combat and within the world. It was important to us that each weapon felt like it belonged to the era, even if touched by the surreal or supernatural.”</p>
<p>Quite frankly, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers sounds fantastic, the perfect game for lovers of history, mythology, and weird looking bird-dudes. Before I wrapped up my time with Xia, I wanted to know, what do the team at Leenzee Games hope players will learn about Chinese history, culture, and mythology through experiencing Wuchang: Fallen Feathers?</p>

<p>“Jiangkou sunken treasure, the Four Loyal Sons, Sanxingdui, the Jinsha ruins, Taoping Qiang Village, Baoyun Temple in Pingwu—these Sichuan landmarks and legends are part of the memories that shaped me and my team as we grew up. We drew inspiration from local folk culture such as the Sanxingdui relics, Sichuan opera’s face-changing, the iron firework ritual datiehua, as well as from Ming Dynasty philosophies—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism—and the evolution of firearms. All of these influences were woven into the gameplay.</p>
<p>Our hope is that these elements not only reflect historical authenticity, but also allow players to experience the unique cultural richness of the region. For us, sharing these memories and stories with more people is meaningful in itself—and we believe they’ll resonate with players.”</p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feather is being published by <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/505-games">505 Games</a> and will launch later this month on July 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-publishing-guidelines-updated-with-clause-prohibiting-content-that-violates-payment-processor-and-bank-rules.1244724/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Steam publishing guidelines have been recently updated with a new clause that prevents the release of certain types of content on the platform if they violate payment processor and bank rules.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/">Automaton</a>, the Rules and Guidelines section of the Steamworks Documentation has been recently updated with a new clause that prohibits the publication of "content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers." The clause clarifies that this refers to certain kinds of adult-only content, of which there's a lot on the Valve platform. A few hours ago, SteamDB confirmed that several games that are definitely in violation of this new rule have been removed from the store, although it's still unconfirmed if their removal has anything to do with the new publishing guidelines clause.</p>



<p>As payment processors and card networks have very strict rules regarding adult content, it was only a matter of time before adult content on Steam would be impacted. Hopefully, the clause will only impact content that's in clear violation of the rule and won't be used to further limit what can be published on Steam, regardless of the presence of what is deemed adult content by a third party.</p>



<p>Besides the addition of the new clause, the rest of the Steam publishing Rules and Guidelines haven't been changed. You can check them out by going <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">here.</a></p>

            <p>I liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, and having read through the notes for its summer update, patch 1.5, I reckon I'll like it even more whenever I next decide to don <a href="https://www.vg247.com/becoming-avoweds-most-toxic-360-no-scoper">the persona of a trickshotting Envoy</a>.</p>
<p>This patch is the <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1945182871930511524">second of three seasonal updates</a> Obsidian outlined that the game'd be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-latest-update-comes-with-community-requested-features-lots-of-tweaks-and-a-promise-of-a-roadmap">over the course of this year</a>. It's brought a substantial rework of fighter and ranger skills, some extra unique weapons for you to get your mitts on, Steam Deck verification, plus a bunch of other tweaks and fixes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The changes to abilities on offer to non-magical scrappers form the meat of <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/">the patch's notes</a>, and Obsidian say they've been made "to round out the classes compared to the Wizard tree". Those damn wizards, always getting the fancy tricks.
</p>
<p>The new abilities added in include the likes of a Shadow Step skill for sneaky stealthers that'll let you casually "step into the Beyond, reappearing behind your enemy", with upgrades offering the chance to do stuff like ensure these killer backstabs reset the ability's cooldown.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Update 1.5 is now live for Avowed! Please update your game when you see that this update is available to receive the following features, fixes, and changes: <a href="https://t.co/XKApoZIa0r">https://t.co/XKApoZIa0r</a></p><p>• Explore new weapons, abilities, and armor<br>• Korean and Japanese language support<br>• ✔️ Steam… <a href="https://t.co/6VEIccb1Ir">pic.twitter.com/6VEIccb1Ir</a></p></div>— Avowed (@AvowedtheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1945181691800076625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Melee Maurices, on the other hand, get skills like reviving allies "from a great distance", a Barbaric Smash that lets you absorb an enemy's built up stun reserves if your "massive blow" kills them, and the ability to take a deep breath that immediately recovers all of their stamina. That last one's something I need in real life.</p>
<p>Alongside that, Obsidian have aimed to address folks "not able to play specific builds that they wanted to early on in the game" by littering a bunch of extra unique weapons throughout Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, Shatterscarp, and Galawain’s Tusks. The former two have gotten the most, with six and five items respectively, mirroring the goal to frontload some more fun.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, enemies have been given some player abilities "such as Returning Storm, Ring of Tire, Taunt, Clear Out, Blizzard, and Tanglefoot" as well as new physical and magical barriers to block attack. So they should be equipped to try and hold off your newfound skillage.</p>
<p>Add in the Steam Deck verification, some changes to the cooking and crafting interface, and a bunch of bug fixes. The result's a patch that looks to me like a decent excuse to dust off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-beginners-guide">your facial shrooms</a> if you fancy a fresh playthrough, even if it's unlikely to turn your view on Avowed around if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">the release version</a> wasn't up your alley.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-summer-update-revamps-fighter-and-ranger-skills-so-those-pesky-wizards-arent-having-all-the-fun]]></content:encoded>
