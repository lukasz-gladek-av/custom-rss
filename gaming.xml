Games San Diego. WB also revealed that it was canceling Monolith’s <em>Wonder Woman</em> game, too. Many online were angry and sad about Monolith’s shutdown as the studio had been around since the ‘90s and had produced some beloved games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gamings-greatest-unsung-heroine-695285585&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gamings-greatest-unsung-heroine-695285585"><em>No One Lives Forever</em></a></span><em>, Blood, </em>and <em>FEAR.</em> Some of Monolith’s classic PC games are hard to play in 2025 for various reasons. But hopefully, that will change soon, thanks to GOG. </p><p>On Wednesday, digital game marketplace GOG (previously known as Good Old Games) announced that next month it will add spooky FPS <em>FEAR </em>and its two expansions to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG Preservation Program</a></span>.

Platinum</em> will be joining the GOG Preservation Program—and sooner than planned, with other Monolith icons to join eventually as well.”</p><p>GOG further added that it will have more news to share about its wonderful preservation efforts tomorrow, February 27. </p><p>So what other Monolith games might be coming to GOG’s program soon?

                <p>Prior to Marvel Rivals, casual superhero fans may have only been familiar with Moon Knight's live-action 2022 Disney+ series starring Oscar Isaac. The Fist of Khonshu first appeared in comics 50 years ago when he went up against Marvel's Werewolf by Night. However, some fans believe that Moon Knight has a grudge against Dracula because of a popular meme, and now even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a> is getting in on the fun with some very amusing callbacks in the game.</p><p>The meme in question features artwork from one of Marvel's comics, but the dialogue was reedited to make Moon Knight angry at the lord of the vampires over an unpaid debt. This never happened in Marvel's comics, and Moon Knight hasn't had a lot of interactions with Dracula in-continuity.</p><p>Marvel Rivals continuity isn't bound by that technicality, and NetEase apparently added in a few Easter eggs for the meme in the new map, Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park, which debuted as part of mid-Season 1 update. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-pitting-the-fantastic-four-against-dracula/1100-6528646/" data-ref-id="1100-6528646">Dracula is one of the main villains of Season 1</a>, and Moon Knight was one of the first heroes in Marvel Rivals. They haven't crossed paths on-screen yet, but Moon Knight mentions the debt Dracula owes him in the clips below.</p><p>So far, the two specific lines of dialogue that came up for Moon Knight in this map are "Dracula's here? Good, that bloodsuckin' nerd owes me big" and that it's "time for Dracula to pay up." There's also another reference to it in Moon Knight's in-game lore tab. In the text where Moon Knight is conversing with his patron deity, Khonshu, he says that "[vampires] suck" and "Dracula owes me money."</p><p>This lighthearted touch is a welcome discovery after the news about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">NetEase laying off some of Marvel Rivals' developers</a> despite the game's massive success. A recent report even suggested that NetEase considered replacing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-cancelation-was-considered-before-release-netease-making-changes-report/1100-6529647/" data-ref-id="1100-6529647">Marvel's characters or canceling the game outright</a> to avoid paying Disney for the rights to use them in the game. Regardless of whether either option was ever a viable choice, Marvel Rivals has already established itself as one of NetEase's most popular titles in a very short time.</p>

                <p>BioWare co-founder Greg Zeschuk has claimed that Xbox could've had another potential franchise hit in the RPG Jade Empire if it wasn't for Microsoft's short-sighted advice.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4C53o2G7q64HMCeqf54Qyz?si=02ac49c328d34de8&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=526b6e50087f44ba" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console podcast</a>, Zeschuk said that Microsoft convinced BioWare to release Jade Empire at the tail-end of the original Xbox's lifecycle. "It was the worst advice; absolute moronic advice from them. The stupidest thing ever," he explained.</p><p>He claimed that Jade Empire should've been an Xbox 360 launch game, which would've made it more successful as a product at the beginning of the console's lifecycle as opposed to the end of the previous console's lifecycle.</p><p>Zeschuk explained that if he had pushed for more development time and money, Jade Empire could've joined the ranks of fabled franchises like Mass Effect and Dragon Age. "Give us six months; give us the chance to make it a launch title for the 360 and we'd have another franchise," he said.</p><p>Jade Empire launched on the original Xbox in April 2005, and the Xbox 360 was released in November 2005. The most recent <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/edmonton-journal/88437678/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">estimate of the game's sales</a> was back in July 2005, where it crossed 500K units sold, which was below expectations.</p><p>While Jade Empire is backwards compatible with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, there have been no subsequent entries outside of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/jade-empire-special-edition-review/1900-6166271/" data-ref-id="1900-6166271">enhanced PC port in 2007</a> and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/biowares-classic-action-rpg-jade-empire-hits-ios/1100-6444254/" data-ref-id="1100-6444254">iOS port in 2016</a>. Back in 2011, BioWare <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-empire-sequel-confirmed/1100-6139680/" data-ref-id="1100-6139680">expressed interest in creating more games</a> in the Jade Empire universe, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-empire-2-stillborn-on-pc-ps3-and-xbox-360/1100-6308731/" data-ref-id="1100-6308731">any hopes of a sequel</a> were eventually dashed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/march-2025-ps-plus-games-include-dragon-age-the-veilguard/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for March&nbsp; 2025 have been announced and if you bought Dragon Age: The Veilguard just four months ago then you are going to be a bit miffed.</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus March 2025 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be March 4th, and they will be available until March 31st.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sonic Colors: Ultimate | PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched on October 31st 2024 with lots of positive reviews, including one from us which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">scored the game 8/10.</a></p>
<p>“The Veilguard is a beautiful-looking and highly enjoyable game, and a nice return to a more focused feeling RPG that does justice to both Dragon Age as a series and also to Bioware,” said Jason in his review. “It’s fun to play in the moment-to-moment, the big decisions feel impactful and worthwhile, and fans of the series will be happy to be running around chasing after that lamentable egg of an Elf once more.”</p>

<p>Since then EA have said the game failed to meet sales expectations and cancelled DLC plans, so it looks like they are trying to rake back a little more cash by getting Sony to pay for it to come to PS Plus.</p>

<p>Sonic Colors: Ultimate is rather older and was released way back in 2021.&nbsp; We did not review it but has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/sonic-colors-ultimate/">Metacrtic score of 74 o</a>n PS4 so that sounds pretty good to me.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Colors: Ultimate - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3MCqTdsVKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is from 2022 and collects thirteen classic Konami Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games in to one pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-78FD9xvc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our retro expert Adrian <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/">reviewed the pack and it also scored 8/10</a>.</p>
<p>“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a must for any Turtles fan,” he said. “The emulation here is flawless and the range of accessibility enhancements is very welcome. In fact, the treasure trove of behind-the-scenes content is worth the asking price alone. Sure, there’s a some ‘classic’ games included that won’t live up to nostalgic memories, but ignore the dross and you’ll have a blast with the near-essential selection of scrolling beat ‘em up TMNT goodness.”</p>

			<p>Today, The Chinese Room has <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-the-cast-of-mortals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 developer diary dedicated to the game's mortal non-player characters (NPCs). As the World of Darkness Head of Creative Management Karim Muammar puts it, vampires can only be striking if they have a mortal backdrop.&nbsp;Bloodlines 2 will feature several human NPCs who are, however, either knowingly or unknowingly, still entangled with the vampires of Seattle.</p>
<p>For example, Pandora Graves is a young girl that protagonist Phyre will meet in a bar. She knows quite a bit about the Kindred, and yet doesn't appear to realize the danger she's in by putting herself so close to vampires. Then there's Verona De Lancey, the offspring of wealthy parents who decided to come to the big city to search for more excitement. Apparently, she got more than she bargained for, having received a death threat in her handbag after a single night in Seattle.</p>
<p>Dale Beecher, on the other hand, is aware that Kindred society exists but only occasionally crosses paths with them, even though, from the description, he sounds like some kind of alchemist vendor. Biker Guru says he's able to sense ghosts, but seems unfazed by that fact. He can usually be found close to the rest of his biker friends near The Dutchman bar.</p>

<p>Carla was a dedicated paramedic, but she parted ways with her employers after something went wrong in their work relationship. However, she still looks out for the people of Seattle, dispensing medicine on the city's streets. Then there's Reggie, a bum with a philosophical view of the city, how it works, and where he can make a difference. He haunts Pioneer Square and usually has a good idea of what's going on in the streets nearby.</p>
<p>Marigold is a familiar figure on the streets near Atrium. She's been conducting her trade with passers-by for a long time and now also offers fortune-telling through astrology. Shelby was a trader in a major financial organization until six months ago when she received a revelation. Now, she walks the streets of uptown Seattle, making sure everyone is well aware of the coming rapture, although, according to her, there's nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Wheeler is a trustworthy officer of the Seattle Police Department. However, he has problems with his memory from time to time and is aware that things aren't quite the way they should be. Lastly, Mr. Lemon is a drunkard who has been in the Seattle Police Department's drunk-tank for a few days now and still hasn’t sobered up.</p>

<p>According to The Chinese Room, players will influence the lives of all these mortal NPCs (and more) in one way or another when going through Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. The next developer diary is scheduled in two weeks and will focus on Hunters. The game is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch this year</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

Before you even get to control your character in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wanderstop">Wanderstop</a>, you've already fucked up. Alta has lost in the arena, her defeat a swift and ignoble end to three years as unbeaten champion. She is, in her own words, a ruinous "failure". To retrain and come back fiercer than ever, she pops into the forest looking for a legendary trainer, only to find herself waking up exhausted in front of a picturesque tea shop. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Steam demo</a> that follows will see you harvesting plants, making tea, and arguing a lot with the shop's owner, a gentle giant who thinks that maybe what Alta really needs is just some time to rest. After all, you can't fail at drinking a cuppa.

<p>
The demo (released as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a>) is basically the opening of the game, heavy on the story and introducing our hamstrung hero and her new friend Boro, the hulking optimist who owns a tea shop but is basically a giant therapist. I want to talk about the character-driven storytelling more than the gamey stuff you'll be doing day to day around the tea shop. But I think it's helpful to know what kind of cosiness you're in for, so let's quickly summarise the basics.
</p>
<p>
You're making tea, but that includes all the farming involved before the first flush. The small field outside the shop is arranged in a hex pattern, and you can sow seeds in certain patterns to instantly bloom different types of plant. Sow in a line to get a small hybrid plant with blue seeds. Sow those same seeds in a three-point star pattern to create a large hybrid that'll offer harvestable fruit for the teas. 
</p>
<p>
You'll dry tea-leaves in a box with a timer, collect the resulting tea balls, and clamber up a giant central tea infusion machine, sliding about on ladders, pulling ropes and puffing bellows and kicking levers to get the hot water flowing. The tea spills out a spiral funnel in the bottom with the pleasing flow of a chemistry set you got for Christmas. There is something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc9h6FC6QgU">very Dick Van Dyke</a> about the internal decor of the house. Little toy trains wheel in and out of waterfalls and heaters - a washing machine for tea cups. Automatic saloon doors open the way from room to room with a satisfying creak. You can tune some knobs to change the music playing in the shop. The radio has three stations: "horse", "dog", and "cow".

This is all very cosy and rosy, but what does it have to do with failure, and how we cope with the idea of it? Well, most of what's on show is not selling the game itself but the protagonist and her problems. Alta has been pushing herself past the point of terrible burnout. She runs back into the forest again and again to escape the tea shop, using anger and fear as a fuel source, not yet understanding that such fuel burns hot and fast and pumps out poison like any petrol-hungry combustion engine. She eventually collapses every time you leave the tea shop's restful glade. 
</p>
<p>
The game's co-writers, Davey Wreden (of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-beginners-guide">The Beginner's Guide</a>) and Karla Zimonja (of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tacoma">Tacoma</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>) have spoken about how the game is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/aug/14/wanderstop-challenging-cosy-fantasies-davey-wreden-pc-ps5-game">a personal story of burnout</a>, and the restorative power of "daily rituals that anchor us in our lives". And playing this opening I can see what they mean. The core struggles Alta faces are difficulties a lot of us can relate to. At one point she talks about a previous dream - to smithy her own sword. But she gave up on the idea because to be "great" at blacksmithing would take a lifetime in itself, and nothing but the best-made sword would do. In Alta's mind, she only had enough life for one goal: to be the greatest arena fighter.

<p>
This is a kind of all-or-nothing thinking any perfectionist will recognise, and one that can lead to despair as easily as it leads to success. Pouring the entirety of your life's efforts into one vessel at the expense of all others comes naturally to those who want to specialise and excel. A lot of us (I include myself here) have funneled a life and identity into the mental coffee cup that accompanies us to work every day. But when something goes wrong and that career cup shatters, for whatever reason, the cold caffeine stains of "failure" seep into everything around you. Suddenly, after years of over-achieving, you're a fuck-up. There are two reactions: double down and try harder, or give up entirely. All or nothing.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, there's a lot of emotional baggage to unpack in Wanderstop, even in this short demo. When it ended after an hour or so, I was left thirsty for more. I want to see Alta get better because I know the restorative value of taking a horse-sized chill pill and learning to sit down and do nothing but breathe air for an hour at a time. I have learned that there is something - lots of things - between "all" and "nothing". And I'd feel warm and fuzzy if this extremely angry man stabber comes to see this too. 
</p>
<p>
I'm also looking forward to how the game will interrogate the "cosy" farming genre, which is traditionally replete with crafting cogs and seasonal deadlines that easily turn otherwise relaxing games into yet more efficiency-driven taskbox ticking. If the goal here is to show Alta that she doesn't need to always push herself, doesn't need to be "productive" all the time, then I'm keen to see how the game design reinforces that idea. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> and its ilk are great distractions, a green-thumbed escape from daily concerns. But there has long been room for a game to come along and think more deeply about why those games are so popular. Exactly what are we trying to escape when we plant another row of parsnips? I'm hopeful Wanderstop has an interesting answer. It's due out March 11th.

Darkrai ex’s rise to prominence isn’t because it hits hard or has a ton of HP—instead, it’s how it fits into the ways Space-Time Smackdown has changed the competitive landscape of the game, rendering many previously viable strategies borderline obsolete.</p><p>There’s a lot to unpack here, so check out our breakdown below to understand just why Darkrai ex has spiked so hard in popularity.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: No matter how much I may or may not hype up any cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, I <em>do not </em>encourage you to spend money on the game, even if you have cash to spare. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838">This is a gacha game at its core</a></span>, and with that comes aggressive psychological manipulation to encourage you to spend more than you normally would.

Whenever you place a Dark Energy from your Energy Zone on Darkrai ex, it will immediately inflict 20 damage on your opponent’s active Pokémon. Because this is an <em>ability</em> and not an <em>attack</em>, this will bypass damage reduction effects like Melmetal’s Hard Coat ability or counterattacks like Druddigon’s Rough Skin. <strong>Most importantly, Nightmare Aura works while Darkrai ex is on the bench</strong>. This means that, with the right setup, Darkrai ex can consistently boost your damage output by 20 per turn. That might not sound like a lot, but when cards like Giovanni can completely change the tide of a game by adding 10 damage to a single attack, you can imagine how Darkrai ex can swing matches in your favor.</p><p>Yet as mentioned above, Darkrai ex itself is only a small slice of why it’s so widely used. It’s how it synergizes with Space-Time Smackdown’s new Trainer Cards that make it so evil.</p><figure id="" data-id="89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-recommend-id="image://89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-recommend-id="image://89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h31085"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Trainer Cards to use with Darkrai ex</strong></h2><p>Two new Trainer Cards in particular elevate Darkrai ex to especially dangerous heights. The first of these is <strong>Dawn</strong>, which lets you transfer one Energy from your benched Pokémon to your active Pokémon. <strong>It’s a useful card in isolation, but also a fantastic tool if you want to activate Darkrai’s Nightmare Aura ability from the bench <em>and </em>build up your active pokemon so it can attack too</strong>. This pairs especially well with low Energy cards like Weezing and Weavile ex, both of which require only one Energy to attack.</p><p>The biggest game-changer, though, is <strong>Cyrus</strong>. In fact, <strong>Cyrus is arguably <em>the</em> most meta-shifting card in Space-Time Smackdown, even beyond Darkrai ex</strong>. The way it works is simple: if your opponent has a Pokémon on their bench that has taken damage, you can swap it to the active slot. Prior to Space-Time Smackdown’s release, decks loaded with ex cards thrived because players could retreat strategically. After all, it doesn’t matter if ex cards are worth two points upon being knocked out if you can deny your opponent the chance to finish them off. Now that dynamic is turned on its head; if your opponent has an ex Pokémon with low health on their bench, you can plan on claiming those two points the moment you draw a Cyrus.</p><figure id="" data-id="d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-recommend-id="image://d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-recommend-id="image://d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be clear, attacking a weak benched monster wasn’t <em>impossible </em>before. Cyrus just makes it a <em>lot </em>easier, and it slots into any deck.</p><p>Darkrai ex’s synergy with Cyrus is two-fold. On one hand, it allows you to use Cyrus on an opponent’s Pokémon with only 10 to 20 HP remaining, knock it out with Nightmare Aura, and then use your active Pokémon’s attack on whoever your opponent decides to switch in afterwards. Conversely, <strong>because Darkrai ex is ideally kept on the bench until the late game, it isn’t as vulnerable to a surprise Cyrus switch-in</strong>. Keep it at full health on your bench, make sure you have at least one other Pokémon in reserve in case your opponent has Sabrina, and wait until you’re already down two points before putting Darkrai ex in to clean up the rest of the game.</p><p>Caption: An image of the Giant Cape Pokémon Tool Trainer Card from <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>.</p><p>This isn’t even getting into the new <strong>Pokémon Tool </strong>cards, which can be equipped on Pokémon to either boost their max HP or inflict damage on opponents when they attack. Both of these effects favor tactics that stall the game and encourage chip damage, which Darkrai ex fits into perfectly. You have a perfect storm of ways that Darkrai ex decks can sweep the floor with virtually any opponent.</p><h2 id="h31086"><a id=""></a><strong>Darkrai ex fits into virtually any dark-type deck</strong></h2><p>Darkrai ex is one of the first Dark-type ex cards added to the game, and I’d go as far as to say it makes any Dark-type deck better. Whether you use it with Weezing, Weavile ex, or even Arbok, it adds so much to your team and leaves very little room for your opponent to exploit it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The continuation of Assassin’s Creed takes us to Japan, and we’re curious to see if we can play hop on a quicker flight and secure Early Access for Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>‘ content will come to <em>light </em>soon enough. Ubisoft is looking to vacate the shadows after a turbulent 2024 where nothing went right. The company has seen better times with countless layoffs to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a> and other projects announcing their closure hitting hard.</p>



<p>But Ubisoft is looking to turn a corner with Assassin’s Creed Shadows. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pre-orders are red hot</a>, and interest in Shadows is almost scalding. Let’s see whether potential Early Access has had a say in the game’s pre-release success and hype.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-assassin-s-creed-shadows-early-access">Can You Play Assassin’s Creed Shadows Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Guess I’ll have to take measures into my own hands. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no Early Access for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and it is set to release simultaneously for everyone.</strong></p>



<p>Shadows doesn’t have online multiplayer, so there’s no component for players to get an edge on each other. However, many single-player games are opting to negate Early Access. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and Baldur’s Gate 3 are classic examples of games being made for players.</p>



<p>They opted against Early Access, and it seems Ubisoft has decided to follow suit.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-why-assassin-s-creed-shadows-doesn-t-have-early-access">Do we Know Why Assassin’s Creed Shadows Doesn’t Have Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>Curiously, Ubisoft hasn’t revealed why they’ve canceled Assassin’s Creed Shadows Early Access, merely stating that the Collector’s Edition no longer has the early bonus.</strong></p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://igamemag.com/assassins-creed-shadows-early-access-canceled-ubisoft-confirms-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iGame Magazine</a>, we can see the original Discord Q&amp;A addressing the cancelation of Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Early Access.</p>



<p>Under a question about the Collector’s Edition titled “Will I still get the 3 days of Early Access as advertised,” a Ubisoft developer says: “<strong>No, there is no Early Access for AC Shadows anymore.</strong>“</p>



<p>Is this out of the goodness and thoughtfulness of Ubisoft’s heart? Or is it a way to improve their standing and put gamers before business first? We may never get a proper answer to this question.</p>



<hr>



<p>It looks like we’re all diving into Assassin’s Creed Shadows blind. I’m interested to hear your thoughts: Should the concept of pre-order Early Access be scrapped for good? Or is it a worthwhile bonus for the most committed of fans? </p>

<p>Hextech Chests are coming back to League of Legends, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-devs-defend-unpopular-hextech-chest-changes-promise-better-battle-passes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their removal at the start of 2025 sparked massive outrage within the player base</a>. In Riot’s most recent Dev Update, the League team acknowledged that many of their previous changes didn’t go over well with the community.</p>



<h2 id="h-hextech-chests-are-coming-back">Hextech Chests Are Coming Back</h2>



<p>Beginning in Act 2, with the release of patch 25.05 at the start of March, Hextech Chests will officially return. Going forward, there will be 10 Hextech Chests available for players to earn each act, which translates to 60 per year across six acts. </p>



<ul>
<li>Eight will be available in the free Pass of each act.</li>



<li>Two more can be earned through the Honor system.</li>
</ul>



<p>Previously, before they were removed, Hextech Chests were earned through the Champion Mastery system. The returning chests will be exactly the same as the ones previously earned through Champion Mastery, but they should be more “accessible” through the pass.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A number of other changes are being rolled back or addressed in the upcoming past. Blue Essence cost for all champions will be reduced by 50 percent, and more Mythic Essence is getting added to the pass rewards system. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h56OC1gqAM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial announcement</a> that Hextech Chests were being removed drew a ton of backlash, with several players threatening to boycott the game altogether. Executive Producer Paul “Pabro” Bellezza and League head Andrei “Meddler” van Roon addressed the team’s goals for Riot’s flagship title:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We want to acknowledge that we know getting League to the right place isn’t about just one set of changes. It’s about continually refining and improving the game. We think today’s updates are an important step, and we’ll keep tracking how these changes feel, talking with all of you about how things are landing, and making adjustments. We’ve always built League along with all you, the community. Thank you for sticking with us and hearing us out, and we look forward to continuing to work with you to make sure League is the best game it can be. Thanks so much, and we’ll see you on the Rift.”</p>
</blockquote>

No two playthroughs are the same and what goes right in one game can go terribly wrong in the other.</p><p><strong>Twist the Threads of Destiny</strong></p><p>No playthroughs are going to be the same, but you can push <em>Dark Deity II</em> even further. Inspired by roguelites, we created the Twisted Destiny mode, allowing you to play through a shortened version of the campaign, featuring a randomized team on every playthrough, a host of new levels and modified existing ones, and unlock rewards for future playthroughs—which can completely change the way you play them!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Dark Deity 2 Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iqhrob2ruCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Players are still very much focused on a handful of live-service games, as over 70 percent of PS5 and Xbox Series X/S players in the US played at least one of the top 10 live-service games in January.</p>
<p>Further, more than 40 percent of all playtime in the US in January across those consoles was spent on those same 10 live-service games.</p>
<p>That's according to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, based on Circana's Player Engagement Tracker. "Used to be that players would jump from big game to big game to some other games but they were most often moving to something new that they purchased," he surmised. "Now, the live-service games suck out a ton of available time, and it's hard to beat free if it's good."</p>

<p>He continued: "Really could use some positive surprises this year, and for a bunch of things to go right in 2025. So a lot is riding on the new products coming to market this year to hopefully combat or reverse some of these trends."</p>
<p>Namely, he's referring to the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo's Switch 2</a> and its subsequent new games, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">hotly anticipated GTA 6</a>.</p>
<p>Piscatella's analysis speaks to the dominance of live-service games in the industry, including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Minecraft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and Roblox. And while other studios have attempted to cash in on the live service trend, they've struggled to compete with established franchises.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/older-games-like-fortnite-account-for-over-60-of-playtime-new-report-suggests">further report last year from Newzoo</a> found games at least six years old accounted for more than 60 percent of playtime in 2023, with Fortnite the top game across all platforms that year.

<p>Sony in particular has struggled with live service projects - last month it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled two in-development games</a> from Sony Bend and Bluepoint.

			<p>Sonic Rumble is a new party game from Sega inspired by the highly popular party game Fall Guys. The title was originally meant to launch at the end of 2024, but unfortunately, that didn't happen. This news was announced in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> by Sega, where they went on to tease some of the features that people can expect to see in the game. Sega also went on to say:</p>
<p><em>We would like to extend a huge thank you to our players and Sonic fans for their patience in waiting for the global launch of Sonic Rumble. The team is committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans with even more new game mechanics, new features, and more exciting content to look forward</em> to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Rumble - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Em6-SjjaYQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the game doesn't have a set release date yet, Sega has confirmed that the game will be coming in Spring, and even included a roadmap for the game within the blog post.</p>
<p>Sonic Rumble was already available to some degree in a pre-launch early-access period, where players would get to experiment with a limited amount of features. With the game's full global launch coming in Spring 2025, this will take the game to 1.2.0, where a competitive game mode will be added, as well as a feature called "Crew," which will allow players to team up together and play Sonic rumble.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to dedicate a significant amount of time to the game, a game mode named Quick Rumble will also be available for players at launch. Instead of a full-scale match, this instead provides matches that last one round and is perfect for those players out there who may not like long play sessions or those who don't have much time to spare.</p>
<p>In addition to the three features, Sega also spoke about how it is making Sonic Rumble "truly unique."</p>
<p><em>We're making Sonic Rumble truly unique by embracing the abilities of your favorite characters from across Sonic's universe. Ever wanted to stun rivals with Amy's Piko Piko Hammer? Now you can!</em></p>
<p>Selected characters will have a certain set of unique abilities that will give those who play them the potential to get an advantage by utilizing the abilities and help keep the gameplay fresh.</p>
<p>When Sonic Rumble does release, it will be available on iOS and Android, as well as on PC via Steam. It's not certain yet whether there are plans to bring this game to console or whether the next big release on console will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a> first, which is set to release later this year on console and PC.</p>

<p>Sony has announced the three new games available for free for all PlayStation Plus subscribers for March 2025 will be Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</p>



<p>All <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-march-dragon-age-the-veilguard-sonic-colors-ultimate-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection/?sf276488366=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">three of the games</a> will be available for PlayStation Plus members starting March 4. As with past monthly games, once you add them to your library, they will be available to download at any time as long as you have an active subscription.</p>



<p>The games will be available until March 31.</p>



<h2 id="h-march-2025-s-free-playstation-plus-games">March 2025’s Free PlayStation Plus Games</h2>



<p>Of the games coming to the service in March, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the most notable. Released in October 2024, Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s response was mixed from both critics and consumers. The game failed to meet EA expectations, with the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying it missed targets</a> by nearly 50%. Developer BioWare has also since made changes, including layoffs at the studio.</p>



<p>Sonic Colors: Ultimate was released in September 2021 and sees you play as Sonic on a journey to free Wisps that were captured by Dr.  Eggman. Lastly, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection was release in  August 2022 and includes a collection of 13 games released between 1989 and 1994.</p>



<p>For those who haven’t picked up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-2025-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February’s free games</a>—Payday 3, High on Life, and Pac-Man World Re-Pac—you have until March 3 to do so.</p>



<p>In addition to the new games for PlayStation Plus subscribers, those who are on Extra and Premium memberships <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-gets-9-games-in-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received nine new games</a> to the PlayStation Game Catalog this month.</p>

BioWare's return to its single-player roots, The Veilguard earned mostly positive reviews <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-dragon-age-the-veilguard-coming-up-short-and-explains-what-happened/1100-6529252/" data-ref-id="1100-6529252">but sales did fail to meet EA's expectations</a>.

This is a remastered version of the 2010 game that was originally released for the Nintendo Wii, and it introduced a power-up system through the alien Wisp creatures that made gameplay very exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga/" data-ref-id="5000-560206">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a> is a treasure trove of the classic TMNT games published by Konami in the '80s and '90s. It includes fan-favorite games such as Turtles in Time and Tournament Fighters, as well as the infamous NES game in case you want to relive the horrible underwater levels.</p><p dir="ltr">Each game has been updated with quality-of-life features such as save states, rewinding, and custom button layouts, and some of them feature local and online co-op play.

                <p dir="ltr">A couple of months after the unveiling, CD Projekt Red has decided to pull the curtains back to showcase how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/">The Witcher 4's</a> debut trailer came together in partnership with <a href="https://platige.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Platige Image</a>. The developer discusses that a major theme was showcasing how Ciri is somewhat of a mirror to a Stromford girl named Mioni.</p><p dir="ltr">The behind-the-scenes video for The Witcher 4 (seen below and posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on YouTube</a>) begins with director Sebastian Kalemba stating "that this is the moment to tell the story with Ciri." From there, the RPG's narrative director Philipp Weber opens up about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/">The Witcher 4's first trailer</a>--which debuted at The Game Awards in December--follows how two women approach destiny differently.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGJ-B7v5tYI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We were thinking in the story that Mioni and Ciri are a little bit mirrors of each other," Weber said. "The traditions of Stromford essentially mean that Mioni has to be sacrificed. That's her destiny, and she accepted that destiny. Ciri is known as someone who does not accept destiny, she fights back at it."</p><p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red notes that the reveal trailer highlights this mirroring from the get-go, as Mioni gets dressed in a village tradition and Ciri prepares in a Witcher style. Additionally, the developer points out that Ciri does things differently than Geralt would do. Last month, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-voice-actor-is-excited-to-see-the-witcher-4-focus-on-ciri/1100-6528960/">expressed his excitement about The Witcher 4 focusing on Ciri</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of the mirroring theme, the behind-the-scenes video gives insight into the production of the RPG's debut trailer. For example, Platige Image says the motion-capture session lasted around 14 days, with another three days spent for on-site shooting and testing. There's discussion about the Slavic style being used artistically as well as the animation behind the Bauk monster.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time CD Projekt Red has elaborated on the trailer, either. After the unveiling in December, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/">Kalemba broke down The Witcher 4 trailer</a> and confirmed the story within the video will be seen in-game. GameSpot also got a chance to chat with Kalemba <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-on-ciri-gwent-and-in-game-romance/1100-6528580/">about Ciri, Gwent, and in-game romance</a>. There is no release date yet for the game.</p>

Well, here's a surprise. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will be part of Sony's PlayStation Plus Essential Games for March.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's big role-playing game only launched four months ago, so it's a surprise to see it included within the subscription service so soon.
</p>
<p>
Reception to the game has been mixed, with a solid launch last October and a decent critical response not translating into sales. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">publisher EA said the EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard had "underperformed"</a>. This month, its boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">Andrew Wilson suggested the game might have performed better if it was live-service</a>.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation Plus Essential games for March 2025 include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard (PS5)</li>
<li>Sonic Colors: Ultimate (PS4)</li>
<li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection (PS4/PS5)</li>
</ul>

<p>All the above join the PlayStation Plus game catalogue next Tuesday, 4th March, and you'll find more details on what else is on offer in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">full PlayStation Plus guide</a>.</p>

Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the fourth major entry in its long-running fantasy series, and its first in a decade. It picks up storylines from across the franchise so far and ties many of them up - but it's also a good point for new players to drop in. "A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. 
</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours-ultimate">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> is the 2001 remaster of Sega's Wii platformer that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-sonic-colours-ultimate-tech-review">according to Digital Foundry</a>, "is still a lot of fun and it plays even better now".</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a>, launched in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-sees-return-of-13-retro-classics">features 13 classic Turtles games from the series' Konami era</a>, released between 1989 and 1994.</p>

			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2 dock has arrived today, thanks to some new pictures shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2dH7Za0#n35dYx2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new pictures</a>, which have been shared online by the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained a CAD model of the console last year as reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4119">Famiiboards forums</a>, provide a new look at the console's dock, highlighting some of the changes over the current dock, including what looks like a grid on the base of the dock, which suggests a change in the cooling and air intake over the current model.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-awaited reveal last month, Nintendo has kept pretty silent about its new system and will likely continue to do so until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd Nintendo Direct</a>. According to a former Nintendo employee, the event won't only go over the Nintendo Switch 2 features that were briefly teased in the reveal trailer, but will also likely confirm the console's release date, which is speculated to be sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">June</a> for a few reasons, so there's the chance that we won't have to wait much longer to learn when it will finally launch worldwide.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches this year. We will keep you updated on it as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, GOG says that while&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em>- which collects the base game and its expansions - was due to be added at "a later timeframe", the release has been accelerated to honor Monolith Productions.</p>

<p>For context, it was revealed yesterday that Monolith was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">closed down by parent company Warner Bros</a>, and that the studio's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Wonder Woman&nbsp;</em>game has been canceled.&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First was also shut down following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">failure of the crossover fighter</a>, as was mobile studio Warner Bros San Diego.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/f.e.a.r.-gog-preservation-program-shooting.jpg?itok=NhAk4SMW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/f.e.a.r.-gog-preservation-program-shooting.jpg?itok=p7q3MxAQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em>is now a part of the GOG Preservation Program.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.</em>, GOG says that "other Monolith icons" will join the Preservation Program, and that "even more news" will be shared regarding the Program tomorrow as well. These are exciting times for game preservation.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what the GOG Preservation Program is, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">an initiative</a> started by the GOG folks to ensure that certain PC games will always be supported, regardless of whether they're receiving official support from their publishers or not.</p>

<p>Many games have already been added to the program, including titles that have been delisted by their publishers, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow">the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games</a>. Other games that are already part of the project include classics like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-1-2-gog-rerelease" rel="nofollow"><em>Dino Crisis</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, plus many more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gog-preservation-program-dino-crisis.jpg?itok=4wiGnRzs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gog-preservation-program-dino-crisis.jpg?itok=gSSQcij3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>is just one of many games already bearing the GOG Preservation Program stamp.</figcaption></figure><p>Other Monolith games that might make it to the Preservation Program include the likes of classic FPS&nbsp;<em>Blood</em>, cult shooter <i>The Operative: No One Lives Forever</i>, and, of course, the two&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>sequels.&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&nbsp;</em>is already part of the program, but&nbsp;<em>Shadow of War&nbsp;</em>has yet to be added.</p>

<p>Sadly, Monolith and Player First are just two of the latest casualties in what is somehow becoming an increasingly tumultuous time for the industry. Other studios to close in recent months include NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">Seattle&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>studio</a>, Dr. Disrespect's ex-studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">Midnight Society</a>, and some of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft's studios</a> as well.</p>

<p>If you want to support GOG and its efforts to preserve Monolith's games, you can check out&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fear_platinum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now via the storefront</a>.</p>

While the latter got two DLCs the following year, we haven’t had a new <em>Pokemon </em>RPG in almost three years. February 27 is Pokémon Day, which means The Pokémon Company is about to share what the franchise has coming down the pipeline. So what better time to revisit the best and worst <em>Pokémon </em>games? Here’s our ranking of the mainline <em>Pokémon </em>RPGs, within which I’m sure you will find nothing objectionable.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="71f66b4197020860cf2a4112e91c2aca" data-recommend-id="image://71f66b4197020860cf2a4112e91c2aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1358" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dawn and Ethan are shown walking forward with Torterra, Infernape, Empoleon, Palkia, Dialga, Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, Cynthia, and Cyrus all posed behind them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dawn and Ethan are shown walking forward with Torterra, Infernape, Empoleon, Palkia, Dialga, Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, Cynthia, and Cyrus all posed behind them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond </em>and <em>Shining Pearl </em>are fine remakes, but play it so safe that they don’t feel quite as magical as the source material.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71f66b4197020860cf2a4112e91c2aca" data-recommend-id="image://71f66b4197020860cf2a4112e91c2aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1358" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dawn and Ethan are shown walking forward with Torterra, Infernape, Empoleon, Palkia, Dialga, Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, Cynthia, and Cyrus all posed behind them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As remakes of the 2006 DS games, <em>Brilliant Diamond </em>and <em>Shining Pearl </em>are pretty faithful to the source material. But that same faithfulness holds it back from reaching the potential of a more radical update. These games are colorful, nostalgic, and have a handful of modern quality of life changes that make them at least more approachable than the original games, but they ultimately end up feeling like a missed opportunity to make a more robust update to two great <em>Pokémon</em> titles. This isn’t helped by it being the first of a handful of <em>Pokémon </em>games marred by technical issues not found in the originals. They’re fine! But that’s all they are.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="167c53192a2e12cde846cd72b363dc90" data-recommend-id="image://167c53192a2e12cde846cd72b363dc90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1152" data-height="692" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown preparing to mega evolve Mewtwo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown preparing to mega evolve Mewtwo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Hey, at least we got Mega Evolutions for one generation, right?</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="167c53192a2e12cde846cd72b363dc90" data-recommend-id="image://167c53192a2e12cde846cd72b363dc90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1152" data-height="692" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown preparing to mega evolve Mewtwo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If nothing else, <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y </em>deserve props for introducing the series’ best generational gameplay gimmick in Mega Evolution, and for finally giving a reliable counter to dragon Pokémon by introducing the fairy type. As the mainline games’ first foray into the 3D space, <em>X</em> and <em>Y </em>are a fulcrum point for the franchise, but they’re also filled with a fair bit of quirks that have knocked them down many <em>Pokémon </em>player’s rankings over the years. Its story, held up by a series’ worst evil team in Team Flare, is messy and introduces some pretty wild elements to the universe, including an old man persisting for thousands of years to find his Floette.</p><p>But despite those potentially interesting threads, it never feels like it quite lives up to the promise. Maybe one day we’ll get a <em>Pokémon Legends</em> game set in the Kalos region that will expand upon these ideas, but for now, <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>is a pretty significant moment in the series, but one that is often viewed as a breaking point for its usual formula. Fortunately, the generations that followed were more experimental with the structures of a <em>Pokémon </em>game.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5777dfdcb623168f4ee02d402a536f18" data-recommend-id="image://5777dfdcb623168f4ee02d402a536f18" data-format="jpg" data-width="579" data-height="321" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown encountering a wild Pikachu and preparing to battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown encountering a wild Pikachu and preparing to battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>The Gen I games are where it all began, which means things have only gotten better, since.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5777dfdcb623168f4ee02d402a536f18" data-recommend-id="image://5777dfdcb623168f4ee02d402a536f18" data-format="jpg" data-width="579" data-height="321" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown encountering a wild Pikachu and preparing to battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As much as the genwunners might hate to hear it, the original <em>Pokémon </em>games are rough to go back to in light of over two decades of iteration. <em>Pokémon Red</em>, <em>Blue</em>, <em>Green</em>, and <em>Yellow </em>are the blueprint for one of the biggest multimedia franchises on the planet, and a lot of us have childhood memories that center around those Game Boy cartridges. But having replayed <em>Yellow </em>recently on my 3DS, it’s jarring when quality of life staples are missing (like a run button) and old annoyances like HMs are still so prevalent. It’s still refreshing to go back to basics: there are 800 fewer Pokémon, the competitive scene isn’t this lavish, meta-driven affair, and Team Rocket just wants to steal people’s Pokémon for profit instead of recreating an entire universe to their liking. It was a simpler time, but things have clearly improved from a game design standpoint since. We’ll always love you, Gen I, but there are better ways to experience you, and we’ll be ranking them higher on this list.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7376f66d57e0ea84c7d1e21f99ed1ca" data-recommend-id="image://f7376f66d57e0ea84c7d1e21f99ed1ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1085" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Several trainers and wild Pokémon are shown gathered on a cliffside overlooking the Alolan ocean." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Several trainers and wild Pokémon are shown gathered on a cliffside overlooking the Alolan ocean." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Sun </em>and <em>Moon </em>brought a distinct culture through the introduction of the Alolan region.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7376f66d57e0ea84c7d1e21f99ed1ca" data-recommend-id="image://f7376f66d57e0ea84c7d1e21f99ed1ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1085" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Several trainers and wild Pokémon are shown gathered on a cliffside overlooking the Alolan ocean." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>brought the best gameplay gimmick, <em>Sun </em>and <em>Moon </em>bring probably the least memorable one with Z-Moves. Other mechanical twists like Mega Evolution and Gigantamaxing have the benefit of form changes and battle-long impact, whereas Z-Moves haven’t had the same impact on the community because they’re just more powerful moves you get to use once, then they’re over. But while <em>Sun </em>and <em>Moon</em>’s battle mechanics aren’t quite as flashy as other games on this list, the tropical region of Alola is fascinating in its distinct culture, shift in format away from the typical eight gym battles, and introduction to new concepts like regional variants.<br></p><p>These new takes on old ‘mons illustrate how real world phenomena like speciation can occur in distinct regions, and Alolan’s Hawaii-inspired setting is a great place to debut the concept and add new layers to the franchise moving forward. <em>Ultra Sun </em>and <em>Ultra Moon </em>iterate on the original games’ systems, and add new content to further the story of the Ultra Beasts, but even to this day it can be confusing to decide which one you should actually play and what the benefits are to playing either (or both). Alola was a great era of experimentation in <em>Pokémon</em>, and its strides have helped inform further shifts from old formulas and form distinct regions and culture within the universe. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="502ec92db9bdf8ac3855a982b6e0091d" data-recommend-id="image://502ec92db9bdf8ac3855a982b6e0091d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groudon and Kyoger are shown battling where the sea and earth meet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groudon and Kyoger are shown battling where the sea and earth meet." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Omega Ruby</em> and <em>Alpha Sapphire</em> recontextualized Groudon and Kyogre through Primal Reversion.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="502ec92db9bdf8ac3855a982b6e0091d" data-recommend-id="image://502ec92db9bdf8ac3855a982b6e0091d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groudon and Kyoger are shown battling where the sea and earth meet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Omega Ruby </em>and <em>Alpha Sapphire </em>are more along the lines of what people likely wanted out of the <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>remakes. These are beefy reimaginings that riff on the original <em>Ruby </em>and <em>Sapphire</em> by making them feel decidedly modern. This includes the visual update that shifts over to 3D models and environments comparable to <em>X </em>and <em>Y</em>, implementing mechanics like Mega Evolution, and adding a pretty dense post-game storyline called the Delta Episode, which manages to add major players in the Hoenn like Rayquaza and Deoxys into the story in a meaningful way. <em>Omega Ruby </em>and <em>Alpha Sapphire </em>are solid revamps of already great games, and revisiting them now just makes <em>Brilliant Diamond </em>and <em>Shining Pearl</em>’s relative restraint sting all the more.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6710211f06ad77517a064ce4ad8af7b" data-recommend-id="image://a6710211f06ad77517a064ce4ad8af7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arven, Nemona, Penny, and a Pokémon trainer are shown flying on Miraidon's back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arven, Nemona, Penny, and a Pokémon trainer are shown flying on Miraidon's back." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Scarlet </em>and<em> Violet’s</em> open world is ambitious, but the game caves under it on a few fronts.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6710211f06ad77517a064ce4ad8af7b" data-recommend-id="image://a6710211f06ad77517a064ce4ad8af7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arven, Nemona, Penny, and a Pokémon trainer are shown flying on Miraidon's back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The main reason <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>aren’t higher on this list is that, as of this writing, these games are still pretty busted. As the first fully open-world entry in the series, they are some of the most ambitious <em>Pokémon </em>games in terms of design (though, I’d argue the ambition felt a bit reckless in some of its open-world feeling more arbitrary and lacking clarity), and their endgame is easily a highlight of the entire franchise. </p><p>But man, they’re still buggy as hell, and central to conversations about the technical capabilities of the Switch, though other developers have made better-looking games sing on the hardware. <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>have so much incredible stuff going for them, like their series-best storytelling, seamless co-op, and, the thrill of freely exploring an entire <em>Pokémon </em>region (even if it’s rough around the edges). Hopefully the reaction to these technical problems can be a wake-up call for whatever comes next.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1f2fdce8ec1d7eace516bec5733156ef" data-recommend-id="image://1f2fdce8ec1d7eace516bec5733156ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer and Hop are seen riding on a train and looking at their phones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer and Hop are seen riding on a train and looking at their phones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>They’re learning type matchups.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f2fdce8ec1d7eace516bec5733156ef" data-recommend-id="image://1f2fdce8ec1d7eace516bec5733156ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer and Hop are seen riding on a train and looking at their phones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield </em>are so mired in the National Dex controversy that it feels like it eclipses conversations about what the games actually are. And that’s a pretty solid pair of games that introduced modes and features that became standard in future titles. The Wild Area is a decent enough proof of concept for what would become the open areas of <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>and <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, and they bring <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s raid battles to the mainline games, which became a staple for post-launch support. Gigantamaxing is a bit silly, but come on, Pokémon kaiju battles are pretty cool.<br></p><p>The A-plot is one of the series’ weakest, with its environmentalist themes getting wrapped up in some strange character motivations that fans are still reeling from, but it also provides some of the series’ most iconic new characters like Galar champion Leon, his 100% canonical boyfriend Raihan, and Nessa, who came to steal Misty’s throne as the water-training queen of the Pokémon world. Like Sun and Moon before them, Sword and Shield feel like hints at changing times for Pokémon, and while they don’t land every note, they aspire to new things, and helped pave the way for better games that followed. Oh, and the DLC whips.

Similar to the recent <em>Detective PIkachu </em>movie, a lot of <em>Black </em>and <em>White </em>questions the ethics around the very basis of the franchise. Is it okay that humans use these critters for competitive sport? Should they be kept inside Pokéballs? Is humanity and Pokémon’s co-existence only beneficial to humans at the expense of Pokémon’s freedom? They grapple with these ideas and don’t quite reach a conclusion as revolutionary as the questions themselves, but they are more contemplative than the usual “power of friendship” status quo the series often rests on. They also take some bold choices in Pokémon selection, only allowing players to capture old favorites after they went the entire game using the new ones. Now, if only the Unova region’s Pokémon weren’t <em>the worst</em>. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="279676f747a0b14b9f6aabbe1d9e5b50" data-recommend-id="image://279676f747a0b14b9f6aabbe1d9e5b50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="745" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown petting Pikachu on the head as it sits on a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown petting Pikachu on the head as it sits on a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Any game that lets you pet Pikachu throughout gets at least a few placements higher on this list.</figcaption><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="279676f747a0b14b9f6aabbe1d9e5b50" data-recommend-id="image://279676f747a0b14b9f6aabbe1d9e5b50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="745" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer is shown petting Pikachu on the head as it sits on a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pokémon Let’s Go Pikachu </em>and <em>Let’s Go Eevee </em>seems to have just been a one-off experiment. On the surface, the remakes of <em>Pokémon Yellow</em> appear to be a <em>Pokémon Go </em>tie-in for your Switch. But their retooling of the series’ usual catching mechanics in favor of <em>Pokemon Go</em>-style motion controls makes a 20-year-old RPG feel fresh, and isa nice, focused detour before heading into <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em>, which expands the lore and competitive scene. While going back to the original Gen I games will give you that same focused experience, the <em>Let’s Go </em>games are an inventive, modern take that let you dress up Pikachu and give him good pets. It rules.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c51e1c09f1eff7b0488d8b0d842d9fed" data-recommend-id="image://c51e1c09f1eff7b0488d8b0d842d9fed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Brendan is seen riding his bicycle as Latias flies beside him over the ocean." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Brendan is seen riding his bicycle as Latias flies beside him over the ocean." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>The jump from the Game Boy to the Game Boy Advance helped <em>Ruby</em> and <em>Sapphire</em> shine.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c51e1c09f1eff7b0488d8b0d842d9fed" data-recommend-id="image://c51e1c09f1eff7b0488d8b0d842d9fed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Brendan is seen riding his bicycle as Latias flies beside him over the ocean." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The original <em>Ruby </em>and <em>Sapphire </em>felt like such a huge leap from <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em> as we made the transition from the Game Boy Color to the Game Boy Advance—at the time, it felt as significant as the transition between those systems. To this day, the third, fourth, and fifth generations of <em>Pokémon </em>are probably still the most timeless in terms of Game Freak’s sprite work and art direction. The transition to 3D hasn’t been kind to <em>Pokémon </em>across the board, and looking back at games like <em>Ruby </em>and <em>Sapphire</em>, it’s hard not to wonder what more recent entries would’ve looked like had the series not made the shift to 3D. But <em>Ruby </em>and <em>Sapphire</em> also have a really strong generation of new Pokémon, introduce the double battles that would go on to be the basis of competitive play 20 years on, and start to hint at an ever-expanding universe that future games would go on to fill in.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e86e5d5e54e01ef3e915c607c2d0b44a" data-recommend-id="image://e86e5d5e54e01ef3e915c607c2d0b44a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ho-oh's silhouette is seen as it flies high in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ho-oh's silhouette is seen as it flies high in the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Gold</em> and <em>Silver’s</em> post-game ambition hasn’t been replicated in any game since.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e86e5d5e54e01ef3e915c607c2d0b44a" data-recommend-id="image://e86e5d5e54e01ef3e915c607c2d0b44a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ho-oh's silhouette is seen as it flies high in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver </em>set the bar for <em>Pokémon </em>post-games that a majority of these titles haven’t even dared to touch. The second generation games introduce a hundred new Pokémon, new typings, and a brand new region to explore in Johto. Then, after the credits roll, the entirety of the previous games’ map opens up, and you have basically a second game waiting for you. All of this culminates in a final battle that still remains legendary in the <em>Pokémon </em>community…then Game Freak just never did it again. It’s not like that would be an easy undertaking, but it set an expectation the company never again attempted to meet. These days, the original <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em> fall short in the way most old games do, with new iterations and improvements making them feel decidedly dated and less fun to play. But its ambition, especially for its time, can’t be overstated. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f97a51e1232e4d6a1553d0256a86d033" data-recommend-id="image://f97a51e1232e4d6a1553d0256a86d033" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two Pokémon trainers are shown in front of a mockup of a DS screen playing Pokémon Black 2 and White 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two Pokémon trainers are shown in front of a mockup of a DS screen playing Pokémon Black 2 and White 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Black 2</em> and <em>White 2</em> were the last Pokémon games on the original DS.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f97a51e1232e4d6a1553d0256a86d033" data-recommend-id="image://f97a51e1232e4d6a1553d0256a86d033" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two Pokémon trainers are shown in front of a mockup of a DS screen playing Pokémon Black 2 and White 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As previously established, Unova is not my favorite region and <em>Black </em>and <em>White</em> aren’t my favorite <em>Pokémon </em>games. So, when Game Freak announced it was making its first (and, as of this writing, only) direct sequel, I wasn’t particularly enticed by <em>Black 2 </em>and <em>White 2</em>. However, while they’re often iterative of their predecessors, these games are widely considered some of the most robust and feature-complete games in the franchise. Taking a second trip back to Unova is rewarding to learn more about this side of the <em>Pokémon </em>universe, but it also is probably the last pure <em>Pokémon </em>experience before things like Mega Evolution and Terastalyzing started to alter how battles would play out both in the main game and in the competitive meta. It’s just a really solid <em>Pokémon </em>experience, and, for a lot of people, feels like the last bastion for a type of <em>Pokémon </em>game that might not exist anymore.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="92fcb1b2cd72fc94f7dee6ea24fad656" data-recommend-id="image://92fcb1b2cd72fc94f7dee6ea24fad656" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1270" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>revealed more about the creation of the <em>Pokémon</em> world by focusing on the Pokémon who created it.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="92fcb1b2cd72fc94f7dee6ea24fad656" data-recommend-id="image://92fcb1b2cd72fc94f7dee6ea24fad656" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1270" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Generation IV is where <em>Pokémon’s </em>world began to really take shape. Sure, <em>Ruby </em>and <em>Sapphire </em>introduce the gods of the earth, sea, and sky, but <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> starts to answer questions of where this world came from. The Sinnoh region is the origin point of the <em>Pokémon </em>universe, and the concepts it introduces make the world feel more vast and unknowable than it had at the time. These ideas are expanded upon in <em>Platinum</em>, which establishes further truths about how the <em>Pokémon </em>world came to be. <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>are the mythology sickos’ <em>Pokemon </em>games, but from a gameplay standpoint, they also offer some of the series’ most infamous challenges. Cynthia’s theme still sends chills up the spine of everyone who hears it as they recount what it was like to face her iconic team and Garchomp ace. Whether you’re here to learn more about the <em>Pokémon </em>world or tackle some of the most challenging fights the series has to offer, <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>are mainstays in the <em>Pokémon </em>canon.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3f3903729b19930dbf43cd50f31bec4c" data-recommend-id="image://3f3903729b19930dbf43cd50f31bec4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer is seen smiling at the sky in an open temple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer is seen smiling at the sky in an open temple." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>By sending players back into the past, <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>told a radically different story.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f3903729b19930dbf43cd50f31bec4c" data-recommend-id="image://3f3903729b19930dbf43cd50f31bec4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon trainer is seen smiling at the sky in an open temple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For some, <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>might feel like an empty tech demo, but it also marks the most significant, refreshing leap forward the series has had in over a decade. Its open-world structure isn’t as seamless as <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, but it’s more fluid, frictionless, and frightening to explore. <em>Legends: Arceus </em>uses its historic setting to free itself from the shackles of the series’ usual competitive sport, allowing both it and the player to explore new stories, mechanics, and structures. Its traversal feels incredible, its action-oriented systems feel like they remove rigid restrictions that once were part and parcel ofthe <em>Pokémon </em>franchise, and without the Pokémon League to get in the way, it explores the origins of the universe unbound by the series’ usual composition. </p><p><br>It is what I, and many other lore-driven fans, wanted out of <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, and frankly, from the series for a long time. Its maps may not be as lively as other open-world games, but thanks to the stories it tells and the connections it allows you to create as a trainer surviving alongside their Pokémon, <em>Pok</em>é<em>mon Legends: Arceus</em> is the most alive the franchise has felt in quite some time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f703a66e41a704d67d853e45ed0cfaed" data-recommend-id="image://f703a66e41a704d67d853e45ed0cfaed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charizard and Venusaur are seen posed in front of a red and green background alongside the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen logos." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charizard and Venusaur are seen posed in front of a red and green background alongside the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen logos." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption><em>FireRed</em> and<em> LeafGreen</em> are still the definitive Kanto experience.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f703a66e41a704d67d853e45ed0cfaed" data-recommend-id="image://f703a66e41a704d67d853e45ed0cfaed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charizard and Venusaur are seen posed in front of a red and green background alongside the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen logos." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While the original Generation I games set the stage for what would come, their Generation III remakes are the definitive place to play through that original journey. <em>FireRed </em>and <em>LeafGreen</em> bring players back to the region of Kanto to re-experience the first <em>Pokémon </em>journey. This was significant in 2004, because it was long before remakes became a staple of the franchise’s business model.<br></p><p>At the time, going back to Kanto in the remakes felt like such a drastic refresh that it was like seeing that setting as you’d imagined it at a younger age. On top of the visual update, <em>FireRed </em>and <em>LeafGreen</em> give the games a contemporary overhaul by adding quality of life changes like the run button, including modern mechanics like breeding, abilities, and cross-gen trading, and swaths of new content to really fill out the package. It is, to this day, the best way to travel through the original Kanto region. It might not have that same classic nostalgia tied to it the way <em>Red </em>and <em>Blue </em>does or have the novelty of <em>Let’s Go Pikachu </em>and <em>Let’s Go Eevee</em>, but it is the definitive Kanto game. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6d1e7a185dc3eed18b00d02e58fd6e3" data-recommend-id="image://a6d1e7a185dc3eed18b00d02e58fd6e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ho-oh and Lugia are shown in front of gold and silver backgrounds alongside the Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver logos." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ho-oh and Lugia are shown in front of gold and silver backgrounds alongside the Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver logos." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>The <em>Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em> remakes perfected the originals’ ambitious endgame.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6d1e7a185dc3eed18b00d02e58fd6e3" data-recommend-id="image://a6d1e7a185dc3eed18b00d02e58fd6e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ho-oh and Lugia are shown in front of gold and silver backgrounds alongside the Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver logos." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All those things I just said about <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> apply to <em>HeartGold</em> and <em>SoulSilver</em>, the remakes of <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em> that launched on the DS. If you’re building off one of the most ambitious games <em>Pokémon </em>has ever had but with better tech and design, you’re bound to come up with a marquee <em>Pokémon </em>game. <em>HeartGold </em>and <em>SoulSilver</em> stand the test of time by polishing what was already one of the series’ most impressive feats. They take everything the original <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver </em>aspired to and wipe away the dust, allowing them to shine beyond so many other <em>Pokémon </em>games over a decade later. While <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>and <em>Legends: Arceus </em>have been taking the series in new, exciting directions, <em>HeartGold </em>and <em>SoulSilver</em> feels like the perfection of what came before it. In retrospect, it makes sense that the games that followed all seemed to be, in one way or another, trying to carve a new path for the series, because when you’ve finally nailed what you set out to do initially, the only place to go is somewhere new.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
