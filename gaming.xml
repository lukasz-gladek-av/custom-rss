            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-lorcana-fabled-preview-features-elsa-gift-box<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has released new information on the upcoming <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Disney Lorcana</a> Fabled</em> set. The latest set of the trading card game based on iconic Disney characters will be getting a new format, new products, and a gift box featuring the ice queen, Elsa.</p>



<p>As part of their Weekly Lorecast on their official Twitch channel, Ravensburger showcased their <em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> preview. The preview centered on official products and accessories alongside the full <em>Fabled</em> line up of booster packs, Illumineer's Troves, and starter decks.</p>

The other deck, showcasing Ariel and Mulan, is an Amber and Sapphire deck. Both will be sold at an MSRP of $16.99 each.</p>

<p>The new products and accessories will portray other characters featured in the set. Those accessories are a pair of <em>Goofy Movie</em> and <em>Mulan</em>-themed card sleeve packs and deck cases. The card sleeves will be sold at an MSRP of $9.99 and the deck boxes will be sold at an MSRP of $5.99.</p>

<p>In addition, two playmats will be available. One spotlights Cinderella as she gets her gorgeous dress from her fairy godmother. The other showcases Mufasa, King of Pride Rock. Both playmats will be available at an MSRP of $19.99</p>

The box will contain five booster packs, an Elsa-themed storage box, three punch-out dividers, and a glimmer foil promo card of <em>Elsa - The Fifth Spirit</em>. This Elsa Gift Box will be available this October at an MSRP of $29.99.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> preview has confirmed the launch of two new formats. The first, Super Sealed, is a variation on a sealed draft. You get four boosters from each of the most recent sets. From there, you must make a three-ink color deck of 50 cards in under 60 minutes.</p>

<p>You are allowed to change cards between matches, but must revert back to the initial deck after each round and before the start of a new match.</p>

<p>The second format is called Triple Deck Constructed Format (Single Elimination). AS the name implies, players make 3 decks covering all 6 ink colors. Players then play best of three against one another. You can even use an ink token to "bench" one of your opponents decks. The Grand Finals are determined in best of five.</p>

<p><em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> will have a pre-release on August 29. The set's full release will be September 5.</p>

                <p>As the video game industry shifts from physical media to a digital future, game preservation is an increasingly relevant topic. Saving the history of the medium is important, and one gaming historian has just successfully preserved one of the rarest video games ever made.</p><p>Video game scholar Bruno de Figueiredo has announced (via <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/05/one-of-the-rarest-video-games-in-history-has-finally-been-preserved" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>) that he has posted the ISO online for TRIPITAKA, the sequel to Cosmology of Kyoto. The original title was released in 1993 in Japan by SoftEdge, and this non-linear adventure game was released in North America the following year where it gained a small following. The sequel is so obscure that only a single physical copy of TRIPITAKA is known to exist.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/dieubussy/status/1925575872720822422" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">After a long search, uncertain that it even existed, I finally located the CD-ROM TRIPITAKA 玄奘三蔵求法の旅, the elusive sequel to the legendary Cosmology of Kyoto.

                <p>EA confirmed this week that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">canceled its upcoming Black Panther game and closed its developer, Cliffhanger Games</a>. A new report provides more context and background as to the situation surrounding the game's cancellation and what the game was aiming to be.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that the Black Panther game recently passed a development milestone, and the project was gaining momentum. However, sources said EA executives were upset that the game was still in pre-production after almost four years of work. After a portfolio review from EA management, the company reportedly chose to axe games in development for an extended period of time without making sufficient progress, and this included Black Panther.</p><p>Also canceled in this process were multiple titles at Apex Legends and Titanfall studio Respawn, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/" data-ref-id="1100-6531200">including a new Titanfall game</a>, according to previous reporting.</p><p>EA's Black Panther game was going to build on some of the ideas that Cliffhanger boss Kevin Stephens had worked on with the Shadow of Mordor series when he was at Warner Bros., including the Nemesis system, the report said. For the Black Panther game, T'Challa, Killmonger, and Shuri would be playable characters, vying to become the new Black Panther.</p><p>Players were going to fight against the Skrull shapeshifting aliens, who had come to Wakanda. Some of these characters in the game might be impostors, and would have remembered and learned from player behavior, similar to how orcs in Shadow of Mordor would remember players and act based on previous interactions.</p><p>Developers had a hard time showcasing what made the Black Panther game special in presentations with management, and processes were slowed due to the team building a game and a new studio at the same time, the report said.</p><p>Following the game's cancellation, staffers who worked on the project spoke out to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-panther-devs-mourn-eas-stunning-and-amazing-game/1100-6531912/" data-ref-id="1100-6531912">praise the work the team did on what they hoped would be an "amazing" game.</a> While the Black Panther game is no longer moving ahead, EA is still building an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iron-man-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531545/" data-ref-id="1100-6531545">Iron Man game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-black-panther-game-is-canceled-but-it-has-three-marvel-games-still-in-development/1100-6531945/" data-ref-id="1100-6531945">multiple Marvel projects as part of a multi-game deal with Marvel.</a></p><p>EA's Black Panther game is dead, but Amy Hennig's Marvel game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522227/" data-ref-id="1100-6522227">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, features Black Panther prominently.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/is-generative-ai-really-just-a-tool<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"AI is inevitable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a phrase that's rattled around my head for a month. Not willingly mind you. It's taken up lodging in my grey matter after hearing it in meetings, reading it in emails, and seeing it buffeted back and forth across Bluesky, LinkedIn, and Discord.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not a convincing phrase. If you hear it from AI boosters it's easy to brush off as raw hype, and if you hear it from doomsayers it can lull you into a sense of fatalism. But as the philosopher Natasha Bedingfield </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/b7k0a5hYnSI?si=wpIbqOH5OM9T3WeS">told us in 2004</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, today is where the book begins, the rest is still unwritten. Nothing, for better or worse, is inevitable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But in those various calls another phrase—one you may have heard at your studio—has slipped past more unnoticed: "AI is just a tool. It can be used for good or evil, like any other tool."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After all this is a business where we use tools for good or evil, right and wrong, correctly and incorrectly. We debate the effectiveness of Unity, Unreal, or Godot. We agonize over whether to use procedural versus hand-crafted content. We debate and discuss the topic so much that Game Developers Conference has a whole </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdconf.com/tools-summit">Tools Summit</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> dedicated to craft of making game development software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Viewing generative AI through the neutral lens of tool assessment is natural—and I'll go so far as to say admirable—for our community. It's a method we use to get past hype and bombast, to try and take technology on its own terms and see how it fits our purposes. And as the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gdc-2025-state-of-the-game-industry-devs-weigh-in-on-layoffs-ai-and-more">2025 GDC State of the Industry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> report tells us, some developers are adopting generative AI, plenty of them not bought in on the hype but through the act of seeking the right tool for the job.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/is-nvidia-s-ai-driven-npc-tech-just-really-expensive-improv-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Is NVIDIA's AI-driven NPC tech just really expensive improv?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But looking at generative AI as 'just a tool' is a deeply flawed lens. That phrase betrays a quiet cynicism (one we hear often from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/RYa-_lrG3H8?si=GTDXPf9__8MOWGZg">opponents of firearm regulation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the United Stats). Because nothing—not generative AI, not a firearm, not even a hammer—is "just a tool."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The function of tools is influenced by their form">The function of tools is influenced by their form</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Consider two tools found in many American households: the claw hammer and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145">the handgun</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Normally Game Developer restricts itself to the craft of making video games but I promise this is relevant. Guns are another tool where neutralizing rhetoric is deployed to downplay a tool's negative effects. I grew up in a gun-owning house in a gun-owning neighborhood in suburban Maryland. There were probably four handguns sitting in lockboxes across two rooms, a few rifles and shotguns in a vault in the basement, and one questionably legal World War I firearm tucked away in a closet. The NRA's mantra of "guns don't kill people, people kill people" was commonplace. A neighbor of mine laughed when I advocated for stronger regulations on gun ownership on the basis of "guns are meant to kill." "Guns aren't meant to kill," I recall him saying. "Cars can kill people. Does that mean cars are meant for killing?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His point boils down to this: The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>outcome </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">of the tool's use is not worth considering when discussing regulation, only its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>potential </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">use. A gun is a tool and the user has control over a tool is used.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cars are already tightly regulated and cost thousands of dollars, making his point moot, so we'll break down the construction of the claw hammer instead. We generally refer to hammers as being used to pound nails into wood, but I mainly use mine for hammering anchors into drywall because I'm a theater kid and was taught in crew to trust screws.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In either case, the physical shape of the claw hammer dictates its most common purpose. The handle extends into a metal object that is blunt at one end, and clawed on the other. The design follows the swing of the human arm, transferring kinetic energy generated by the bicep, down the elbow, through the wrist, and into the blunt end.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also know that claw hammers are not useful for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>every</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> form of transferring this energy. Variations on hammer design like the ball-peen hammer show how this basic purpose needs to be altered for different tasks. The shape and the material changes depending on the purpose. To sell more hammers, companies invest in better materials and affordances like rubber grips to make their use more comfortable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like a firearm, hammers can be used as weapons. That same transference of force can be used to harm another living being. Video games sometimes place hammers in a players' loadout alongside guns, grenades, and weapons of war.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Neither the hammer nor the firearm is "just" a tool. They are tools that are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>optimized</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for a purpose. We can study that purpose, and cast judgements about a tool's safety, merits, and need to be regulated based on that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>But</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The shape of the hammer is not an efficient way to inflict harm. This is supported by data from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/shr">FBI Crime Statistics survey</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which gathers data filed by police departments that participate in assembling data. "Handgun" is the most common weapon used in homicides, and "knife/cutting instrument" ranks higher than "blunt objects." That's because handguns are an incredibly efficient means of wounding living beings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's break down the handgun the way we did the hammer. Handguns are assembled from an assortment of components that transfer the squeeze of a trigger into the strike of a hammer against a firing pin, which strikes the primer of a bullet's cartridge and sends it propelling out of the tube. Though some bullets seen in larger firearms are meant to penetrate metal, a handgun's bullet is envisioned and designed to cut through flesh.</span></p><p>Image via Adobe Stock.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These constraints make handguns efficient at few other tasks. In a pinch you could use the butt of a handgun as a hammer. I can't find any data about them being used for that purpose. I can only wander onto a construction site and count the number of firearms in toolboxes as a general sample size.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Neither the hammer nor the firearm is "just" a tool. They are tools that are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>optimized</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for a purpose. We can study that purpose, and cast judgements about a tool's safety, merits, and need to be regulated based on that. Firearm advocates oppose this process through neutralizing language because it's difficult to dispute the correlation between the number of guns versus the number of murders and assaults with guns in a geographic area.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Generative AI proponents sometimes regurgitate that language when defending this new technology. Because like the gun lobby, they don't want the purpose of generative AI decided by its outcomes, only its potential.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What is that purpose? It may be the death of truth itself.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Generative AI is broadly used to deceive through mimicry">Generative AI is broadly used to deceive through mimicry</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Generative AI is a tool for deception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's not what its biggest backers will tell you.

		<p>It’s barely been out a day, but the internet has had its say on Elden Ring Nightreign, and it’s said, “Ooh missus, it’s a bit hard when I’m playing by myself.”</p>
<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are listening and have announced an upcoming patch that will include “improvements for solo expeditions”, specifically that “the effect “Automatic Revival Upon Defeat”, which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.” Additionally, the amount of runes gained will be increased.&nbsp;The Nightreign patch will also include the usual round of bug fixes and improvements,</p>


<p>From Software also revealed that they had sold 2 million copies of the game in a single day.</p>
<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign has not gathered the universal acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic.&nbsp;</a> We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jim saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>


<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> revealed a lot about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">now-canceled Black Panther game</a> from EA and Cliffhanger Studios. The report discusses a number of the challenges the game faced in its four years of development and some details about what the game would have included if it had been able to get across the finish line.</p>
<p>According to Schreier's report, EA's decision to cancel Black Panther and close Cliffhanger Games came down to the game not being far enough along in its development. Sources told Schreier that executives at EA were "<em>frustrated</em>" with the game still being in its pre-production phase, and that even though the game had recently gained some momentum, it was all seemingly too little too late in the minds of EA's top brass.</p>
<p>As to why development was moving at a slower pace, the report points to two key factors, the first being the fact that since Cliffhanger was only founded in 2021, the studio was still in the process of expanding and scaling its team to support the development of a big triple-A Black Panther game. The other falls to the studio's ambitions with the game, which was to create a system similar to Monolith's famous Nemesis system, and the issues that come with developing procedural narrative games, and then showcasing the game to executives.</p>
<p>According to the report, the game "<em>was to feature various playable heroes from the comic-book universe, such as T’Challa, Killmonger and Shuri, all competing for the mantle of Black Panther</em>," and that Marvel's infamous shapeshifting aliens, the Skrulls, would have been allies to the heroes.</p>
<p>However, as Skrulls are known to do, some would have posed as allies, and "<em>others might have remembered the player’s behavior and acted accordingly</em>," which is where similarities to the nemesis system come into play.</p>
<p>But the slow progress in the game's development and EA executives seemingly not being able to see how the game would shape up led to the news that was revealed earlier this week, and EA's third <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">mass layoff</a> this year alone.</p>
<p>Despite Black Panther being canceled, both <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-and-marvels-collaboration-remains-strong-after-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-committed-to-making-three-games-based-on-marvel-characters/">EA and Marvel claim that their relationship "<em>remains strong</em>,"</a> and that EA will still develop three games based on Marvel characters, the first being Motive's Iron Man game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-never-too-late-to-talk-about-a-video-game.1203123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parrying-clair-obscur-ea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're sans Nathan on this week's Aftermath Hours, so Riley, Luke, and Isaiah intend to talk about a lot of topics, but mostly we can’t keep ourselves from talking about <em>Clair Obscur</em>, which everyone but me has finished. But we all agree that I'm far from having the missed the boat, and that there's still plenty of people out there who want to talk about games even once their launch hype dies down.</p><p>We start by talking about two stories Aftermath ran this week: <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one in favor of parrying in video games</a>, and one <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">against</a>. Those stories kicked off a flurry of discourse on social media, which we found mostly to be in good fun. We talk about how different those kinds of conversations feel now that we’re at Aftermath instead of a larger site, and ponder what it is about <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/clair-obscur-expedition-33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur</a>'s </em>parrying system that kicked off everybody's parrying opinions in the first place.</p><p>Then, we discuss <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this week’s layoffs at Electronic Arts</a>, which follow on the heels of <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>other</em> layoffs at Electronic Arts</a>. We wonder why several companies have run into trouble with licensed games, and we talk about the challenge of getting players excited about Marvel games when <a href="https://aftermath.site/marvel-thunderbolts-movie-im-so-tired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the MCU is facing its own uphill battle</a>.</p><p>Last, we talk about what games we’re playing lately. Luke goes through a lot of games <a href="https://aftermath.site/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-tactical-takedown-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he didn’t like</a> before landing on one he did, <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/9-kings-pc-roguelike-deckbuilder-impressions-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9 Kings</a></em>. I lament not playing <em>Clair Obscur</em> faster, so then we talk about that game a whole bunch more, and we debate whether it can ever be “too late” to talk about a video game. Working in games journalism sometimes skews our perspective about what it means to be part of the conversation around a game, but we all agree that Aftermath gives us a chance to talk about games at a pace that's more similar to regular players instead of people who do this for a living.</p><p>To close, we answer some mailbag questions about the best <a href="https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrestling moves</a>, what we’d do if we were CEO of EA, and who we trust to give us game recommendations. &nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank">Spotify</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

                <p>The Communications Workers of America, the union representing QA testers at ZeniMax, announced today that it has reached a tentative agreement on a labor contract with Microsoft. If implemented, this contract will be one of the first to go into effect at one of the big AAA game publishers.</p><p>Last month, the union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-and-zenimax-union-votes-to-authorize-a-strike/1100-6530524/" data-ref-id="1100-6530524">voted to authorize a strike</a> in response to challenges to the contract negotiation process; this agreement would avoid a strike from being carried out. In a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, CWA shared that the agreed contract would grant ZeniMax employees significantly increased protections and would raise pay across the board. It would also implement guidelines on the use of AI, restrict "arbitrary dismissal," and create processes to ensure that QA testers adequately receive credit in video games that they contribute to.</p><p>QA testing has been a hotspot of unionization efforts in the games industry, some of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-qa-workers-say-they-were-laid-off-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6524209/" data-ref-id="1100-6524209">have been targeted with union-busting efforts</a>. At ZeniMax, the QA testers' union represents around 300 employees and has been fighting for several years for this contract. In response to the agreement, Jessee Leese, a QA tester and union representative at ZeniMax, stated, "Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity. Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we all deserve."</p><p>In early 2023, ZeniMax employees created ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, a coalition of CWA units embedded in the company that was made possible under <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-formally-agrees-to-recognize-activision-blizzard-union/1100-6504549/" data-ref-id="1100-6504549">Microsoft's neutrality agreement with union activism.</a> Since then, unionization has expanded at Microsoft to include more teams; earlier in May, for instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-overwatch-team-has-unionized-were-not-just-a-number-on-an-excel-sheet/1100-6531438/" data-ref-id="1100-6531438">the Overwatch 2 team at Blizzard announced that it has fully unionized</a>. There are now over 2,000 unionized employees at Microsoft.</p><p>This contract still needs to complete several hurdles before it can be fully implemented. Now that both parties have tentatively agreed, the union will hold a series of explanation sessions for its members to learn about its provisions. Then, in late June, CWA expects to hold a ratification vote among its members.</p><p><i>Disclosure: The author of this article is a member of CWA by way of a graduate student union. </i></p>

<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but its requirements are even higher than what we've seen in most cases. According to the developers, you'll need a GeForce RTX 4090 to play at 4K resolution and 30 frames per second on Ultra settings. This is already with upscaling enabled, too.</p>

<p>The good news is that everyone can test Hell Is Us for themselves very soon. Rogue Factor also announced that a demo will be released on Steam, where it will be playable between June 2 and 16. Console users won't get any demo due to 'technical constraints'.</p>
<p>The demo starts right at the beginning of the game. This introduction is designed to ease players into Hell is Us and its core gameplay systems. It won't reveal everything that the full game has to offer; Rogue Factor said that some of the key elements, such as exploration and the evolving player experience, are best appreciated as the world opens up and the layers unfold.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Today, the studio also discussed the game's difficulty settings. It's meant to be a challenging experience, but there will be tweakable settings. There are three preset levels, and players can also choose a more granular control, customizing things like enemy health, enemy damage, enemy aggressiveness, and death penalty.</p>
<p>Hell Is Us will be released on September 4 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

		<p>In desperation, the extraordinary becomes possible.</p><p>It’s how I felt when <em>VICE</em> told me that seven years was, well, long enough. Many of my colleagues had started their own businesses, but I was not a business person. I can write, I can podcast, I can stream. Numbers? That’s what a calculator is for. Many times, I’ve stayed at a bad job because a bad job was better than hustling for a new one. </p><p><em>Own</em> my own company? No.</p><p>Except, over time, no became “maybe” and then with some nudging, maybe became “yes.” Two years later, one of the best things that ever happened to me was losing my job, striking out on my own, and owning fate. It’s weird to think that failure on your own terms is less of an existential threat than failure because some random executive decided they weren’t interested in your contributions anymore.</p><p>These moments go in cycles, and now, it’s <em>Polygon</em>’s turn.&nbsp;</p><p>In early May, the popular video game (and over time, like many others, entertainment) publication <em>Polygon</em> was acquired by a company of vultures known as Valnet. Nothing good comes from Valnet. Nothing good was going to come by Valnet buying <em>Polygon</em>. Naturally, Valnet’s first move as <em>Polygon</em>’s owner <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/polygon-sale-valnet/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>was to enact mass layoffs</u></a>. <em>Polygon</em> hasn’t been shut down, but it’s a fundamentally different place.</p><p>The thing about working at a big company is you often become more than colleagues with the people you work with but <em>friends</em>, folks you share interests and values with. It’s why we continued <em>Waypoint</em> as <em>Remap</em>, and why some from <em>Polygon</em> are headed down a similar path.</p><p>Just recently, former <em>Polygon</em> EIC Chris Plante launched (to much personal jealousy, as it’s long been an idea I’ve had, as well) <a href="https://postgame.substack.com/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>an <em>NPR</em>-style podcast called <em>Post Games</em>.</u></a> But today, I’m chatting with the folks behind another spin-off, and it’s an idea I haven’t seen tried before.</p><p>Ryan Gilliam and Jeffrey Parkin were, until recently, guides producers at <em>Polygon</em>. For years now, guides have been the financial underbelly of many websites, a mashup of tasty SEO bait that search engines like Google love <em>and</em> beloved by people who just want to know how to find that weird collectible in a game that they’ve spent an hour looking for.</p><p>Now, Gilliam and Parkin are launching<em> Big Friendly.Guide</em>, a publication <em>focused</em> on guides and trying to foster a community <em>around</em> guides. </p><p>Can it work? That’s what I decided to ask Gilliam.</p><p>Before we get to that conversation, though, here’s how to find and support <em>Big Friendly.Guide</em>, which obviously I'd recommend you do:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/bigfriendlyguide?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Patreon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Website</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=SYGY9ZEMZ5LBN&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>PayPal Donation</u></a></li><li><a href="http://ko-fi.com/bigfriendlyguide?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Ko-fi Donation</u></a></li></ul><p>Now, onto the interview.</p><p><em>The conversation below has been lightly edited.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@gpthree?ref=remapradio.com"><span>George Pagan III</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Remap: Talk me through that final day at <em>Polygon</em>. When did you realize things were going wrong, and when did you realize it was one of the worst case scenarios?</strong></p><p>Ryan Gilliam: I actually found out that the website was being sold first, through my other Union co-workers. I was scrolling through our Union Slack when I saw everyone saying their jobs were eliminated. Then I saw people from my team saying they were eliminated. And then looked at my DMs to see Jeff—my co-founder of <em>BigFriendly.Guide</em>, who was also a Guides Producer— telling me to check my email. And that's where I saw that I was also being eliminated. I was in the middle of getting footage for a Destiny guide I was about to write that morning.</p><p>The second I saw the sale, I was worried, because we had fought so long and hard for our Union contract, and I couldn't imagine a <em>Polygon</em> without it. And then the dread of seeing that it didn't matter ... it hit twice for me. The industry sucks, and I've survived more layoffs than I can count—we were up to like two a year there for a while—but <em>Polygon</em> was usually safe. And then inside that bubble, in guides, I felt as safe as possible. In all the bad ways I saw it going down, this wasn't even on the radar for me. It was shocking.</p><p><strong>Remap: I remember what it felt like when the <em>VICE</em> layoff happened: ah, well, it finally came for me. I felt numb. There have been so many layoffs at so many places that while it seemed inevitable I’d also get laid off, all that mental preparation made it difficult to process the reality of it. Where was your head at? Was there a moment that it all sunk in?</strong></p><p>Gilliam: I finally felt pretty safe. After a long, long time of worrying about making myself essential and all that, I had developed skills with the guides team that made me valuable. And I saw how important the guides engine was to the success of the site. There was no reality for me where <em>Polygon</em> would exist with fewer guides people than we had, as it was already a pretty lean team. And, somehow, we had all missed this possibility of a bloodbath sale. Nobody I talked to was prepared or thought this was how it would go down. We thought, if anything, we'd eventually get cut down to a small staff site and guides would churn in the background.</p><p>I used to say that guides would be like the <em>Polygon</em> cockroach, and that they'd move us to some obscure team on another website before they'd give up traffic for the next Persona, Animal Crossing, or GTA, but didn't exactly nail that one.</p>

Given just 30 minutes’ notice before the news was announced by EA in an internal meeting, the studio had apparently just recently successfully passed one of its development milestones and was working toward a vertical slice that would show a chunk of the game in action. </p><p>The story reportedly revolved around playing as T’Challa, Killmonger, or Shuri as each vied for the mantle of Black Panther which would grant them superhuman powers. The game would also feature fights with the shapeshifting Skrull showcased in Marvel’s popular <em>Secret Invasion</em> comic-book crossover event. The gameplay was also aiming to incorporate elements of the Nemesis system from <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> such that enemies might remember past encounters with the player and relationships with aspiring Black Panther rivals might evolve. </p><p>It appears the most likely reason EA may have decided to walk away from the project was the lack of progress after several years of prototyping, even as some of those laid off in Cliffhanger Games’ closure had only just arrived at the studio earlier this year as it scaled up its development capabilities. Several developers spoke up about the project online this week following its cancelation. </p><p>“Well, it was a good run while it lasted,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ted-snook-9235602_well-it-was-a-good-run-while-it-lasted-activity-7333598980263624704-tG2t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB9jAJMBKn6avI14nm0RQ2Himw8u2luEWC0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ted-snook-9235602_well-it-was-a-good-run-while-it-lasted-activity-7333598980263624704-tG2t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB9jAJMBKn6avI14nm0RQ2Himw8u2luEWC0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span> software engineer Ted Snook. “Found out today that Cliffhanger Games is shut down by EA.

			<p>The ZeniMax Workers United union, representing more than 300 quality assurance developers working at ZeniMax Media under Microsoft, has reached a tentative deal after two years of negotiating.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">press release</a> from the Communications Workers of America (CWA) calls it a "<em>historic</em>" agreement. The ZeniMax Workers United-CWA is the first union formed after <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">Microsoft agreed</a> to take a neutral stance on its employees' unionizing when it was trying to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, to have a deal, even a tentative one, in place.</p>
<p>This deal also comes almost two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unionized-microsoft-developers-authorize-strike-after-failing-to-reach-a-deal-after-two-years-of-negotiations/">ZeniMax Workers United-CWA voted to authorize strike powers</a> for its negotiating committee. When the ZWU-CWA voted to authorize strike powers, representatives of the union voiced their displeasure with Microsoft dragging its feet at the bargaining table, with union member Zachary Armstrong saying "<em>None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is</em>."</p>
<p>The ZWU-CWA did just that and, according to the press release, negotiated a tentative deal that includes "<em>substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers.</em> " It also includes "<em>protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a crediting policy that clearly acknowledges the QA workers' contributions to the video games they help create.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>QA workers from across the country continue to lead the charge for industry-wide change,</em>" said ZWU-CWA bargaining committee member and senior QA tester Page Branson. "<em>Going toe-to-toe with one of the largest corporations in the world isn't a small feat. This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after</em>."</p>
<p>Fellow ZWU-CWA bargaining committee member and QA tester Jessee Leese added, "<em>Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity. Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we deserve. Our first contract is an invitation for video game professionals everywhere to take action. We're the ones who make these games, and we'll be the ones to set new standards for fair treatment</em>."</p>
<p>Now that a tentative deal has been reached, it is expected to be ratified by June 20, according to the ZWU-CWA. Once that's done, it'll officially be the beginning of a new era for QA workers at ZeniMax. After that, the other unions that have formed under Microsoft since it signed a union neutrality agreement that do not have a deal in place are the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA</a>, <a href="https://code-cwa.org/news/workers-bethesda-game-studios-achieve-union">One BGS USA</a>, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">One BGS Montreal</a>, <a href="https://x.com/WeAreGWA">Game Workers Alliance at Raven Software</a>, and the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild-CWA</a>.</p>

It is the first contract agreement at Microsoft since the concerted effort to unionize the video game industry began roughly four years ago.</p><p>“This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after,” said Page Branson, a senior QA tester at ZeniMax, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">in the press release announcing the agreement</a>. A ratification vote for the contract will take place in late June.</p><p>The union, organized by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), was formed in 2023 and was voluntarily recognized by Microsoft as a part of the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/6/23543005/microsoft-washington-post-ad-cwa-unions">labor neutrality agreement with the CWA</a>. In the two years since, the union and Microsoft engaged in contract negotiations that precipitated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295556/video-game-developer-strike-zenimax-microsoft">a one-day strike</a> to protest return to office and outsourcing policies and, in April, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote">strike authorization vote</a>.</p><p>The contract details offer up a glimpse of what workers across the industry are fighting for and what they can win. According to CWA’s press release, the contract guarantees wage increases — a big deal considering QA workers are some of the lowest-paid workers in the industry. The contract will also include protections against arbitrary dismissal, as well as crediting guidelines — another big deal, as there are numerous ways a person who worked on a video game <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129">can get left off its credits</a>. </p><p>While the industry’s organization efforts are ongoing, there’s been a surge in activity over the last four years. Workers at Raven Software, which was then a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard before its acquisition by Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/21/22894964/activision-blizzard-raven-software-employees-create-game-workers-alliance-union">organized the first video game union at a AAA publisher in 2022</a>. That win kicked off a series of other high-profile unionization efforts across the industry but concentrated primarily within Microsoft — ostensibly to take advantage of the labor neutrality agreement that states that Microsoft will voluntarily recognize union efforts within the company. With ZeniMax workers finally winning a contract agreement at Microsoft, the industry has another first — one that will set a precedent for future negotiations.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A lot of <em>Polygon</em>’s staff was laid off following Vox Media’s sale of the publication to Valnet, but two of its former guides writers are launching their own guides-focused website: <em>Big Friendly Guide</em>, which you can find at <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/">bigfriendly.guide</a>. Ryan Gilliam and Jeffrey Parkin founded and are co-owners of the site.</p><p>Guides make Gilliam “feel like I’m helping someone enjoy something that’s very important to me and I know is important to them,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “And so when I lost the opportunity to do that at my usual 9-to-5, I wanted to continue it.”</p><p>“I hate sounding immodest or bragging, but what Ryan and I got really good at was helping people play video games,” Parkin says. Their work on guides helps people have fun with games, he adds — and assists with things like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-guide/23728443/giant-white-stallion-horse-god-find-tame">getting a giant horse in <em>Zelda</em></a>.</p><p><em>Big Friendly Guide</em> will make most of its content available for free, and the guides themselves won’t be paywalled. But Gilliam and Parkin will also be opening a Patreon for the site as a way for people to support the work, which will also give people access to a Discord. There will be a weekly podcast that’s free for everyone and a monthly subscriber-only podcast where Gilliam and Parkin will discuss their coverage plans.</p><p>There will be ads on the site to start. “For now, at least, we’ll run ads to keep the lights on,” according to the site’s <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/about-us/">About Us page</a>.) But the focus is more on building a community that trusts Gilliam and Parkin’s work and pays to support it. In addition to working on guides for games that interest them, Gilliam and Parkin want the community to make suggestions for guides that they can consider and respond to.</p><p>The release of <em>Big Friendly Guide</em> is just the latest outlet from <em>Polygon</em> staffers: former editor-in-chief Chris Plante launched <a href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-award-that-changes-the-lives">the <em>Post Games</em> podcast</a> and former curation editor Pete Volk launched <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/petevolk.bsky.social/post/3lootykftkk2v">the <em>PV Guide</em> newsletter</a>. The new outlets follow the rise of other indie gaming publications like <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/nicole-carpenter"><em>Aftermath</em></a> and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview"><em>Game File</em></a>.</p><p>With <em>Big Friendly Guide</em>, Gilliam and Parkin have modest expectations. “We’re not looking to build a brand and sell it or anything,” Parkin says. “I don’t think either of us want to get particularly rich. We want to keep doing this. That’s really what it comes down to.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’ll sometimes have an Abductor Virgin enemy on the base level, but will more often have a quick and simple fight against a knight boss at the top. Behind the boss will be a chest that you can open, which has a good chance of containing a Stonesword Key.</li><li><strong>Medium Castles</strong>: You’ll also sometimes find medium-sized castles that are gated off and require you to enter via the sewers at the very bottom of the structure. Here, you can make your way up the wooden stairs inside to find a room halfway up containing a group of enemies. A side room here has a chest that may contain a Stonesword Key.</li><li><strong>Ruined Cathedrals</strong>: Not to be confused with the small cathedrals where you find flask upgrades, ruined cathedrals are large, broken structures that are hard to miss. You’ll encounter basic enemies here, as well as a boss located either near the altar or by dropping down a hole in the center. Bosses aside, just defeat any nearby foes and check behind the altar in the center of the cathedral for a chest that has a solid chance of dropping a Stonesword Key for you.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to track down some extra Stonesword Keys, get out there and beat some ass at the gaols. Just don’t be surprised if one day you open up a gaol and get a whole lot more than you bargained for…ut that’s a discussion for another day!</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since then, we've heard very little until <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-remembers-splinter-cell-exists-by-adding-steam-achievements-to-a-12-year-old-game"><u>Ubisoft remembered Splinter Cell existed by adding Steam achievements to a 12-year-old game just a couple of weeks ago</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If we're honest, today's tease doesn't provide much more information — we've got a close-up of Sam Fisher's face and a hashtag, Splinter Cell — but interestingly, the alt description is a little more revealing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Close-up of Sam Fisher from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-chaos-theory">Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</a>, showing a stern expression with focused eyes, short dark hair, and a rugged beard, set against a blurred high-tech background," the description explains. "He's locked in."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr">👁️👄👁️<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SplinterCell?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SplinterCell</a> <a href="https://t.co/Uh47DxdNQu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Uh47DxdNQu</a></p>— Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1928421132438224990?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's also interesting that Ubisoft specifies this screenshot is from Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, and not from the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-remake"><u>Splinter Cell Remake</u></a>, so make of that what you will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Splinter Cell series is set to sneak back into action with a remake of the classic first game in the franchise, Splinter Cell Remake. We still don't know very much about it other than the new version will be built from the ground up using the advanced Snowdrop engine. Our last meaningful update came in 2022 when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splinter-cell-remake-we-finally-get-an-update-unlocked-571"><u>IGN met with Ubisoft Toronto developers to discuss their design philosophy behind the game</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“20 years later, we can look back at the plot, the characters, the overall story of the game [and] make some improvements — things that might not have aged particularly well,” said creative director Chris Auty at the time. “But the core of the story, the core of the experience will remain as it was in the original game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Ubisoft is priming fans for a Summer Game Fest announcement, but without confirmation, it's hard to know for sure. On the plus side, we don't have too long to wait — Summer Game Fest and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-partners-announced"><u>IGN Live</u></a> are right around the corner. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series"><u>The Last of US Season 2</u></a> will be at IGN Live, as well as Sonic Team, Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2, Norse: Oath of Blood, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
