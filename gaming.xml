            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford admits he's a "little nervous" about Borderlands 4's "more challenging" difficulty.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/">Insider Gaming</a>, Pitchford acknowledged that "a lot" of Borderland players "aren't interested in deep, hard challenges", adding "we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics".</p>

<p>"We have lots of players that actually aren't interested in deep, hard challenges; lots of people that love just exploring the Borderlands or spending time with the characters," Pitchford said.</p>
<p>"I'm a little nervous because there are points of Borderlands 4 that are more challenging, but one of the coolest things about Borderlands 4, because of the nature of the RPG, is if anything is a little challenging for you, you can just grind somewhere and level up and become more powerful.</p>
<p>"You will find that things that were hard when you were a little chump will become trivial when you become a badass. But we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics."</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 was announced last August, and we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">finally got a first look at the looter-shooter sequel</a> when The Game Awards rolled around in December.

                <p dir="ltr">Philipp Batura didn’t expect one of his most successful designs to be a giant red bow. Simple and cartoonishly oversized, the Big Hair Bow became one of Roblox’s biggest fashion hits during Christmas, selling more than 455,000 copies and generating over $150,000 in revenue.</p><p dir="ltr">"What's funny is that it's such a simple design, but that's probably why it worked," Batura told GameSpot via email. "It appealed to a wide audience. I remember logging into games and seeing it on so many players, and I still spot it in YouTube and TikTok videos."</p><p dir="ltr">It's a story that illustrates how Roblox fashion works and why it's so different from the real-world fashion industry. In Milan or Paris, designers might obsess over silhouettes or fabric innovation. In Roblox, the fashion ecosystem moves at the speed of memes, and sometimes the winning accessory isn't high-concept at all; it's a giant bow anyone can slap onto their avatar.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554670-banner_10_hairbow.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554670" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554670-banner_10_hairbow.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554670"></a><figcaption>The Big Red Bow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554670-banner_10_hairbow.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Batura, who goes by Topcat in Roblox, didn't enter the User Generated Content Creator program expecting to become a digital fashion powerhouse. He has, in a way, since he leads a full-time team of modelers and a rigger that help him design multiple items a day. When he first started selling avatar accessories in early 2023, he gravitated toward tongue-in-cheek ideas inspired by internet culture.</p><p dir="ltr">"The weirdest design I made that sold well was the SIGMA Chain," he wrote. "It was part of my very first UGC drop in early 2023 and ended up getting over 13,000 sales. That moment was a turning point--it made me realize this could be more than just something I did for fun. It could be a real business."</p><p dir="ltr">That business began with meme-driven accessories like the Mr. Peebles Head--a giant cat head--and the Rizz Frame, a literal frame you wore around your face. They were funny, eye-catching, and briefly popular. But Batura soon realized the downside.</p><p dir="ltr">"While meme-based items might spike in popularity, they aren't a sustainable niche," he said. "So I pivoted toward streetwear, which allowed for more consistent results and long-term growth."</p><p dir="ltr">At first glance, it might seem strange that the bow outperformed more complex or trendy designs. But in Roblox, simplicity is a superpower. Players want items that work across multiple outfits and social settings. The bow managed to be playful without being tied to a specific meme or cultural reference, making it endlessly adaptable.</p><p dir="ltr">It also didn't hurt that it dropped during the Christmas season, when the Roblox avatar shop is flooded with players looking for festive ways to dress up. Big, bright, and jolly, the bow was the right item at the right time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554671-10_banner_team.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554671" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554671-10_banner_team.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554671"></a><figcaption>Topcat and his team.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554671-10_banner_team.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And once enough players picked it up, it became inescapable. Roblox fashion spreads not just through the in-game store, but through visibility in popular experiences, streamers' avatars, TikTok edits, and YouTube skits. The bow wasn't just an item--it was a trend, woven into Roblox culture.</p><p dir="ltr">The success of the Big Hair Bow underscores how Roblox fashion has matured into its own industry. The UGC program has empowered thousands of independent designers to create and sell virtual clothing, and with hundreds of millions of monthly users on the platform, the audience is massive.</p><p dir="ltr">For some, like Batura, it has become a career. The fact that one digital accessory can generate six-figure sales is a reminder that digital fashion isn't a novelty; it's an economy. Roblox has seen collaborations with luxury brands like Gucci, Ralph Lauren, and Nike, but the real pulse of its fashion world comes from homegrown creators. They move quickly, understand the platform's culture, and know when to trade high-concept ideas for something as straightforward as a bow.</p><p dir="ltr">"Seeing something I created become part of the culture like that has been incredibly rewarding," he wrote. While it may amuse Batura that his most iconic creation is essentially a cartoon bow, it's fitting. Roblox fashion is democratic and often surprising. Success doesn't always come from complexity--sometimes it comes from knowing what players will actually want to wear.</p><p dir="ltr">For Topcat, that realization has transformed a hobby into a livelihood. For Roblox, it's another reminder that in the world of digital fashion, anyone--with the right idea--can become the next big trendsetter.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read more: The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-lawsuit-louisiana-statement-children-safety/1100-6534061/" data-ref-id="1100-6534061">latest developments in the controversy involving Roblox</a>.</em></p>

            <p>David Hayter – the original voice behind one of gaming's biggest characters, Snake – says portraying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s stealthy creation "was the definitive role in [his] life", and if he was asked to reprise the role, he'd be "down" to voice him again.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/mgs-delta-snake-eater-voice-talent-interview">Inverse</a> alongside fellow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> voice actors Lori Alan and Cynthia Harrell, Hayter – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/solid-snake-voice-actor-david-hayter-throws-shade-on-hideo-kojima">who was dropped from the role and replaced by Kiefer Sutherland for the fifth instalment, The Phantom Pain</a> – called it "the definitive role in [his] life".</p>

<p>"Anytime they ask me to be Snake, I'm in," Hayter said. "It's the definitive role in my life. It's so complex and so profound, and there are so many different aspects to both him and Big Boss. So anytime it comes up, I’m down.</p><p>"I get so many people coming up to me now saying, I just got into Metal Gear last year because of the Master Collection, and it's so cool to see 18-year-old fans and younger kids discovering it for the first time," the award-winning Hollywood writer added. "A great game should be like a great movie or like a great album – it should live on. And a lot of times, because consoles and technology change, a lot of great games disappear. And so I'm just grateful that Konami is behind this in the way they are."</p>
<p>That said, if given the opportunity, Hayter was candid enough to acknowledge he wouldn't have minded re-recording some of Snake's lines for the remake.</p>
<p>"I do feel that I'm a little better of an actor now than I was then," he admitted. "It was fine back in the day, but I would have loved to bring some of the knowledge that I've picked up over the past 20 years to it. But you don't want the controller lines to be better acted all of a sudden, because that'll take you out of the game.</p>
<p>"I've been working in Hollywood for quite some time now,” he added. "This is a beloved franchise, a huge world with massive worldwide appeal. So I'm never surprised when something like this comes back. But I didn't anticipate it would be this. But to start with, Snake Eater is very cool, because it's generally considered the pinnacle of Metal Gear.”</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-secret-mode-was-developed-by-platinum-games">We recently learned that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has brought back the secret Guy Savage mode</a>. But it wasn't made by Konami alone – Platinum Games, perhaps best known for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and Astral Chain series, is responsible for the surprise action minigame.</p>
<p>Connor had a great time with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">awarding it five out of five stars in our review</a>, writing: "A legend is brought back to life with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, in a surprisingly sensitive remake from Konami featuring developers from the original."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The trench-ridden battlefields of Napoleonic Europe were never going to be a nice place to wake up in. Turns out they’re much worse when mutated mashups of former soldiers and gruesome, blistered horrors also trudge through its mud. Valor Mortis places you right in the thick of it, and trusts that your skill with a blade, pistol, and superpowered palm will ensure you make it through alive. Despite being rooted in the fundamentals of the Soulslike genre, it adopts a non-conventional first-person perspective, which not only fully immerses you in this horrifying world but also adds an additional layer of precision and satisfaction to its parrying, slashing, and sharp-shooting combat. And while I found that its battles can be tough, during my time playing it at gamescom 2025, I found several signs this won’t be as punishing an exercise as can be found elsewhere in the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Face down in mud, Valor Mortis’ protagonist William hears the words of his general, Napoleon Bonaparte, echoing in his ears and telling him to get up. Dozens of corpses line the forest path ahead as a tattered French flag droops in presumed defeat. No other context is given as to how we’ve ended up here, but the infamous emperor <em>is</em> insisting that I get up, so I do exactly that and trudge on ahead. Initially armed with a sword and the ability to perform a block, parry, dodge, and both light and heavy attacks, there’s nothing initially revolutionary about developer One More Level’s new project, which has slowed its Ghostrunner melee action to a much more deliberate pace here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Valor Mortis Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The swordplay may not be too different, but it remains incredibly enjoyable to take part in. Blocking doesn’t completely negate damage, so the timings of your parries become your best bet for quickly dispatching your opponent. There’s a wonderful metallic clang that rings out when you get it just right, followed by a momentary shift into slow motion that reminds me of Dishonored’s equally gratifying maneuver. I later find a pistol nestled in an ornate trunk decorated with a portrait of Bonaparte himself. Further adding to the Dunwall of it all, this centuries-old sidearm hands me a ranged option, albeit one with a limited supply of bullets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then things get a bit weird as a dash of the supernatural is added to my arsenal in the form of a burst of flames I can project straight out of my palm. This flamethrower ability will look familiar to anyone who has guzzled a shot of one of Bioshock’s tonics. It’s a delightfully explosive skill that helped me deal with crowd control, and even inflict a burning state on the demo’s boss (much more on him later). There are definitely aspects of the two aforementioned immersive sims here, but I wouldn’t go in expecting anywhere near the flexibility in its combat system as you may find in one of Arkane’s or Irrational’s games. This is fundamentally still a Soulslike that relies heavily on one-to-one melee encounters while delicately managing your stamina gauge, so I wouldn’t expect to be mixing elemental effects and creating chaos of your own design here. Aside from the odd opportunity to sneak up on one of your opponents and skewer them deliciously from behind, the demo’s options when entering combat rarely stretched beyond toe-to-toe duels.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fans of the genre’s traditional disgusting foes also appear to be well catered for.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The creatures I fought across this 45-minute sample can all, to varying degrees, be described as being rooted in some sort of humanity. What starts out as lowly infantry staggering around like the undead made way for more interesting enemies the deeper I pushed on. I found an optional area, unlocked via blasting a glowing structural weak point with the pistol, where I was greeted by a foreboding duelist who gracefully stepped towards, his haunted manner only emphasised by an emotionless metal mask. His attacks were fast and health bar-ravaging, and his parry windows tight – I quickly decided that he was a challenge for another day. I almost made it halfway through this preview without mentioning Bloodborne, but the speed and thrust of his blade did remind me of one of Yharnam’s Hunter threats. An elevated challenge, but not quite a true boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the genre’s traditional disgusting foes also appear to be well catered for, as there are also many more mutated, monster-like enemies. Though all still appear to be clinging onto their former selves — army uniforms hang off of them, or human heads (sometimes multiple) watch your movements closely — they are very much not of this world, or at least how early 19th century Europe is depicted in history books, at least. A mysterious plague has infected the battlefields, creating these aberrations that can pose quite a challenge. One such brute appeared to be two soldiers conjoined together, who also happened to have grown an extra arm and developed a massively oversized, meaty, clawed hand. He took swipes at me at close range, but enjoyed nothing more than throwing explosive cinders if I stepped too far back. Luckily, a big ol’ glowing red sack looked ready to pop where his elbow should be, so I aimed a few pistol rounds at it to take advantage of his weak point.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But he was outclassed by another, far more horrendous-looking entity. The demo’s final boss was General Lothaire, The Eagle Bearer, a man-mountain of a bastard with a comically normal-sized head that I would have laughed at more if it hadn’t been for the three guns pointing at me that emerged from his fleshy, contorted right shoulder. Dual-wielding a sweeping flagpole and slicing cutlass, his reach was vast and the hits heavy. I’ll freely admit it took me a fair few attempts to take him down, but after a few upgrades at a nearby rekindled Lantern (this universe’s version of the classic Dark Souls bonfire), I managed to take him down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, his first form anyway. Yes, One More Level has decided to take the piss and give the very first boss of Valor Mortis a second phase. This version of Lothaire still has a deadly mix of ranged and close attacks that keep you on your toes, but also packs the ability to summon annoying minions and capture you in his clawed clutches. He’s tricky, but thankfully, nothing overly difficult for anyone trained in this genre of combat.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Crucially, upon dying your collected catalysts are dropped at the outside perimeter of boss arenas.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But to those who are relatively new to Soulslikes, or even find first-person combat a challenge, Valor Mortis is lenient… to a certain extent. Catalysts are your resource upgrade here, and you can use them to level up your stats at what seems to be a reasonably cheap cost. I pumped points into getting a bigger stamina bar, as a few quick stabs can quickly drain your initial meter, and it made overcoming the boss a much more manageable affair. Crucially, though, upon dying, your collected catalysts are dropped at the outside perimeter of boss arenas, not through the murky, smoky gate that precedes them. One More Level doesn’t want you to have to grind elsewhere in its world in order to progress, and this offer of saving you a little frustration, combined with special traits that can be unlocked through exploration that utilises a little of parkour design the studio perfected in Ghostrunner (you can swing from trees, for instance) all come together to help you feel more powerful more quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo ended as I finally took down Lothaire, the words “Abomination Eradicated” filling the screen. I imagine there are many more abominations to be dealt with, though, if Valor Mortis’ reveal trailer is anything to go by. All in all, I had a very satisfying time with it, finding its blend of first-person swordplay and superpowered magic abilities an enjoyable power trip. I look forward to digging deeper into what secrets its combat suite may have in store and taking on more of those abominations with it when Valor Mortis arrives sometime in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a75b1c24fbd6f/chibi-robo-park-patrol-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's time to plug into another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-super-adventure-island-snes">Last time</a>, we matched up a trio of covers for the SNES classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_adventure_island">Super Adventure Island</a>, with the three regions opting for vastly different designs. The disparity wasn't enough to drastically split the vote, mind you, as the golden Japanese variant walked away with a comfortable 76% of the votes, leaving North America with 16% and Europe with a diddly 9%.</p>
<p>This time, to celebrate <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>'s arrival on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-this-week">GameCube NSO library</a>, we're taking a look at the oft-forgotten DS sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/chibi_robo_park_patrol">Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol</a>. Once again putting you in the metallic shoes of the tiny robot protagonist, this handheld adventure was all about making a sweet little garden, by planting seeds, watering roots and getting rid of nasty Smogling pollution. In short, it was really rather sweet.</p>
<p>The game never received a European release, which means there are just two designs to choose from today. Let's get into it.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:3451,186410 @ 1756037794 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6cbaad5035a94/chibi-robo-park-patrol-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6413-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right off the bat, the North American design tells you everything that you need to know about this DS entry. Our titular robo takes centre stage with his water pistol, running across the grass and dwarfed by the giant game logo — a nice indication of his diminished stature, we'd say. All this is capped off by some creepy flowers and fauna in the foreground, making everything look that bit smaller. <em>Neat</em>!</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5be9b77e35a56/chibi-robo-park-patrol-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6413-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese design swings for something different. We get the same Chibi-Robo sprite, but his garden is nowhere to be seen. Instead, the stripped-back background shows colourful little flower sketches, with the blocky logo redesign running along the bottom. There is a patch of grass to be found in the lower portion of the frame, but it's not as in-your-face as the NA variant.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Change is coming with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> looked to redefine the open world experience and catching mechanics of the series, Z-A is bringing a huge overhaul of the combat. Gone is the turn-based battling, in favour of running around battle arenas in real time.</p>
<p><iframe title="[UK] Mega Victreebel: The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GLrHQZF7IKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We sampled two sections of Pokémon Legends: Z-A at Gamescom, starting with a preview of the Battle Zone gameplay. During the day, Lumiose City is a shining beacon of peace and harmony, the metropolitan area being completely overhauled to feature Wild Zones for Pokémon, so that they can better coexist with humans –&nbsp;just don’t think about it too much, and you’ll be fine. But at night, Pokémon trainers emerge to engage in the Z-A Royale at designated Battle Zones, like they’re underground street racers, or something.</p>


<p>We’re introduced to this by Urbain, Naveen and Lida from Team MZ, a group that has taken it upon themselves to protect the city, and is there to guide you through these first nighttime battles.</p>
<p>It boils down to being an area and time dedicated to trainer battles. Other trainers will be hanging around in the Battle Zone waiting to challenge you as you come into view, though if you’re able to sneak up behind them, you’ll be able to launch an early surprise attack and gain an advantage.</p>


<p>So far, so Pokémon, but the battles themselves have a completely different feel thanks to the shift to real-time combat. You only fight with one Pokémon at a time, calling them out and then targeting and launching attacks and abilities as and when you please. These are then on a cooldown, but you can launch their other abilities while waiting for another one to recharge. As you give out your commands, they’ll leap into action, getting close enough to launch their attacks before returning to your side.</p>
<p>Being in real time and with free movement means that you’re also able to actively try to evade the attacks and abilities of your opponent’s Pokémon. This took me a little getting used to –&nbsp;think I was pressing to run instead of to dodge roll by mistake – but I managed to dodge some slower moving web attacks, and the like.</p>

<p>It’s a really big shift for the franchise, that’s for sure, and has allowed for some major new game modes to be added alongside the regular battles. Just last week <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/18/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-chaotic-4-player-battles-in-the-z-a-battle-club/">the four-player time-based Z-A Battle Club</a> was announced, for example, while we also got to try a battle against a Rogue Mega Evolution Pokémon.</p>
<p>As part of a story moment where Team MZ is following a Zygard who really wants to lead you to something, we’re bundled into a battle with an Absol who’s being wracked by an unwanted Rogue Mega Evolution –&nbsp;they definitely saw this disaster coming! Thankfully the towering figure of ZA returning just in time to lend you his Lucario and a Mega Ring to aid in this fight.</p>
<p>Much like the regular real-time battles, you have free movement and can launch attacks as soon as they’re ready, with Lucario launching themselves into the fray. As you deal damage to Rogue Mega Evolved creature, they drop Mega Orbs that you’ll need to collect in order to charge up your Mega Ring and give Lucario their own Mega Evolution, letting them deal much more damage with their attacks.</p>

<p>There’s a nice back and forth here, as you can continue to run around and grab Mega Orbs, extending the time that Lucario can spend in their Mega form. You just need to be a little careful because, while you don’t have a health bar of your own, you can take damage and be KO’d yourself –&nbsp;this has the edges of the screen darken as a warning, but thankfully you will heal up again in a short span of time. Another thing to know is that using items is also on a cooldown, though opening the inventory screen does seem to pause the game in single player.</p>
<p>Playing these two battle experiences has me really looking forward to Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Jumping from turn-based to real-time battles is a big risk and will absolutely change the feel of the game compared to the classic, but once again, we’re getting closer to the style of battle that we see in the anime, running around, dodging attacks and giving your Pokémon commands. It’s a great shift that could easily define the next decade of Pokémon games.</p>

The new artwork by Matt Ferguson and Florey looks beautiful. The cigar box has a large silhouette of Jack Torrance with the fireman's axe overlooking (sorry) the Overlook Hotel. On the back is Jack's typewriter, and there are even words on the paper--likely the same sentence over and over again. The artwork on the steelbook case recreates the scene where Jack trudges through the hedge maze.</p><p>The steelbook artwork is also featured on the double-sided movie poster. The other side is a retouched version of Saul Bass' well-known poster that was created for The Shining's 1980 theatrical release. The eight art cards showcase memorable shots from the film as well as behind-the-scenes production photographs.</p><hr><p>If you're unfamiliar with The Film Vault, it's a series of collectible editions of classic movies from the Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures film catalogs. The Film Vault was created in 2022 by Vice Press, a UK company specializing in officially licensed movie collectibles and artwork. All of the 4K Blu-rays released by The Film Vault are region-free discs, but as a UK company, these limited-edition versions of all-time classics aren't regularly found at US retailers. We suspect The Shining is exclusive to Walmart in the US.</p><hr><h3><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Preorder+The+Shining+Film+Vault+Special+Edition+At+Walmart+Before+It%27s+Gone&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-08-24+01%3A47%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-24+01%3A48%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534223&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F17217022233%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-shining-the-film-vault-special-edition-steelbook-4k-blu-ray-walmart%2F1100-6534223%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Film Vault: The Shining Steelbook Edition</a></h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4555476-theshiningfilmvaultlimitedlandscape.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555476" data-ratio="0.393" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4555476-theshiningfilmvaultlimitedlandscape.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555476"></a><figcaption>The Shining Solus Steelbook Edition by Vice Press &amp; Warner Bros.

This beautiful slipcase collection was designed by M/M Paris and published by Taschen earlier this year.</p><p>Written by J.W. Rinzler and edited by Pixar director Lee Unkrich, this compendium is based on hundreds of hours of interviews and mountains of investigative research. The first book, which includes an introduction by Steven Spielberg, chronicles every step of the production. When I received my copy earlier this year, I was astounded by the level of detail provided throughout the roughly 900-page hardcover book. If there's a more thorough making-of book about a single movie, I would be shocked. This book is nearly as long as all three volumes in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074BR92QR?binding=hardcover&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rinzler's The Making of Star Wars series</a>, which is also fantastic.</p><p>The box set also comes with a gorgeous scrapbook filled with a wide array of photographs, artwork, and documents related to the production of The Shining. </p><p>To put it simply: This compendium is the best collection of behind-the-scenes material--across any medium--I've ever read.</p><p>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is in stock at Amazon for $124, but it's unknown how many copies the publisher printed and whether it will receive additional print runs. Amazon sold out when preorders opened last summer, and the box set remained out of stock until a few months ago.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shining-the-film-vault-special-edition-steelbook-4k-blu-ray-walmart/1100-6534223/">Preorder The Shining Film Vault Special Edition At Walmart Before It's Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discontinued-arcade1up-countercade-randomly-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6534222/">Discontinued Arcade1Up Countercade Randomly Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-world-pixel-art-model-gets-rare-price-cut-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6525283/">Lego Super Mario World Pixel Art Model Gets Rare Price Cut At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-walmart-amazon-restock/1100-6530578/">SanDisk 512GB MicroSD Express For Switch 2 Is Only $78 At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-four-discontinued-donkey-kong-lego-sets-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6532560/">Retired Donkey Kong Lego Sets In Stock And Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-controller-for-switch-2-gets-limited-time-amazon-deal/1100-6529695/">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller For Switch 2 Gets Limited-Time Amazon Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/retired-lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-71431-amazon-restock-deal/1100-6531375/">Retired Lego Bowser Muscle Car Is Only $24 At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-original-movie-trilogy-preorder-new-4k-blu-ray-limited-edition/1100-6533998/">TMNT Trilogy Limited Edition Revealed - 4K Restorations And New Bonus Content</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-cod-next-2025-%E2%80%94call-of-duty-next-schedule-where-to-watch-and-predictions.1279122/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>COD NEXT, the monumental event that unravels the short-term future of the Call of Duty franchise, sits firmly on the horizon. It’s set to drop in a matter of weeks, unveiling everything coming in Black Ops 7 and beyond. This will follow the latest trailer and preview that was showcased during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when COD NEXT 2025 will take place or how to watch COD NEXT when it surfaces, read on. I’ve got all the information you need, including predictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-cod-next-2025-being-streamed">When is COD NEXT 2025 Being Streamed?</h2>



<p><strong>COD NEXT will be streamed live on September 30, 2025. </strong>It’s set to feature several hours of Call of Duty content and will almost certainly boast the usual arrangement of COD creators and pro players streaming the game from a centralized location.</p>



<p>COD NEXT 2025 is set to take place in <strong>Las Vegas</strong>, and in typical COD NEXT fashion, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll see trailers</a>, gameplay walkthroughs, and dev panels unfold during the event. The insights will be unparalleled, and we’ll come away from COD NEXT with all the knowledge we’ll need for Black Ops 7, which will be released worldwide on November 14.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-cod-next-2025">Where to Watch COD NEXT 2025</h2>



<p>The best place to watch COD NEXT 2025 is, as always, via the official Call of Duty channels. Every year, Call of Duty NEXT rewards viewers with exclusive drops that they can redeem in-game, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Beta codes</li>



<li>Double XP tokens</li>



<li>Exclusive charms, skins, sprays, or emblems</li>
</ul>







<p>Here are the links you’ll need to watch COD NEXT:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/callofduty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty on YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/callofduty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty on Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Alternatively, you’ll be able to watch <strong>some </strong>of COD NEXT by tuning in to see if your favorite Call of Duty streamer is broadcasting live from the event in Las Vegas on September 30. This will afford you a first-person perspective of Black Ops 7, but you might miss things like the developer panels and trailers.</p>



<h2 id="h-cod-next-2025-predictions">COD NEXT 2025 Predictions</h2>



<p>It’s easy to predict that we’ll see stacks of Black Ops 7 multiplayer content at COD NEXT. We’ll likely explore the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-weapon-build-feature-makes-sharing-loadouts-easier/">create-a-class systems</a>, maps, modes (especially new ones like Skirmish), and potentially ‘extra’ deliverables like Ranked or the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7’s Zombies platform will be revealed in full, and like the multiplayer ecosystem, we could see some creator-driven activations that’ll allow Activision’s studios to dive deep into the fan-favorite mode.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that Warzone will also be explored at COD NEXT 2025. It’s the staging ground for anything related to Call of Duty, and with each new iteration, Warzone undergoes some dramatic changes. How will Warzone differ when Black Ops 7 comes around?</p>



<p>Finally, we’ll see a walkthrough of whatever content and updates are coming next for Call of Duty Mobile, which is by numbers the most popular COD game in the world.</p>



<p>What do you want to see most at COD NEXT 2025? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The 'Definitive Edition' launched earlier this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Before the arrival of the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> got a 'Definitive Edition' release on the Switch in March.</p>
<p>Although there have been no major updates for the game on this new platform (<em>at least yet</em>), it seems Nintendo has now identified an issue with the game on this particular device. As highlighted by Nintendo Everything, "voices may be out of sync in some areas" of the title.</p>
<p>This bug, which should be fixed in the future, follows reports earlier this year about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> apparently supporting a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1jfoucs/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition_games/">"hidden 60fps mode"</a>.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2 in June, Nintendo has been rolling out regular updates for various first-party Switch titles, enhancing the overall experience on the Switch 2. This included an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> in the same month, which made "several adjustments" to improve the gameplay on this platform.</p>
<p>You can find out more about Xenoblade Chronicles X for the Switch, and learn more about recent Switch game updates in our previous coverage:</p>

Although a bigger cast and new story might be the primary draw for fans, the studio says it made sure to tuck in more Easter Eggs to uncover, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original High on Life <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-includes-4-full-length-movies-and-new-justin-roiland-animated-shorts">famously included a few full-length movies</a> for players to watch if they knew where to look, and it sounds like High on Life 2 will take things a step further. Spano tells us that, in addition to “some surprising B+ tier movies,” the sequel introduces fully-emulated, playable video games. When originally asked which titles to include, Spano says one game came up before any others: Bible Adventures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes, you can play the whole thing,” Spano said of the officially licensed version included in High on Life 2. “And it's not the only emulated game that's in there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve actually already caught a glimpse of how Bible Adventures shows up in Squanch’s sequel. In a gameplay demo shown at gamescom 2025, it’s revealed that players will, at some point during High on Life 2, encounter Richard Kind’s Senator Muppy Doo. After he shrinks down to invade the player (and their in-game menu), players can find the only legal way to play Bible Adventures in the year 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spano stops short of telling us exactly how many games can be played or which other titles are included but does promise there are at least “more than five.” If Bible Adventures is the first we’re hearing about, then there’s no telling what else lies in store.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll only have to wait a few more months to find out which movies and games wormed their way into High on Life 2. Squanch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-2-release-date-revealed-for-february-2026"><u>confirmed its sequel has a release date</u></a> of February 13, 2026, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S, as well as Game Pass, earlier this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

                <p>Arcade1Up's Countercades are great for those who have limited space as well as anyone who doesn't want to drop $500 on a standing home arcade machine. Unfortunately, Arcade1Up seems like it could be done with its series of compact machines. All of the manufacturer's Countercades are discontinued. Until this month, we hadn't seen an Arcade1Up Countercade in stock since last holiday season.

The Class of '81 Countercade is sold and shipped by Amazon, but the price is $167.16.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-mirage-is-indeed-getting-new-free-content-later-this-year.1278993/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Assassin's Creed Mirage would receive a new 'DLC' funded by Savvy Games Group, an investment company created by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). </p>



<p>Ubisoft has now officially <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> during the ESports World Cup 2025 (taking place in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia) that the game will indeed receive new content in 2025 and will be free, too.</p>



<ul>
<li>New story chapter &amp; missions set in 9th-century al-Ula</li>



<li>Gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location</li>
</ul>



<p>al-Ula is an ancient Arabian oasis city located in Medina Province, which is part of modern-day Saudi Arabia, whereas the base game takes place in Baghdad, Iraq.</p>



<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage launched on October 5, 2023, earning positive reviews from critics. Wccftech's Nathan Birch rated it 8 out of 10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his review</a>:</p>



<p><em>The core Assassin’s Creed Mirage campaign doesn’t overstay its welcome, clocking in at around 12 to 15 hours, but there’s also a hearty amount of side content to tackle. Bonus contracts, “Tales of Baghdad” story bits you can run across while exploring the city, and, of course, tons of chests to loot and collectibles to grab. While Mirage doesn’t have XP or RPG-like leveling, there are still ways to improve your abilities as skill points are awarded for completing missions and you can collect crafting materials to improve your weapons and gear. There’s more than enough here to justify Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s reasonable $50 asking price, but you needn't worry about the game murdering all your free time.</em></p>



<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign, and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard.1278978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is easily one of the most anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 games of this year, and being a die-hard fan of the franchise, I’ve really been looking forward to this one. Insider Gaming was present at Gamescom 2025 this year, and we had the chance to test the preview build for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and here are our impressions on it. </p>



<p>To set some context, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the latest game in the series, where players get to return to Lumiose City from the X and Y games. The upcoming installment introduces a dynamic battle system that completely changes the way players approach battles in the series. Fortunately, we had the opportunity to preview the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A battle system during Gamescom 2025. </p>



<h2 id="h-dynamic-battles-keep-players-on-their-toes">Dynamic Battles Keep Players on Their Toes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Gamescom preview build for Pokémon Legends: Z-A was only 10 minutes long, featured the Switch 2 version and was restricted to the German language. However, you were able to gauge the new battle system quite well, even with the language barrier. The demo had players walking through a Red Zone, where they would have to face three different trainers. It was a highly compact area, so there was no way to get a sense of the exploration; the only thing you could do was battle. </p>



<p>I had access to four Pokémon: Chikorita, Weedle, Mareep, and Fletchling. Each of these Pokémon came with its individual skill set, which could be activated with the press of a button. The PP system has been replaced with a cool-down system, where players must wait a short period before executing their next move. At the same time, players can swap Pokémon on the fly, and that’s a brilliant way to get away from some of the attacks. </p>



<p>The battle system also features a new ambush mechanic, where players can either ambush the other trainer’s Pokémon or be ambushed by them. A new stealth system has also been added, which allows players to sneak around a trainer if they do not wish to fight them at that moment. However, if you are caught off guard, the opponent trainer can dish out some hefty damage when ambushing you. </p>



<p>Every Pokémon has the ability to learn four moves that can be executed by aiming at the opponent with the ZL button and then pressing either X, Y, A, or B to pull off the move. The animations look really crisp, and the performance seems pretty solid too. Similar to previous games, the Pokemon learns new moves as they level up with battles. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new battle system appears to be heading in the right direction, introducing a fresh layer of strategy and gameplay that will appeal to existing franchise players. As it is no longer a turn-based system, the player is no longer offered the luxury of time; you must be quick with your actions, as the opponents can be relentless. That was all we were able to explore during this demo; hopefully, we can see more of the redeveloped <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/story-world/lumiose-city" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lumiose City</a>, the mega evolutions, gym battles, and more soon. </p>

		<p>Of all the games annoucedby Nintendo for the Switch 2, Kirby Air Riders is perhaps the most surprising. A sequel to the GameCube’s Kirby Air Ride, the connective thread passes between a whole bunch of Smash Bros. titles, as Masahiro Sakurai takes the opportunity to revisit one of his decades old game ideas.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct – 19/08/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gn5c4RkoYAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is racing within Kirby Air Riders, though it’s quite a distance from the tone and pace of Mario Kart. Riding on a machine through a gameplay tutorial, we’re introduced to boost charging while drifting, angling your vehicle to fly or glide after jumping from a ramp, the importance of needing to stick the landing by having your craft parallel when landing. And then there’s the classic ability to gobble up and shoot them out as stars, pull off a spin attack, or a more audacious character-specific super.</p>


<p>The quirk that I constantly tussled with is that you don’t need to press a button or push forward to move, and the demo was constantly telling me off for doing so. This does put the focus more on braking, drifting, flying and attacking, but it’s still something that I didn’t get used to while playing.</p>
<p>Your Special depends on the character you’re riding as, and there’s obviously a bunch of familiar characters from the Kirby series, including Meta Knight, King Dedede, Cappy, Chef Kawasaki, Starman and more. All of them are given the ability to inhale enemies in this game, absorbing their abilities or shooting out a star, but they have a unique Special, so Meta Knight’s sees him able to really take off and fly, while Chef Kawasaki chucks blobs of damaging gloop. Kirby actually has four different Specials: one for each of the four colour variants you can race as.</p>


<p>There’s more that Kirby Air Ride has to offer than track races in its Air Ride mode, and we went hands on with the returning City Trial mode, shifting across to something much more like a vehicular combat game for up to 16 players online.</p>
<p>City Trial takes place across multiple stages, first taking players to the floating island of Skyah to drive around freely, seeking out power-ups, attacking opponents to damage their machines, and more. You initially start off with a basic machine –&nbsp;the star-shaped jet, a uni-bike, car, and more – and want to race around, passing through power-up icons that can boost the various attributes.</p>

<p>It’s all rather chaotic, as you’d expect, with time ticking down and a need to gather as much as possible, while also denting the progress of your rivals. Each machine can only take so much damage, and while you can restore it, there’s the risk that you’ll lose a bunch of progress if it’s destroyed, and then have to run around on foot searching for a replacement!</p>
<p>It can also make the randomised Field Events a bit of a risk. Do you head in to help destroy the strange stone tower that’s appeared somewhere and risk taking damage from other players? Or do you stay away and do your own thing?</p>

<p>As the timer on this first sessions comes to an end, you get to see how you’ve done in collecting different stat boosts, and then get to choose which finale Stadium stage you want to take part in. These are different mini-game modes, from simple races, to a Dustup Derby, and you want to choose one that will best suit your vehicle’s stats – handily the game suggests what would be a good match. Curiously, this doesn’t keep the full lobby together, breaking you into smaller groups by preference, making that choice more specifically strategic and meaning that you could end up taking on this second part of the game mode on your own.</p>
<p>Having been unfamiliar with the original game, City Trial was something truly unexpected for me when playing Kirby Air Riders. There’s plenty about it that feels like a Smash Bros. style party game – not least the style of the UI – with an initial simplicity and chaotic fun that hides a strategic and skilful depth.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is getting some surprise new content later this year, thanks to Ubisoft. The title, which was released in 2023, hit Xbox Game Pass a few weeks ago. With all the new players, it now seems that Basim’s origin story is not quite over yet. </p>



<p>Taking place in 9th-century Baghdad, you play as Basim Ibn Ishaq, whose older self appears in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla as Eivor’s mentor. It’s more classic Assassin’s Creed than Odyssey and Valhalla, so longtime fans were quick to praise the title, and for good reason. </p>



<p>While the recent Shadows has outplaced Mirage, a new update from Ubisoft confirms there’s more to come for the stealth-heavy entry.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Assassin's Creed Mirage players, we have a surprise coming your way later this year!</p><p> 📖 New story chapter &amp; missions set in 9th century AlUla<br>🎮 Gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location<br>🎁 All for free</p><p> Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/8CjB3MRvfR">pic.twitter.com/8CjB3MRvfR</a></p></div>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a tweet from the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Assassin’s Creed account</a>, it states that, later this year, new content will be available for players to enjoy. Outside of new gameplay improvements, the game will get a brand new location and story content, all set in Al Ula. To top it all off, the DLC is free to all who own the game. Unfortunately, no set release date was given outside of releasing this year.</p>



<p>While it isn’t out of the ordinary for new content for years-old games to drop, Assassin’s Creed Mirage is an interesting one. As mentioned previously, it’s not the newest title anymore, as AC Shadows came out this February. Even more so, it’s also getting its own <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free DLC</a> in late September. </p>



<p>Having Mirage get new content, especially story content, may hint at possible ties to Shadows or future games like Hexe. Still, the game’s addition to Xbox Game Pass is now sure to get some traction, as now even more people can play the DLC whenever it comes out.</p>



<p>Are you excited to return to Assassin’s Creed Mirage? Have you played it before? How does it stack up against other AC titles? Let us know in the comments and on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forums</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight may have one up over Batman: Arkham Knight: its vast open world. According to a LEGO Games fan account, it seems that Gotham City in the new title, coming in 2026, will be a large one to explore.</p>



<p>Announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is the next big LEGO title from TT Games. The game brings together many of Batman’s iconic moments in entertainment, from The Dark Knight and The Batman, to tell the ultimate origin story. It’s every Batman fan’s dream, and if the news is true, it’s going to get even better.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-could-have-the-largest-batman-open-world-ever">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Could Have the Largest Batman Open World Ever</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Gotham City in LEGO Batman: Legacy of Dark Knight is bigger than Batman: Arkham Knight </p><p>The game consists of four islands, with South Island being the largest. <a href="https://t.co/JgRlfWxpJu">pic.twitter.com/JgRlfWxpJu</a></p></div>— LEGO Games News (@LEGOTtNewsI) <a href="https://twitter.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1959024577713230265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a tweet by user <a href="https://x.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1959024577713230265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Games News</a>, they state that LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has four different islands. While only one gets a mention, the South Island (which will be the largest) is said to be bigger than Batman: Arkham Knight. If true, it does mean that the LEGO title will be the largest Batman open world in gaming.</p>



<p>Batman: Arkham Knight, created by Rocksteady Games, utilized a sprawling Gotham City, previously not as big as in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, for players to explore. In fact, it was so big, they let players drive the Batmobile around to get to places quickly. Seeing that the game is surprisingly a decade old now, of course, advancements allow for more space to be done. </p>



<p>Still, despite LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only featuring seven characters</a>, there will be more than enough things to do in Gotham City than ever before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7cada14c96d8/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Six years. Much has been said in the last six years about Team Cherry's near radio silence on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Promises from Microsoft about the game coming out "in the next 12 months" in 2022. No playable demo since E3 2019. No Kickstarter updates. And a furore of hungry fans whipping themselves into a frenzy and building an entire community on memes and anguish.</p>
<p>Then, on 19th August, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/teamcherry.bsky.social/post/3lwr4yoxbis2b">we found out that was about to change</a>: "The countdown is on! Join us in 48 hours for a special announcement about Hollow Knight: Silksong!" Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr4vytd322k">revealed he'd spoken to the devs</a> last month and promised to share "the story behind why Silksong took seven years to make...". Even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/geoff-keighley-either-knows-something-about-silksong-or-is-just-being-a-tool">Geoff Keighley got in on the action</a> and, during Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live, shared a brief snippet of (blurry) gameplay. The hype was reaching fever pitch.</p>
<p>And, as promised, at 3:30pm BST on Thursday 21st August, the news dropped. Silksong is finally coming out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">on 4th September 2025</a>. Team Cherry's co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">story was out there</a>. Was there drama? Fireworks?</p>
<p>Nope. It was all beautifully anticlimactic in the best possible way; a sub-two minute trailer that showed us this was "more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>". No over-explaining mechanics or details. Some glimpses of boss fights, towns, characters, and movement. And, of course, that release date.</p>
<p>In fact, you can go even further — the Silksong release trailer is structured almost identically to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAO2urG23S4&amp;ab_channel=TeamCherry">the Hollow Knight equivalent</a>, right down to the language. "Face over 140 ferocious foes" and "Descend into a vast, ruined world" in Hollow Knight is now "Battle over 200 ferocious foes" and "Ascend to the peak of a haunted kingdom" in Silksong. It's not subtle, but I'll say it again: <em>Silksong is more Hollow Knight</em>.</p>

<p>Watching that Silksong trailer was like seeing an old friend after a long period of time; an event that you build up in your head, only for it to be a completely normal moment. Last month, I visited the UK for the first time in two years, and I arranged to meet up with a friend; I worried, I overthought things, I thought about what to wear. Then when we did meet, we hugged, asked each other how we were, and chatted like we'd never been apart. Completely ordinary, just like this trailer drop.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of a better way for Silksong to reintroduce itself to the world, on Team Cherry's own terms. For years, after every Nintendo Direct, every Indie World, every Summer Game Fest, people decried that it was over, clown paint and hair at the ready, frustration boiling over. There had to be <em>something</em> going on, right?</p>
<p>Yet, there wasn't — at least, that's what Gibson and Pellen told Schreier. Team Cherry isn't here to provide the audience with juicy gossip or to fuel the fandom with even more fire. "Why did it take so long?" Schreier says in the piece. The response? They were having fun, blissfully ignorant (mostly) of the whirlwind of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1ixqje9/genuine_question_how_do_you_define_silkpost/">'Silkposting'</a> online: "This whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It’s nice to make fun things."</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cdfc2faf10c74/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Fun thing can also be scary thing...? — <em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether that's true or not is another story, but it's refreshing to hear that the team (Gibson, Pellen, Jack Vine, and composer Christopher Larkin) took the time to do whatever they wanted, and they had the money to do it. Look, I am the first person to admit that I'm excited to play Silksong, and I acknowledge that video games media and coverage (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-do-you-think-well-see-hollow-knight-silksong-this-year">including us</a>!) has, in part, contributed to the bubbling pot of Silksong fever. But I've also never really got the voracious need to have this game in people's hands.</p>
<p>Team Cherry was never going to release Silksong if it wasn't ready — the devs <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/team_cherry_shares_more_hollow_knight_silksong_details_will_launch_when_its_ready">said this back in 2019</a>. We read so many stories about crunch, pressure from higher-ups, and games failing to hit unrealistic deadlines and targets. Creators should be allowed to flourish and make whatever the heck they want, no matter how long it takes, and we shouldn't grief them for it.</p>
<p>Could the team have said something? Maybe, but as Gibson argues, “We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing because all we could really say is, ‘We’re still working on it.’" Hollow Knight was a different beast, a studio's very first game, and so there was almost an obligation to keep people in the loop. Silksong became so much more than it was ever meant to be.</p>

<p>A lot has changed in the six years since Silksong's last playable demo, but Silksong and Team Cherry remain defiant; their timeline is their own. That playable demo at Gamescom 2025? Apparently it was almost identical to the E3 2019 (RIP) one. Silksong is likely an iteration of Hollow Knight — and we've seen some of the best sequels ever made with iterative installments like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and even smaller games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/freedom_planet_2">Freedom Planet 2</a>, another indie that went through a long-development cycle.</p>
<p>The Metroidvania (or action-platformer, or search-action, whatever you want to call it) was already blooming prior to Hollow Knight's release, but now it's truly exploded. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/nine_sols">Nine Sols</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/prince_of_persia_the_lost_crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/timespinner">Timespinner</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_custodian">Crypt Custodian</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Ender Lilies</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Magnolia</a> — these are just a few of my favourites I've played that launched between Hollow Knight and Silksong. And while Hollow Knight might sit at the top of that pantheon for me, even surpassing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/castlevania_symphony_of_the_night">Symphony of the Night</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, Silksong should be treated as just another game release. Detach it from the hype machine and just enjoy it for what it is.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on whether Silksong will live up to the hype (I don't even know if that's possible), or already proclaiming that it's "GOTY 2025" (it's not even <em>out</em> yet — and hey, maybe I'll end up saying that in December), we should celebrate that Team Cherry made a game on their own terms, in their own time. That should be the norm in this industry, and it's a darn shame it isn't.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It might sound bizarre at first blush, but Randy Pitchford, CEO of Gearbox and creator of the Borderlands franchise, had <strong>less input </strong>in the recent Borderlands movie than he did in the upcoming release of Now You See Me: Now You Don’t. I sat down with Pitchford at Gamescom to talk all things Borderlands 4, and as you can imagine, that chat turned towards the Borderlands movie.</p>



<p>For many, it was a complete failure, even for the most die-hard fans. Randy admitted to me that ‘he liked it’ but stressed that he ‘can’t look at it like anybody else could.’</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview before you jump in:</p>

<h2 id="h-randy-pitchford-spearheads-the-magic-in-now-you-see-me-now-you-don-t">Randy Pitchford Spearheads the Magic in Now You See Me: Now You Don’t</h2>



<p>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t is the third movie in the series that debuted in 2013. It’s centered around a group of magicians who use their talents to perform heists and mind-blowing stunts, and I learned from Randy Pitchford at Gamescom that he had a massive input in the movie, <strong>more than he had in the Borderlands movie</strong>.</p>



<p>If we cast back to August 2024, we see the Borderlands movie release to a woeful reception. Today, it boasts a Rotten Tomatoes score of just 10% and a 4.7/10 rating on IMDb. I asked Randy what he’d do if he had full creative license over another attempt to produce a Borderlands movie, but he wasn’t willing to take that seat:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that would be a mistake because I’m not a filmmaker. I’ve seen projects where people with IP get full creative and — I’ve been on the other side of it!</p>



<p>I did a James Bond game back in the day with Electronic Arts and we’re two weeks away from shopping, and the James Bond people said, you know, ‘We don’t think James Bond should be so violent. How about we just take all the guns out of the game?’ </p>



<p>I don’t want to be that guy. Whoever the experts are in the medium, do the best you can. You definitely know better than me. It’s hard enough as it is.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I probed, I learned that Pitchford had much more of a hands-on involvement in Now You See Me: Now You Don’t than he did in Lionsgate’s Borderlands movie:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In another life, <strong>I’m a magician</strong>, and recently with The Magic Castle, which is a club for magicians that I own in Hollywood, the Magic Castle team did all of the magic and magic productions for the upcoming movie, Now You See Me: Now You Don’t.</p>



<p>My involvement in that movie was more profound and deeper and had more effect on both the storytelling and on the result than the effect that I had on Borderlands, which is crazy!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One day, we might get another pass at a Borderlands movie, but for now, fans will need to remain satisfied with the upcoming Borderlands 4, due to be released worldwide on September 12.</p>
