			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 unveiling may have been largely positive, but there are a few things that didn't sit very well with some fans, such as the pricing of the hardware and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the software</a>. It doesn't help that the console pre-orders, scheduled to go live later today in most of the world, have been delayed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a> due to the US tariffs issue, making North American customers even more anxious about a further price increase.</p>
<p>Now, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has shared a tone-deaf statement that has riled up fans even more. As <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-1.7503598" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by CBC Canada, he essentially told them to go buy the original Switch if they can't afford the new one.</p>
<p><em>As we look at Nintendo Switch 2 and you think about the feature sets that I talked about ... we believe that the pricing is appropriate for the value of the machine and the gameplay experience overall. We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford the Nintendo Switch 2 price point. That's why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available, so people still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds, and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they come in.</em></p>
<p>Those with a long enough memory have instantly remembered Don Mattrick's similar statement. When the Xbox One was facing criticism because of the console's initial mandatory online connectivity, he famously said:</p>
<p><em>We have a product for people who aren't able to get some form of connectivity; it's called Xbox 360.</em></p>
<p>The terrible Xbox One marketing essentially doomed Microsoft's third console from the get-go in its fight against Sony's PlayStation 4. The Nintendo Switch 2 likely won't suffer the same fate, with analysts believing it will still <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become the fastest-selling console ever</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-stepping-up-to-be-more-of-a-primary-platform-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn into more of a primary platform for core gamers</a>. Still, this reveal could have gone a bit more smoothly.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Commandos: Origins Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/commandos-origins-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/commandos-origins-review.1159062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/commandos-origins-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether twiddling their thumbs during the decades since Commandos 3 or calmly hiding in a hedge waiting to knife a nosey Nazi in the neck on his next stroll past, if there’s one thing Commandos fans are known for it’s lurking patiently. Good things come to those who’ve waited, and Commandos: Origins fits that bill. Slow-paced, challenging, and consistently satisfying when all your plans come together, its brand of isometric stealth action is intact and has never looked better. I’ve sunk nearly 60 hours into it over the last week and a half just to see out the missions, and there are potentially dozens more hours available should I return to play through some of them again with the intention of leaving no stone unturned and no soldier unslain. The only major issue is the assortment of bugs I’ve had to become accustomed to in order to keep enjoying myself. Like a peskily placed German sniper, some of these I learnt how to avoid entirely, but there were others I just needed to find a way to neutralise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those of you who skipped basic training, Commandos is a classic series of real-time tactics stealth ’em ups set during the Second World War that goes all the way back to the late ’90s. Picture a crew of elite but generally crabby commandos crawling around on their bellies behind enemy lines, driven by a whole lot of mouse clicking, and you’re most of the way there. For a modern comparison, it’s a lot like The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, only filmed exclusively from a drone (and without Guy Ritchie’s wit or Henry Cavill’s perfectly curled cookie duster). Or the BBC’s Rogue Heroes with 90% less swearing and 100% less AC/DC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, while its cheesy yet otherwise stony-faced approach may lack the outright humour of those crackling British Special Forces capers, Commandos: Origins is arguably the best version of the series’ concept to date. It’s a familiar yet modern experience for grizzled veterans, and also an intuitive and approachable one for new players who are ready to test themselves against a steadily escalating difficulty curve.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where eagles stare</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any great stealth game, Origins is as much a game about tactics as it is a salvo of deadly puzzles to solve. It essentially boils down to analysing every upcoming encounter, inspecting each enemy soldier’s vision cone, and finding a way to dispatch them that won’t bring the whole German army down on your squad’s heads. A large part of my time with Origins has been spent simply staring at the screen, surveying my prey like an ambush predator. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A large part of my time with Origins has been spent simply staring at the screen, surveying my prey like an ambush predator.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the six commandos on your team has a set of unique tools and abilities. For the most part, Origins curates the characters available for each mission, tailoring the action for their skills. There are only two instances where all six soldiers will be on the same battlefield at once, which is kind of a shame because those are real highlights. That said, I probably would’ve played a huge amount of Origins exclusively using the Marine’s throwing knives and harpoon gun had I had the chance, so forcing me to expand my approach by sidelining him sometimes was probably wise and almost certainly kept things from becoming stale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of sidelining, I actually don’t miss the inventory management of the previous games, though I feel like I wouldn’t have removed the ability to pick up and use enemy weapons for the Green Beret in particular. The argument here is that Origins is more about thoughtful stealth at all times – and less about spraying lead from scavenged MP40s at anything with a swastika on it. Thoughtful stealth, luckily, is empowered by the coolest part of Origins: Command Mode. Riffing on similar modes in the late, great Mimimi’s Desperados 3 and Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, Command Mode allows you to freeze time indefinitely and queue up individual actions for each of your commandos. Back in real time, they’ll execute those simultaneously on your say so. Nailing the timing on a set of Command Mode instructions is powerfully satisfying, whether it’s simply two crawling commandos stabbing a distracted pair of soldiers from the side, or a more complicated and elaborately choreographed ballet of harpoons, blades, and bullets.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Commandos: Origins Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all quite a slow process to do well, but it’s a truly rewarding one when you figure out the solution to taking on what initially may seem like too many meticulously positioned soldiers to tackle. Maybe your first choice of target is impossible to kill quietly because he’s always in sight of one of his other comrades, and maybe that very squadmate is always in view of a third, and so on. But there’s fun in uncovering who should be the first domino to fall throat-first onto a Fairbairn–Sykes combat knife. Some enemies will leave their posts to investigate strange sounds, like the Sapper’s whistle or the Green Beret’s radio – or inspect the Driver’s burning packets of cigarettes. Some will only temporarily turn and face a distraction, giving you precious moments to slip by them. Experimenting with which routes and tools work best is a task that tapped into a compulsive part of my brain.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s fun in uncovering who should be the first domino to fall throat-first onto a Fairbairn–Sykes combat knife.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The opportunities are always there; it’s just on us to find them – and the fact that they’re not telegraphed or signposted makes every victory feel like you’ve outfoxed the developers. At one point I spotted a tiny gap in the view cones of four soldiers on a small set of stairs in the water. It allowed me to not only get behind them to wipe them out, but also to bring three other squadmates via boat to the rear of my main objective. Was that there on purpose? Probably, but maybe not. Leaving it ambiguous as to whether you’ve gone about an encounter in the precise way Claymore Game Studios surreptitiously left ajar for us – or succeeded with an unpredictable sequence of moves the dev team perhaps never saw coming –  is just good design.  Either way, the encouragement to explore every corner of the maps for the best opportunities is thoroughly baked in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In large part, that’s because these levels are all exceedingly detailed dioramas, sprawling and dense, and every one feels like I’m playing a high-stakes game of toy soldiers on the kind of miniature map exhibits you might see tucked behind glass at a war museum. Missions take place all across Europe and North Africa, too, so the variety of backdrops is terrific – from snowy Scandinavia to lush, soggy fields and baking deserts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The huge environments are also rendered entirely in three dimensions and you can enter buildings seamlessly, and the fact that I felt the need to say that should give you an idea of how long it’s been since we’ve had a proper Commandos game. You can make fine camera rotations in any compass direction, so getting the right angle to spot a gap in security is easy. That said, scrolling around too fast sometimes introduces a bit of temporary choppiness, but it’s a short-lived gripe. It’s otherwise great looking overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, unfortunately, some occasional clumsiness when navigating particularly complex, multi-storey structures. Over the course of the campaign I encountered a few enemies that appeared to be sharing a floor with me, but who were actually on a different level entirely and should’ve been hidden from view at that moment. I also had the misfortune of placing down a beartrap that became irretrievable because it wasn’t on the same platform I wanted to leave it, and being shot through a solid container that apparently wasn’t really there is never any fun. There were also occasional instances where my commands were being misinterpreted and my men were setting off to unintended areas and directly into enemy sight lines, due to an apparent disconnect between what floors are being displayed and what floor Origins <em>thinks </em>I’m clicking on. These aren’t major frustrations, though, and remedying them typically just required some minor zooming, or panning the camera slightly. That, or a quick reload to bring back the prematurely deceased.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Saving dyin’ privates</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In the trial-and-error world of tactical games like Commandos, quick save is your friend – and Origins is no exception. The ability to pick up directly where you left off after doing something risky and/or stupid is what actually gives us the freedom to experiment with different approaches in the first place. Make no mistake, quick save well and truly saved my bacon (and quickly!) on many occasions – but, unfortunately, this essential feature also seems to provoke some of Origins’ most bothersome bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, loading a save you made while one of your commandos was climbing a wire – or perched high on a climbable pole – appears to leave the poor bastard marooned on an invisible level above the map, fruitlessly crawling or moonwalking into oblivion. The solution, naturally, is to simply resolve to never save while one of your men is climbing anything. That wasn’t the end of my issues, though. After another reload I noticed my Marine was no longer in his boat, but walking on water back to the marker I’d placed. This bug eventually resolved itself, but one where my Sapper simply disappeared off the map and became unselectable did not. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That kind of issue could’ve become game-breaking, but Origins – seemingly aware that it has a few technical landmines for you to step on – keeps a queue of several quick saves. For the most part, if something goes awry, there’s a strong chance you’ll have a slightly older save you can revert too. In this instance, though, I’d sadly filled all my saves without noticing my Sapper was no longer present. The only solution was restarting the mission entirely, which was over an hour lost.</p><div id="rank-these-world-war-ii-men-on-a-mission-movies" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these World War II 'men-on-a-mission' movies</h3><h3>Rank these World War II 'men-on-a-mission' movies</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One weird issue, and one I can’t tell whether it’s related to the quick saves or not, is the occasional instance of enemies falsely detecting one of your commandos in a bush they’re no longer hiding in – and getting locked in an alert state about it. They’ll subsequently circle it and blast it to hell to no avail. It wasn’t so bad because I was able to either skirt around it or totally exploit it by stabbing all the soldiers while they were busy slaughtering the unfortunate shrubbery, but it definitely wasn’t supposed to happen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I wouldn’t necessarily call the enemies smart overall, and it would’ve been nice if they displayed a little more of the initiative we see in other modern stealth games. Instead of callously ignoring dead bodies after an alert phase resets, for instance, they might want to drag their kaput companions off to a predefined location, à la Hitman. They make up for their dim bulbs by being extremely dangerous, though – and they’re just unpredictable enough to keep you on your toes when you think you’ve got their patterns figured out. They won’t inspect the nearest hiding places in the same order after a reload, for instance, so you’d better have a backup plan – or at least make sure nobody’s climbing a telephone pole when they come looking.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Blizzard has shared a roadmap for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, taking us through the rest of this year and teasing a bit of what's to come in 2026.</p>
<p>This roadmap <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">reiterates that another hellish expansion is on the way</a>, but it won't be available until next year. Along with that new expansion, 2026 also promises players a new ranking system, leaderboards and a new <em>something</em>. I only say <em>something </em>here, because the rest of the roadmap's text has been engulfed by fire, but I am going to make an educated guess and say it will probably be a new class.</p>
<p>But, before all of that, there is plenty of Diablo 4 chaos slated for 2025.</p>

<p>Coming up next on the roadmap is the April to July season, which is known as Belial's Return. "Belial, Lord of Lies has returned to warp reality to his will. Daring wanderers can clash with Belial and two bosses from Vessel of Hatred as part of the updated Lair Boss system," <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap">reads the season's official blurb</a>.</p>
<p>There's also an "earnable feline pet" on the way in the coming months, as well as a "new IP collab" and some quality of life tweaks to lair bosses.</p>
<p>Then between July and September, Diablo 4 players will be welcoming Sins of the Horadrim, which will return to Nightmare Dungeons. Players can expect new activities here, as well as interactions "that let you progress the dungeon’s intensity as you hunt down the barons of Hell" (sounds chill).</p>
<p>During this time, Blizzard will also be introducing keyboard and mouse support for consoles as a permanent addition to the game, something the developer said has been a much requested feature. Between July and September, there will also be an earnable pet available, although the team did not specify what kind.</p>
<p>Moving into the colder months of September to December, we then have Infernal Chaos, which will bring Infernal Horde Updates. As you may have surmised given that these months come with the header Infernal Chaos, this means things are going to get "more chaotic" for players, as the Diablo 4 team puts "new choices into your hands".</p>
<p>There will also be a new variety of powers to earn here, known as chaos powers. Advanced options between Infernal Waves will also be making a showing during these months as well. Again, Blizzard has teased an earnable pet and a "new IP collab" for between September and December, but again has kept further details under wraps for now.</p>

<p>Diablo 4 will celebrate its second anniversary this June. On its initial release back in 2023, we awarded Diablo 4 four out of five stars. "Like the Blizzard hits of old, Diablo 4 is a designer's game at heart, built on intricacy and depth. A sense of fearful overcompensation holds it back," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-review-richness-luxury-and-compromise">Eurogamer's original Diablo 4 review</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, we have also been treated to a major expansion known as Vessel of Hatred. This expansion also earned itself four Eurogamer stars.</p>
<p>"A polished, bewitching upgrade that sinks its claws into you - featuring perhaps the best character class in Diablo's history," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Eurogamer's Vessel of Hatred review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A sequel to the newly-released A Minecraft Movie is already being discussed.</p>
<p>This should perhaps come as no surprise given the film's record breaking opening - the Jack Black and Jason Momoa-fronted A Minecraft Movie debuted just last week, generating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m worldwide on its first weekend</a>.</p>
<p>Now just a few short days later, A Minecraft Movie's director Jared Hess has revealed there are already talks of a sequel, with the filmmaker teasing where things could go next (<strong>please be aware of spoilers for A Minecraft Movie below</strong>).</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/minecraft-movie-sequel-plans-director-jared-hess-jack-black-jason-momoa-1236362421/">Deadline</a>, Hess - who was also at the helm of 2004's Napoleon Dynamite - expressed his excitement about potentially being part of another Minecraft film. "It would be so much fun. We had so much fun making this movie," Hess said before adding:</p>
<p>"It's such an expansive world in the game, and there were so many things that we didn't tap into that we wanted to. I would have a blast doing the sequel, and it seems like there's already talk about it happening, so I'm super excited. It'll be so much fun to go back into the world. The fans are just having such a good time.</p>
<p>"We  teased it in the end credits, and the fans seem to be going wild for it."</p>
<p>So, what exactly did Hess and the rest of the A Minecraft Movie crew tease that made fans go so wild? The arrival of Alex, of course! Alex is one of the nine default player skins in Minecraft, and is often shown alongside Steve (played in the film by Black) in promotional artwork and such.</p>
<p>In A Minecraft Movie's post credits scene, we don't see Alex's face. However, Alex introduces herself to Black's Steve after he decides to pop back to the real world at the end of the film. She now lives in the house Steve once did, you see, and she invites him in.</p>
<p>Alex is "the other massively critical character in Minecraft," Hess said, "so that's the one that we will be bringing to the table without a doubt."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/08/the-outlast-trials-final-season-2-update-goes-live-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Outlast Trials’ latest update goes live today, with the rogue Reagent Amelia Collier taking center stage. She has laid out the path of other prisoners to escape the Sinyala Facility, giving players a chance to make a break for it in the final update for Season 2 before Season 3 kicks off at the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Red Barrels’ provides the following synopsis for Season 2.2 of Project Breach:</p>

<p>“Amelia has managed to trick the system, creating a brief means of escape for the victims of Dr. Easterman and his unethical experiments. Thanks to her carefully positioned Escape Plans and other tools, Reagants can now attempt their own getaway to try and free themselves from the horrors of the Sinyala Facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Murkoff won’t let them go without a fight. Doubling down on the extreme surveillance already embedded throughout the facility, the risk of being exposed to the all-seeing eye is greater than ever before.”</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNCpOhZk-iM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Season 2.2 introduces the new gameplay event, The Escape, which tasks four players with fleeing the Sinyala Facility. Under Survellience Part II lets players resume their progress from Part 1, offering a more challenging romp as players must avoid being spotted while locating escape plans or watching Amelia’s message before Murkoff does.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Completing these trials earns Event Tokens that can be spent acquiring cosmetics from the new limited-time Amelia Catalog. The catalog will only be available until April 22; any unspent event tokens will be lost. Season 3 of The Outlast Trials begins on April 22, introducing new elements while closing off the Rebirth hallway for the foreseeable future. You can read the Season 2.2 changes <a href="https://redbarrelsgames.com/news/new-update-escape-0408/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Outlast Trials is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-other-game-is-shaped-like-blue-prince.1158978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The total novelty of <em>Blue Prince </em>makes description difficult but necessary. There are many things <em>Blue Prince</em> is like: art board game, roguelite, narrative puzzle game. It’s one of the most novel and daring games I’ve played in ages. It feels engineered in a lab to be talked about, studied, and critiqued. It is catnip for game critics, and I have to admit it got my ass real good.</p><figure><figcaption>The manor awaits.</figcaption></figure><p>In contrast to its thorough inventiveness, <em>Blue Prince </em>starts with a well worn trope: the “on one condition” will. Your great uncle Herbert S. Sinclair has left you his estate of Mount Holly, under the condition that you can get to the secret 46th room of the 45-room mansion. The complication is that the mansion’s layout is not static, but rather a structure that you build every single day, room by room. The mansion’s map is a tile-based grid, and you have a select number of rooms in the pool to build out your mansion. You start with a fixed number of steps you can take, each step representing moving into a room. These steps can be refilled by activities like resting in bedrooms and eating food. If you run out of stamina, the day is over, and you must rest and return the following day. If you run into a dead end, you will probably have to hang it up as well. Tools, items, money and gems can be collected, but cannot be transferred to a different day except under specific conditions. At the end of the day, the tiles on the house reset unless specified otherwise.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>The board game element of <em>Blue Prince </em>requires strategic understanding of how the pool&nbsp; or rooms and the structure of the house works. Many rooms in your pool, like closets and bathrooms, are dead ends that can end your run if you draw them at the wrong time. Strategically burning those rooms early in places where they won’t be a nuisance becomes key to survival. On top of that, items like gems and keys become increasingly important as you get deeper into the mansion, so budgeting them for later becomes important as time goes on. You also have a few rooms with regular puzzles, including a variant of the Two Doors riddle and what I can only describe as “Dartboard PEMDAS,” that reward you with resources and teach you their internal logic. The only criticism of how the game is implemented is that at least one puzzle and the rooms themselves are color-themed, and the game’s color blindness accessibility feature is still a work in progress, currently being tested and developed according to the in-game menu.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>In addition to the stated goal of getting to Room 46, each individual room has clues to a greater mystery and a more intriguing plot. Often, it’s worth burning a run to go into a room you haven’t been in to advance the larger metagame. Sometimes these puzzles involve unlocking other parts of the grounds of the estate in ways that make the primary task easier. Other times, it’s in the service of something far grander. Much of the joy is the discovery of picking the game apart, so I will not spoil anything else, but it is some of the most interesting environmental storytelling I have seen in ages.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>There are flavors of other games in <em>Blue Prince</em>,<em> </em>but absolutely nothing that is like it. You can point to many games – anything Cyan has made, <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, several board games, the <em>Zero Escape </em>games, <em>Outer Wilds</em>, <em>Inscryption</em>, but the second you talk about any other part of the game the comparison falls apart. What if <em>Riven </em>was a roguelite? What if <em>Telling Lies </em>was a deckbuilder? What if <em>Pipe Mania </em>was themed like <em>The Masque of the Red Death</em>? What if the board game <em>Carcassonne </em>was also a mystery novel?&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>This layering has an additive effect. Where games like <em>The Witness</em> and <em>Myst</em> often become an impenetrable brick wall for the player to bash their head against, the daily construction of <em>Blue Prince</em>’s house engages a different part of your brain and paces out the overall mysteries. The house itself is a little busy box that constantly engages you, unjamming any frustrating mental blocks by suggesting new angles of attack, as well as offering many different pathways to the same solution. I solved many puzzles through inference only to be told the solution later in a different way. It is a game that solves solutions to problems I did not know the puzzle and adventure genres had.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> is a far larger game than I could have ever predicted; I have spent about 55 hours in it and I am not “done” with it. It is a game that is best played with a <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buddy</a>, occasionally dropping each other oblique hints to the mysteries still unsolved but never spoiling it for yourself. Like a house with many shifting rooms, <em>Blue Prince</em>’s constituent parts are immediately recognizable, but the totality is impossible to narrow down. It deserves every bit of the overwhelming praise it has gotten, and will be talked about for years to come. It is a game of novelty, new blood in a stagnant age. <em>Blue Prince</em> is the future of something new.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad"><h3>Games Writing Words I Hate</h3></a><p>Let's get pedantic, my favorite thing to be</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/manga-no-name-ending-edgerunners"><h3>The Truth Behind The Sudden Conclusion Of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Showrunner’s Short-Lived Manga Series</h3></a><p>Edgerunners showrunner Rafał Jaki mythbusts the ins-and-outs of creating his historic manga series, No\Name</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025"><h3>Aftermath Vs 2025</h3></a><p>We've got even bigger plans than last year, and we need your help</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ellie was under anesthesia as she was getting ready for a procedure that would kill her but hopefully find a cure for the cordyceps infection. She didn’t know she was going to die. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Joel wasn’t OK with that and rescued her while killing many along the way, yet Ellie was unconscious the whole time so didn’t have a choice in the matter.

Joel had initially asked Tommy to take Ellie to the Fireflies after he admitted he wasn’t strong enough to do it and couldn’t after the loss of his daughter, Sarah.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/645555/arduboy-victim-trump-tariffs-us-china-kevin-bates<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Kevin Bates managed to quit his day job and move to China after his game-playing business card, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/you-can-finally-buy-that-tiny-video-game-playing-busine-1703207365">the Arduboy</a>, went viral in 2014. But a decade later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">Trump’s staggering</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/643970/trade-war-consequences-crazy">inexplicable new US tariffs</a> are driving him out of business.</p><p>Just as he was about to turn a profit for the first time, just before he was about to bring a new product to retail, he tells <em>The Verge</em> that his company can no longer survive as-is. He says that despite lifetime Arduboy sales of over $1 million, much of it from recent growth in 2023 and 2024, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645305/trump-104-percent-china-tariffs">Trump’s new 104 percent China tariffs</a> will be the beginning of the end.</p><p>“I just like making circuit boards and helping people learn to code games. This is all too much,” he says.</p><p>Even if he wanted to — Bates admits he’s been looking to sunset Arduboy for a while — he says he wouldn’t be able to satisfy Trump’s stated goal of restarting manufacturing in the US.</p><p>“There are no manufacturers in the USA who would even answer an email to produce Arduboy, much less give a good price. I could build them myself and end up making about $10 an hour, still paying a crazy amount for components.”</p><p>Instead, he says, his options are to dramatically raise prices, find a way around the tariffs, or simply kill off Arduboy for good.</p><p>“The fact Arduboy could exist at all was kind of a miracle of global trade. An individual person, producing and distributing an international product with margins that would never work at a larger company. I didn’t need 80 percent markup to survive,” he says, adding that his actual margins ranged from 30 to 50 percent.</p><p>Trump’s US tariffs would entirely wipe out those margins, and he says China’s retaliatory tariffs would hurt too, as they would impose a 34 percent tariff on <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/atmega32u4">the Arduboy’s US-made processor</a>, which Bates says is the most expensive component in the system.</p><p>While he’s hopeful that some larger organization might buy Arduboy and take up the torch, he admits that’s not terribly realistic in this economic climate, and he’s already declaring Arduboy “dead” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7315460443198627841/">on his LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://community.arduboy.com/t/tariffs-killed-arduboy/12675">in the Arduboy forums.</a> He’s already looking for a new day job once again.</p><p>But he says Arduboy isn’t <em>quite</em> dead yet. He wants to launch one last Kickstarter for a USB-C version of the Arduboy with “more features like real time clock, IR blaster, and link cable support,” assuming he can figure out how to ship them at a price people will pay. He says he already saw $99 Arduboy FX Special Edition as overpriced for what it is, and he isn’t looking forward to charging $200 for a new version or saddling buyers with customs fees should he choose to drop-ship them.</p><p>“The only realistic solution is to warehouse the inventory somewhere that doesn’t have Chinese import taxes, and drop ship everything. I visited my factory last year to talk about this, and they said all their customers are in the same situation so they said they would have a solution. But one has not materialized yet,” he says.</p><p>Speaking of drop-shipping and customs fees, that is probably what you should expect if you buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642692/banana-bit-game-boy-arduboy-handheld-console-gaming">the new banana-shaped Arduboy</a> or the <a href="https://www.arduboy.com/shop/p/special-edition">last few remaining units of the Arduboy FX Special Edition</a>. “I am planning to fulfill the orders but they may be drop shipped, so U.S. customers should be aware that import taxes may now apply,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. But he also may just turn off Banana-Bit preorders, as he says he’s only sold about a dozen so far.</p><p>He also warns these packages could get held up at US customs for a time, because Trump <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642601/donald-trump-tariffs-de-minimis-shein-temu">has also gotten rid of the de minimis exemption</a> that let low-value packages enter the US duty-free. “That’s going to impact everything from Shein to Temu to AliExpress, and honestly, it’s going to be chaos. U.S. customs isn’t ready for that volume,” he says.</p><p>Bates says Trump’s trade war is “an absolute unmitigated disaster for anyone without the ability to dramatically restructure.”</p><p>“I guess that’s the point,” he adds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is still a month away, but I'm guessing there's some of you that could do with a bit of boomer shooting to fill the gap in the meantime. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-eden">Metal Eden</a> will probably scratch that itch, the next game from the devs behind the quite violent and flashy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ruiner">Ruiner</a>, given that it's out May 6th. That's still about a month away though, so you could always try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3468980/METAL_EDEN__Demo/">free demo that dropped today</a> offering a small taste of its sci-fi shooter.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo seems like a pretty beefy one too, you can try out the first two missions of the game. It should be noted that this doesn't appear to be a "save data carries over to the main game" kind of demo, but Metal Eden seems like the kind of game you'll want to replay to get better and better at anyway. Which, funnily enough, is kind of the point, as over on Steam Reikon Games shared that it's hosting a speedrun challenge of the game in partnership with <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/challenges/9x32q3l6-Metal_Eden-metal-eden-demo-speedrun-challenge">speedrun.com</a>.

<p>
Honestly, if you're good at making like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, you genuinely might want to give it a go. As long as you've submitted your run by April 15th, you'll be in with a chance to win a share of a $1000 prize pool. You will need to come somewhere within the top three to get some of that share, so good luck if you do give it a go.
</p>
<p>
I love a game that features parkour, or at least movement like it. I'm still chasing the thrill of games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, so Metal Eden seems like it's worth a quick punt at least. Doubt I'll make it into the top three in best times though.

            <p>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (or BAFTA, if you're after something a bit snappier) has announced the winners of this year's BAFTA Games Awards - and it's very much been <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>'s night, with the acclaimed PlayStation 5 platformer taking home the gong in five categories including Best Game.</p>
<p>Astro Bot's Best Game victory saw it win out over fellow nominees Balatro, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and Thank Goodness You're Here. And it was equally successful in the BAFTA Games Awards' Animation, Audio Achievement, Family, and Game Design categories.</p>
<p>Team Asobi's Astro Bot didn't entirely hog the limelight, however. Balatro, by developer LocalThunk, took the top spot in the Debut Game category, while Coal Supper's superb comedy oddity Thank Goodness You're Here was crowned Best British Game. Elsewhere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' Helldivers 2 secured two gongs - winning out in BAFTA's multiplayer and Music categories - while Nomada Studio's Neva won Artistic Achievement, and Atlus' Metaphor: Metaphor: ReFantazio trumped fellow nominees for Narrative.

That’s according to Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svRmWFAGLJg">said on CNBC Monday</a> that Nintendo had time to build up an inventory of the next-gen portable gaming system “on a global basis,” and that many have already landed, including “some” in the United States.</p><p>“We really do hope we can meet that demand,” said Bowser. When asked if Nintendo can meet that demand, Bowser replied, “That remains to be seen. That certainly is our goal.” The original Switch remained hard to find for quite a while after it launched in the spring of 2017, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17283938/nintendo-switch-earnings-fy-2017-2018-forecast">selling more consoles by April 2018</a> (17.79 million) than its predecessor, the Wii U, sold in five years (13.56 million).</p><p>Bowser told <em>The Verge</em> that Nintendo is “actively assessing” the impact of the latest tariffs, but that was before Nintendo decided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">delay Switch 2 preorders</a> in the US and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">Canada</a> from the original April 9th date. Nintendo says it’s still on track to launch the console on June 5th. On Tuesday, analyst DFC Intelligence cut its Switch 2 forecast for the year from 17 million units to 15 million, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/switch-2-sales-forecast-is-cut-by-researcher-over-trump-tariffs"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports. That prediction would still make it the fastest-selling console ever, despite tariffs and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">budget-stretching price of $449.99</a>.</p><p>The new tariffs announced after the Switch 2 event could be hard on Nintendo since the company is building Switch 2 in Vietnam, which is in line for a 46 percent tariff.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activision has been hellbent on jamming as many crossovers into the Call of Duty universe as possible these days. We’ve seen some bizarre topics surface, leading to inane in-game events and laughable skins that have players craving something a little more grounded.</p>



<p>In a recent claim from a prolific Call of Duty insider, it was suggested that Activision is acutely aware of the feedback from the wider community suggesting that Call of Duty is becoming a laughing stock because of these weird skins and irrelevant crossovers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-self-awareness-is-key">Self-Awareness is Key</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1909627607567458504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a> gave feedback about the performance of Warzone and how Verdansk has boosted the game’s player count on all platforms.</p>



<p>He then turned to talk about the future of Warzone, suggesting that Activision’s teams are proposing taking a more restrained approach to skins and bundles in the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They are talking about showing more restraint with Warzone for skins/bundles/microtransactions. Crossovers are ‘printing money’ but they hear the criticism that the game is starting to look stupid.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gone are the days when people ran around Call of Duty dressed exclusively in milsim outfits. The rise of the free-to-play battle royale platform meant that microtransactions had to be ramped up, thus leaving us with countless crossovers and collaborations with musicians, television shows, movies, and other games.</p>



<p>They might be ‘printing money’, but perhaps die-hard Call of Duty fans are growing tired of the number of neon-lit, over-the-top, impossible outfits in the game.</p>



<p>Have you ever bought a ludicrous Call of Duty skin? Let me know what you purchased in the comments, or hit up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>We assembled data for those game baskets across 21 non-consecutive years, going back to 1982, then normalized the nominal prices to consistent February 2025 dollars using <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI calculator</a>.

<h2>The bad old days</h2>
<p>In purely nominal terms, the $30 to $40 retailers routinely charged for game cartridges in the 1980s seems like a relative bargain. Looking at the inflation-adjusted data, though, it's easy to see how even an $80 game today would seem like a bargain to console gamers in the cartridge era.</p>

<p>New cartridge games in the 20th century routinely retailed for well over $100 in 2025 money, thanks to a combination of relatively high manufacturing costs and relatively low competition in the market. While you could often get older and/or used cartridges for much less than that in practice, must-have new games at the time often cost the equivalent of $140 or more in today's money.</p>

<p>Pricing took a while to calm down once CD-based consoles were introduced in the late '90s. By the beginning of the '00s, though, nominal top-end game pricing had fallen to about $50, and only rose back to $60 by the end of the decade. Adjusting for inflation, however, those early 21st century games were still demanding prices approaching $90 in 2025 dollars, well above the new $80 nominal price ceiling <em>Mario Kart World </em>is trying to establish.</p>

<p>In the 2010s, inflation started eating into the value of gaming's de facto $60 price ceiling, which remained remarkably consistent throughout the decade. Adjusted for inflation, the nominal average pricing we found for our game "baskets" in 2013, 2017, and 2020 ended up almost precisely equivalent to $80 in constant 2025 dollars.</p>
<h2>Is this just what things cost now?</h2>
<p>While the jump to an $80 price might seem sudden, the post-COVID jump in inflation makes it almost inevitable. After decades of annual inflation rates in the 2 to 3 percent range, the <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-">Consumer Price Index</a> jumped 4.7 percent in 2021 and a whopping 8 percent in 2022. In the years since, annual price increases still haven't gotten below the 3 percent level that was once seen as "high."</p>

			<p>Earlier today, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on the latest Nintendo Switch 2 market analysis from DFC Intelligence. The analysts reckon it'll become the fastest-selling console ever with 15 million units sold in 2025, although the impact of the tariffs, should they be here to stay, is impossible to fully predict.</p>
<p>When we received the report, we also got the opportunity to speak with founder, CEO, and principal David Cole to learn more about their insights on the Nintendo Switch 2 and the potential impact of the US tariffs on the whole games industry.</p>
<p><strong>Hello, David. Were you expecting that $450 price, or were you, maybe, like many other colleagues, waiting for Nintendo to announce a $400 price?</strong></p>
<p>We were concerned about the tariff issue before the announcements. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts. They get parts from all over Asia that go into the system. With tariffs going into effect, we were concerned the price would be $500 or more, so when it came in at $450, we were actually pretty happy. $400 would obviously have been the best-case scenario, but we thought $450 was a solid market price.</p>
<p>Obviously, when they <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Friday that they were going to put the pre-orders on hold, that's a whole new ball game. Clearly, this is an ongoing issue that I think everybody's trying to figure out. We met with Nintendo executives last week and they were confident in the pricing, but it's an economic environment that nobody can really predict. The decisions are made out of Japan on that pricing and it has to tie closely into what they feel they can lose.</p>
<p>Nintendo is a public company that's very much dependent on hardware sales to, if not generate a profit, at least not generate a loss. They're not like Microsoft, which has taken a big loss on hardware just to try and build an installed base. Nintendo doesn't tend to do that, so we are very concerned about the issue of, will they be forced to increase the price? Will they limit their manufacturing? Right now, they're cranking up the manufacturing and building up the inventory. They have quite a bunch of Nintendo Switch 2 inventory ready for launch, but going forward in the next few months, they may start to scale back on manufacturing a little bit.</p>
<p>There just may be another case of shortages, hopefully not as bad as what we saw with the<br>
PlayStation 5, but they may start to control inventory more, which would affect our topline forecasts because there would not be enough units to meet demand.</p>
<p><strong>That makes sense. It looks like they didn't factor in the tariffs for their initial Nintendo Switch 2 pricing. In your report, you're expecting a 20% price increase over the next couple of years. Were you referring to the Switch 2 or just generally across the industry?</strong></p>
<p>I think we're looking at prices on hardware, accessories, and software. Everything is set to increase and we've modeled that in our forecast. There will be declines in prices hopefully within the 2-year period. Obviously, it's a changing environment out there. The latest news I heard was that there would be a 90-day hold on these tariffs, but I think that's probably fake news. People are speculating every which way, which makes it very difficult to forecast accurately, knowing that it can really hit on two, with fewer products getting manufactured where they scale back on accessories.</p>
<p>Obviously, they have things like a camera and all kinds of different accessories. One of the first things they'll do is probably scale back on how much inventory is produced because they definitely don't want to build up inventory. You get a situation where the cost of manufacturing is higher and the cost of passing that on to the consumer is higher. You also have consumers knowing that this tariff price increase is probably temporary, so prices will hopefully come down. I'm going to wait a few months. Now that they've announced that $450 price, it's going to be tough to roll it back. That's a real catch-22 because I think if they were forced to increase the price and pass that on to consumers, a lot of consumers would look at it and say "Well, they announced the $450 price. They're increasing it because of the tariffs, but I'm just going to wait and wait till the prices roll back." It's a real catch-22.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering if you think Microsoft might be forced to raise the price of the Xbox consoles. Of course, it's a US company, but the consoles are not actually manufactured in the United States.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. The impact is far-ranging and it's not just the video game industry, it's all consumer products, so you have this huge macroeconomic situation where prices are increasing across the board. The video game industry is definitely not isolated in this issue.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think that that is going to be a huge change for the game industry. In the past, people said Nintendo was kind of their own ecosystem and not really competing with what Sony and Microsoft are doing. Now, they are stepping up to say "Hey, we're going to be a platform for serious AAA third-party game publishers." They've realized that the audience is expanding and they're definitely going after it. There's a real potential to shake up.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Indeed. You believe that the Nintendo Switch 2 could potentially engage more directly with the PlayStation and Xbox fanbases compared to the original Switch, right?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. We've done all kinds of research on that topic because what we've seen is really that the Switch had nice penetration among PlayStation and Xbox owners who are looking for a second system. If you bought a PlayStation, instead of buying an Xbox, you tend to buy a Switch. Even among the core PC gaming community, if you're a big PC gamer, you know a lot of those games you play are going to be available on the PlayStation and Xbox, but you go buy a Switch because the products that Nintendo puts out aren't available anywhere else.</p>
<p>I think what you see with the Nintendo Switch 2 is Nintendo really focusing on that audience with a lot of third-party content and features like mouse controls. It's pretty interesting how they're able to offer a unique platform that in many cases for these core users is a secondary platform, but could become more and more of a primary platform, especially now that you can get a lot of sports titles and more mature titles like Cyberpunk 2077. Then you have products from FromSoftware, which I thought was really interesting. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They're bringing Elden Ring to the Switch 2</a>, but they're also announcing <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusive title from From Software</a>, which was interesting because Sony has been investing and partnering heavily with From Software (they made an acquisition late last year to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest minority shareholder in From Software's parent company</a>). That's a pretty big feather in Nintendo's cap to have such an exclusive.</p>
<p>At the same time, of course, they have that core Nintendo fanboy base that goes along with whatever Nintendo is putting out in most cases. I think that is going to be a huge change for the game industry. In the past, people said Nintendo was kind of their own ecosystem and not really competing with what Sony and Microsoft are doing. Now, they are stepping up to say "Hey, we're going to be a platform for serious AAA third-party game publishers." They've realized that the audience is expanding and they're definitely going after it. There's a real potential to shake up, more on the console side, not so much on the PC side, where you'd still see the Nintendo Switch 2 Switch as a secondary system.</p>
<p><strong>In addition, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a while ago that they would bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms. The Nintendo Switch 2 seems a perfect fit for that, especially with the mouse-like controls.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. It gives options to people who may want to play in different ways. Some people want to play with a controller and then you got a huge audience that loves to play with mouse controls. They're delivering more versatility.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the new Nintendo console may eat more into the Xbox base or the PlayStation's?</strong></p>
<p>Well, the Xbox base is pretty weak right now, so I think it's going to eat more into Sony's PlayStation base. Microsoft's strategy remains unclear. They're focused on diversifying across platforms, they're looking at what kind of new hardware form factor to deliver. The PlayStation 5 is the really competing console platform right now out there. Whether that changes when Microsoft announces something new remains to be seen, but right now, it's really going directly after the PlayStation base.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 is doubling down on the handheld capabilities. Just yesterday, Phil Spencer teased an Xbox handheld once again, and there have been rumors even of PlayStation considering another handheld. Do you think there is space in the market for new PlayStation and Xbox handhelds, or is it just getting saturated with the Steam Deck and other PC handhelds?</strong></p>
<p>The problem with Sony and Microsoft, with both the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series S|X, was that they were basically just power upgrades. They were more powerful versions of what came before, and they didn't really shift the market dynamics, so I think both Sony and Microsoft are scrambling, knowing that this is an era where portable gaming is huge. They don't really have an option for that. Sony tried major efforts with the PSP and the PS Vita back in the day, but they just were not able to gain any market traction. Sony has clearly said the PlayStation 5 is on the downtail of its life cycle. They've missed forecasts the past two years and it did great at launch. Now, sales are not weak, but they're not as strong as Sony expected and they've come out and said it's clearly on the decline.</p>
<p>The question is, what answer will Sony and Microsoft have in terms of new hardware? Do they reinvent their systems to become more like a Switch with a portable option? Nintendo has had 30-plus years in portable gaming devices, while Sony's had some failed experiments. The track record is not strong for either of those companies. They need to try and come up with something, but whether they can, that's the open question right now.</p>
<p><strong>Returning to the Nintendo Switch 2, one of the big shocking points of the reveal was, of course, the pricing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially for Mario Kart World at $80 (€90 in Europe)</a>. Some people are still a bit shocked. Do you think it may be more of an exception than the rule?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it's going to be more of the exception rather than the rule. There's already quite a wide range of price points. Third-party titles are coming in and they're not going up to that price range. There's a lot of flexibility on pricing with types of software. Nintendo said that Mario Kart World has a huge amount of content and they think consumers are willing to pay $80 for it. Most people will probably buy the $500 bundle that includes the Switch 2 and the game, so that breaks the price down to $50.</p>
<p>The price will probably drive a lot of sales of that bundle. They're also doing a lot of these upgrade packs, which I think are a really interesting concept. They're going to use that whole upgrade model to enhance the existing games for the Switch, adding new features and then either sell it for $10 to $20 or give it away if you become an online subscriber, so there's just all kinds of flexibility in the business model.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the tariffs could even impact software pricing?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Obviously, hardware has more of a direct impact, but you do have a lot of issues on the software side. Pricing could increase. Whether the publishers will eat that cost or not remains to be seen. I think it could show up in less discounting on products. One of the great things in the video game business is that you don't have to buy a game on day one; you could wait a while, and the price would come down. You might see an impact on that. I don't think it'll be as great as with hardware, but it definitely could have an impact.</p>
<p><strong>Analysts from Media Research <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thought</a> that part of the reason Mario Kart World was priced at $80 was to drive users toward digital purchases, which are $10 cheaper. Do you agree?</strong></p>
<p>It could be, but I really don't think so. One thing you have to consider when buying digital titles on Nintendo, especially when they're full games like Mario Kart, is it doesn't have a lot of onboard memory to store these games. Clearly, Nintendo is hoping to sell more of its proprietary memory cards. Digital buying on the Switch is growing, but I don't think Nintendo is necessarily trying to drive that any more than would naturally be the case.</p>
<p>They probably realize that people who buy physical copies have a higher price tolerance than people who buy digital games. They want the physical part to decline as much as possible, but at the same time, having a physical presence is still great.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the Game Chat feature will be a major factor in the success of the Nintendo Switch 2? It seems like they're making a big thing out of it this time around.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We were talking to all our headset clients and saying, "You got to look at the Nintendo Switch 2 and putting headsets out for that because I think it is going to be pretty big." Having a younger audience, Nintendo has always been a little intimidated by chat and the can of worms that can potentially open. They've taken a slower approach to that, but I think it's clear with what they're doing with the Switch 2 that they're going all in on the chat.</p>
<p>I'm sure they are spending a lot of time ensuring that parental controls and all that good stuff make the chat system robust but also safe. When you're in that business, same with Roblox and other companies that target a younger audience, you have to be very careful in those areas, but the chat is a much-needed feature and I think it'll be extremely appreciated by the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>The BAFTA Games Awards 2025 has wrapped, and all the trophies have been handed out. Sitting at the top of the table is Astro Bot, one of 2024’s most popular titles. It claimed no fewer than <strong>five </strong>BAFTA Awards, securing the winning spot in some of the most competitive categories, including the prestigious ‘Best Game’ slot.</p>



<p>It was joined by games like Helldivers 2 and Still Wakes the Deep, both of which landed multiple awards during the show.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-astro-bot-on-top">Astro Bot on Top</h2>



<p>Astro Bot has claimed the BAFTA Awards for some iconic categories:</p>



<ul>
<li>Best Game</li>



<li>Game Design</li>



<li>Family</li>



<li>Audio Achievement</li>



<li>Animation</li>
</ul>



<p>The results at the <a href="https://www.bafta.org/awards/games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BAFTA Games Awards</a> in London follow months of similar circumstances for Team Asobi’s wonderful platformer.</p>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep also had a nice spree at the BAFTAs, securing the following wins:</p>



<ul>
<li>New IP</li>



<li>Performer in a Leading Role</li>



<li>Performer in a Supporting Role</li>
</ul>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep was one of my top games of 2024, boasting some intense horror sequences that unfolded during a tense fight for survival aboard a besieged Scottish oil rig. </p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was able to grab the BAFTA Awards for Music and Multiplayer, while Hellblade II landed Technical Achievement. There’s a special nod reserved for Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, which received the BAFTA Award for Game Beyond Entertainment, which given the game’s backstory, is deserved through and through.</p>



<p>To my surprise, Vampire Survivors won Evolving Game, an award that I thought would for sure go to Hello Games and No Man’s Sky. Balatro managed to secure the award for Debut Game, and Thank Goodness You’re Here, the star-studded and bizarre comedy title, won the award for British Game.]</p>



<p>Stay tuned to Insider Gaming, as I was at the BAFTA Games Awards and secured some exclusive interviews with some of the biggest names in gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has announced the roadmap for <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lets-you-claim-boss-powers-for-yourself-next-season-ptr-opens-today/">Diablo IV</a>, as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/"> Age of Hatred</a> continues for the rest of the year, with the next big expansion for Diablo IV not coming until sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Diablo IV started 2025 with the current season, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-witchcraft-adds-the-armory-witchy-powers-and-a-new-storyline-on-the-tree-of-whispers/">Season of Witchcraft</a>, which will come to an end later this month, with the Belial's Return season picking up the baton. Following that will be the Sins of the Horadrim season, and then closing out the year will be the Infernal Chaos season.</p>
<p>Each will bring a new set of limited updates that players can grab before they're gone, along with permanent additions to the game, like new lair bosses coming in the Belail's Return season, and new nightmare dungeon activities in the Sins of the Horadrim season.</p>
<p>The latter will also be when players on consoles will be able to plug in their keyboard and mouse setups, as support for that control scheme on consoles will arrive sometime this summer. There will also be new collaborations with other series in both the Belial's Return season and the Infernal Chaos season, and the former will likely feature a few special add-ons as Blizzard celebrates Diablo IV's two-year anniversary.</p>
<p>Of course, the new expansion that'll be coming in 2026 will be what brings the most change to the game when it arrives next year. The first major expansion for Diablo IV, Vessel of Hatred, arrived a little over a year after the game's original release. This new expansion is spreading that time difference further, so it'll be interesting to see how players react to it once they see how much bigger, or smaller, it is from the last one.</p>

<p>For now, Blizzard teases that the new Diablo IV expansion will include leaderboards and a new ranking system. According to the roadmap image Blizzard showed off, that's about all we know about the expansion, which you can check out for yourself above.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the crowdfunding campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-coming-courtesy-of-steamforged-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em></a> went live. This tabletop adaptation of Arrowhead Studios' satirical sci-fi shooter was an instant success on Gamefound, reaching its funding goal 12 minutes after going live.</p>

<h2>The <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> Gamefound Campaign</h2>

<p>On its official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/helldivers-2-board-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> brings the fight for managed democracy to gaming tables. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> videogame, it is a co-op experience for 1-4 players. Players choose one of four classes, mission difficulty, and a planet on which to deploy.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-board-game-captain-miniature.jpg?itok=2W4PN7Fq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-board-game-captain-miniature.jpg?itok=jLMAShhj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there, you and your squadmates must manage your ammunition, prioritize targets, strategically use action cards, utilize different weapon types and stratagems, and heroically extract from the mission area. According to the campaign page, a single game takes 120-180 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>The base version of the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> includes many game pieces and elements that fans expect: damage dice, <em>Helldivers</em> miniatures, stratagem boards, and various status effect tokens. As for enemies, the base game only supports the insectoid Terminid enemies.</p>

<p>Thankfully, developer Steamforged Games included various expansions at different pledge levels and as add-ons. These include the Patriot Exosuit expansion, bringing mech power to the squad, and various boss enemies like the Bile Titan, Factory Strider, and Impaler. Finally, there is an Automatons expansion, bringing the robotic terrors of Malevelon Creek to the game.</p>

<p>There are three pledge levels for the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em>. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£61.00:</strong> The base version of the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Galactic Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£92.00:</strong> The base game, the Patriot Exosuit expansion, and two mystery expansions set to be announced at a later date.</li>
	<li><strong>Hell Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£246.00:</strong> The base game, Patriot Exosuit, Impaler, Bile Titan, Factory Strider, Automaton, and mystery expansions</li>
</ul><p>In addition, anyone who backs the crowdfunding campaign will receive a Gamefound exclusive <em>Helldivers</em> commemorative turn tracker coin at no additional cost.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;£383,714, more than six times its initial funding goal of&nbsp;£60,000. The campaign concludes April 22.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> is coming up to its second anniversary but it still has a good bit of gas in the tank. Earlier today <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> shared its <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap">roadmap for the game</a> across the rest of the year, though obviously we're a quarter of the way through that already. The game is currently in its seventh season, with its eighth, Belial's Return, starting sometime this month. This one, unsurprisingly, adds Belial, Lord of Lies as a boss, alongside a couple of bosses from Vessel of Hatred as "part of the updated Lair Boss system."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This is the part that isn't as fun though: that season will also be bringing in an "IP collab." That's obviously a bit of a red flag, given how much <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> has fully lent into just ignoring the laws of its own universe with its own crossovers, but the blog post does note that the collab will feature "universes that complement its dark themes." Universes, plural, because season ten, (we'll get there) also features a collab.
</p>
<p>
Season nine, Sins of the Horadrim, starts in July and runs through to September, will bring in new powers, Nightmare dungeon activities, dungeon escalation, and an earnable pet. Aww! Then there's the aforementioned tenth season, which'll include the second collab of the year, as well as new chaos powers and an Infernal Hordes update (oh, and another earnable pet). There'll be some quality of life updates throughout the year too, like the Battle Pass and Seasonal Journey getting a refresh to help them "evolve in ways that are more rewarding."
</p>
<p>
There's no new expansion on the way this year though, with the roadmap noting the next one will be coming in 2026, alongside a new ranking system, leaderboards, and, uh, new something, that bit is obfuscated by some flames. Oops! Blizzard should take a look at that, can't read what's been burned away.
