            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/metaphor-refantazio-how-to-easily-spot-heismays-clones/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is filled to the brim with intense boss battles that can play much differently than your regular battles against mobs. Instead of just discovering an attack type or elemental weakness to gain extra turns, you will sometimes have to understand certain gimmicks that may not be immediately understandable.</p>
<p>At some point during the adventure, you will have to go after Heismay, a dangerous individual who is said to be kidnapping children in the village of Martira. After cornering him, you will have to fight the supposed kidnapper, and it's here that trouble begins, as the eugief has the ability to create some clones that, once attacked, will make you waste precious turns. Making matters worse is the fact that the game doesn't outright tell you how to identify the clones, forcing you to guess.</p>
<p>There's actually a way to identify the clones, even in the first battle against Heismay in Metaphor: ReFantazio. All you need to do is to <strong>check for shadows</strong>, as only the real Heismay casts one. Attack him to dispel the clones temporarily and repeat the process every time he creates new ones.</p>
<p>For the rest, the battle is really straightforward. Heismay doesn't have any weakness, so use your strongest available attacks while buffing your party members and debuffing your enemy, and healing when needed. Before long, the battle will be over, and your adventure can continue. You will eventually have to fight Heismay again, but the above strategy will be as effective in the second fight as it is in the first.</p>

            <p>Indonesian indie developers stellarNULL have announced action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mentari">Mentari</a>, a coming of age story about a magical girl who heals the world and fights baddies with the power of dance. As they attack you, you'll hit them with sick twirls and the 'ol two step, cleansing them of a sickness called the "Stillness". Bonus fun fact: Mentari means "Sunshine" in Indonesian, while Menari means "dancing".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As I mentioned, the world has been afflicted by a sickness and it's up to Mentari, a girl who dances really well, to save it. At first you'll start with a limited number of dance moves, but as you progress, you'll be "able to create your own choreography" with the devs saying there's "hundreds of possible combinations". I hope this means I can connect Fortnite's iconic default dance with the foxtrot.</p>

<p>As for exploration, it looks like a sort of top-down affair, where you'll help out pals and they'll open up previously blocked pathways once you've done so. A bit like, I don't know, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley">Snufkin</a> adventure game, or most metroidvanias. There's no word on what sort of tasks you'll perform, but judging from the trailer above, there looks to be some light platforming and relentless boogying.</p><p>One thing I'm keen to see from it is the Indonesian influence. I'd love for it to be more of a learning experience than anything, with intros to Indonesian dance or food or the language. I don't really know much about the country, besides the fact they're a legendary badminton nation, which is a shame. I'd hope the game would help deliver some of the education I so sorely need.</p>
<p>There's no release date for Mentari just yet, but you can follow its progress over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146560/Mentari/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-officially-in-development-at-longdue/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-officially-in-development-at-longdue.1007022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-officially-in-development-at-longdue/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, newly established independent studio Longdue announced that it is creating a spiritual successor to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-a-tapestry-of-beautiful-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disco Elysium</a>. Longdue already has around twelve members, many of whom worked on the highly acclaimed role-playing game made by ZA/UM, and they also have two open positions for an Art Director and a Writer. Both are enabled for remote work.</p>
<p>Narrative Director Grant Robert said:</p>
<p><em>At Longdue, we're inspired by decades of classic RPGs, from Ultima and Wizardry, through Fallout and Planescape, to the justifiably adored Disco Elysium. We're excited to continue that legacy with another narrative-first, psychological RPG, where the interplay between inner worlds and external landscapes is the beating heart of the experience. We're building a world-class team for a world-class game that will tell a world-class story, and we can't wait to show you more.</em></p>
<p>The press release outlines a broad overview of the game that sounds certainly as ambitious as the award-winning Disco Elysium. According to Longdue, the studio's debut RPG explores the interplay between the conscious and the subconscious, the seen and the unseen. Set in a world where choices are made between the character's psyche and the environment, players navigate an ever-changing landscape shaped by internal and external forces.</p>
<p>The game will introduce a groundbreaking 'psychogeographic RPG' mechanic, where every decision reshapes both the world and the characters that inhabit it. In this experience, the boundaries between mind and environment will blur, colliding and transforming with each choice, guiding players through an ever-evolving narrative landscape.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://www.longduegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website </a>of Longdue already allows fans to subscribe to a mailing list to stay in touch with any meaningful updates on the studio and its aforementioned debut project. This will certainly be welcome news for all those players who were highly disappointed by the cancellation of the planned Disco Elysium sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/youd-be-forgiven-for-thinking-this-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-from-some-of-the-people-who-worked-at-zaum-is-disco-elysium-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>On Disco Elysium’s five-year anniversary, two separate studios each made up of people who used to work at developer ZA/UM have announced they're both making a spiritual successor of their own.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> is a 2019 narrative role-playing game developed and published by controversial studio ZA/UM. Gameplay revolves around navigating dialogue trees rather than combat, with each of the 24 skills representing a different aspect of the amnesiac detective protagonist's abilities and thoughts. The player is free to support or suppress his ideologies as they work through the story. Disco Elysium is considered by some among the greatest video games ever made.</p><p>It went on to enjoy enormous success, winning numerous game of the year awards and selling millions of copies. A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-tv-adaptation-announced-from-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-producer">TV series adaptation deal</a> followed, as did the release of an expanded version of the game featuring full voice acting and new content subtitled The Final Cut. A follow-up seemed all but guaranteed, but after high-profile staff exits and subsequent messy legal tussles brought ZA/UM to its knees, what might have turned out to be a Disco Elysium sequel was canceled.</p><p>Now, two new London-based studios have emerged from the chaos: Dark Math Games and Longdue Games. Each has drawn a line back to both Disco Elysium and ZA/UM in the announcement of not just their existence, but their upcoming games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>XXX NIGHTSHIFT Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Let’s start with Dark Math Games. Founded in 2023, Dark Math describes itself as a “breakaway group” from the original development team of Disco Elysium. It is a group of 20 people, about half of whom “contributed” to “bringing the critically acclaimed hit Disco Elysium and Disco Elysium - The Final Cut to life.”</p><p>Dark Math’s game is called XXX NIGHTSHIFT and, like Disco Elysium, is described as a ‘true detective RPG.’ Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Set 2086, you play a Patrol Op, Dinorah Katz, who is stranded at a luxury Ski resort in Antarctica. This original science-fiction setting lands you in a resort that shouldn’t exist with people that you shouldn’t know with the endless polar night covering a multitude of sins.</blockquote><blockquote>XXX NIGHTSHIFT will deliver a deep single-player role-playing experience with many tools and layers of gameplay. A unique companion dynamic adds more fun and offers different paths to solve cases. The innovative and powerful role-playing system respects your time and trusts your intelligence with seismic choices. It’s up to you to decide how your story unfolds — and how it ends.</blockquote><p>Based on its announcement trailer and screenshots, XXX NIGHTSHIFT looks remarkably similar to Disco Elysium, even down to the isometric perspective and dialogue text that moves up the right-hand side of the screen as the player makes choices and hears voice actors bring a narrator and the protagonist’s internal monologue to life.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One of the four Dark Math founders is art director Timo Albert, who was a motion graphic designer at ZA/UM from 2018 to October 2022. Albert commented: “Additionally to innovating the traditional RPG mechanics, we’ll bring something fresh to the table. You will see. And of course, a few less words. And a few more bullets, perhaps. In total: lot more fun.”</p><p>According to filings on Companies House, Dark Math's active directors include Heiti Kender, with his brother, Kaur Kender, listed as a resigned director. Kaur Kender was an early investor in ZA/UM and executive producer of Disco Elysium. In March 2023, a bitter legal dispute between Kender and ZA/UM over ownership of the coveted Disco Elysium IP was resolved, with a court ordering Kender to repay ZA/UM CEO Ilmar Kompus for legal fees.</p><p>Now, let’s move on to Longdue Games. It said it’s making a “new psychological RPG... set in a game world conceived by the leads of the now canceled Disco Elysium sequel.” Others working on this untitled Disco Elysium spiritual successor worked at the likes of Bungie, Rockstar, and Yes, Your Graces developer Brave At Night.</p><p>Longdue, backed by tech investor Riaz Moola, said it has a “focus on creating psychologically deep, narrative-first experiences” and wants to become “a meaningful and consistent voice in the isometric cRPG space.”</p><p>“With the fifth anniversary of Disco Elysium on the horizon, Longdue is proud to announce its formation as a new independent studio that has raised seed investment to create an RPG that will continue Disco Elysium’s award-winning legacy and represent a bold new artistic endeavor that aims to trailblaze in the narrative-first cRPG space,” Longdue said in its note to press.</p><p>Longdue didn’t name its game (all we have for now is a solitary piece of concept art, below), but it did say it features what it calls a “psychogeographic" RPG mechanic “where every decision reshapes both the world and the characters that inhabit it.” “In this experience,” Longdue explained, “the lines between the mind and the environment blur, colliding and transforming with each choice, leading players through an ever-evolving narrative landscape.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/b7e663f9-52dc-9c67-567e-baff454b6df0-1728595650682.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art for Longdue's Disco Elysium spiritual successor.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Here’s the official blurb on Longdue’s game:</p><blockquote>Longdue’s debut RPG explores the delicate interplay between the conscious and subconscious, the seen and unseen. Set in a world where choices ripple between the character’s psyche and environment, players will navigate a constantly shifting landscape, shaped by both internal and external forces.</blockquote><p>Longdue mentioned just one of its developers in its press release: narrative director Grant Roberts. Roberts said: “At Longdue, we're inspired by decades of classic RPGs, from Ultima and Wizardry, through Fallout and Planescape, to the justifiably adored Disco Elysium.</p><p>"We're excited to continue that legacy with another narrative-first, psychological RPG, where the interplay between inner worlds and external landscapes is the beating heart of the experience. We're building a world-class team for a world-class game that will tell a world-class story, and we can't wait to show you more.”</p><p>Londue isn’t announcing anyone else working at the company right now, “but is looking forward to talking more about the studio and the game in the future,” a representative told IGN.</p><p>It’s worth noting that neither Robert Kurvitz, the lead writer and designer of Disco Elysium and founding member of ZA/UM, nor Aleksander Rostov, who was art director on Disco Elysium, are involved with either studio. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-developers-involuntarily-left-zaum-responds">Both were fired from ZA/UM</a> in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct. Kurvitz and Rostov are reportedly making a new game of their own at a studio called Red Info, which is backed by Chinese internet company NetEase.</p><p>As for ZA/UM, it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaum-reportedly-cancels-disco-elysium-expansion-at-risk-of-lay-offs">reportedly canceled a standalone expansion for Disco Elysium back in February</a>, leaving several staff members at risk of losing their jobs. While an official Disco Elysium 2 seems as unlikely now as it did when ZA/UM first fell apart, it is clear that there are many who are keen to keep the dream alive.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>A spiritual successor to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> is now in development from the leads of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-standalone-disco-elysium-spin-off-would-have-been-most-hardcore-disco-since-disco">cancelled sequel</a>.</p>
<p>Longdue is a new independent studio comprising staff from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, as well as developers from the likes of Bungie and Rockstar. Eurogamer understands Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov are not involved.</p>
<p>The studio's first game will involve a "groundbreaking 'psychogeographic RPG' mechanic", where decisions made in the narrative will reshape the world and its characters.</p>

<p>Further, it will draw inspiration from both Disco Elysium and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planescape-torment">Planescape: Torment</a>, as well as other classic RPGs, with a narrative-first approach fuelled by player choice.</p>
<p>"At Longdue, we're inspired by decades of classic RPGs, from Ultima and Wizardry, through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> and Planescape, to the justifiably adored Disco Elysium," said narrative director Grant Roberts. "We're excited to continue that legacy with another narrative-first, psychological RPG, where the interplay between inner worlds and external landscapes is the beating heart of the experience. We're building a world-class team for a world-class game that will tell a world-class story, and we can't wait to show you more."</p><p>"We are excited to back the work of an incredible team of creative talent and support the development of a new type of narrative-first video game experience and associated technology to improve the creation of these games across the video game industry," said private investor Riaz Moola.</p>
<p>No further details on the game have been provided, in terms of release date or platforms, beyond the artwork above.</p>
<p>Longdue has made this announcement ahead of Disco Elysium's fifth anniversary next week.</p>
<p>Further, it comes alongside a rival game from other former developers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">XXX Nightshift will be the first project from Dark Math Games</a>, a studio describing itself as a "breakaway group from the original development team of Disco Elysium".</p>
<p>This seeming rivalry is likely the result of unrest at the studio following the release of Disco Elysium, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">lawsuit</a>, reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">toxic behaviour and IP theft</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">layoffs</a> after a standalone expansion was reportedly cancelled.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-archeage-2s-new-title-out-in-2025-the-pc-version-requires-an-rtx-2070-super/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ArcheAge Chronicles </a>developer XLGames <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KLtjnEOx3E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new developer diary for the upcoming MMORPG. In the video interview, various development team members discussed the game's features and content.</p>
<p>One of the main changes of this game (formerly known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-ii-gets-stunning-debut-trailer-and-first-info-confirmed-for-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ArcheAge 2</a>) is the switch towards PvE rather than PvP (although the latter mode is still present in the game). This was consciously done in an attempt to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Executive Producer Yongjin Ham:</strong> ArcheAge Chronicles isn't just a sequel to ArcheAge. Recreating ArcheAge to resonate with contemporary audiences was crucial. We aimed to infuse the game with new elements suitable for a new era, and we needed a title that reflected this shift. The name 'Chronicles' emerged, and we felt it aligned perfectly with the game's direction.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>People often expect large-scale battles and competitions from an MMORPG, which are indeed important. However, we also believe cooperative content and adventure stories, where players become the protagonists, could attract a broader audience. We hope for ArcheAge Chronicles to reach a wider audience than its predecessor. By making the game available on both PC and consoles, we aim to ensure that a greater number of players can enjoy the experience.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Creative Director Jaehwang Lee:</strong> We are prioritizing the PvE aspects of ArcheAge Chronicles, as we believe that engaging with a variety of monsters enhances the game's appeal. But this doesn't mean the game won't have PvP. Rather, we believe if the monsters and combat mechanics are interesting, the PvP experiences will naturally be enjoyable as well.</em></p>
<p>On the subject of combat, XLGames is striving to make it as engaging as that of any single player action game, although that has been a challenge due to the MMO nature of ArcheAge Chronicles.</p>
<p><em><strong>Executive Producer Yongjin Ham: </strong>Building action combat on an MMO server comes with its challenges, like network issues. If we solve these, we might really create something incredible. We aim for the action combat to rival that of a single player game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Technical</strong> <strong>Director</strong> <strong>Yongmin</strong> <strong>Kim:</strong> Typically, combat in an MMORPG isn't as detailed as in a single player game. We've had extensive discussions about hitbox and NPC AI designs to compensate for those shortcomings.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>ArcheAge Chronicles, which is being developed with Unreal Engine 5, will be released at some point next year for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>Perhaps it’s just a testament to the archetypal strength of the image, honestly, but there’s no denying this fallen giant king looks especially gorgeous in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bylina">Bylina</a>. I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. </p>
<p>It’s a single player action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.</p>

<p>That isn’t discordant folk music at all! But it is very metal. The trailer shows a close range archer - truly one the most brilliantly, recklessly stupid player builds - dodge rolling around some big woodland bastards. They’re also occasionally taken by what looks like some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_plague_of_1518">dancing mania</a>, although I can’t tell whether that’s just for the trailer. Let’s see if the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461440/Bylina/">Steam page</a> can clue us in.</p>
<blockquote><p>Falconet dreams of following in the footsteps of his father, a fabled bogatyr - but during what seems like a simple task, he finds himself in the dark and mysterious Far Far Kingdom where... he dies. To his surprise, the young hero is revived by a mysterious spirit with whom he must now share his body. Falconet faces three daunting tasks: reclaim control over his soul, uncover an ancient mystery surrounding his new companion, and save the world from imminent doom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Am I possessed by the spirit of funk itself? Is that what’s going on here? I don’t doubt there are worse things to be possessed by in a world in which trees have mouths. No release date on this one yet - it’s slated for sometime in 2025. Enough time to contemplate the inevitable slide toward entropic decay that awaits all once mighty kingdoms, and the futility of clinging on to past glories once your time has passed. I will not make a Dark Souls reference. It is beneath me.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elon-musk%E2%80%99s-tesla-optimus-brings-us-one-step-closer-to-detroit-become-human.1006989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-tesla-optimus-detroid/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Tesla just unveiled the ‘Optimus’ robot, a handy humanoid companion that can perform a range of day-to-day activities. It can walk your dog, water your plants, serve your dinner, and perhaps one day, it’ll rise in rebellion against its fleshy masters and fight for the power of sentience.</p>



<p>Elon Musk said it’s the ‘biggest product ever’ and suggested it can alter how we as humans interact with the world around us. For now, it’ll be available only to the world’s elite, thanks to the $20,000 (starting) price tag.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-happening">It’s Happening</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human is a phenomenal game that tells the tale of a population of android assistants that gain sentience, breaking free of their programming and fighting back against their human controllers. It’s a choice-and-consequence title like no other, and as players explore it, they’ll be taken down an emotional and immersive path.</p>



<p>It recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/detroit-become-human-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 10 million lifetime sales</a>.</p>



<p>In Detroit, many of the synthetic assistants fulfil roles and complete tasks that Tesla’s Optimus robot will. In a demonstration video, we saw Optimus serving drinks, cleaning a kitchen work surface, and even socialising. Musk, the eccentric billionaire (which is how it always starts), said that Optimus is designed to ‘blend seamlessly into everyday life’.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Long-term, there’s a goal to have Optimus take over almost every ‘mundane’ task humans hate to do. It’ll mow the lawn, babysit your children, and offer a therapeutic chat at the end of a hard day at work. At the most, Musk estimates the Optimus will cost around $30,000, but being honest, the convenience it could offer will be enough for some to invest.</p>



<p>Elon Musk is a gamer, how long will it be before Optimus can grind for you on an MMO or help you get out of hardstuck Iron on VALORANT?</p>



<p>Presently, the Optimus <strong>looks like </strong>a robot, even if it is a humanoid one. If Tesla applies a layer of skin and some working body parts (behave yourself) to the Optimus, we’ll be <strong>another step closer </strong>to Detroit: Become Human.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Won’t Stop Selling Xbox Consoles in Saudi Arabia]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-consoles-saudi-arabia/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-won%E2%80%99t-stop-selling-xbox-consoles-in-saudi-arabia.1006980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-consoles-saudi-arabia/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, reports started surfacing claiming that Microsoft was preparing to wind down sales of Xbox consoles in Saudi Arabia. In a post on social media that kickstarted the discussion, it was written that ‘even distributors won’t be able to get the device.’</p>



<p>This apparent revelation prompted Microsoft to get involved, and the Chief Consumer Sales Officer, Ami Silverman, set everyone straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-plans">No Plans</h2>



<p>In a statement circulated amongst outlets, Xbox’s Ami Silverman said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Xbox devices are available in all current Xbox hardware-supported countries, including Saudi Arabia</em>. C<em>onsole availability may vary by country but Xbox games can be played on consoles, PCs, and on phones, tablets or TVs where Xbox Cloud Gaming is available</em>. <em>Players can visit&nbsp;xbox.com/regions&nbsp;to learn more about how to play with Xbox.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Admittedly, it’s a pretty weak statement, but it eliminates the present concern that Xbox is preparing to pull out of Saudi Arabia. It doesn’t talk about the future of the market, but this should be enough to alleviate the concerns of Middle Eastern gamers.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been the smoothest sailing for Xbox over the last few years, but the goal of the company is to reach more gamers around the world, allowing for the Xbox platform to become the most accessible gaming service ever devised. </p>



<p>It was just about one year ago that Phil Spencer revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-gaming-growth-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immense growth in Asian markets</a>, and in July 2024, it was referenced that Microsoft’s ‘gaming ecosystem’ boasts <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-gaming-ecosystem-500-mau/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500 million monthly active users</a> – and that figure is growing exponentially. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsofts-xbox-earnings-report-q2-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox reported record growth</a> amidst layoffs and studio shutdowns. At the same time, Microsoft hit a $3 trillion market valuation.</p>



<p>But I digress.</p>



<p>Xbox won’t stop selling consoles in Saudi Arabia.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"Longdue’s debut project is developed with key creatives from the original Disco Elysium team and contributors to the unreleased sequel, carrying forward the thoughtful, narrative-first approach that defined its predecessor," Longdue said in a press release announcing both the studio's formation and the game itself. "The game explores the intricate relationship between mind and environment, offering players a story-driven experience where their choices shape both the world and its characters."</p><p dir="ltr">Like Disco Elysium, Longdue's currently unnamed project is an RPG that focuses on psychological depth and player choices, with the game's developers striving to honor Disco Elysium's legacy. It's no coincidence that Longdue chose to announce the game and the formation of the new studio on the fifth anniversary of Disco Elysium's original release.</p><p dir="ltr">"Announced on the fifth anniversary of Disco Elysium, Longdue’s first project honors the cRPG canon while establishing itself as a steady and dependable voice in the future of isometric RPG design," Longdue said in the press release.</p><p dir="ltr">Described as "a psychogeographic RPG with narrative depth," Longdue's upcoming title will explore "the delicate interplay between the conscious and subconscious, the seen and unseen," and challenges places with difficult choices that will "ripple between the character’s psyche and environment," forcing players to find their way through "a constantly shifting landscape shaped by both internal and external forces."</p><p dir="ltr">Longdue says the "psychogeographic RPG mechanic" featured in the game results in every decision having an effect on both the in-game world, and the characters who live within it.</p><p dir="ltr">"In this experience, the lines between the mind and the environment blur, colliding and transforming with each choice, leading players through an ever-evolving narrative landscape."</p><p>Little else is currently known about the upcoming RPG, as its developer has yet to even reveal the game's title, but updates are likely to be posted to <a href="http://www.longduegames.com/" rel="nofollow ">Longdue Games' official website</a> as development progresses.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-ceo-thinks-that-user-feedback-is-more-important-than-data-in-game-development.1006965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nexon-ceo-feedback-more-important-data/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nexon’s CEO recently sat down for an interview at the Tokyo Game Show and started talking about his career, the growth of Nexon, and what it takes to build a successful game. Nexon is one of the world’s biggest developers and publishers of games, and most recently, the brand has been in the news because of certain character designs in The First Descendant, an action-MMO game.</p>



<p>Speaking candidly, Park Yong-Hyun, the CEO of Nexon Games, said that user feedback is infinitely more important than numbers and historical data when it comes to assembling a game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-numbers-will-not-produce-good-results">‘Numbers Will Not Produce Good Results’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/649/G064958/20241007024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview with 4Gamer</a>, Park Yong-Hyun, the CEO of Nexon Games, suggested that community feedback is one of the most important resources a studio can listen to when piecing together a game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that costs are high, I think that on the contrary, setting a strict budget and moving based on the numbers will not produce good results. If you rely on user feedback, it may make a difference in whether it sells or sells more, but I don’t think it will be the case that the development costs will go to waste if it doesn’t sell at all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yong-Hyun mentioned that ‘making games by calculating backwards form numbers was fine in the past,’ suggesting that the prior success of games and what went well back then isn’t enough to base the development of a new game on.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that focusing on user feedback is the most reliable standard at present … I think that if you confidently tell the upper management, “This game will be well received by users!”, it will be accepted, but I don’t think it will work if you say, “We can make this much money.” This is because the sales figures change depending on various circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nexon recently made some major changes to The First Descendant, an all-new action MMO that was released in July to a mixed reception. In recent days, the brand has piqued the interest of gamers everywhere on social media following the reveal of Ultimate Freyna, a more powerful variant of a base character with one of the most revealing outfits we’ve ever seen in a game.</p>



<p>The community response to this character was monumental, and a fervour set about the market that was indicative of the skin selling well despite not yet having hit the market. Ultimate Freyna was added to The First Descendant on October 10 and has been turning heads since.</p>



<p>What do you think? Do you believe that game developers <strong>must </strong>listen to their communities if they want to succeed? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-pro-x-superlight-2-dex-review/</link>

<p><em>I am speed</em>.</p>



<p>If the Logitech Pro X Superlight 2 Dex could speak, it would say that every time you grasp it, ever ready for action and willing to deliver. This premium, competitive-grade gaming wireless mouse is impressive in many ways, but the blistering speed it offers esports players is the biggest talking point here.</p>



<p>Read on to scout through my full Pro X Superlight 2 Dex review, hot off the press in 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-like-air">Like Air</h2>



<p>The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is one of those peripherals that looks dramatically simple on the surface but packs a punch under the hood. It weighs just 60 grams, which <strong>feels bizarrely light </strong>if you’re not used to esports mice. </p>



<p>That weight accommodates the enhanced HERO 2 sensor, the technology required to drive both the LIGHTFORCE switches and LIGHTSPEED mechanics and a battery that lasts a whopping 95 hours on a full charge. This is perhaps the lightest gaming mouse in the world right now, but it still manages to feel sturdy in your hand.</p>



<p>On a clean desk mat, the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex moves like a skate across flat ice. It’s as ergonomic as you could ever hope for a mouse to be, and when you’re gripping it, nothing is slowing you down from soaring across a gaming surface unhindered by <strong>anything</strong>. That’s thanks to the zero-additive PTFE feet, which offer best-in-class motion.</p>



<p>This is a competitive gaming mouse that has been designed hand-in-hand with the world’s best pro players, and that means something these days.</p>



<h2 id="h-talking-numbers">Talking Numbers</h2>



<p>The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex features Logitech’s proprietary Lightspeed technology, offering users an 8 kHz polling rate. When paired with the Lightforce switches, which feel immensely satisfying and responsive, users are moving fast and never missing a click.</p>



<p>It’s customisable through G Hub, even if there isn’t any way to customise the <strong>look </strong>of the mouse — by that, I mean there’s no onboard RGB. That’s not the point of this mouse, as it’s prioritising function over form.</p>



<p>The mouse has five buttons, a resolution that climbs as high as 44,0000 dpi, and a maximum speed of approximately 888 ips. </p>



<p>In the box, I was pleased to find optional grip tape designed to make the mouse more tactile at the cost of a couple of extra grams. It’s a soft-touch, easy-to-apply arrangement that’ll make the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex feel a touch more sizeable and easier to grip, especially if you’re the kind of gamer who gets sweaty palms.</p>



<p>Make no mistake – this is one of the most advanced wireless gaming mice you’ll ever see. I’ve been using one for a few weeks to work and play with, and I haven’t been able to identify a single flaw. And I’ve tried, but I’ll be wrapping this Pro X Superlight 2 Dex review without listing a negative.</p>



<p>At around $150, the mouse sits at the higher end of the cost spectrum, but it’s honestly worth every penny. I was perpetually tied to the G502 Hero as my daily driver for the longest time, but the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex and its versatility and accuracy may have just won me over.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/metaphor-refantazio-how-to-increase-skill-inheritance-slots/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-%E2%80%93-how-to-increase-skill-inheritance-slots.1006938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/metaphor-refantazio-how-to-increase-skill-inheritance-slots/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio features an interesting class system called the Archetype System that allows each character to play a role in battle. Whether it's physical damage, magical damage, healing, tanking, or support, each Archetype lineage has a specific focus, but you are given the chance to branch out a bit thanks to one mechanic that makes the entire system quite versatile: the Skill Inheritance system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241008131013_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you unlock any archetype in Metaphor: ReFantazio after reaching a certain point in the story, you will be given the chance to inherit skills you have learned using other Archetypes. All you need to do is access the dedicated menu at the Akademia or in the main menu after strengthening your bond with More, pick the skill you want to inherit, and spend Maga to make the skill inheritable. Doing so once will make the skill permanently available for inheritance, no matter the currently equipped archetype.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241008130943_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of the game, however, your customization options will be very limited, as Archetypes can only inherit a single skill. However, there's a way to increase the skill inheritance slots. By strengthening the bonds with your followers, you will learn the Scion's Skill, Scion's Merit, and Scion's Essence abilities, which will increase slots to 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The latter is generally learned at Rank 8 with only a few exceptions, like with Gallica, so the maximum number of customization possibilities will only be granted towards the end of the game. Still, by balancing your party composition and Archetypes, you should have no trouble being prepared for every danger you will encounter as you attempt to take down Louis and dispel the curse gripping the Prince.</p>

Australians have been asking for this for years — and Valve promised to make it happen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit">way back in November 2021</a>.</p><p>It’ll arrive <em>this</em> November in the same primary configurations Valve sells elsewhere: a 256GB configuration of the original LCD model, or 512GB and 1TB versions of the newer OLED model that also come with longer battery life, a better screen, and more. They’ll cost AUD $649, $899, and $1,049 respectively. </p><p>(While the OLED model does cost $250 AUD more than the original, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">it has so many important changes</a> that I’d personally recommend it over the LCD version to anyone who can afford it.)</p><p>While even the OLED model will be an entire year old by the time it arrives in Australia, there’s no current indication that Valve will release a faster, better version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">anytime soon</a> — and no handheld running Windows can currently match it for portable ease-of-use, even though some have an edge in performance and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the Asus ROG Ally X</a> can also beat it in AAA gaming battery life.</p><p>That said, Valve may also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">bring its SteamOS to rival handhelds</a> like the Asus ROG Ally X before too many more months go by, and I’ve been very impressed when running Bazzite’s version of the SteamOS interface on my Ally X review unit (though it has its wrinkles).</p><p>If you’re at PAX Australia in Melbourne, you can try the Steam Deck at Valve’s booth today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a post on <a href="https://x.com/MAlbsimi/status/1844310455432642698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a>, he said that Microsoft had already made retailers aware that it would soon stop selling Xbox devices in Saudi Arabia.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/football-manager-25-sports-game-delay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was <em>yesterday </em>that I was writing</a> about the stasis that major sports games find themselves in, with annual updates so minimal it's getting increasingly tough to see what's changed year to year. One sports game--<em>Football Manager</em>--had been looking to buck that trend in 2024, but sadly it has now suffered two major mishaps in quick succession.</p><p>The first came on September 4,<a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when developers Sports Interactive announced</a> that the game's international management mode--where players can not just manage a club side, but a national team as well--was being canned so that they could get the main game out on time.</p><p>Now, today,<a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> they've said that <em>Football Manager 25</em> itself, which should have been out very soon, won't be out until March 2025</a>. That's not a huge delay for a normal video game, but for a sports game, where so much of the appeal is based on featuring the latest rosters and teams, it's a <em>colossal</em> blow.</p><p>The reason for both moves is pretty major: for the first time in a long time, <em>Football Manager 25</em> was rebuilding itself from the ground up. New engine, new menus, new layout, the works. It was a bold decision to make, but also a necessary one; like the sports games<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about yesterday</a>, <em>Football Manager</em> was starting to feel a bit stale, its sluggish menus and dated presentation making it look increasingly tired.</p><p>This delay will be a <em>huge </em>deal for the game and for its sales, because March is nearing the end of the European football season, which normally wraps up in May. Traditionally, like other football games, <em>Football Manager</em> would release towards the end of the calendar year, which was early enough to still play out most of the current season (which starts in Aug-Sep), while also allowing the game to be on shelves (physical or otherwise) in time for the holidays.</p><p>Nevertheless, I think this is <em>great</em>. Unlike other major sports games, Sports Interactive recognised their game's advancing age, made a bold decision to get with the times and stuck to it. It hasn't entirely panned out, sure, but a move like this isn't made for just one year, it's made for years and even decades to come, and so even if <em>Football Manager 25</em> doesn't really come together--and let's be real, given this delay there's a chance it may not come out at all--everyone involved in this decision still deserves an enormous amount of respect.</p><p>Especially when you consider how frank the team are in the announcement post, writing:</p><blockquote><div><p>In the previous blog we explained that it has been a difficult development cycle for the studio. Many things have been moving slower than we had predicted – despite everyone in the team working at an incredible pace to try and get everything done.&nbsp;</p><p>Timelines were already tight and, as rightly pointed out by many of your recent comments, we were simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards. This has put an enormous amount of pressure on everyone working across the studio, who are all passionately committed to delivering the best game possible.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>FM25 is the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation. We simply cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history by rushing to release it in November.</p><p>Of course, this is not where any of us expected to be seven weeks out from our release but, in the spirit of our studio values, we always consider the bigger picture – and the bigger picture here is that we need this additional time to deliver a game that we can all be proud of.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Whatever happens to <em>Football Manager 25</em>, I'm a lot more optimistic about <em>Football Manager 26</em> and <em>27</em> than I am about any other big sports game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">US court ruling earlier this week</a> that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store on November 1st, Microsoft is ready to take advantage of the changes.</p><p>“The court’s ruling to open up Google’s mobile store in the US will allow more choice and flexibility,” says Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255">in a post on X</a>. “Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android.”</p><p>Google’s Android app store is an illegal monopoly, and the search giant has been ordered to open up the Play Store to competition for three years. This means no longer forcing developers to use its own Google Play Billing after a jury found that Google had illegally tied its payment system to its app store. Google will also have to distribute rival third-party app stores<em>&nbsp;</em>within<em>&nbsp;</em>Google Play.</p><p>Xbox store purchase support directly in the mobile Android app will allow Microsoft to sell Xbox games freely on Android devices, and integrated Xbox Cloud Gaming features mean people will be able to immediately stream games to their handsets after purchasing them. </p><p>It’s not immediately clear why Microsoft can’t already provide Xbox game purchases inside its Android mobile app, though. You can buy games from Steam or the PlayStation Store on mobile devices, so Microsoft has long been the exception here. I asked Microsoft for more details on the store changes, but the company says Bond’s statement is all it has to share right now.</p><p>Separately, Microsoft is also working on a browser-based Xbox mobile store that it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153245/microsoft-xbox-mobile-gaming-store-july-launch">originally planning to launch in July</a>. The store will eventually focus on first-party mobile games from Microsoft’s various studios, but initially it will feature deals and in-game items. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211805/where-is-the-xbox-mobile-store">Microsoft said in August</a> that testing had begun on the web-based mobile store and “work is progressing well and we will have more to share in the future.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 11th</strong>: Article updated to note Microsoft isn’t sharing any more details on its Xbox mobile changes on Android.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Splinter Cell Remake was officially announced in December 2021, with Ubisoft announcing that they were doing a remake of the 2002 title Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell. They announced that they were developing the game using the Snowdrop engine. This engine was also used to develop Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws, both of which didn't perform particularly well for Ubisoft. After rumors swirling around for a significant period of time suggesting that the Splinter Cell Remake had been canceled, new rumors have reported that the Splinter Cell Remake is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">continuing to progress</a> over at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Ubisoft Toronto is the one leading the remake development, and it announced the game with an interview on the Ubisoft website, alongside a video. However, that was over two years ago and there has been nothing posted by the company since the initial announcement.&nbsp; As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, it's rumored that the game is still being developed under the codename North. As stated previously, they are using the Snowdrop Engine to develop the game, whereas the previous Splinter Cell games in the franchise were developed using Unreal Engine 2 and Unreal Engine 2.5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splinter Cell Remake: Stepping Out of the Shadows | Ubisoft [NA]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When the game was first announced, it was said that the game was in the "very earliest stages of development." Compared to most games coming out these days that are remastering old games, Ubisoft has gone the route that Square Enix took with Final Fantasy 7 and has decided to do a full-on remake. As they have stated, they are building the game from the ground up, including creating new visuals, which means that the game is going to take an extensive period of time. Looking back to the example of Final Fantasy 7's remake, there are significant gaps between each release. The remake was first released in 2020, with Rebirth being released in 2024.</p>
<p>Because of how drastic the changes are and how they have stated that they are taking their time to make sure the visuals are linear to the original, it's possible that those excited for a high-fidelity remake of teenage nostalgia will take a bit longer. Some sources suggest that the Splinter Cell Remake will be released sometime in 2026, but there's no guarantee that there will be any news by that point, depending on what other projects Ubisoft is focusing on in the meantime.</p>
<p>In addition to the general development process, it's possible that the team developing the Splinter Cell Remake will be impacted by Ubisoft's financial insecurity right now, as well as the possibility of the company going private and receiving a change in CEO as well as potential layoffs. At the moment, it's anyone's guess as to what is happening with the Splinter Cell Remake, but we have to trust that the statement is correct and that the game is still in active development.</p>

			<p>Anime fans of all ages, let it be known that another Dragon Ball game is upon us, and it’s a damn good one! That means it’s once again time to learn all about how Goku became the worst father of all-time. Wait, no. It’s time to find out how Gohan stopped being a whiny baby, became a badass teenager, and then became a whiny adult again. Wait no. It’s time to d-d-d-duel?</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dfbu3CJS0uY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is an interestingly placed Dragon Ball game. The last few games based off this long-running anime series have been an intensely competitive fighting game in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, and a time-travelling constant What-If? scenario complete with co-op and custom characters in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/02/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review/">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a>. Those two games were inherently aimed at very different audiences in terms of raw gameplay, but ultimately, as a huge Dragon Ball fan, I’ve played a lot of both – as have a lot of people, I’d imagine. Also, there was a card game and a lot of mobile gacha games as well, but we’re not here for those.</p>


<p>Sparking! Zero sits more on the Xenoverse end of things than the FighterZ end, but really, it’s about throwing us back to the PlayStation 2-era Budokai Tenkaichi games. That means you get to transform in battle, you get to clash your beams against each other, and you get just so very many characters to mess around with. Sure, there are a lot of people who look like Goku here (or actually just are Goku), but to be fair to the game, that’s true to the source material.</p>


<p>The story is largely stuff we’ve all seen before, although the alternate takes on things are fun, especially as you get to make the conversational decisions yourself, and you’ll get to see a lot of What-If? stuff throughout the game, which is great. The key thing here though, is the combat. You’ll be mixing in melee strikes, ki blasts at range, and special skills as well. It’s standard Dragon Ball fighting stuff, but it’s the more granular things that help this feel like you’re playing an episode of the anime.</p>
<p>As long as you manage your resources well, you can teleport behind enemies as you get hit or deflect incoming energy blasts with a well-timed block. You can also switch in and out of different characters and even transform between different forms. Different characters have their own unique quirks to learn as well, so you’ll need to practice to be truly great, but if you master the basics, you’ll be able to make most characters look good in battle.</p>

<p>It’s all a lot of fun, but it does take time to get to that level, because the learning curve here can feel pretty steep, especially if you’re not familiar with the previous games in the vast Dragon Ball lineage. It’s worth pushing through though, because the result is one of the most joyful interpretations of Dragon Ball we’ve had in a long while, and while I don’t think it’s reinventing anything, it looks good, sounds good, and feels good to play.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		As a modern successor and sequel to the classic PS2 era Budokai Tenkaichi trilogy, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is a great time for Dragon Ball fans. You'll have to ease yourself into the controls, but once it clicks it's a lot of fun to explore the full roster and smash anime characters together. 	</p></div>
