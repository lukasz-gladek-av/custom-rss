		<p><em>The muted reaction to Sony’s PlayStation 5 Pro presentation left the impression that whatever people want, it’s not what Sony was leading with in their unveiling of their newest gaming hardware.</em></p><p><em>So what do they want? What do we want from a new piece of games hardware? That’s hard to say, and it’s not a surprise that the inherently incremental nature of a PS5 Pro felt like a misreading of the room. Rob and Patrick will probably take “the same, but better” if it’s offered, but if you ask them what would excite them, they have some very different answers along very different lines than a getting a slightly better video card.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>So Patrick, it seems safe to say that the general reaction to the PS5 Pro was indifferent. Even in quarters where you might expect a bit more excitement around a $700 console with a better graphics card, Sony’s presentation didn’t effectively sell people on the idea that the Pro would deliver widespread, meaningful improvements and it doesn’t seem like anyone is really thirsting to buy an even more expensive video games console.</p><p>We’ve talked extensively about the fact that we are in an era of marginal gains for graphical performance in video games. It’s been a problem since the start of this generation, and was a problem with the latest generation of PC graphics cards as well (the fact that NVIDIA apparently left a chasm between its top-end 4090 card and the rest of the 40XX line did not help). Part of it is that there’s simply not a ton that really serves a dedicated showcase to the latest tech because most things are built to straddle a wide range of hardware specs, so you end up with the kinds of underwhelming examples that Sony used, where they were reduced to showing how marginal details in a game that already looked good are suddenly a bit sharper. The fact that poor old Joel and Ellie are dragged out of retirement for “one last job” every time Sony has a new hardware spec doesn’t do much to assuage that <em>Groundhog Day </em>feeling around these reveals.</p><p>I’m pretty sympathetic to the “make it look better just because you can” point-of-view, but while I can enjoy a flight of fancy where I spend $20,000 on a new setup to enjoy <em>Gran Turismo 7 </em>in 8K (but not with HDR, apparently!), there’s a difference between enjoying better graphics and actually <em>wanting </em>them.</p><p>I freely acknowledge that one reason we end up foregrounding graphics so much is because you can show screenshots and videos as part of a sales pitch, while just about any other improvement is something that has to be experienced firsthand to fully appreciate. But it seems clear that “more graphics” aren’t moving the needle anymore, and the industry is struggling to figure out what will.</p><p>Personally, I keep thinking about the wasted potential of the PS5 controller. This isn’t Sony’s fault: their first-party stuff makes good-to-great use of its adaptive triggers, if not necessarily the touchpad. But it’s one of the few things to come along in the last ten years that can make a profound difference in how it feels to play a game, and how much information the controller itself can impart to the player. There should be a slew of games making use of it, especially given how well that console sold, but outside of Sony it mostly gets treated like a clone of the Xbox controller. Think of how lively <em>Astro’s Playroom </em>feels in your hand, the way it underscored every game mechanic and let you literally feel like you had a better grasp of their controls. I tell you without a shred of exaggeration that adaptive triggers were transformative for <em>GT7</em>.&nbsp; This should have been a bigger deal, if only to Sony. When you’re talking about how game controls feel, how good their feedback is, that’s a huge part of the equation. But we’re frequently stuck playing games with frankly numb-feeling controls because neither controller nor keyboard-and-mouse support is particularly well-implemented, a lowest-common denominator situation where at best we get passable, somewhat inoffensive controls. I think you could argue we have some of the best controller tech games have ever had, and games have rarely done a worse job of making players feel connected to the games they are controlling. The general shrug that greeted the PS5 controller’s unique features hints at an underlying problem: games are a tactile medium, but that tactility is treated as a minimum target developers have to hit rather than an opportunity to make a game feel better and more engaging. Frankly, you could keep the ray-tracing and maybe even the HDR if more games gave me the immediate sense of involvement that I got from that initial slate of PS5 games.</p><p>In a word, I’m a lot less moved by level of detail than I am by attention to detail, and I think that’s the stuff I want from games a hell of a lot more than I want a GPU that’s 67% bigger delivering 45% better performance.</p><p>What about you? What’s the stuff you want from a new piece of games hardware now? Not “what do you think would be commercially successful” but what is the thing that they could do that would meaningfully enrich your experience of the hardware or address a problem that sticks in your craw?</p><figure><figcaption><span>The future Patrick still wants.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>What I want from video games these days is the ability to play them wherever, whenever at an acceptable quality. It’s the reason the Steam Deck is so central to my life, it’s the reason the Switch, before the Steam Deck, was my most played piece of gaming hardware. It’s why I’ve jumped through hoops to make my PC stream wirelessly to my TV in the family room. It’s why I wish my Apple TV had a native GeForce NOW app. Increasingly, I’m just asking for my games to meet me where I am, and allow me to play them when I have time for them.</p><p>In a way, you could argue this helps explain why things like the DualSense have been a flop, outside of a few experiments. One of Microsoft’s big pitches has been turning “every screen into an Xbox” through cloud gaming. Video game hardware has not just plateaued—it’s flattened. A game is a game is a game, and even Nintendo has ended up in a place where its central gimmick is not about a second screen, it’s about letting one screen <em>meet you where you are</em>.</p><p>In that sense, why would any developer put meaningful work into something that wasn’t portable? You can’t be sure where your game might be played, and that could be as simple as knowing you’re likely to have a PC port where you can’t guarantee what controller they’re using.&nbsp;</p><p>I suspect the PlayStation 5 Pro is more impressive than Sony’s presentation revealed. Not because Sony was holding back, but because it was a piss poor event. It wasn’t able to appeal to normies or sickos, and yet, each time a clip trickles out of Digital Foundry, it has me going “hey, that looks pretty good.” Some of this is caught up in something we’ve been talking about for a minute now, the idea that gaming hardware has entered a phone phase where upgrades are incremental and largely unnecessary, but I think it also speaks to Sony being unsure where to hang their hat on. It’s a bit like the dance EA does with its sports games every year, where they have to quietly convince you their last game was ass without actually saying it. But you’re trying to instill FOMO. The question with the PlayStation 5 Pro is who you’re instilling fomo in.&nbsp;</p>

That means that anyone who wants to play the meaty, brooding sequel to the 2018 GOTY needs to make a PlayStation account and sign in before playing, even if they don’t own a PS5 and never plan to. That hurdle is part of Sony’s larger attempt to move its PlayStation user experience onto PC without using its own game launcher.<br></p><p>And a bunch of Steam users still really hate it. <em>God Of War Ragnarök </em>is currently sitting at a 65 percent on Steam with over 2,000 reviews in so far, giving it a rating of “mixed” in the dreaded yellowish-orange font usually reserved for games with serious bugs or gameplay shortcomings. “I really wanted to give this game a thumbs up because it IS actually a good game, but the PSN requirement is stupid as hell and Sony needs to know that gamers will not stand for this,” reads one of the reviews.</p><figure id="" data-id="bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-recommend-id="image://bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-format="png" data-width="1389" data-height="827" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative God of War Ragnarok reviews" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative God of War Ragnarok reviews" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-recommend-id="image://bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-format="png" data-width="1389" data-height="827" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative God of War Ragnarok reviews" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sony’s PSN login requirement for Steam has been controversial since it was first foisted onto <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players earlier this year.

<p>In a Call of Duty showmatch like no other, the current OpTic Texas roster will face off against the OpTic Dynasty live on October 12. It was just weeks ago that OpTic Texas won the Call of Duty League Championship, securing the most coveted trophy in COD esports and nabbing a $1 million grand prize.</p>



<p>The OpTic Dynasty, however, represents the pinnacle of Call of Duty esports for many fans. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-for-the-bragging-rights">For The Bragging Rights</h2>



<p>In front of a live audience at the Esports Stadium in Texas, OpTic Texas will attempt to take down the OpTic Dynasty, cementing their status as a true power squad in the Call of Duty space. </p>



<p>This match will pit Kenny, Pred, Shotzzy, and Dashy against Crimsix, FormaL, Karma, and Scump.</p>



<p>Of the entire OpTic Dynasty roster, only one member is still actively competing in the esports scene, and that’s Matt ‘FormaL’ Piper – but he plays Halo under the OpTic Gaming banner. Crimsix is a race car driver, Scump is primarily a streamer, and Karma is a coach for the OpTic Texas team, which could give him the upper hand in this contest.</p>



<p>During the past CDL season, OpTic Texas secured the top spot at Major 3 <strong>and </strong>COD Champs, proving that the team has the talent required to win both chips and rings – a concept that the Dynasty is certainly familiar with. </p>



<p>If you’re interested in watching the action unfold – assumedly on Modern Warfare 3 – you’ll be able to check out the gameplay on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/OpTicGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpTic Gaming’s YouTube channel</a>.`</p>

The launch trailer is intense. The trailer shows legendary footballer David Beckham receiving a phone call but choosing to ignore it and instead turn up his TV's volume and lean forward to truly focus.</p><p>The trailer bounces between footage of the game and live-action scenes showing the dedication people have to the real-world sport with intense, close-up shots of gnarly blisters, a ball-bruised stomach, and x-rays depicting an injured ankle. There is even a quick shot of a player doubling over in exhaustion and throwing up their lunch. Take a look for yourself in the launch trailer below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24249913/twitch-depreciating-strike-twitchcon-trust-and-safety<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitch is changing the way it enforces its community guidelines. In <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/09/20/everything-we-announced-at-twitchcon-san-diego/">an announcement posted on its website</a>, Twitch said that it will introduce a new enforcement strategy in which strikes for certain offenses will depreciate over time, users will receive more information regarding their strikes, and users will be able to take educational courses to reduce the severity of enforcement actions. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Rob Lewington, Twitch’s VP of safety operations, and Kristen Murdock, the director of safety risk and response, spoke about the new program and what it means for moderating communities on Twitch.</p><p>According to Lewington, safety is Twitch’s highest priority. He said Twitch hosts over 105 million users per month with 1.3 trillion minutes of content viewed. But such enormous numbers, combined with Twitch’s age and popularity as a livestream destination, have created unique challenges in how the platform punishes people who violate its rules.</p><p>Currently, when a streamer violates one of Twitch’s community guidelines, they receive some kind of enforcement action like a warning or a suspension, which then counts against them in the form of a strike. After a certain number of strikes, that streamer’s account can be suspended indefinitely. “We’ve had people on Twitch for a long time that have had enforcements in the past, but they don’t expire over time,” Lewington said. “[This current system] is punitive for folks who’ve been on Twitch for longer and that’s not what we want to do.”</p><p>In this new system, strikes for “low severity” offenses will expire after a certain amount of time. Though accidental nudity was given as one example, Twitch did not offer a comprehensive list of what the “low severity” offenses are nor how long it would take for them to expire. “That’s still a work in progress,” Lewington said. “We’re still figuring out the exact timelines.” He did, however, say that strikes for high-severity offenses — incidents relating to child safety, terrorism, or hateful conduct — will never depreciate.</p><p>In addition to expiring strikes, Twitch will now offer more information to users when a violation occurs. Starting next year, Twitch will provide the relevant chat message or clip to give context on why an enforcement action was taken. According to Lewington, providing this information will help people better understand what they did wrong while also giving them the tools they might need if they want to file an appeal.</p><p>The final part of Twitch’s new enforcement strategy involves offering users educational courses when a violation occurs. As an example, Murdock described a situation in which a person who received a hateful conduct strike was able to reduce the length of their suspension because they took a relevant educational course and quiz.</p><p>Murdock said Twitch worked with the Anti-Defamation League and other outside experts to develop these courses and quizzes around subjects like hateful conduct, sexual content, and gambling. Their goal is to create consistent messaging for both streamers and moderators on what actions will constitute a violation.</p><p>Taken together, this new strategy represents a desire at Twitch to ensure its communities remain safe while allowing members who have made mistakes to learn and grow from their experience. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/uk-game-sales-august-digital/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent report, it was revealed that a whopping 75% of all games sold through August in the United Kingdom were <strong>digital purchases</strong>. It was documented that 1.74 million games were sold during the four weeks, and only 25% of them were hard copies, representing a 10% <strong>drop </strong>in physical game sales year-on-year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-alternatives">No Alternatives</h2>



<p>The report, which was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/75-of-games-sold-in-august-were-downloaded-uk-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">covered by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, confirmed that in August 2023, 65% of sales in the UK were digital. Over time, consumers in the United Kingdom have given up on physical media, and there are several reasons for that.</p>



<p>Firstly, digital gaming is becoming much easier and more accessible over time, with consoles shipping with larger storage drives and price parity stabilising across the board. Also, internet speeds are getting faster all the time, which means downloading or streaming games is also improving from an experience perspective.</p>



<p>Second, it’s important to stress that physical storefronts are dying out, and only GAME in the United Kingdom represents a ‘high street presence’ for the games industry across the entire region. In recent months, the decades-old retailer has faced severe struggles that have left many doubting the long-term prospects for the company.</p>



<p>With supermarkets boasting slim-to-nil catalogues of games and online storefronts often having some of the highest price points on the market, many gamers are turning to pre-ordering their treasured titles digitally, pre-loading them so they can start playing from the second the game goes live.</p>



<p>GamesIndustry.biz’s report also mentioned that Grand Theft Auto 5 sits atop the digital sales charts in the United Kingdom, which shows how the region is eagerly anticipating the arrival of Grand Theft Auto 6. </p>

<p>In a monumental report covering the state of play for Microsoft and Xbox, Bloomberg dove deep into the impact of the Game Pass subscription service. It’s not everybody’s cup of tea and it has garnered a mixed response from developers over the years, but one staggering statistic in Bloomberg’s write-up reveals just how invested Microsoft is in the platform.</p>



<p>It was said that the tech titan spends $1 billion annually to pull third-party games onto Game Pass, often parting ways with millions of dollars just to put pen to paper and get the deals signed. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-promise-of-exposure">‘The Promise of Exposure’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-20/xbox-president-sarah-bond-predicts-the-future-of-microsoft-s-next-game-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the gargantuan report</a> written by Bloomberg’s Dina Bass and Cecilia D’Anastasio, everything from the recent clash between Microsoft and the CMA to the potential of a handheld Xbox device was explored. </p>



<p>At one point, the conversation, which was focused majorly on Sarah Bond’s Xbox presidency, turned to Game Pass. In a retrospective, we got a glimpse of how the subscription service surfaced with a humble library and a low price point before becoming a massive effort that weighed heavily on Microsoft’s coffers.</p>



<p>It was a paradigm shift for Microsoft, standing up something that would see value trickle in over time rather than relying on that one supersized launch to rake in a substantial payday. That’s what Sarah Bond alluded to, touching on the alteration in the operating model:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s a difference between managing a network effect and maximizing the value of a single game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bloomberg then mentioned that Microsoft spends a whopping $1 billion a year bringing third-party games into the Game Pass ecosystem, which has been modelled recently as a ‘Play Anywhere’ system that transcends simple home consoles.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Game Pass was also a major adjustment for publishers. To sweeten the deal, Microsoft now spends $1 billion a year getting third-party games on the subscription service. </p>



<p>The largesse has been more than enough to win over small publishers, to whom it offers flat fees of millions of dollars upfront to include their titles, along with a portion of subscription revenue and <strong>the promise of exposure they couldn’t count on getting otherwise</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Owing to inflation, Game Pass has recently increased in price, and the games that take pole position in the library chop and change, but there’s no doubting the power it has as a subscription-based product. That notion is set to improve, too – next month, the first Call of Duty game will grace the service in the form of Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>It already incorporates titles from the Ubisoft Connect and EA Play services, making it a seriously stacked offering for gamers worldwide, and it’s getting better all the time. </p>



<p>Sarah Bond and the rest of the crew at Xbox have immense faith in the product, and with a seeming desire to move away from console gaming, it’s only a matter of time before a seamlessly connected Game Pass experience is the firm’s foremost focus.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-palworld-version-has-been-removed-from-tgs-exhibitor-list/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-palworld-version-has-been-removed-from-tgs-exhibitor-list/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Palworld was set to be on the exhibitors list at the Tokyo Games Show, but it seems that they have now been removed from the list entirely. This choice possibly comes after Nintendo issued a lawsuit, saying that Palworld was infringing on multiple of Nintendo's patents. On the day that the lawsuit was issued, one of the developers tweeted out an emoji while they were at TGS (as stated in their name on X). Still, an <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official statement</a> has been released on the Palworld social media and the Pocketpair website.</p>
<p>According to Pocketpair, they are unaware of what patents they are currently infringing on and are now beginning legal proceedings and investigations into <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">Nintendo's claims</a>. In their statement, they claim, "We have not been notified of such details."</p>
<p>Pocketpair is an indie game company based in Tokyo, and Palworld had a lot of hype before and after its release. The game has over 275,000 reviews on Steam, with a Very Positive review status on the title. Although most people assumed that the lawsuit would be copyright-related, with many of the Pals looking strikingly similar to the designs of Pokemon, their patents are causing the issue.</p>
<p>CESA released the exhibitors list from Tokyo Games Show 2024 on September 11, which was way before the lawsuit was publicly issued to Pocketpair. It was said that there was going to be a PS5 showcase of Palworld, but it was removed the same day it was announced. Pocketpair may still be showcasing Palworld regardless, and the list revealed by CESA was just incorrectly updated, or they were given the wrong details.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's likely that as a result of this lawsuit, either Pocketpair has made the conscious decision to remove themselves from the exhibitor list at TGS or the officials at TGS have removed them due to fear of unwanted attention or controversy by 'supporting' them. It's possible that Pocketpair will make a statement as to why they have been removed from the exhibitor list, but for now, it remains unknown.</p>
<p>If it were true that it was just a factual error, it's possible that their appearance or lack thereof at TGS has nothing to do with Nintendo's lawsuit. They could be there as visitors and nothing more.</p>

			<p>Concord is one of Sony's biggest mistakes in game development, with the game being pulled offline and refunded just two weeks after it launched. Concord aimed to be the premium in a sea of free-to-play hero shooters. However, the numbers weren't there, and it received a 1.8 Metacritic User score. In a recent <a href="https://x.com/longislandviper/status/1837157796137030141" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sacred Symbols podcast episode</a>, Colin Moriarty mentioned that they had spoken to one of the staff members who worked on Concord at Firewalk Studios and spoke "extensively for a long time" about Concord and its situation.</p>
<p>The whole situation was doomed from the start, with the game being overhyped internally and referred to as "the future of PlayStation." That statement could be correct to some degree, but would more so imply the future of PlayStation is going downhill along with Concord. The game was so hyped up within the studio and at PlayStation, that there was a dev culture of "toxic positivity," which didn't allow for any negative feedback to be given at any point.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While it was estimated at a much lower number, Concord cost about $400 million to make, leaving Sony a pretty hefty void after the game failed to perform as expected. Concord was in development for a couple of years, reaching an Alpha state in late 2023. At that point, Sony didn't even own <a href="https://wccftech.com/concords-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down/">Firewalk Studios</a>, but they had been working alongside them to create this title since 2020 or 2021. Moriarty mentions that before it had even reached the Alpha state, they had already spent at least $200 million on developing the game, which is a huge amount of money to sink into something that isn't even close to being released to the public. Moriarty mentions that it's uncertain how much of that money came from the original studio that was developing Concord and how much of it came from Sony.</p>
<p>Between the Alpha period and the game's release, Sony spent another $200 million on Concord. According to the employee who spoke to Moriarty, by the time the game was showcased to a public audience, it was in a "laughable state," and it looked so terrible that Sony felt they had to spend more money to make the product viable. By the end of the first quarter of 2023, the game was still incredibly unfinished, so Sony paid a significant sum of money and outsourced the game to other studios to try and put the product together.</p>
<p>Once the game was released, Sony made just about $1 million in gross revenue but then refunded everything. This is one of Sony's biggest losses on the market, with games such as The Last of Us Part 2 and Spider-Man costing less than Concord but being significantly more successful.</p>
<p>Sony so heavily championed Concord that it was considered a "Star Wars-like" project for them and would be successful on a grand scale. It was also seen as Hermen Hulst's "baby."</p>

<p>Nor could I ask any of them for "Favours" to scrape a few more heat stamps necessary for a new food district, indebting me to them at some future point when they decide they've had enough of some other faction's people and ideas. In&nbsp;<em><a href="https://frostpunk2.com/">Frostpunk 2</a> (</em>out today), the people who pop up to tell you how they're feeling aren't just helpful indicators, they're a vital part of the strategy. To keep these people going, you've got to make some of them mad, some of them happy, and balance a ledger of all you've gained and demanded from them.</p>
<p>That's the biggest difference you'll notice in&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em> if you're coming from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/frostpunk-review-ice-burg/">the original</a>. The original had you making choices that affected people, but you were the Captain, in full control of your people, at least until you angered them enough to revolt. In&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, you manage factions and communities rather than groups of survivors. You place districts, not hospitals. Time moves in days and weeks, not hours. You play multiple chapters across a landscape in a world that is 30 years removed from its initial peril.
</p><p>The challenge of <em>Frostpunk 2 </em>is no longer simply getting everyone through this winter. There is now some thought of what kind of people you want to be once you have enough fuel, food, and children. Are you in managed decline, or can you build something better, despite the world trying to kill you?</p>

<h2>A beautiful grid with brutal choices</h2>
<p>Those are the big-picture changes to <em>Frostpunk 2</em>. At the ground level, the general feeling is quite familiar. It's cold, it sometimes gets colder, and there's a furnace to feed. This time, you need to do "Icebreaking" to unlock tiles for development, but you don't have to worry so much about the exact placement of individual bits. Your colony or city will link itself up and look beautiful in the game's grim Victorian cryo-future style. You have to figure out how to scrimp the resources to put an extraction district on the oil reserves, making enough heat for the residents to stop getting sick so you can then send them out to recover goods from a decimated wagon and then icebreak some more toward a food source, all while planning to build a research center and council building.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The research and political trees you climb are more varied and even harder to choose in this sequel. Early in&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, your explorers find a body in the ice with the insignia of the first game's city on his jacket, and they ask you if it stands for Order or Faith. However you answer, you will have more than just two ideas to choose from. At the base level are two communities, Progress-focused New Londoners and Adaptation-minded Frostlanders. Then you get Order-obsessed Stalwarts, Faithkeepers, and their respective opposition, Pilgrims and Evolvers. Playing the game's "Utopia Builder" mode after the chapter-based story mode brings in a <em>lot</em> more communities and factions. You know, for this fun thing you do in your spare time.</p>
<p>At the Council Hall, you will need to negotiate with these factions to get votes out of the 100 members, divided up by faction influence. Most votes need 51, but votes that change your power require 66. If a faction is on the fence, you can promise them something, like future research projects or other law changes. Break that promise, and they will work against you in the future. Radicals will show up inside each faction, requiring you to either appease them or find support elsewhere. You can look at all the players and "Cornerstones" (ideologies) at play in one of the game's beautifully informative screens. You can ponder this while, all around you, the basic needs like fuel, materials, food, and shelter keep needing to be managed.</p>

			<p>As promised yesterday, following our Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-qa-no-side-quest-exists-without-contributing-to-the-narrative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Q&amp;A</a>, here's the full transcript of the longer roundtable Q&amp;A that featured BioWare's Game Directors Corinne Busche and John Epler answering all sorts of questions from the assembled press on the highly anticipated single player action RPG.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will continue the story of Inquisition a decade later (albeit with a different protagonist, although the Inquisitor will still be featured in the new game). Dragon Age Inquisition launched on November 20, 2014, whereas Veilguard will be released on October 31 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Fundamentally, it comes down to player agency. We, of course, are a single-player offline RPG. We value your choice and autonomy, and we want to respect that. I have a hell of a great time playing around with the skill trees and trying different builds. We want you to do the same. If you want to respec, more power to you.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>This game allows you to respec on a very organic level. You can do that anytime. That's something, I'd say, new to Dragon Age. How did that come to be that you could respec and not commit to a class?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>Yeah, that's a really lovely question. Thank you. Fundamentally, it comes down to player agency. We, of course, are a single-player offline RPG. We value your choice and autonomy, and we want to respect that. I have a hell of a great time playing around with the skill trees and trying different builds. We want you to do the same. If you want to respec, more power to you.</p>
<p><strong>I'm just curious: when did you guys decide that Rook would be essentially the only playable character and that you should focus more on that instead of what previously was mostly party-based combat?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>I think I can start this one and then maybe John if you want to jump in. Dragon Age has such an amazing, rich lore and history behind it. The worldbuilding, I really think it's what's kept this franchise alive and people discussing it 10 years after Inquisition. So our North Star was that we wanted you to embody Rook, to step into Rook's shoes, to experience this world on the ground as this character. And what that meant is giving you more autonomy, more control of the character, putting you in control of every single swing, and really making it feel like you're a part of this world.</p>
<p>What's more, we've talked a lot about the companions. I know a lot of the questions that came up today about Dragon Age: The Veilguard were about the depth and authenticity of the companions. We really felt like there was a big opportunity here to make the companions feel more realized, more like their characters who fight alongside you and have their own styles, motivations, and interactions if you're not actually embodying them.</p>
<p>But of course, throughout all of that, we do know in the combat system, that sense of teamwork, of pause and play, tactical depth. That has been the throughline through every single edition of Dragon Age. So we wanted to walk the fine line of making that teamwork and that sense of strategy show up but also make you feel like you're in this world.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>Yeah, and Corinne touched on autonomy as far as Rook goes, but also part of making the companions feel like their own people, like their own characters, is giving them that autonomy as well on the battlefield. Again, you are the leader of this group, they have their own personalities, their own stories, and we wanted to make sure that you felt that through the gameplay as well.</p>
<p><strong>Most RPGs right now are open world. Dragon Age Inquisition was open world, and I'm glad Dragon Age: The Veilguard is not. Was it hard to adapt, and does it change a lot the way that Rook is going to progress through the story?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>I'll tell you what: it's hard to buck trends sometimes, but we really felt we could tell the best stories and create the most curated moment-to-moment experience by going back to a mission-based structure. But maybe I'll turn it over to Francois, our Mission Director, and John to talk about our philosophy on that.</p>
<p><strong>Francois Chaput:</strong> It's a great question, and thank you for asking. One of the key things for us was understanding the opportunities. They were different opportunities than in the past. What can we do with this new focus that we found? We had to make sure that we stood on some solid pillars.</p>
<p>One of those was, "Alright, we have an opportunity to stay focused and make sure everything's contributing to a greater conflict, a greater narrative, and a greater sense of space." That was the first one. And then, to keep us in check and avoid going totally linear, we wanted to make sure the second pillar supported that in being one of player freedom and agency.</p>
<p>So, understanding how we can focus things and bring things in while allowing players to still have a choice, to still make their impact and still decide where to go, and still have things to uncover and discover. Those were our two key pillars. We had to establish that early on. Once we understood that, this was our new structure for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>I'm just going to add one more thing. One of the things about the spaces in Veilguard that I think is fantastic is that each space has a story of its own. These are not just spaces that exist for their own sake; they tell a story that, in a lot of ways, ties back to the overarching conflict, the overarching story.</p>
<p>Something we heard loud and clear in Inquisition was some of the spaces didn't necessarily feel like they had a purpose. We wanted to make sure every space felt purposeful and meaningful in the experience of Rook and companions against these elven gods, against the end of the world.</p>

<p><strong>I think we all had a bit of an idea that the character customization would be really in-depth when we came into it, but even still coming into it, it was even more detailed to the point where I don't think I've ever seen a cataract slider in a game ever. When you're going that granular with that kind of decision, how do you decide how far to go and where to stop?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it's a great question. Thank you. We wanted to hit a balance where players could make the characters that they wanted to make but also not be broken. So I think the tactic we took with that was really opening up the possibilities of how far you could take the sliders and the different options that you could take.</p>
<p>And then, through testing, playing, and evaluating it, we figured out how far we could tune it back so that the characters still looked like we wanted them to in the cinematics while still respecting the choices the player wants to make.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>Also, the character creator is an amazing player-facing thing, and it's so much fun. My kids, to them, that's what the game is. It's the character creator. At the same time, it's also what we use to build most of the NPCs that you interact with in the world. It is super cool to offer this much variety, but it's also from us where we just want to be able to tell the stories we want to tell. We needed to be able to push it that much further.</p>
<p>We were talking to somebody before about EA and how it's been really handy, actually, for hair in particular. I noticed some people really pushing the hair, which is great. But it's been cool with EA because we're sharing the engine with a number of other different groups that are pushing here. We've been able to borrow from them and learn and get amazing stuff and then share back in return. So it's been really beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>One of the things I might also add is of our three core design pillars, be who you want to be was the first, that was the starting point. We wanted everyone to feel like they belonged in this game to the best of our ability, we wanted that you could relate to the characters, so that meant sclera color. It meant cataracts. It meant vitiligo. Freckles. Respectful skin tones that react to light properly. I'm tremendously proud of the team and everything they put together to make sure that all of the players can feel seen, too.</p>
<p><strong>Was there ever any hesitation when it came to character creation? I read the news from Larian talking about how 80 percent of Baldur's Gate 3 players are selecting the half-elf, and only a tiny minuscule amount are picking whatever. Is there any sort of talk about that in the development studio, like, 'Do we really need to make this race of character playable when only a certain amount is going to be playing it?'</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>Challenge accepted is what we say. Here's a little fun fact for you. In Dragon Age Inquisition, only 5 percent of players ever played a dwarf. What we see in our player testing these days, we're up to 12 percent, so we'll take it. What that tells me is the more options you give players to embody the character they want to be, the more engaged they will be. We know our players love that. They're hungry for it.</p>
<p><strong>This is actually a question for Matt (<em>Rhodes, Art Director</em>). I loved the tarot card art in Dragon Age Inquisition and wondered why you decided against using it for this game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt Rhodes:</strong> It was such a core piece of of Inquisition. It was something that was actually born out of a Dragon Age week, where we give people a chance to work on something cool that they want for a week. And two artists just went absolutely nuts. I think they maybe only made three images each, but the art director at the time loved them and was just like, that's what we're doing now; let's do more of that.</p>
<p>One of the best jobs as a concept artist that I did on Inquisition was taking on their tasks so that they could work on those because, yeah, it became a thing. One of the things we've tried to do is keep the visual language of these cards and expand on it, so what was once the 2D frescoes from Origins and 2 has always been there, but like inject that style into the 2D cinematics. Even going so far as our UI artists, who extrapolated and took those shapes and started feeding them through the UI, so you'll see it all across the UI, the exploration icons and in-world diegetic things of the patterns and motifs that you notice on the glint system if you have that activated. We literally tried to take that and basically just blast it everywhere we possibly could get away with it.</p>
<p>This is part of Dragon Age now, and it's never not going to be part of Dragon Age. There's no way we could just stop doing this. One of the things that characterizes is that it was a cool passion project at one point, and then it expanded and we just went bonkers with it. But as with every game, people also want to try new stuff. These were actually all done by the same artist who was one of the original card creators. These were some of the beautiful last things he did for our project and they're gorgeous.</p>
<p>But it's cool because it's also this natural growth where, as an illustrator and a painter, you want to push it into new territory and continue that process. If you notice in the skill tree, there's just little illustrations that were also painted by the same artist (Ramil Sanga). Probably in the next game it's going to be in even more places.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Under the UI customization menus, you can disable damage floaties, whether you show incoming attack indicators or health bars. Hell, if you want to do a UI-less run, more power to you, but you can do that too. Customizing this experience for what suits you, whether we're talking about difficulty, builds, pause and play versus staying in the moment, and UI, it's been a central premise to us.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>One of the things I've noticed playing through Dragon Age: The Veilguard generally, but especially as you gain more skills, is there's a lot on screen. There's a lot of flashy things, and I was wondering, I know Final Fantasy XIV has the idea that you can have many crazy things on screen or just remove them entirely. Is that something you would consider just because there is so much happening on screen all at once, or is that the whole point?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>Absolutely. Great question. You can. Under the UI customization menus, you can disable damage floaties, whether you show incoming attack indicators or health bars. Hell, if you want to do a UI-less run, more power to you, but you can do that too. Customizing this experience for what suits you, whether we're talking about difficulty, builds, pause and play versus staying in the moment, and UI, it's been a central premise to us.</p>
<p><strong>In Dragon Age Origins, I was an elf and couldn't marry Alistair, so I had to start over as a human. I know part of the story is to try to get all these challenges to the players, to develop more of the story and to get this final controversy and all these things. What are we gonna get through all these storylines in Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</strong></p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>So, there are kind of two parts to answering this question. One of which is, again, we've spoken before about reactivity, how who your character is, what your lineage is, what your faction is, and even what your class is impacts the world.</p>
<p>Again, using class as an example, mages obviously have a different understanding of the world than a rogue or a warrior. But we wanted to make sure that, again, the world reacts to you, and this cast of characters particularly—they're all people who have chosen to join your cause, join your party.</p>
<p>Talking specifically about romance, one of the things we wanted to allow is player choice as much as possible, so being able to develop a romance with any character no matter who your Rook is, but those romances may play out a little bit differently based on every activity, based on how you've built your Rook, how you've customized them.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>Handling romances and romantic options is quite the challenge, and to be honest with y'all, I'm not sure there's a right answer on how to approach it. What we felt was best for this game was to make sure you could romance the companions, but I want to be clear that it's not player sexual. These are fully fleshed-out characters that have their own romantic histories, preferences, and backgrounds.</p>
<p>That doesn't change based on who you, the player character, are. They don't adapt their personalities to conform to the player. That's fundamentally the difference. There's merits to it and challenges. We're also mindful of having characters in the world of all orientations so we get that thoughtful representation again where people can see themselves.</p>
<p><strong>We talked about how deep and time-consuming the character creator is. Have you considered putting that up pre launch as a standalone, just so people can really hone their Rook in the time before the game releases?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>It's a much-requested feature. We're TBD on that, but it would be pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH: I had a two-part question about leveling. Dragon Age has traditionally had a level cap somewhere around 27 to 35. With the level cap being 50 in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, what kind of challenges did you have with balancing so many more skills under the player's belt?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>Oh my goodness, our poor systems design director, Luke Barrett. My goodness, send him all your love because it was quite the tuning and balancing challenge. Coming up as a systems designer myself, the sophistication in the model, the challenge around game balance... I'm in awe. It took a concerted effort and some really insightful forethought in how we were going to handle the underlying damage calculations and contributions from gear versus skill trees.</p>
<p>And also, those tuning plateaus of how enemies scale alongside you. Those moments where you feel like you're you're maybe overpowering them, and then they leap ahead of you to keep you constantly engaged and pushing forward. It was hard.</p>
<p>Especially with all the combinatorial effects, I would say one of the biggest challenges we have is we want players to find emergent builds. We want them to feel like they can outsmart us. Maybe not obliterate the game. So when we find those, we try and reign them in. But my goodness, nothing would make me happier than somebody outsmarting our best tuners.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>There's a phrase we like to use called error in the player's favor, which is again, as Corinne said, people finding these opportunities for gear and skills to synergize in ways that we didn't expect but are always awesome as players to find.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>I'll tell you, one of the builds we found early on, did anybody play with the warrior shield toss builds or anything adjacent to that? We had a build that was probably the most broken thing I've seen. It would just obliterate entire boss encounters with a single throw and we had to tune that one down.</p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH: As my quick follow-up, do you have any gear that scales up with your level in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, like the Fadeshear in prior games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>We have something adjacent to that. You may or may not have come across gear in your time today that will scale properties based on the strength of the respective faction that the gear comes from. Also, I'm sure some of you experienced upgrading the rarity of your items. That's the primary method by which we scale the gear.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the forecasting of the abilities. It really gets you curious about how the gear might synergize with your build later on. But that is the primary scaling mechanism. Faction strength, when you come across it, can be quite potent.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'In Dragon Age Inquisition, Corypheus was somebody who wanted to become a god. Now, for the first time, you're facing actual gods. As Corinne said, that raises the stakes tremendously. And we also want to make sure you're aware of what those stakes are.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>When I reached the final portion that we could play today, I was told it was like the finale of the first act of the game. It was already a pretty great scale. It felt like the complete finale of some other games. How many more acts are there in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and were there ever talks about maybe going too big?</strong></p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>One of the fun things about working on Dragon Age is that the stakes continue to escalate from game to game. We wanted to make sure that each act felt like it had its own arc that fed into the larger arc of the critical path of the game. For me, every mission should feel meaningful and important in the story's context, no matter where it takes place.</p>
<p>And then, as you finish the arc, as you finish the act, that's obviously the thing that drives you to the next one. It's what we describe as context shifts. With the end of each act, the context shifts, the world changes, and things, how you approach it, but also how Rook approaches their fight against the gods, is going to change accordingly.</p>
<p>We've broken it down into essentially a three-act structure. Each act is different, though; not every act is the exact same as the other one, and a lot of the content that's not on the critical path you can do at any time. Even with the companion quests and arcs, we wanted to make sure that they felt meaningful. You are standing against the end of the world. Everything you do should feel meaningful in that context.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>One of the things I'd add is that the conclusion of this game needs to matter. It needs to be the natural conclusion of your efforts in building up the Veilguard and taking on these gods. Weisshaupt really serves as your first true demonstration of what you're up against. While it is a large first act, and it is a very climactic mission to cap it off, from my perspective, that is where you get that sense of the overwhelming power, the stakes of what's at play here.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>In Dragon Age Inquisition, Corypheus was somebody who wanted to become a god. Now, for the first time, you're facing actual gods. As Corinne said, that raises the stakes tremendously. And we also want to make sure you're aware of what those stakes are.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering if, given its appearance in Origin and Dragon Age 2, the Blood Mage (<em><a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-lead-writer-explains-why-blood-magic-isnt-available-to-players-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is not in Veilguard</a></em>) as a specialization ever has a chance of coming back, despite its lore implications?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>To be honest, we looked long and hard at that. Origins versus Dragon Age 2 and the representation of Blood Mage were very different takes. What I hope you've taken away from playing today is that we want everything, including your classes, how you show up in the world, to feel narratively salient to this adventure. Blood Magic is a difficult one in the world of Dragon Age. It comes at a tremendous cost to how you're regarded. To be honest, when we were having our truest conversations about Blood Magic, to do it proper justice, I almost feel as though it would have to be a class unto itself to fit within the scope and direction of this game. It didn't feel like the right time, especially given some of the other Blood Magic threats you're going to come across.</p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>Building off what Corinne said, Blood Magic is a weighty thing to decide to do, and if we do it, we want to make sure we do it with the narrative weight and also the respect that it deserves. Because, again, Blood Magic is something that even some of the villainous characters in the games have balked at. We want to make sure that if you go down that path, it feels meaningful. It doesn't just feel like a reskin of other mage abilities. It needs to feel like an actual massive character choice you are making.</p>
<p><strong>One of the things that I noticed is that when you do the character creation, you choose the history of the Inquisitor. One of the things that I loved about Dragon Age Inquisition was Dragon Age Keep, which was a huge tool. Was there ever a possibility that we could customize the history of what happened for us for more than just the Inquisitor?</strong></p>
<p><strong>John Epler: </strong>This project has been in development for a while, so one of the things we did investigate is how deep we wanted that to go. For us, though, the core philosophy was that we want you to make choices that matter, choices that we can actually reflect. Part of going to Northern Thedas is a lot of stuff that matters tremendously if you're in Ferelden or Orlais doesn't matter as much in Tevinter.</p>
<p>A great example is the Divine, who is hugely important if you're Andrastian in the South of Thedas, but they have their own Divine up in Minrathous. We really wanted to focus again on those decisions that we knew would matter and that we knew we could do something interesting with.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Busche: </strong>It's been a long time since Inquisition. Even if you're a diehard fan, unless you're gonna watch a YouTube replay of the whole game, you might have a little cobwebs on the choices you made or their implications. Not only did we want this to be an in-game feature that would allow you to replicate those choices that John mentioned are contextually appropriate to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but we also view it as a dual-purpose onboarding tool.</p>
<p>If you are a player that just doesn't remember or hasn't played the past games, you're gonna go in and see those choices, those beautiful tarot cards that Matt and his team put together, with all the context around what these choices meant and why they mattered. I view it as a beautiful onboarding tool as well.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/quest-3s-price-leak-on-ad/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On social media, a leaked ad for the Meta Quest range has surfaced, showcasing the new Meta Quest 3S, which is expected to be fully unveiled soon. The ‘more accessible’ VR headset from Meta has been designed as a more affordable entry point into the world of VR, boasting a specification comparable with the Quest 2 but incorporating features from the newer Quest 3.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-competitive">Getting Competitive</h2>



<p>On the OculusQuest subreddit, a clip was uploaded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1fl01lp/299_quest_3s_128gb_confirmed_by_amazon_ad_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">showcasing an ad</a> that many users believe was posted ‘early’ by Peacock.</p>



<p>In the ad, we see both the Quest 3 and the Quest 3S side-by-side, along with a caption stating that the Meta Quest range ‘starts at $299.99’. There’s a snippet of text at the bottom that clarifies the Meta Quest 3S 128GB headset will retail for $299.99.</p>



<p>This leaked ad also corroborates recent images that surfaced online, giving users their first 360-degree look at the Quest 3S, which features full-colour passthrough technology at a lower resolution than the Quest 3. It also features older lenses, but it makes use of the same controllers that come with the Quest 3, which was released just late last year.</p>



<p>The Quest 3S <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-3s-leak-battery-missing-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will have a slightly lower battery capacity</a> than the Quest 3, and it’s also missing a headset jack, much to the chagrin of VR users worldwide. It’s not designed as an upgrade from the Quest 3, though – it’s an accessible and admittedly very competitive device designed by Meta for users just getting into VR gaming.</p>



<p>This price leak, if accurate, makes the Quest 3S one of the cheapest VR headsets on the market, and given that it will be able to access the full library available to Quest 3 users, that makes it an absolute bargain.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlestate-tarkov-plans-for-2024/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlestate-tarkov-plans-for-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled a ‘preliminary update plan’ for the remainder of 2024 involving Escape from Tarkov and EFT: Arena. It covers everything up to 0.16.0.0, which will welcome in the winter season – and that probably means <strong>crunchy snow</strong> is coming back.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the next few minor and major patches for both the traditional extraction shooter and more recent multiplayer arena shooter are detailed, even if no dates are mentioned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-patches-everywhere">Patches Everywhere</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1837122066606067934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the graphic published</a> on social media by Battlestate Games, we see the next few months of updates for Escape from Tarkov and EFT Arena.</p>



<p>It starts with 0.2.2.0 for Tarkov Arena, which will bring about a new mode, location, and various technical adjustments. Shortly after, the synchronisation of EFT’s 0.15 patch and EFT: Arena will be deployed. That patch will roll out hand-in-hand with the Unity 2022 update for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>In 0.15.5.0, Escape From Tarkov will get a stack of changes and upgrades:</p>



<ul>
<li>Stash and Hideout ‘interaction’ while matching</li>



<li>Lock items in stash</li>



<li>Expansions to ‘new mechanics’</li>



<li>Fall weather</li>



<li>New weapons</li>



<li>In-game events</li>
</ul>



<p>EFT: Arena will then get Molotov Cocktail throwables, a battle pass system, a ranked season system, and a new location between 0.2.4.0 and 0.2.5.0.</p>



<p>Finally, at the end of the year, Escape from Tarkov’s 0.16.0.0 patch will be deployed, bringing about ‘new high-end content’, fresh weapons, and winter weather.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the next Tarkov wipe will be released with 0.16.0.0 in December 2024. It has been a rough few months for the team at Battlestate Games thanks to a few controversial changes and massive issues with cheaters – something has to give soon, so perhaps these major updates will change the game for the better.</p>

The big takeaway is that Bungie is hoping to make playing as a Titan--the tank-ish, slightly meatheaded of Destiny 2's three character subclasses--feel a little more like the fantasy of playing a frontline fighter that tends to punch their way through the opposition.</p><p dir="ltr">That doesn't necessarily mean making Titans stronger in a martial sense, however; instead, Bungie is making tweaks to different elements of the Titan build in other ways. The one that'll affect players more clearly is making the Titan barricade ability now taunt enemies, drawing their fire away from teammates and toward the barrier itself.</p><p dir="ltr">The Titan barricade is an energy wall that Titans can lay down on the battlefield, either in full-sized versions that function as a big shield or as a smaller piece of cover players can shoot over. Right now, it basically just functions as a wall you can hide behind for a few seconds before getting back to the fight, but enemies still target players behind the wall or when they're away from it. The idea here is that, in most cases, enemies will prioritize shooting at the barricade until it's destroyed, increasing its defensive functionality by allowing Titans to use it to take some of the heat off teammates, even if those teammates aren't actually standing behind it.</p><p dir="ltr">Barricades will also be stronger going forward, taking 50% less damage from rank-and-file enemies, so they'll last longer generally in PvE activities. They'll also provide better protection from explosive splash damage: Bungie is increasing that protection from 20% to 60% for anyone standing behind a barricade. The buffs are also being applied to the Sentinel Shield Super ability in which players generate a shield in front of themselves that they wield while walking around, and when using the Unbreakable aspect, in which players generate a personal shield that absorbs damage--both will now have additional defensive uses than just making yourself harder to kill.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is running out a few other tweaks as well, making it easier for different Titan abilities to destroy Stasis crystals they create to deal freezing damage to nearby enemies--another means by which Titans should get a boost to their viability without Bungie specifically amping up their damage output. One place Titans are getting a boost in damage, though, is in their punches. Titans are supposed to be the class that opt for brawn more often than other characters, so their unpowered melees are getting boosted 5% against players and 20% against PvE enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog also detailed a number of other tweaks Bungie is rolling out with the Revenant update, including adjustments to various "roaming" Super abilities--the ones players use that allow them to move around, like the Hunter's Golden Gun and Spectral Blades, or the Warlock's Chaos Reach and Stormtrance. Those Supers are getting increases to damage reduction when they're used in PvE, and several are also getting slight buffs to make them a little more useful against enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_09_19_2024">Bungie's This Week in Destiny post</a> for a full rundown of the changes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-the-%E2%80%98i-will-never-take-nintendo%E2%80%99s-side%E2%80%99-vow.987336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-palworld-lawsuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is a company that’s usually pretty easy to root for. It takes its time to make great games. It <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues supporting a beloved console</a> even with a shiny new one waiting in the wings. It’s synonymous with the likes of Mario, Link, Samus, and Kirby. Unfortunately, at least from a legal standpoint, Nintendo is also evil. This week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/palworld-nintendo-lawyer-sue-pocketpair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Palworld </em>lawsuit</a> has been <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-citra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another</a> rude wake-up call in that regard. On the latest episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss the wolf in Pikachu’s clothing.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by comedian and streamer Tom Walker to discuss the latter’s self-made nightmare: an ongoing<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-fast-traffic-stream-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Auto IV </em>playthrough in which traffic speed is cranked up to max</a>. We talk about how livestreaming comedy differs from traditional forms of comedy like standup and how Twitch chat facilitates a unique sort of chaos that might involve, among other things, a naked person announcing that they’ve spilled wedding cake on their dick. Also, we get two separate Peter Griffin impressions, so you know this is a good one.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to the big news story of the week: Nintendo suing <a href="https://aftermath.site/four-hours-in-pokemon-with-guns-hasnt-given-me-any-guns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Palworld</em></a>, the <em>Pokemon</em>-alike with guns that <a href="https://aftermath.site/palworld-release-record-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got big earlier this year</a>. Nintendo might be the purveyor of more beloved family-friendly faces than any other video game company, but its legal team is about as black-hearted as they come. Why, then, do people give Nintendo more grace in these sorts of situations than they do other companies? Finally, we talk about an obscure Australian holiday that has resulted in, as one chatter put it, “mass horse death.”</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can patent troll Nintendo, to see how they like it.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I have taken the “I will never take Nintendo’s side” vow. It’s a very, very simple vow: You will never take Nintendo’s side in any legal argument. And they make it pretty easy. Because if they had mined the game and were like “You put a Pikachu in here. There is a Pikachu in the game file. Fuck you. You hid it well and creatively,” that would have been more actionable than “We own the concept of dog fights for little monsters.”&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the thing that gets me: They found the evilest angle for this. They found the thing that makes me side with <em>Palworld</em>, which I don’t want to do. And again, we don’t know how this is gonna play out. But just based on the fact that they’re going after patent shit, it doesn’t seem fun. It doesn’t seem like that TikTok sketch where two guys are like “That’s a different monster.” Maybe they think they can win this. I don’t know. This is not legal analysis. This is just me being like “Man, Nintendo’s an evil fucking company a lot of the time.”</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> It makes you wonder where the line is with this game as well. There were a lot of Japanese Twitter users and social media users reposting <em>Sujimon</em>, which is the <em>Pokemon</em>-type game that was in the latest <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Like A Dragon</em> game. You basically had a quite extensive minigame where the guys you fight in the street as you progress through the game, you could unlock them and collect them and basically play <em>Pokemon </em>with them. Systems-wise, it was almost identical to <em>Pokemon</em>. That’s a recent prominent example, but how many other games have done this over the last 30 years? Why is Nintendo going so hard over these guys? It’s because they gave Pokemon guns, and they made tens of millions of dollars.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s the big one. This is the first <em>Pokemon </em>clone that has had bordering on mainstream success – at least initially. I think it cooled off after that initial surge of sales. But it made headlines. It was the first big game of this year. It’s super visible. And any time that a company does this, of course, what they’re hoping is that it will have a chilling effect on other companies that might want to do something similar in the future.</p><p>Which is also terrible, because one of the big problems we’ve seen with <em>Pokemon </em>in general is that it has stagnated a lot over the years. People liked <em>Palworld </em>so much because it felt like something a little bit different within the bounds of that formula. It took it and put it in a big 3D open world. It added crafting and farming and all these other elements and systems. It didn’t do those things perfectly, but at least it was kind of interesting compared to where <em>Pokemon </em>has been going for the past decade or more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think [Nintendo] is just mad they got one over on them, and they were looking for a way to sue them, and they’re going with patent. And yeah, sure, I stand with <em>Palworld </em>until we find out there’s something evil going on there.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> #IStandWithPalworld&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Well, it’s annoying to have to take that position where it’s like “Yeah, I think I like those guys who are clearly doing something like ‘I’m not touching you, I’m not touching you’ more on principle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Tom, as the outsider here – at least insofar as you don’t cover video game news for a living – have you kept up with <em>Pokemon </em>games over the years, or is this just a thing to you of, as you said earlier, it’s funny that they gave the kid a gun?</p><p><strong>Tom: </strong>I think “adult Pokemon fan” is definitely a bullet I dodged. No disrespect to adult <em>Pokemon </em>fans. I have been riddled with many other bullets. That’s something I got close to but have thankfully fallen off the wagon of, because boy oh boy, that seems to be a thankless life. <em>Pokemon </em>fans have got it rough enough that they were excited when they released a <em>Pokemon </em>MOBA. That is not a fate I wish for anybody in this world, to be excited for a MOBA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To me, an outsider – tell me if this is right – it seems like their ambition is to cut off the impetus for a big company to be able to do a <em>Pokemon</em>-like. Even if you are doing a thing where you’re collecting little guys and having them fight each other, they want it to clearly be a substandard version of it rather than something approaching more of a 1:1.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Nintendo’s legal stuff is always performative. There isn’t a commercial justification for 99 percent of the prominent things they pursue, because a lot of those are fan projects or tiny little projects scrounging together a few bucks on Kickstarter or Patreon. This is a rare sort of exception where there’s genuinely money involved. Normally it’s supposed to have a chilling effect. It’s supposed to make other people not want to touch Nintendo’s shit. </p><p>That’s the point of them being so militant about protecting their copyrights and their imagery and that stuff: If they’ve got a reputation as being the company that goes hard and fast on everybody who tries to replicate or even pay homage to anything they make, then it scares a lot of companies off from doing that stuff. Because they know Nintendo’s gonna come after them, whether it’s when they announce it or release it, or nine months later in <em>Palworld</em>’s case. Nintendo could come for you at any moment and come super hard.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Unity has shared a new tech demo called Time Ghost that showcases the Unity 6 Engine. It features some stunning visuals and graphics. The demo is just over four minutes long and was championed by the developer team that created their previous tech demos, such as The Blacksmith, Book of the Dead, and The Heretic. This demo highlights their advancements in visual quality and project complexity while utilizing machine learning.</p>
<p><iframe title="Time Ghost" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o1JIK5W3DRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The visual advancements made have allowed for the graphics in Time Ghost to look phenomenal, with the demo leveraging improvements that were made in HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline), a variety of new lighting options with APVs, Scenario Blending, Smoke Lighting and a strong focus on performance with their GPU Resident Drawer. Those who utilize the engine will use tools like the VFX Graph and Shader Graph, to tailor their graphics to how they want them to look.</p>
<p>Even when there are close-up shots of the clothing, you can see the individual fibers of the cloth, allowing you to tell what kind of fabric it is made out of. The clothing deforms realistically, even in high-motion scenes, such as when the characters are sprinting.</p>
<p>Although the graphics are significantly more realistic, the characters look slightly robotic when running, which could be due to limb placement. While it looked like they were running with their arms out to maintain balance, it just made them look a little bit wonkier instead.</p>
<p>One of the things they focused on with Unity 6 was using Machine Learning to be able to create accurate and realistic cloth deformation. To be able to do that, they used Unity Sentis, where they trained the ML model with 2,000 frames of vertex animation. The accurate deformations happen in 0.8 ms per frame, allowing for the project to maintain that high visual fidelity.</p>
<p>Unity 6 has a lot of new features that are showcased in the Time Ghost tech demo, including the improved hair system. With close-ups on the character, you can see the high-density, real-time simulated hair. This feature was originally used in <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-engine-stunning-enemies-tech-demo-download/">Enemies</a>, and the system used to create hair has been upgraded significantly, allowing for seamless rendering LOD, automatic LOD generation and volumetric wind to create a realistic and functioning hair system that has the correct physics depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Unity has<a href="https://unity.com/demos/time-ghost" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted a blog post</a> that details the new engine and what people can expect when using it. There are a ton of new features, including a new and improved VFX collision system that allows for more stable and robust enhanced collisions.</p>
<p>The Unity 6 Engine will be released on October 17.</p>
