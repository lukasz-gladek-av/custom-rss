			<p>If you're looking for a way to celebrate the festive season in Mortal Kombat 1, then look no longer. It's been announced today by Warner Bros. Games that new holiday-themed in-game events will be arriving at the game from December 19 through to December 30. These events will be staggered across the days, with each event providing different rewards upon completion. The rewards come in the form of new character palettes, of which the details will be provided below. The events comprise five new Towers of Time events, which are free events available to all owners of Mortal Kombat 1. Below are all of the details you need about these events so you can pick and choose which ones you want to participate in based on the character palettes that you can unlock.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bloody Snow&nbsp;</strong>Tower (December 19-25) - Yuletide Necromancer &amp; Christmas Evil character palettes for Quan Chi</li>
<li><strong>Naughty List</strong> Tower (December 21-26) - Souls of Winter &amp; Holiday Collection palettes for Ermac</li>
<li><strong>A Christmas Krampus</strong> Tower (December 23-30) Holiday Hero &amp; Winter Wonderman palettes for Takeda</li>
<li><strong>'Twas the Night</strong> Tower (December 25-30) - Angel on High &amp; Holidazzle palettes for Cyrax</li>
<li><strong>Final Present</strong> Tower (December 26-30) - Eat, Drink, and Be Lethal &amp; Bah, Humbug palettes for Sektor</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these character palettes, players will be given the option to purchase new holiday skins for Kameo Fighters Frost and Sareena, as well as the previously released festive skins Santa's Helper Reptile, Krampus General Shao and Mrs. Klause Kitana.</p>
<p>For those who aren't owners of Mortal Kombat 1 yet, there is now the option to purchase the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Kollection, which is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store. This collection includes the main Mortal Kombat 1 game, as well as the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion, the previous Kombat Pack, and 1,250 Dragon Krystals.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you already own the game but you don't have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-trailer-showcases-noob-saibot/">Khaos Reigns content</a>, you can upgrade your version of the game with Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns, which will provide you with a new story expansion, as well as Konbat Pack 2, which adds Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot to the game. There are also some new guest fighters on the way that will be added to the game via Kombat Pack 2. This includes Ghostface, who is already in the game, as well as one-week early access to guest fighter Conan the Barbarian, who is set to be released on January 21. T-1000 Terminator is also set to join Mortal Kombat 1 but doesn't yet have an official release date.</p>
<p>What character palettes will you be aiming for this year?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ark-ultimate-mobile-edition-coming-to-ios-android-today-free-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition has officially launched for free on<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ark-ultimate-mobile-edition/id6639622324" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studiowildcard.arkuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a> today, with the game being completely free to play for those who want to get stuck into the Dino adventure. This announcement came from Grove Street Games and publisher Snail Games in partnership with Studio Wildcard. This is a brand-new free <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/">adaptation of ARK</a>, serving as a massive mobile dino-adventure that will include the full-scale experience of ARK: Survival Evolved, as well as the ARK Expansion Packs. This consists of Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, Genesis Parts 1 &amp; 2, and the fan-favorite Ragnarok map that was created by the community. This is just the tip of the dino-shaped iceberg, as there is plenty more that will be available in this mobile adventure, with a promise of thousands of gameplay hours.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to get their games through the Epic Games Store mobile marketplace, it will soon be available there. If you're not sure how ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition is panning out, you can check out the gameplay launch trailer below, which gives you a glimpse into what you can expect. The trailer is just over a minute long, and showcases some of the key features of the game, the same features that are in the PC and console versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U014C9C2X60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition comes with massive worlds for you to explore, with over 150 dinosaurs and creatures to tame and train as your own, as well as multiplayer tribe dynamics so that you can partner up with friends. Of course, it wouldn't be ARK without the crafting and building experience, which you will be able to dive into from the outset. The app launches today with the original ARK Island Map, Scorched Earth, and Aberration expansions. The rest of the expansions will be available for players by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>For those interested, there is also the option to opt-in to a subscription service called the ARK Pass. If you want to subscribe to the ARK Pass, it's available at a $4.99 monthly cost or a $49.99 annual subscription price, whichever is preferable for you. By having access to the ARK Pass, you will get access to every current and future Expansion Pack, as well as monthly bonuses. These bonuses include God Console, giving you access to console commands if you're playing in a single-player, bonus XP in all game modes, monthly drops of free 'Keys,' and exclusive access to servers.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Expansion Packs and features for ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition can also be purchased separately, depending on what you prefer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/superman-james-gunn-trailer-dc-universe-1851724194<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In our cynical timeline, hype is no longer something that’s generated organically on the basis of mass enthusiasm but rather something, we are instructed, that we already feel. So it is that tomorrow’s teaser trailer for the upcoming James Gunn-led relaunch of the DC cinematic universe, <em>Superman</em>, has just received its own teaser trailer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Given the premise—a piece of marketing material designed to have you intrigued to watch a forthcoming piece of marketing material that’s designed to have you intrigued to watch a film—the resulting diminishing returns are a collection of shots that tell us almost nothing whatsoever about the film it’s all intended to promote. We see reaction shots of people’s astonishment at seeing—presumably—a man who can fly, stop bullets, and leap tall buildings in a single bound. We also see less than a second of the super man himself.</p><p>Well shit, it worked, didn’t it? We posted it.</p><p>Let’s insist we’re doing it as a cultural observation of the sheer audacity of hype, of the fever pitch Warner Bros. and DC Studios are informing us we’ve reached, over finally seeing a tangible glimpse of this movie. They likely wanted that, too.</p><p>What strikes me as most interesting about what <em>is</em> shown here is how defiantly generic it is when it comes to Superman-based media. Forgetting the shots of crowds looking agog that makes up the bulk of the footage, we’ve got a glimpse of a generic Daily Planet office (including Rachel Brosnahan’s Lois Lane and Skyler Gisondo’s Jimmy Olsen), a split-picosecond moment of Superman flying through the ice inevitably surrounding his Fortress of Solitude, and a tiny dot of Superman disappearing up into the clouds. Each could be lifted from just about any adaptation of the character, from the early ‘90s <em>Lois &amp; Clark</em> to the grey slop of 2006’s <em>Superman Returns</em>—hell, we only know it’s not from 1948's <em>Superman </em>serial or 2013's <em>Man of Steel </em>because it’s in color.</p><figure id="" data-id="1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-recommend-id="image://1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="661" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rotten Tomatoes Trailers / DC Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-recommend-id="image://1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="661" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, it’s also arguable that all of this is an act of boldness, a real statement from Gunn (although who knows how involved he is in the marketing), and that’s  backed up by two other factors: the title and the score.</p><p>Calling your movie <em>Superman</em>, with no subtitle, is a statement. There already was a <em>Superman</em>, in 1978, and Richard Donner’s version has never been improved upon in any of the six films across three relaunches since (let alone the character’s repeated flogging in Snyder’s DCU). It was originally to be called <em>Superman: Legacy</em>, and dropping the suffix is ballsy. Gunn invites direct comparison with the Christopher Reeve classic—a beautifully shot movie that holds up almost 50 years later.</p><p>Then there’s the theme. It’s right there, subtle at first, then—amid the obligatory bassy “thommmm”s that all superhero movie trailers must feature by law—out emerges a faint rendition of John Williams’ classic tune. Again, it’s an unflinching declaration that this film is operating at the same level and evoking the same tonal reverence as the classic that, arguably, both ushered in the era of the modern superhero film, and defined it.</p><p>Gunn’s a fun movie maker, and has had well-deserved success via funny, schlocky films like <em>Slither</em> and <em>Super</em>, followed by the cartoon-like jubilance and hilarity of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> trilogy and <em>The Suicide Squad</em>. I’m genuinely excited that he’s trying to make something un-terrible from DC properties, ending the era of Snyder’s well-intentioned but grimly dreary attempts, and he’s an obvious fit for the sillier, more subversive side of the comic franchise. But playing <em>Superman</em> this straight, this on-the-nose? I’m fascinated to see what comes of it. Even if I doubt tomorrow’s “teaser” will tell us anything useful.</p><p>My desperate hope is that this could be, finally, <em>finally</em>, the moment someone writes a <em>Superman </em>script that doesn’t depend on unSupermanning him in order to introduce any peril or plot. My “time to Kryptonite” stopwatch will be running, and god, I hope it never has to stop. It’s the great flaw of the great American hero, that the only way anyone can find for an invincible, all-powerful god-like to be interesting on film is to incessantly make him incapable and all-vulnerable, and rely on enemy hubris to save the day.</p><p>(Massive shout-out to CW’s recently finished <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, which despite featuring some hoary old cliches and a miserable over-reliance on all shades of Kryptonite, managed to make Clark Kent vulnerable in <em>far </em>more interesting ways, not least in its extraordinary third-season arc following Lois’s cancer story.)</p><p>So, are you hyped for the teaser trailer to hype the six months of trailer-trailers, to hype the movie, ahead of its July 11, 2025 release date? I really hope we’re not exhausted by its simple existence by then.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Oh, and all these items are only available for five days before they’re rotated out of the store.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth putting these prices into context. 1,000 SC costs $9.99 / £7.99 in the in-game store. One of Helldivers 2’s premium Warbonds costs 1,000 Super Credits, which means that if you want all the Killzone items, you’re looking at just shy of twice the price of a premium Warbond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, there will be Helldivers 2 players who have Super Credits saved up after nearly a year of playing the game, and it’s worth noting that you can unlock 300 Super Credits in Warbonds with your medals, or find them out and about by looting in gameplay. But the fact remains that these items are also being sold for real-world money, and the pricing is unlike anything fans have seen so far in Helldivers 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Killzone assault rifle has sparked renewed pay-to-win accusations from some in the game’s community, despite it being considered a bit of a downgrade compared to already available guns. The Helldivers subreddit is already littered with complaints, many of which point out that Helldivers 2 is not a free game and so should take a different approach to monetization.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/hd-1734537347269.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Some Helldivers 2 players say the Killzone items are too expensive.

Even if we forget the armor set, a new AR?? They seriously add a new gun and lock it behind a 600 Super Credit paywall!?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“615 SC for a primary weapon is straight up ridiculous,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyz51/615_sc_for_a_primary_weapon_is_straight_up/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added Goopmaster_</a>. “I get the game needs to be monetized in some way, I get that the devs’ work isn’t free, but charging half a Warbond price for an assault rifle with no optic is straight up nonsense.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I knew it was a slippery slope, but didn't think we'd reach that part of the slope already,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyj28/comment/m2n69yx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SovietMarma commented</a>. “I've willingly paid for 1,000 SC packs for each and every Warbond release so I could support the game and buy the Super Store armors that came with them. Don't think I'll be doing the same here.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Arrowhead said the Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 belongs to a new tier of “special” premium content reserved for collaborations and other “uniquely-themed work.” “Our plan is to offer you something distinct and special,” the developer added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">Helldivers 2’s recent Illuminate update</a> breathed new life into the game, sparking a resurgence in players and enthusiasm around the addition of a new faction to fight against. But as has been the case multiple times during the game’s rollercoaster first year of live service, it’s a case of one step forward, two steps back for community sentiment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, as you'd expect, fans are taking to Steam user reviews to express their dissatisfaction over the Killzone prices. "The Superstore items are straight scams," one negative review reads. "Such a shame after such a great update."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Ultizero Games has revealed a new gameplay trailer for Lost Soul Aside. It will launch for PS5 and PC in 2025, although no specific date was given yet. It's an action game that looks like it plays similar to a Devil May Cry game with the visuals of a Final Fantasy game.</p><p>The trailer shows the main character, Kazer, in a snowy tundra setting fighting some big opponents, including some sort of ice monster and ice wolf. The gameplay features frenetic action and chaining together combos to pull off flashy attacks. It also looks like players will have a companion, as a woman is seen joining the heat of battle.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Lost Soul Aside – Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Not much is known about the story, but according to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> page, Kazer is off to save his sister as well as humankind from an invading dimensional threat.</p><p>Lost Soul Aside is part of PlayStation's China Hero Project, which focuses on publishing games made by Chinese developers to an international audience. Other examples include FIST: Forged in Shadow Torch and Anno: Mutationem.</p><p>Lost Soul Aside was inspired by Final Fantasy XV. Independent developer Yang Bin shared a prototype of the game in 2016, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lost-soul-aside-will-launch-on-ps5-debuts-new-gameplay-trailer/1100-6490929/" data-ref-id="1100-6490929">captured the attention of Sony</a> and allowed him to establish Ultizero Games.</p>

Some movies simply use Christmas as a sort of emotional backdrop for their naughty deeds. Meanwhile, other movies use the holiday as a narrative device meant to highlight a character’s road to redemption and triumph with a feeling of togetherness familiar to all. It’s easy to tell what’s a Christmas movie. It’s not so easy to tell which ones are naughty and which ones are nice.</p><p>A movie overflowing with cursing like <em>Friday After Next </em>is actually a nicer Christmas movie than the family-centric <em>Home Alone</em> because the former uses the feeling of Christmas goodness to overcome its vulgar obstacles while the latter is entirely about an innocent kid surviving a life-or-death situation. One film’s core is a quest to engineer a Christmas miracle to save characters from homelessness, and the other film is just a home invasion comedy thriller set during Christmas. </p><p>All of this and more will be explained once you dive into our examples of some of the best naughty and nice Christmas movies.</p></div></div><div><p><em>Die Hard </em>may very well be a wholesome Christmas movie, given its story about a man wanting to patch things up with his estranged wife. (At least that’s how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/die-hard-jeb-stuart-interview-35-year-anniversary-1850633919&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/die-hard-jeb-stuart-interview-35-year-anniversary-1850633919">screenwriter Jeb Stuart</a></span> argues on its behalf.) But that doesn’t excuse the fact that John McClane racks up a body count of <em>ten</em> men by the time the end credits roll. Sure, they’re all international criminals posing as terrorists who would have killed far more without McClane to stop them. But if Snoopy and the Red Baron could set aside bloodshed on Christmas night, surely John and Hans could have done so too.</p></div><div><p>Disregarding the 3D-ness of it all, <em>A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas</em> goes down smoother than fast food sliders ever could. John Cho, Kal Penn, and Neil Patrick Harris reunite for one more, seemingly final round as the estranged best friends rediscover their bond after taking their first steps into real adulthood. See past the R-rated vulgarity, gun violence, and claymation dongs and you’ll find <em>A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas</em> to be the gift that keeps on giving.</p></div><div><p><em>Home Alone </em>doesn’t have nearly enough holiday cheer, nor its young star quite enough charm, to cover up the film’s child abandonment resulting from a faulty alarm clock. John Hughes’ seminal film may be a Christmas classic, but that doesn’t mean it’ll ever get off the naughty list. For children, Christmas is a time for the joyful innocence of awaiting Santa Claus’s arrival to  reward your good year with great presents, as you maybe leave him some milk and cookies to sweeten the deal. It’s not about a kid fighting for his life by leaving nails for thief Marv (Daniel Stern) to step on, and a scolding hot doorknob for Harry (Joe Pesci) to burn his hand on, as both try to rob the child’s home. Sorry to say, but one of the greatest Christmas movies ever is also one of the naughtiest.</p></div><div><p>Everything about <em>Elf</em> is a Christmas miracle. Springing from the mind of screenwriter David Berenbaum and executed by the dynamo duo of Jon Favreau and Will Ferrell—the latter considered a liability among executives at the time, given his previous starring role in the bawdy <em>Old School</em>—<em>Elf</em> defied expectations to become the premier holiday classic of the new millennium. Its spellbinding sense of unabashed joy and its story concerning one man’s search for family are powerful enough to thaw even the iciest hearts. And few can resist the simple hilarity of six-foot-three Will Ferrell in emerald stockings.</p></div><div><p>Never judge a book by its cover, but always judge a Christmas movie by its Santa. Billy Bob Thornton, as Willie T. Soke, portrays arguably the crudest department store Santa Claus in history. Telling a child on your lap that you contracted a disease from sleeping with Mrs. Claus’s sister and then showing up to work drunk is sacrilegious to anyone who celebrates Christmas. The movie takes an exceptionally dark turn when Willie attempts suicide—something no Christmas story should have to endure. While preteen Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) ultimately gains the gift of lasting friendship with Willie and the confidence to stand up to his bullies, it only comes after Willie is shot by the police while wearing his Santa costume and Thurman flips off his harasser. You can’t slap a few ornaments on a lump of coal and call it anything but naughty.</p></div><div><p>I know what you’re about to say, and you’re correct: <em>Friday After Next</em> had more F-words that weren’t “frolicking” or “family” in it than any Christmas movie should have. But it was all in service of preserving what makes Christmas great. Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Daymond “Day-Day” Jones (Mike Epps) make ridiculous attempts at paying rent after a thief dressed as Santa Claus robs them of their rent money and gifts. That, along with Katt Williams’ Money Mike character thwarting sexual assault by clinching Damon “Triple O.G.” Pearly’s (Terry Crews’) testicles with pliers, is antithetical to the Christmas spirit. However, gathering people for a Christmas Eve party to help them pay their rent, along with Christmas carolers getting retribution for those who harassed them while they spread holiday cheer, are beautiful examples of the power of Christmas. Plus, catching the robber in the ’hood, getting the money back, and leaving him on a roof for the cops to collect is nothing short of a Christmas miracle.</p></div><div><p>Nothing is more awkward than your boss hooking up with your crush. So imagine being Jack Lemmon in Billy Wilder’s <em>The Apartment</em>, whose boss isn’t just sleeping with his crush (Shirley MacLaine) but doing the deed in his own pad! (Even worse: Imagine the cleaning bill on all of his own bedsheets.) Beloved as it may be with its sweet happy ending and the triumph of personal happiness over professional ambition, the central predicament of <em>The Apartment</em> is just about the epitome of the holiday blues. The very kind Elvis sang about. </p></div><div><p>No, revealing someone’s sex work past and a cancer death aren’t really what Christmas is all about. Those are just the lowlights, however, in an illuminating Christmas classic, <em>The Best Man Holiday</em>. The sequel to 1999's <em>The Best Man</em> finds a fractured yet still familial group of friends spending the holidays together when infidelity, financial mismanagement, and betrayal strike. The performances from the film’s incredible ensemble, which includes Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Terrence Howard, and Regina Hall, are all rooted in the type of redeemable honesty that inspires the forgiveness that Christmas calls for. Coordinated displays of love, like wearing the same ugly Santa sweater as your partner and going Christmas caroling, are quintessentially in the Christmas spirit. Thanks to <em>The Best Man Holiday</em>, you can add four men doing a choreographed rendition of New Edition’s “Can You Stand the Rain” for the women in their lives (while decked in enough leather to cause a heat stroke in slightly hotter conditions) to that list.</p></div><div><p>Hot chocolate and pecan pie can set the Christmas mood perfectly—unless they’re consumed under duress while your kidnappers are seconds away from pummeling you. Starring Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, and <em>Forrest Gump</em>’s Gary Sinise, <em>Reindeer Games</em> follows ex-con Rudy Duncan (Affleck) as he assumes the identity of his late cellmate Nick (James Frain) to win over a woman named Ashley (Theron) and spend time with her family for Christmas after being released from prison. However, he soon finds himself entangled in a dangerous plot led by Ashley’s brother Gabriel (Sinise), who believes Rudy (posing as Nick) can help them rob a casino. Kidnapping, excessive blood and guns, and a deadly finale are all cardinal sins of Christmas movies, banishing this one to the naughty pile.</p></div><div><p>Paul Giamatti may be a perpetual Grinch in his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-dc-dune-penguin-golden-globes-1851716634?_gl=1*cq8jjv*_ga*MTQ2OTgzNDI5MS4xNzMyMjkzNzkx*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDQ1MzQ0Ni43MC4xLjE3MzQ0NjM0MTkuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-dc-dune-penguin-golden-globes-1851716634?_gl=1*cq8jjv*_ga*MTQ2OTgzNDI5MS4xNzMyMjkzNzkx*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDQ1MzQ0Ni43MC4xLjE3MzQ0NjM0MTkuNjAuMC4w">Golden Globe Award</a></span>-winning performance as boarding school <strike>dictator</strike> teacher Paul Hunham in <em>The Holdovers</em>, but that just makes the Christmas joy he helps engineer all the more sacred and earned. No one should be alone on Christmas, and <em>The Holdovers </em>immaculately demonstrates that as Hunham, petulant student Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), and grieving cafeteria manager Mary Lamb (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) are all stuck at Barton Academy boarding school over the holidays, life passing each of them by in particular ways. They band together and help each other reconnect with family and the joy of life. That’s as Christmas as it’s going to get.</p></div><div><p>As is the case anytime Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg collaborate on something, there is a heart of gold beneath the crude surface of <em>The Night Before</em>. But that still doesn’t mean it gets on Santa’s nice list. While this wildly underrated Christmas comedy champions the endurance of male friendships and taking personal accountability, there’s still a whole lotta lies, drugs, and unprotected sex in dive bar bathrooms during this oh-so-holy night. Also, while things ultimately work out for Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lizzy Caplan, it’s never a good idea to spring a public marriage proposal on your ex.</p></div><div><p>“Isn’t there anyone who knows what Christmas is all about?” cries Charlie Brown. “Sure Charlie Brown, I can tell you what Christmas is all about,” a calm Linus says before cueing the stagelights and recounting the story of the First Christmas. It’s an iconic emotional climax to an equally iconic Christmas movie, one that stands the test of time thanks to just how much poor old Charlie Brown buckles under the weight of expectations and hollow artificiality. Linus’ Bible lecture isn’t religious dogma, not really. Just a calm reminder that the real intentions of these end-of-year celebrations are, as he puts it, “peace [and] good will toward men.”</p><h2 id="h164484"><a id=""></a></h2></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been claimed by Maksym Krippa, the owner of GSC Game World, that discussions are underway with Netflix regarding a TV adaptation of STALKER, the survival-based FPS franchise. Last month, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released to a mixed reception, but it was recently revealed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-profitable-one-month-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already become profitable at GSC</a>.</p>



<p>Within just two days, Heart of Chornobyl had sold a million copies, despite being listed on day one on both PC and Xbox Game Pass. It would be the latest in a long line of games to get the television adaptation treatment, following in the footsteps of shows like The Last of Us and Fallout.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-never-say-never">Never Say Never</h2>



<p>Maksym Krippa, the enigmatic multi-millionaire owner of GSC Game World – and other entities like Natus Vincere – has admitted that the company is looking at a TV adaptation of STALKER with Netflix. In an interview with <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes Ukraine</a>, the entrepreneur explained that he’d ‘love to see’ STALKER appear on screen through an alternate medium.</p>



<p>While nothing has been finalised, it likely wouldn’t take much for Netflix to hop on board with the idea.</p>



<p>In recent months and years, shows like Riot Games’ Arcane, Amazon’s Fallout, and HBO’s The Last of Us have skyrocketed up the charts, pulling in millions of viewers. With how successful STALKER 2 has been since dropping last month, it stands to reason that a well-made show set in the lore-rich universe of the game could do quite well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-thick-as-thieves-adapts-immersive-sim-tricks-for-online-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via OtherSide Entertainment/Aonic.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this year's Game Developers Conference, OtherSide Entertainment cofounder and creative director Warren Spector </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/warren-spector-says-the-next-logical-step-for-immersive-sims-is-multiplayer">told us</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> why he thinks online multiplayer is the next big thing for developers making "immersive sim" games. It was an unusual prediction, as immersive sims rely on a game being able to account for a wide buffet of player choices in a game world. Adding more players to such an open environment in a game like OtherSide's in-development project </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3341000/Thick_As_Thieves/">Thick as Thieves</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be seen as risky.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time he said it had a lot to do with tabletop-style interactivity, where players work together to create a dynamic story, pushing and pulling at the world around them. He and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thick as Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director Greg Piccolo (also OtherSide vice president of product) were jubilant about diving into "thief-versus-thief" game design—but they couldn't share very much about what they were working on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now fresh off a reveal at The Game Awards, the pair, joined by lead designer David McDonough, could offer a bigger peek behind the curtain. They were eager to share the nuts-and-bolts of how they're tackling the challenges of online "immersive sims"—all to satisfy players that they say "want to feel clever" while playing against each other.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Thick as Thieves"><span>Thick as Thieves</span>' "shared quest" system drives its dynamism</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/warren-spector-says-the-next-logical-step-for-immersive-sims-is-multiplayer" target="_self">Warren Spector says the next logical step for immersive sims is multiplayer</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Piccolo explained in our chat that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thick as Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' most exciting game mechanic had finally come together in the last few months: a centralizing objective system called a "shared quest." In earlier versions of the game, players competed to steal multiple items in round-based gameplay. Those multiple items are still there, but now one shared objective that all players are hunting for binds the experience together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The structure echoes that of the "extraction shooter" genre, where players enter a map to battle NPCs—and each other—to get out with the biggest prize possible. What makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thick of Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> different, Spector said, is that it's a game about "competition, not defeating your opponents."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You're not trying to necessarily beat up on the other the other players," he said (noting that still may be a viable solution for some eager to ambush their foes). Using the lens of "competition" as a design pillar helped the team tackle the friction between stealth-friendly immersive sims and multiplayer games. Stealth games, he said, are usually games where players try </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to interact with the environment or other characters. PvP games are all about interacting.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4z9nK5Tj4Rw" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're wondering why the idea of one major shared objective didn't surface sooner in development, it's because the production </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thief of Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wasn't so much about planning one high-stakes heist, but exploring avenues for keeping repeatable session-based multiplayer as refreshing as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Piccolo said the Shared Quest system was a possible solution that OtherSide "knew about," but was really "brought into sharper focus" as work progressed on something called the "clue system."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The clue system is a randomized recreation of a beloved feature from immersive sim games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thief</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dishonored</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deathloop</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, etc. It's the means by which OtherSide scatters crumbs of knowledge throughout the game world that guide players to their target treasure. In a hands-off gameplay demo, the group explained these clues would change with every session so that players can't just memorize the best or most reliable routes and locations. The video showed an OtherSide playtester scurrying through the sewers and happening on a notebook that boldly displayed the words "THE VAULT CODE IS..." followed by a number that unfortunately has scuttled out of this writer's notes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Immersive sims have toyed with this tech for a while, using random number generators to prevent players from skipping key bits of content by memorizing passwords (or, sometimes, they've kept the numbers the same to reward players who retain knowledge of the level). This system takes the concept up another notch, as Piccolo explained that clue in the sewer probably won't be there every time players visit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The clue system also acts as a kind of balancing tool to lower the gap between experienced and newer players. It's one of many features in place to disincentivize players from brute-forcing the shared quest based on experience. "Knowledge is an accelerator for your progress," Piccolo said, and confining the relevant knowledge to each run of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thick as Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reduces what friction players can eliminate by practicing run after run or watching YouTube videos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Piccolo said there's one fascinating challenge with the clue system that OtherSide is still working on. The clue in the notebook could be uncharitably described as "thuddingly obvious." It doesn't bury the passcode in with some in-game journal entry where a superior yells at a guard for not changing the vault code. "Lengthy exposition in a context where people are battling each other to get to a finish line was not welcome," Piccolo observed, saying the version shown to press was a perfect example of developers getting a feature functional, then figuring out how to make it flavorful.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game design is the real immersive sim">Game design is the real immersive sim</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prodding the OtherSide team about how the Shared Quest system could seem like an obvious feature seemed a bit unfair. But to students or industry newcomers it's a fair question: how is it that core gameplay loop came so much later in production?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spector stood up to the plate here, ready to knock down the idea that the mechanic could have been ready to implement on day one. "Documentation is stale the instant the the virtual ink dries on the virtual page," he said. "It doesn't matter how much you think about something or how clever and creative you are, you're not going to think of everything, especially in this kind of game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's fascinating that Spector warned designers against overestimating their own cleverness while showing off a game meant to help players feel clever—but maybe that's a key ingredient to making immersive sims. There can be cleverness in solving elaborate puzzles with fixed solutions, but the genre has built such a passionate cult fanbase because players grapple on to the unexpected and boundary-pushing solutions to problems ranging from breaking-and-entering to long-distance assassination.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating systems, letting players push the boundaries with them (or fail to do so, even if you know they can), is a design process that doesn't mesh with immediately borrowing the core gameplay loops of popular titles. It's risky and can burn far more development time. But if OtherSide's bet pays off, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thick as Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will absolutely be a one-of-a-kind game that attracts players who thrill at stumbling into feeling like a genius—only to be one-upped by another player that stumbled into an equally brain-bending solution.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-simpsons-christmas-disney-plus-derren-brown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since Disney owns <em>The Simpsons</em>, there are sometimes episodes that are only on Disney+. Despite <em>The Simpsons</em> being one of the shows I regularly play in the background while I’m doing other things, I’ve never watched any of these until yesterday, when a Christmas episode featured UK mentalist Derren Brown.</p><p>Brown is, to my understanding, very well-known in the UK, but not so much here in America. I came across his work all the way back in 2012, when I was writing a play about–stay with me here–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism_(movement)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiritualism</a> after the Civil War for a <a href="https://www.hughryan.org/pop-up-museum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">queer history arts festival</a>. As part of that, I was doing a ton of research about how seances, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-real-fakery-of-the-ouija-board-1819805308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spirit writing</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj177SqjydA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">table turning</a> were actually performed, reading lots of old books by debunkers of the movement (including, fun fact, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/66451/66451-h/66451-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Houdini</a>). This led me to Brown, who in addition to debunking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEYW2vqqNDQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faith healers</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acnUkYNTk90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mediums</a>, has also performed versions of some spiritualist tricks, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjJhnz_Drls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billet reading</a>, as part of his stage shows. I was delighted by his stage work and devoured what I could find on YouTube (most of it, alas, seems to have been scrubbed now). I’m less of a fan of his TV specials, where he’s done things like convince someone they’ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfo_HJ8TRpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emergency landed a plane</a>, played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQWK0zBhNz8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russian roulette</a>, or otherwise performed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpUpNv9uNSI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhat manipulative stunts</a> that have always felt a little too “TV magician” to really resonate with me.</p><p>I interviewed Brown in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210617095830/https://www.jezebel.com/mentalist-derren-brown-makes-magic-from-the-stories-we-1796235264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017</a> for Jezebel, when he brought his stage show <em>Secret</em> to the US. If I recall right I found some roundabout way of bringing up our shared interest in spiritualism but maintained the professional boundaries necessary to not devolve the whole interview into talking about it. Since then, I’ve a little bit lost track of his work, though it’s always stayed with me as a gateway into a fascination with stage magic.&nbsp;</p><p>So that was a long-winded way of saying I was surprised and excited to see him headline a 45-minute <em>Simpsons</em> episode, “O C’mon All Ye Faithful.” The episode is structured around his TV stunts, where he attempts to manipulate Springfield into the Christmas spirit through his brand of tricks. The second half of the episode centers on Flanders’ religious faith as a result of Brown’s actions, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_The_Simpsons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">topic</a> I’m always excited for <em>The Simpsons</em> to explore. The episode does a good job of explaining who Brown is to an audience I can’t imagine is familiar without over-explaining, and while the whole thing feels like a cameo geared toward a very narrow audience who’s excited about both Brown and how religion is portrayed in media (namely, me), it’s a pretty OK episode. I was moved, but also a little let down, by its climax, where I personally feel it fumbles the bag on <em>why</em> people are religious, but this response is also very me. I was charmed by how much Brown sounds like himself, with all his familiar-to-me patter and some of his personal stances regarding psychology and religion.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have Disney+ you should totally watch the episode, but this blog is mostly an excuse to tell you how glad I am that Brown’s work introduced me to stage magic beyond the cultural presence of David Copperfield and the worst parts of Penn &amp; Teller (as opposed to the best parts, like how <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1302071519015841794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful</a> I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0mL3PWKkwU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their version of the Miser’s Dream</a> is on <em>Fool Us</em>). I have become in particular a huge fan of card tricks, which I maintain are our <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1805262239533838845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most human</a> narrative art form: they work because of how our brain works and how it intersects with our culture, how we are hard-wired toward meaning and connection; a card trick happens in the performer’s hands but also by drawing on the very foundations of how we live in the world. The big thing with stage magic seems to be not knowing how it’s done, but I’ve never found this true for myself. I found magicians pretty offputting, the way I think many people do (they often don’t do themselves any favors), until I learned more about how their effects are achieved, when I was able to see precisely how complicated and beautiful and deeply human even the simplest-seeming trick is. I am hardly an expert (unlike my old G/O coworker <a href="https://www.avclub.com/why-i-m-still-obsessed-with-magic-tricks-1798265096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Pang</a>, whom I would constantly DM about either magic or food writing), but the more I’ve learned about how effects are done, the more in awe I am of a field I think a lot of adults write off. I’ve been excited to see the growing popularity of more “mature” stage shows, like Derek DelGaudio’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_62BeXxd_jo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>In &amp; Of Itself</em></a> (which I will admit I saw live and thought was just OK but liked more when I saw it again on Hulu; both times, I thought the best effect by far was the very last one).</p><p>I woke up this morning feeling overwhelmed, in dread of the tasks of the day before I’d even opened my eyes. But now, a few hours later, I’m thinking about how the same thought patterns I apply to spreadsheets and to-do lists to keep a business running can be applied to cards and coins and envelopes to expose how beautiful and miraculous it is to walk around with a human brain, how our instinct for meaning-making can be used to both maintain our day-to-day and break out of it. For about as long as I’ve been aware of Brown’s work I’ve been carting around a used copy of the seminal <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-royal-road-to-card-magic-hey-presto-magic-book-jean-hugard/21556637?ean=9781909678255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Royal Road to Card Magic</em></a>, with the dream of learning to do a single card trick before I die, just to know for myself how it feels to make something so lovely out of so little. That dream gets less and less likely every year (Do you know how to do this? Help me out!), but sharing my enthusiasm for it with you has reminded me that there’s still time. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/day-of-the-jackal-river-udc-redmayne"><h3>The Day of the Jackal Is So Good Except This One Part That Makes Absolutely No Sense</h3></a><p>The only real problem with the show is the Jackal’s target: a tech entrepreneur with a killer app that does… something.</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Depending on your playstyle and the build you’re after, you might need an early-game skill to clear standard mobs, but you’ll quickly realize that many of the Mercenary’s abilities prove potent well into the late-game, too. For now, let’s focus on three must-have skills.</p><p><strong>Tier I: Explosive Grenade</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-recommend-id="image://fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-recommend-id="image://fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most powerful early-game skills you can unlock for the Mercenary, specifically an AoE (area-of-effect) ability that deals Physical and Fire Damage to mobs, is the <strong>Explosive Grenade</strong>. It’s an effective party starter of a skill, as tossing one into a small group will whittle down an enemy’s health and soften them up. It’s also effective for keeping up the pressure against bosses.</p><p><strong>Tier III: Incendiary Shot</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-recommend-id="image://d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Incendiary Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Incendiary Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-recommend-id="image://d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Incendiary Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Incendiary Shot </strong>is as effective as it is flashy. It’s slow to reload and cast, but the AoE effect of igniting everything in front of you on fire cannot be ignored. Igniting enemies and clearing low-level mobs are excellent ways to kick off a fight and simultaneously damage large groups.</p><p><strong>Tier V: Rapid Shot</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-recommend-id="image://0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rapid Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rapid Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-recommend-id="image://0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rapid Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve been following along, you should now have two powerful AoE abilities, but now it’s time to focus on single-target damage that deals with rapid-fire DPS (damage-per-second) to quickly whittle down a boss’s health pool. <strong>Rapid Shot </strong>effectively turns your single-shot crossbow into a fast-firing machine gun, slinging steel bolts at enemies with an impressive clip size. This ability is how I finally bested Count Geonor at the end of Act 1.</p><p><br><em>Path of Exile 2</em> is currently available via paid Early Access via Steam on PC. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been claimed by GSC Game World’s mysterious owner, Maksym Krippa, that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is already profitable a mere month after being released worldwide. In a rare interview with Forbes Ukraine, the multi-millionaire entrepreneur said that GSC has ‘already sold enough to make the project profitable.’</p>



<p>He also mentioned that discussions are underway regarding a live-action adaptation of the series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-quick-turnaround">Quick Turnaround</h2>



<p>Maksym Krippa is a relatively unknown individual, working in the shadows and pumping tens of millions of dollars into projects under the brands and companies that he owns. In his interview with <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes Ukraine</a>, he revealed that he has invested <strong>a lot </strong>into the development of STALKER 2, but he wouldn’t part ways with an exact sum:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Of course, it’s tens of millions of dollars.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Krippa is no stranger to the wider games industry. In 2022, he acquired Natus Vincere, Ukraine’s most prominent esports organisation and a world-class competitor in the Counter-Strike market, amongst other games.</p>



<p>STALKER 2’s success comes as no surprise. It was in development, on and off, for more than a decade, and it garnered some solid reviews when it finally hit the market. It was a divisive game, though. Many players had more than their fair share of issues with the game, but GSC Game World has worked incessantly to patch up the mutant-ridden shooter.</p>



<p>It was just two days after launch that STALKER 2 was revealed to have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-1-million-copies/">sold one million copies</a> – despite the game being available on both Xbox and PC Game Pass. That was enough to set the tone for the game, which has continued to evolve and retain the attention of a worldwide audience ever since.</p>

<p>Back in the mid-to-late 2000s, developer Free Radical Design was working on the third installment of the popular Star Wars Battlefront series for the Nintendo Wii. In 2008, however, Star Wars Battlefront 3 was ultimately cancelled for a variety of he said, she said reasons. Now, 16 years later, Star Wars Battlefront 3 gameplay has leaked online for players to see for themselves.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNLILrbrO58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a>, the build was found via the Free Radical Archive. According to them, it comes from a build dated roughly a week before the game’s cancellation.</p>



<p>“This build, made in the final week of development, is full of content that has not been seen before by fans,” they said. “As this game was cancelled during development, there are still bugs and issues which we hope can be resolved through future modding.”</p>



<p>The video below shows both gameplay as well as a recreation of the game’s PC trailer using the Wii build.</p>

<p>First uncovered in 2006, Star Wars Battlefront 3 was the third game in the popular early-2000s series. The game was in development for at least two years before it was cancelled in late 2008. The reasons for the cancellation are unconfirmed, but there have been claims.  Free Radical Design co-founder Steve Ellis believes it was, in part, due to the fact that LucasArts didn’t want to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120512004359/http://www.joystiq.com/2012/04/27/this-is-what-happened-to-star-wars-battlefront-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“spend big”</a> on the game’s marketing. On the other side of things, an unnamed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-lucasarts-employee-on-why-star-wars-battlefront-iii-failed/1100-6400936/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LucasArts employee claimed</a> the developers had regularly missed deadlines, burning goodwill with the publisher.</p>

			<p>Last month, Wccftech was invited to join a small and exclusive number of outlets for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lead-architect-mark-cerny-unveils-codename-amethyst-ml-collaboration-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusive presentation</a> hosted by PS5 Pro Lead System Architect Mark Cerny. While the main topic was, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new console</a>, there was even an exciting announcement regarding a collaboration with AMD on a machine learning project called 'Codename Amethyst.'</p>
<p>Following the presentation, we had a one-on-one chat with the legendary programmer and game designer (in case you didn't know, he worked on the first Crash Bandicoot and Spyro installments, as well as the Jak &amp; Daxter franchise and, more recently, directed Knack and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/knack-2-demo-available-european-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>). Since this event took place ahead of the launch of the PlayStation 5 Pro, some of the topics discussed may have been revealed and/or confirmed by the publication of this article.</p>
<p>However, we also asked him a lot of future-facing questions, such as if PSSR would get a frame generation component, whether variable refresh rate on the console would be updated to support Low Framerate Compensation, and we also inquired about the feasibility of path tracing on PS5 Pro, among other things. Keep scrolling for the full transcription of our interview with Sony Interactive Entertainment's Mark Cerny.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PSSR-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>The main focus of your presentation was arguably PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), so let's kick off with that. You previously commented on when the PlayStation 5 Pro project started internally, but when did you begin working on PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>We started on PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution at roughly the same time as we started on the hardware itself. Though, the neural network we are using today is something that we came up with, I believe, in late 2021.</p>
<p><strong>How has the development of the PlayStation 5 Pro hardware evolved over the past few years in tandem with PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>The hardware definitely came first, because you can't know that your neural network is implementable unless you understand a bit about the hardware that it's going to be running on top of. So, simply put, in 2020 we did early hardware work. In 2021, we did more detailed hardware work and fully kicked off the PSSR project.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see PSSR evolving after the launch of the console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>We're definitely going to continue our work in this space. There are so many ways that we can take that, though, right? We could continue to improve PSSR or start working on some of the other targets that I mentioned, like frame generation, frame extrapolation, ray tracing, denoising, and the like. I think it'll be interesting to see over the next few months what the full reaction from the development community is.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to maybe add a frame generation component to PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Well, at the current moment, our focus is definitely on Super Resolution. I'm just saying that there are a number of other very attractive targets out there.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about Super Resolution, does it require per-game training as the first version of NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling, or is it more of a general model like DLSS 2.0 and later?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>It's generalized training.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about roughly how long it takes to implement PSSR compared to NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, or Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>It's almost a drop-in replacement for the other strategies. The difficulty is that game engines tend to evolve along with the Super Resolution or the upscaling strategy that they're using. So, if you're trying to add something in after the fact that the game was not developed with, then there's a bit of rejiggering of the game engine that may be needed. Much of the time I think the developers spent bringing it over was the logistics of where in their pipeline they're going to insert PSSR.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sony-PlayStation-5-Pro-_-AMD-SoC-_7.png"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Moving on from PSSR to the PlayStation 5 Pro hardware, the new SSD's size has obviously been greatly increased from the 768 GB of the PlayStation 5. Did the SSD's speed&nbsp;also improve in the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>No, the speed of the SSD on PS5 Pro is the same as the speed of the SSD on PS5.</p>
<p><strong>OK. Did Sony ever consider expanding the RAM during the development of the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Well, definitely more RAM is needed to implement those new features because PSSR needs a bit of RAM, and the ray tracing implementation definitely needs RAM. The question was just how much RAM is needed. We worked out that probably a gigabyte or so would be enough to support the big three that I was talking about.</p>
<p>We have GDDR 6, which is very fast memory—16 gigabytes of it. Then we added slow DDR5 RAM and started moving over to that from the fast RAM. That frees up fast RAM for the games, and that's the one or so GB I was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>I know that during Remote Play, the PlayStation 5 disables some of the video capture capabilities. Are those enabled on the PlayStation 5 Pro, or does it have the same limitations in this regard?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>The same limitations. There are many features that the gamer can use that require&nbsp;memory, and not all of them can be used simultaneously simply because there isn't enough memory on the system side. We want to get the bulk of the memory to the games, and the limitation set is the same on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Will Sony add Low Framerate Compensation or LFC to improve the Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) experience on PS5 and PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>There are ongoing discussions about where we should be taking VRR, and that's definitely part of those discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Another major advancement of the PlayStation 5 Pro is in the ray tracing capability. Will that enable the console to run full path tracing, like we see on PC with games like Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>One difficulty in answering your question is that there are so many strategies for doing ray tracing or path tracing. Just to give an example, the engine that drives Alan Wake 2 is very, very different from the engine that drives Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>There were talks on both of these at the Game Developers Conference that I went to. I really hesitate to say that PlayStation 5 Pro can or can't do path tracing, but you need to have a highly optimized strategy for doing it if you're going to do it on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Some PS5 Pro titles have implemented AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution Frame Generation. Have there been any complications with that running in tandem with PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>No, PSSR is Super Resolution, so whatever strategy a game has for frame generation should be completely orthogonal.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. This is something I was curious about. At the launch of PS5, there were some PlayStation 4 titles like Bloodborne and The Last Guardian that, throughout their life cycle, were patched to have a locked 30 frames per second mode. If you go back to the 1.0 version of the disk, they also feature an unlocked frame rate. Has Sony been in conversations to kind of revisit that to unlock those frame rates on the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>I'm afraid I can't say anything about Bloodborne or that other title that you mentioned on PS5 Pro. Typically, the games on PS5 Pro are running in what we're calling Boost Mode. In this mode, we do give the game the entire GPU and faster memory to use, but whatever limitations it had are still there on the PS5 Pro version. So there's things that are definitely going to get better and things that will stay the same. I will say if your game has VRR, you should see substantially higher frame rates on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Will the PlayStation 5 Pro substantially boost PlayStation VR 2 games compared to the original console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>PS VR 2 titles are definitely being boosted on PS5 Pro. There's a couple of different rendering strategies that VR titles take, depending on the strategy. PSSR is either something that works out of the box or something that needs a little bit more care and handling to be functional, and I think right now, we're at the point where we're getting pretty good uptake across the portfolio on PS VR2 for PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Forgive me if you have mentioned this before - is PSSR going to be a toggle in the system settings for players who may want to play the title as it was originally developed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>It's all whatever the developer would like to do. It's what they feel is best for their game. Some of the developers, like Naughty Dog, are offering the PS5 modes on PS5 Pro, so you can pick Performance Pro or you can pick the original Performance or Fidelity modes, but other developers decided that what is best is that you would have strictly Pro modes when playing their game on the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>

<p><strong>The big surprise of today's presentation was the Amethyst machine learning project with AMD. What are the first steps of that collaboration going to look like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Well, we've already started talking. Pretty much when PlayStation 5 Pro was wrapping up, we began discussions and development of those various aspects of Amethyst. To get more specific, I think we were getting pretty good momentum by the end of 2023. But as you know, it takes a phenomenally long amount of time to go from discussions and concepting to actually having a piece of hardware out in the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>One thing you touched on during the presentation was the democratization and standard libraries between SIE and AMD, which would be developed in&nbsp;parallel. Can you talk about how that partnership is going to be built out?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Certainly. Well, for hardware first, really this is not about PlayStation proprietary hardware. We're looking to co-develop performant new AI architectures that can be used freely in any space that anybody chooses to use them, whether that is PC, console, or cloud.</p>
<p>For the software, if I look at it today, we have games that run on a TV and there's a certain set of developers that make them, and AMD for PC has games that run on PC monitors that have a somewhat overlapping set of developers that make games for them. There are different needs and different relationships there, so really what we're looking to do is to co-develop those network architectures and those training strategies that can then be freely used in both contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Another keyword from the presentation was discovering the holy grail of graphics through fully fused neural networks. What does that look like in your mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Ultimately, what you would see is really high quality libraries based on CNN's (convolutional neural networks) for game graphics. To me, that's a bit of a prerequisite. You need to have hardware that is capable of doing that.</p>
<p><strong>Game developers are using so many different engines to say the least, between Decima, Unreal, Frostbite, and many more. How does machine learning tie those together? Is there kind of a unified path for the architecture here, whether it's PSSR or the other features on the PS5 Pro, to kind of mold itself to the requirements of those different engines?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>I think we look out there globally, NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR are doing a pretty good job supporting a broad variety of game engines. So, yes, I believe that with sufficient care taken in meeting the needs of the individual game developers, it's definitely possible to create these broadly usable libraries,</p>
<p><strong>So much of the focus has been obviously on the graphics and the visual aspect of the new PS5 Pro console. Does it also feature any additional capabilities for the audio component or anything else in the hardware, though?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Largely, the key improvements on the PS5 Pro are those big three. There are a few smaller features. The audio clock is a bit higher in case anybody wanted to use that. They can do a few more convolution reverbs; that is in there. Probably more significantly, you can run the CPU at a 10% higher frequency if you want to do so. By and large, though, the focus was on the big three key improvements.</p>
<p><strong>To wrap up our chat, is there one title that you feel is the standout centerpiece that shows players what the PS5 Pro can do at launch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>There have been a number of pretty amazing titles on PlayStation 5 Pro, so I would really hate to pick one. I did personally enjoy seeing the eleven games we had at our hands-on event. On a personal note, that was really fun because I got to, in advance of that event, play and experience pretty much every game that was in development on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Wonderful. As always, thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of the PS5 Pro</a> last month, Sony invited Wccftech as part of a very select number of media outlets and analysts to get an early look at the console and a soon-to-be-released deep dive into the system architecture by none other than the Lead Architect of the console, Mark Cerny. The event also included an exclusive Q&amp;A with Mr. Cerny himself afterward, which you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Mark Cerny started off the presentation as a sort of ‘bits and bytes’ talk to principally focus on the GPU for the PlayStation 5 Pro and why it matters. As it’s been some seven years since the beginning of the PlayStation 5 journey, it’s been more than enough time for the technology advances to need that additional power to make the most of the console generation. With the PlayStation 5 already having been on the market for more than four years, Mark Cerny admitted that it’s taken time for game creators to get up to speed (unless you’re one of Sony’s first-party studios like Naughty Dog or Sony Santa Monica).</p>
<p>Much of the PS5 Pro presentation focused on what Mark Cerny called the Big Three: a larger GPU, advanced ray tracing features, and upscaling games through artificial intelligence and PlayStation Super Spectral Resolution, or PSSR.</p>
<p>The first focus was on the larger GPU present in the PlayStation 5 Pro which features a unique AMD architecture that Sony was branding as RDNA2.X. This was a hybrid variant of RDNA 2 while featuring both custom and future RDNA versions present in RDNA 3 and beyond. This is combined with a GPU that featured 66% more Work Group Processors, or WGP, compared to the graphics solution present in the existing PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Sony wanted to emphasize that they decided against fully upgrading the system architecture to RDNA 3 because they did not want to have two separate game packages or versions between the PlayStation 5's base and Pro models, not unlike Microsoft’s Xbox Series S and X solution.</p>
<p>Secondly, Sony made a point of refuting the 335 Teraflop number that was present in the lead-up to the PlayStation 5 Pro’s launch. Mark commented that it would have been a nice bonus to have twice the ‘flops,’ but it wouldn’t double the real-world performance and would have instead led to something he dubbed ‘Flopflation.’ He once again reiterated the increase from 18 WGPs (workgroup processors, or compute units) to 30 WGPs while also introducing 67% higher ‘flops’. In terms of real world gains, this meant upwards of a 45% improvement in performance.</p>
<p>One example given was how a frame taking 16 milliseconds to render on PlayStation 5 could instead be done in only 11 milliseconds on PlayStation 5 Pro, and those extra 5ms could instead be spent on adding ray tracing. These additional WGPs were primarily focused on ray calculations and the divergence associated. By improving the ease of use, Mark Cerny hoped that ray tracing would continue to be adopted at an increasing rate.</p>
<figure><figcaption>PS5 Pro's Big Three</figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Sony made a point to touch on the machine learning or AI present in the PlayStation 5 Pro architecture. By utilizing ML, it’s possible to give games a graphical boost by having a game render fewer pixels and then using the PSSR neural network to fill in the gaps. This was bookended with the intent that this would not necessarily result in rendering a smaller resolution to begin with. By way of extrapolation and frame generation, the possibility exists to have PSSR insert frames between key frames and reduce the choppiness that’s commonly seen in games running at a reduced frame rate. This type of adjusted rendering would not necessarily be the be-all, end-all in terms of graphical processing. Sure, the possibility exists for developers to use the neural processing units to initially render a title at 540P or 720P, but ultimately, it comes down to the matrix math as Cerny called it and integer operations at play, namely the TOPS, or Trillions of integer Operations per Second. These TOPS are the real numbers that Sony wanted to focus on for rendering efficiency and the actual bandwidth of the PS5 Pro hardware.</p>
<p>Sony ended their presentation on the PlayStation 5 Pro deep dive by talking about the future potential for what the next PlayStation could achieve and also a unique collaboration with AMD that they’re calling Codename Amethyst. While much of the machine learning architecture on the PlayStation 5 Pro pushes the hardware to its limits, there is still a bottleneck at play in terms of system memory access. This is an opportunity for growth and perhaps to achieve a fully fused network with PSSR and the overall potential for growth with machine learning as a whole. Through the PlayStation 5 Pro, Mark Cerny and his team have developed a good understanding of what the current system architecture is capable of and what is to come in a future console.</p>
<p>While details are somewhat scarce compared to the rest of the PlayStation 5 Pro deep dive, Amethyst is the culmination of a unique collaboration with AMD to create a democratized library for machine learning, built upon multiple generations of RDNA and Sony Interactive Entertainment’s research and development. Mark Cerny likened the potential of this collaboration to developing a sort of neural network focused on graphics for gaming.</p>
<p>This is where future hardware architectures for both machine learning and AI would be integrated and allow developers to use these resources and perhaps guide the technology into unanticipated directions. Sony made a key point that this collaboration would be developed in parallel between the two companies, with developers having the ability to draw from libraries. Rather than this being some matter of proprietary technology solely for Sony, Amethyst is intended to bring broad machine learning across a variety of devices. It's definitely an intriguing initiative, though it's unclear when we'll see it bearing fruit in actual games.</p>

Whether he’s torching his own birthday cake with a flamethrower or dancing with himself through a field of lasers, it’s never easy to shake the sense that the movie was more focused on achieving GIF-able moments than telling any kind of coherent story.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>In the end, Zilko’s assessment is that <em>Sonic 3</em> might be fun for young kids and diehard fans, but it can’t end soon enough for everyone else. He might be right. But as the perfect mark for a Sega nostalgia cash-in with Sonic-loving kids of his own, I’m ready to revel in the franchise brain rot no matter what. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And equipped with that knowledge, you <em>can </em>succeed in <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>and even compete against the biggest whales in the game without spending money.,With that said, here’s what free-to-play players should expect out of their experience and how they can make the most of it.</p><figure id="" data-id="90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-recommend-id="image://90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an incomplete collection in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows an incomplete collection in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-recommend-id="image://90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an incomplete collection in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h75357"><a id=""></a>Accept that you won’t get everything</h2><p>The first rule of every gacha game is to completely turn off any part of your brain that tells you you’re a completionist. While you do get free booster packs every day in <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, sheer economics will tell you that you won’t open enough booster packs to actually complete your card collection. After all, if you could get every card for free, what would you spend money on?</p><p>New cards will inevitably come out faster than you can collect them with the free resources the game provides. Naturally, this means you need to lower your expectations of what you should chase. Immersive three star cards have a paltry 0.222% chance of showing up in a pack. Crown rares only have a 0.040% chance! This doesn’t mean you’ll <em>never </em>get these cards, of course. It’s just that you shouldn’t necessarily choose which pack to open in hopes you’ll get a card that has a 1 in 2500 chance of appearing.</p><p>Instead, set your sight on cards that will help you win battles. This will help you get the most rewards during events, which will in turn help you collect even more cards. </p><h2 id="h75358"><a id=""></a>Chase cards that will help you build decks of each element</h2><p><em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> doesn’t give you many options to chase down specific cards as of writing, but you can exert <em>some </em>control over which cards you can get. Right now, the three Genetic Apex card sets each contain distinct pools of cards. The fewer cards you own from a certain set, the greater the chance you’ll find a new card in your next pack.</p><p>As a free-to-play player, your first goal is to collect enough cards to build a competent deck of each element. You don’t need to make a <em>meta </em>deck of each element, mind you. Charizard EX and Moltres EX have great synergy, but if you played during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pocket-tcg-mass-outbreak-fire-type-bonus-rare-1851706732&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pocket-tcg-mass-outbreak-fire-type-bonus-rare-1851706732">Fire Pokemon Mass Outbreak Event</a></span>, you already have a strong deck in Blaine, Ninetails, and Rapidash. Pick the packs you choose to pull strategically, with the goal of selecting packs that will most likely strengthen whichever elemental deck is weakest. For instance, if you can’t build a strong Dark deck, Genetic Apex Mewtwo has a strong core of Ekans, Grimer, Zubat, and Koffing evolution lines you can add to your collection.</p><figure id="" data-id="de7f9b869e45eb3d7f4ad24c090e6021" data-recommend-id="image://de7f9b869e45eb3d7f4ad24c090e6021" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a battle against the CPU in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket.

While online battling can feel intimidating at first, matches are mostly low-stakes in <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>, and there’s no way for your opponent to send you mean messages about how you’re a bad player for not using the mythical Dunsparce card. I typically stay far away from PvP modes myself, so I can assure you that online battling isn’t nearly as scary as it sounds.</p><p>Look at the cards you already have and figure out which deck you can realistically build that can win online battles. Sure, in the game’s current meta, cards like Mewtwo EX and Gardevoir rule the roost when used together. However, if you don’t have any copies of either card, you’ll need a lot of luck with your card pulls to make that deck work. However, if you already have, say, two Exeggutor EX cards, you might be close to putting together a strong Grass deck bolstered by the Erika trainer card. Maybe your deck won’t be “meta,” but at least you’ll have a solid foundation to work with as you continue to collect cards.</p><p>On the plus side, less popular decks can thrive online <em>because</em> they aren’t meta. After all, if everyone uses decks with Pikachu EXs, then most players will learn how to best counter them. However, if you roll up with a Marowak EX deck, you may leave your opponent scrambling to come up with a counterplay. Just remember that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195">success in <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> battles often comes down to sheer luck</a></span>, so don’t feel like your deck is bad just because you’re struggling to win!</p><h2 id="h75360"><a id=""></a>Show up for the daily grind</h2><p>With solid decks to play the game under your belt, or at least enough cards to get your feet wet, it’s time to do what every free-to-play game devolves into: daily grinding. To the game’s credit, <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>is light on this front. Your literal “daily missions” can be completed in about 10 minutes. That said, if you want to collect as many free resources as you can as you play, participate in the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Use your <strong>free booster packs</strong> when they become available.</li><li>Check your <strong>Wonder Picks</strong>, especially if your Wonder Stamina is almost full. Events may dish out free Wonder Picks throughout the day, so check in whenever you open the game.</li><li><strong>Participate in any ongoing single-player events</strong>, and don’t sit on a full Event Stamina bar. You can often repeat these battles to grind out bonus hourglasses and unique event cards.</li><li>Battle other players in Versus mode. <strong>You can get up to five shop tickets a day from players who press the “thanks” button after battle </strong>(make sure to return the favor and thank them too!). Remember, Shop Tickets can be used to buy Hourglasses, which means more cards.</li><li><strong>You can also give Shop Tickets to your friends by liking their Showcases</strong>.

While we know that some resources will eventually expire (such as Pack Points used to get a card of your choice), nothing indicates that hourglasses can’t be used for future expansions. So if you’ve collected all the cards you need to win battles and have fulfilled most of your collection-based missions, consider following the advice of your elders who grew up in a much better economy and start saving for the future.</p><p>At the end of the day, there’s no hard science to playing games like <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>. No one’s going to knock on your door and take your phone away because you didn’t manage your free-to-play account optimally. But when shiny new cards drop and players begin to rack up hundreds of dollars on their credit cards chasing them, you’ll be happy to have a handful of pulls in reserve so you can enjoy the new stuff too. You’ll never own as many cards as a hardcore spender does. But you can at least rest easy knowing that you worked for the cards you got..</p><p>Video games are meant to be fun, so hopefully using your resources to best fill out your collection will help you get the most out of <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>. And if you aren’t having fun… well, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinity-nikki-release-date-dress-up-rpg-ps5-register-1851699258&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinity-nikki-release-date-dress-up-rpg-ps5-register-1851699258"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a></span> looks pretty good. </p><p><em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>is available now for iOS and Android devices.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During a recent interview, CD Projekt Red revealed that Witcher 4 will have “more or less” the same map size and number of quests as The Witcher 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conversation with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiYBje1qeaA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Skill Up</a> podcast (via <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/521172/article/the-witcher-4-map-size-confirmed-to-be-similar-to-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>), CD Projekt RED VPs Sebastian Kalemba and Małgorzata Mitrega revealed new details about The Witcher 4’s map and quests. When asked whether they wanted to make the sequel larger in scale or more condensed than the previous title, the developers replied that the map is “more or less” similar in size to The Witcher 3, and the number of quests is “more or less the same,” too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the answer is not that simple. The developers revealed that The Witcher 4 will be a big game, and the team’s ambition with the title is “huge”. They want to “deliver a super compelling experience,” and they will prioritise quality over quantity. At the same time, they can promise that the game is “going to be pretty big.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, the developers also stated that The Witcher 4 will take place a few years after the events of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. With the sequel, they aim to create an inviting experience for newcomers while fulfilling the existing community’s expectations. Hence, they have asked the fans to trust the process, as they are trying to build a universal experience.</p>

It started during a pandemic and resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-shortages-2021-microsoft-continue"><u>supply chain issues</u></a> that made the Xbox Series X hard to get for months, the potential-killer-app launch title (Halo Infinite) suffered an embarrassing but much needed yearlong <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-delayed-to-2021-for-xbox-series-x-pc-xbox-one"><u>delay</u></a>, Microsoft tried to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired"><u>buy Activision-Blizzard for SIXTY-NINE BILLION DOLLARS</u></a> only to see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-verdict-has-been-reached-in-the-microsoft-vs-ftc-trial"><u>regulatory agencies</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-calls-cma-decision-disappointing-disputes-cloud-gaming-reasoning"><u>around the world</u></a> challenge it before the deal ultimately <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal"><u>went through</u></a>, the company shipped one bona fide <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2021"><u>Game of the Year</u></a> (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review"><u>Forza Horizon 5</u></a>) and also started <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-vision-of-the-future"><u>publishing its first-party games on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch</u></a>, and Xbox boss Phil Spencer even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away"><u>confirmed</u></a> that a handheld Xbox is in the works, even if we might not see it during this hardware generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, outside of a kickass 2021 that saw the release of the aforementioned Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 along with Psychonauts 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and Tunic, Xbox players have been waiting (and waiting) for a steady flow of first-party games. And it was looking a bit bleak this year – <em>again </em>– with Avowed getting pushed to February 2025 and the potential-packed pixel-art indie action-adventure exclusive Replaced slipping out of 2024. But Microsoft turned in all its homework right as the bell rang at the end of class, with STALKER 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle all landing in the final six weeks of the year – and all three getting A’s on the assignment. Let’s discuss the honorable mentions, runners-up, and Best Xbox Game of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Xbox Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a> both just missed making the top of our list but are very worthy of honorable mentions. The psychologically focused sequel to Hellblade was the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/13/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-announced-for-xbox-series-x"><u>first-ever officially announced Xbox Series X game</u></a>, and when it finally shipped this year, it can lay claim to at least one title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review"><u>best-looking Xbox game ever made</u></a>. Ninja Theory’s Unreal Engine 5-powered narrative-driven adventure is a technical showpiece, a powerhouse of pixels that leverages all 10.2 teraflops of power that the Series X is packing. It’s a bit light in the gameplay department – more akin to a walking simulator than a proper action-adventure – but it is nevertheless beautifully acted and stunningly presented. It’s very much worth taking the time to go on this journey with Senua.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Dungeons of Hinterberg’s hooky concept – a European town becomes a hotspot for visitors to come and make friends and drink beers at night after a long day of monster slaying in the dungeons below – translates into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-of-hinterberg-the-final-preview"><u>a super enjoyable mix</u></a> of action-RPG and social sim gameplay. Its comic book-style visuals only enhanced the entire experience. This was a refreshing summer release in a season where we typically complain about the lack of interesting new games to play. But this year’s virtual summer trip to Europe to crush a bunch of monsters and collect loot while chatting with the locals about it at the pub afterwards proved to be just the kind of vacation we needed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/codblops6-1725926226920-1734501135279.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It may not be an Xbox exclusive, but Microsoft owns Call of Duty now, and the biggest first-person shooter franchise in the world bounced back in a big way this year. And Xbox owners did get to play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> on day one via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, so there’s that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, Treyarch, Raven, and the myriad Activision support studios that put in yeoman’s work on this series every year came together to craft the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><u>best single-player Call of Duty campaign</u></a> in years. Historically underrated developer Raven understood that the key to a great Call of Duty campaign is variety, and in Black Ops 6 you get to do all kinds of incredibly fun stuff, from going undercover at a casino to freely roaming an open-world desert to hobnobbing at a Bill Clinton fundraiser and so much more. Its story doesn’t quite punch you in the face with a twist as good as Black Ops 1’s JFK moment, but it’s a damn fine story nevertheless that positively reinforces the excellent and unpredictable campaign gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review"><u>great, focused multiplayer mode</u></a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review"><u>excellent return of Zombies</u></a>, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is one of the best overall gaming packages you can get in 2024.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/stalkerthumb-1723559698961-1734501135279.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> went through a literal version of Hell on Earth in order to get this deeply personal game about their home country of Ukraine made after Russia invaded it midway through development. That it got done at all is an incredible testament to their perseverance and human spirit, and how lucky we are that they did finish it, because <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review"><u>it is fantastic</u></a>. (Side note: the 90-minute documentary about the making of this game is an incredible human story that’s well worth watching. Find it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg620kmD6Dc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox’s YouTube channel</u></a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This first-person shooter sequel mixes punishing survival gameplay with brutal combat in a brooding sci-fi atmosphere to create a gameplay loop that feels refreshingly old-school yet delightfully new and modern all at the same time. Though its initial launch was marred by a host of technical issues, its fixes and updates came so frequently that it’s impossible to hold its launch day against it. And if you’re just jumping in now, you’ll only ever see the current, more polished version of the Exclusion Zone. Enjoy playing in the world it creates, as its developers clearly did when building it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-blogroll-1732662931258-1734501135279.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-steam-reviews-collapse-to-overwhelmingly-negative-dev-admits-it-completely-underestimated-excitement-for-the-game"><u>rough takeoff put passengers in a sour mood</u></a>, but things quickly smoothed out as developer Asobo Studio reached cruising altitude with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review"><u>latest version</u></a> of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-review"><u>masterpiece</u></a> aviation simulator. The team somehow made Flight Simulator even more gorgeous, rendering an even more beautiful and realistic Earth than the one from 2021. They also added a lot more to do, from wildlife photo shoots to inconceivably dotting the in-game planet with every single helipad in the real world. Physics were improved, as were numerous other under-the-hood systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In all, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> may not be a “game” for everyone (hence the “simulator” in the title), but what it sets out to do it does brilliantly. It is a love letter to anyone and everyone who loves aviation, in the same way that Forza Horizon 5 was a love letter to anyone who loved cars and driving.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/indianajones-xboxpc-performancereview-blogroll-1734193646590-1734501135278.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucasfilm chose wisely when partnering with MachineGames to make a AAA Indiana Jones video game. The talented studio revived and modernized Wolfenstein, and before that made one of the greatest licensed video games of all time and one of the best original Xbox games ever in The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. And so it is high praise when we say that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review"><u>best game</u></a> this group of developers has ever made – not to mention the best Indiana Jones <em>anything </em>since The Last Crusade, 35 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some gamers were skeptical when we found out back in January that Indy’s latest interactive adventure would be played primarily in first-person. But once everyone played it, MachineGames’s choice was quickly validated. The Great Circle completely immerses you as Indiana Jones, from the shadow of your fedora on a wall to the versatile whip in your hand to the leather jacket that squeaks as you walk – not to mention the absolutely S-tier performance of veteran voice actor Troy Baker, who completely disappears into the role of Indiana Jones and convinces your ears and brain that you’re somehow anachronistically listening to a 40-something Harrison Ford. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Great Circle has action, sure, but that action occurs as a complement to the real heart of it: adventure. Your whip can be used to stun enemies – or knock the gun out of their hands – but it’s mostly used for traversal as a makeshift rope to help you navigate the crypts, tombs, cities, and dig sites you’ll visit around the world. And the swelling orchestral score makes the big moments feel extra big, just as it did in the Indiana Jones movies. The writing is also spot-on, with humor being used to punctuate various scenes and make sure the tone always stays fun without ever getting too dark or serious. Oh, and you’ll be solving puzzles too. So, so many puzzles both big and small. And they’re all really enjoyable to figure out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle isn’t just the best Xbox game of the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-brings-back-the-magic-of-xbox-exclusives-unlocked-clips"><u>it’s the best game that Microsoft has shipped under any of its banners</u></a> since IGN’s 2021 overall Game of the Year winner, Forza Horizon 5. It’s a globe-trotting adventure-action romp that eschews shooting in favor of punching, puzzles, whips, quips, story, sidequests, and setpieces. It is brilliant, impossible to put down, and it plays unlike any other first-person game out there. It easily and deservedly wins IGN’s Best Xbox Game of 2024 award.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more discussion on all of your favorite Xbox games, don’t miss our weekly Xbox show, Podcast Unlocked.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-rpg-of-2024.1064421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout 2024, it felt as if a new amazin RPG was right around the corner at every moment. The year kicked off with a bang when Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth launched just before Persona 3 Reload showed us why the original is a timeless story. And we only had to wait until February to return to Final Fantasy VII when Rebirth expanded the horizons of a beloved classic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those may have been the headliners early in the year, but Unicorn Overlord worked its way into our hearts with its captivating art style and tactical depth, before Dragon’s Dogma 2 proved why the cult classic deserved a sequel. It was more than enough to hold us over until the big hitters like Metaphor: ReFantazio and Dragon Age: The Veilguard landed toward the end of the year, showing how two iconic RPG development teams can forge a new path in their own ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was an embarrassment of riches for the RPG sickos here at IGN, especially considering the aforementioned games weren’t the only RPGs that stuck with us throughout the year. We can only highlight a handful of them, however, so here’s our list of the best RPGs of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best RPG of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two RPGs from this year received an Honorable Mention, which we'd like to highlight before getting into our runner-up and winner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can spot a Vanillaware game from a mile away thanks to its painterly art style and expressive anime-inspired character designs. It's what gives Unicorn Overlord such a distinct fantasy aesthetic, but it’s the unique mix of real-time strategy and tactical gameplay that makes it stand out among a sea of great RPGs. Creating squads composed of different classes and deploying them strategically filled that Ogre Battle-sized void in our lives, and exploring the overworld to build up towns that join your cause brought all its mechanics together. Its story of political drama has intriguing twists and turns, but it’s the squad members we made along the way that left a lasting impression in Unicorn Overlord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite it partly being a Hawaiian getaway for the crew from RGG Studio’s RPG debut Yakuza: Like A Dragon in 2020, the follow-up Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth was rather heavy. It’s an examination of family, legacy, and what you do with the time you have left. Series-long protagonist Kazuma Kiryu teaming up with his successor in Kasuga Ichiban made for a beautiful passing of the torch. I came for the detailed and nuanced recreation of Waikiki, but it’s the bittersweet and inspiring moments in Infinite Wealth that reminded us why there’s just nothing like the Yakuza franchise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Dragon’s Dogma 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/04/dd2-oo-ign-thumbnail-v1-1709594709352.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Many would consider the original Dragon’s Dogma from 2012 a cult classic for the ways it thrusts you into a harsh fantasy world with very little to guide you. And the sequel in Dragon's Dogma 2 did not forget that. Capcom didn’t sand off the edges, streamline systems, or make its dark world any more inviting, and that’s why it was able to stand out in 2024 despite being one of the biggest years for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon’s Dogma 2 is all about its organic emergent moments. There is a main quest to follow, of course, but NPCs will tap you for sidequests and you never know what you run into along the way. Its mechanics may seem inelegant, but after giving it time, you realize how flexible and deep it is from a gameplay perspective, especially once you grasp how reactive the in-game physics are. The Pawn system adds another layer, letting you customize your own AI-controlled party members, or borrow members from others online to make the goofiest band of heroes. Dragon’s Dogma 2 is not a clean experience and it thrives off of a unique friction that’s tough to find in games these days. When you reflect on how much work you put into surviving in its massive and harsh world, the consequential world-altering events and its message are nothing short of awe-inspiring.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/05/ff7rebirth-vcms-1730774234294.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing Remake in 2020, it felt as if there were endless possibilities for what the rest of Final Fantasy VII would look like for a new generation. Stepping out into the Grasslands for the first time in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, when Aerith takes in the scenic view and shows excitement about a world worth fighting for, captures the exact feeling. The musical motifs played on our nostalgia and the recreation of its original world was undoubtedly impressive while evoking a sense of wistfulness – it felt like Final Fantasy VII grew up with us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have our qualms with how Rebirth ends and sets up part three in this remade trilogy, but that doesn’t necessarily define the entire game. Tucked within its reinvention of the existing story are moments that elevate beloved characters to feel like brand new heroes who’ve inspired us in new ways. Its open regions are a beautiful expansion of the original’s overworld, and they’re filled with things to do that are often more than just busy work – and don’t ask us about how many hours we sunk into the new card game Queen’s Blood. In many respects, Rebirth connected us to a world we thought we knew on a deeper level – it made for one of the year’s best RPGs and it has us incredibly eager for what’s next.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/da-1718021093156.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been 10 years since Dragon Age: Inquisition, and the way in which series fans were <em>thirsty </em>for anything related to Dragon Age in that time was wild to see. With a tumultuous development cycle, it’s kind of a miracle that The Veilguard exists at all, but it turned out to be a worthy successor and one of the best RPGs of the year. Through the lens of Rook, our new customizable protagonist, we get to pick up on the story of Solas that left us hanging from Inquisition and its DLC. Yet, The Veilguard was still able to establish a new direction that stayed true to the core concepts of a series so steeped in its own lore. Its warmer tone may not be what you remember from previous Dragon Age games, but you roll with a party full of bright personalities who create a sense of purpose reminiscent of the BioWare games of yore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat will be familiar for anyone who has played a modern action game without sacrificing the kind of depth you’d expect from an action-RPG. Every class feels great to play and retains a unique playstyle while being viable – which is important considering you only control Rook throughout the game. While your party members still play an important role in combat, it's their presence and where you stand with them that makes the journey worth seeing through. Either way, you’ll be treated to some great conclusions that show how The Veilguard carves its own path with confidence.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/metaphor-re-fantazio-key-art-1719595744252.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With a pedigree of the last three Persona games, I came into Metaphor: ReFantazio with high expectations, and even then, developer Atlus found a way to exceed them. To call it fantasy Persona isn’t necessarily inaccurate (and is a pretty good indication of what you’re getting into), but that would also undersell the nuances that make Metaphor the best RPG of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using the context of a daily calendar system, Metaphor wields familiar mechanics to usher you through its fantasy political drama. Deciding how to spend your limited time makes those choices intriguing, whether it’s spending time with followers to level up bonds, explore dungeons for sidequests, or better yourself by increasing virtue stats – it’s the small moments like these that connect you to its world on the ground level. That’s the social sim element that leaves you naturally invested, and it gives its big moments more weight. So, when you see a character overcome their trauma or push themselves to do what’s right, it feels like it comes from a genuine place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, Metaphor is the game of the moment. It doesn’t shy away from themes such as racism, inequality, religious extremism, and abuse of power and demonstrates an understanding of the material it's working with through a powerful story. Every character, every bond and follower, and every major story beat feeds into a thoughtful representation of our real world, showing us the ugliest parts of humanity but also what it takes to create a brighter future. Metaphor is very upfront about its message from beginning to end, and yet, what it says about the power of fiction might be the most inspiring part of it all. There’s just nothing like Metaphor: ReFantazio, and it represents the best of what games can offer, especially in 2024.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-rogue-incursion-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the series most ripe for a virtual reality adaptation, few have greater potential than Alien. I mean, who aside from Ellen Ripley herself wouldn’t want to experience the thrill of being hunted by the perfect organism without that whole “risk of being dismembered” thing? Alien: Rogue Incursion is an admirable first attempt at delivering just that, with a compelling story, memorable characters, terrifying Xenomorphs, and a perfectly crafted world that couldn’t be mistaken for anything but the iconic Alien universe. There’s plenty of room to improve in its already-in-the-works sequel, however, especially when it comes to the simplistic combat, not-so-clever Xenomorphic foes, and occasional jankiness that could use some smoothing over. Even so, Rogue Incursion is a strong opening act for a series I’m already eager to play more of.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alien: Rogue Incursion Gameplay Screenshots (PSVR 2)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve read the Alien comics, like Aliens: Defiance, then you’ll already be familiar with the badass protagonist whose boots you’ll be filling: Zula Hendricks. And if that name doesn’t ring a bell, Rogue Incursion does a great job of introducing you to her in short order so you don’t have to do any homework beforehand. An ex-colonial marine with a rough upbringing and chronic back problems, you’re sent to a classically deserted planet overrun by the most evil creatures imaginable, and accompanied by your trusty synthetic companion, Davis – don’t worry, he’s reformed, and not the type to betray you to please his corporate overlords… anymore. What follows is an extremely formulaic Alien tale that apes all the same beats for which the series is known, but thanks to interesting dialogue, great characters, and a relatively short runtime that doesn’t overstay its welcome, that familiarity doesn’t end up being such a bad thing. Zula and her relationship with her robot bestie is genuinely touching, oftentimes offsetting an otherwise relentlessly bleak situation, and the story has a few twists in store and an ending that sets up a sequel nicely.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zula's relationship with her robot bestie is genuinely touching.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the eight-hour story, you’ll tiptoe through the dark corridors and frozen wastes of a forgotten colony world while looking over your shoulder every few seconds for those eye-free freak shows that are never far off, and then painting the walls with their acidic blood whenever one pops out of a vent or sneaks up behind you. Going through each area slowly and doing your best to keep quiet can keep them off your back for slightly longer, but since ammo isn’t particularly scarce and Xenomorphs aren’t all that hard to kill on anything but the hardest difficulty, I found that running through areas and getting things done quickly could work just as well, so long as you’re up for a slightly more regular fight. And, of course, you’ll have to solve complicated engineering problems in a world where every piece of technology breaks as soon as a Xenomorph so much as looks at it, and then makes as much noise as possible anytime you try to troubleshoot, just in case those aliens in the next room over hadn’t heard you yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is rather simple, in that 95% of the time you’ll be attacked by Xenomorphs who climb out of vents seemingly installed for the explicit purpose of helping them get around, pull out one of your three weapons to make short work of them, and then move on. These encounters are divided nearly equally into either exciting sections that have some kind of unique tension or twist, and completely monotonous annoyances. For example, finding yourself cornered by a trio of Xenos and frantically trying to reload your weapon before you’re toast is extremely memorable, and setting traps as you hold off an onslaught of double-jawed monsters while performing IT support for some broken communications relays is an action-packed good time. But then you’ll go a long stretch of walking down some of the same hallways you’ve visited already, stopping every 30 seconds to kill a few monsters that run straight at you, completely devoid of any kind of intelligent attack strategy, then carefully reload your weapons before moving on and repeating the process moments later. These sections tend to make combat feel pretty mundane, and take away a lot of the initial fear when confronting a Xenomorph, which begin to feel quite commonplace after the first couple hours.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Initially scary Xenomorphs can soon begin to feel commonplace.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably the weakest part of combat is your limited and mostly unremarkable arsenal, which consists of a pulse rifle, a pump-action shotgun, and a six-shooter revolver. The pulse rifle, an automatic weapon that’s usually the most overall reliable choice for a variety of situations, is really the only weapon that feels recognizable in the Alien universe, while the shotgun and revolver seem oddly generic and low-tech for a sci-fi setting. Your only other tools are proximity grenades that can be set to go off when an alien draws near and a motion scanner that you won’t need to use very often, since Xenomorphs loudly scurry about and hiss at you to announce their presence most of the time. These items feel pretty par for the course for VR shooters, with little to set them apart. It’s also a bit weird that you don’t have a last resort melee weapon to fall back on, so if a facehugger jumps on your head, you’d better hope you can get your pistol pointed at an awkward angle to kill it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is an Alien game, so perhaps unsurprisingly, the enemy variety isn’t very strong either. You’ll go at least several hours before seeing a single enemy that isn’t a Xenomorph, and even when you do, it’ll be a facehugger or two before going right back to more Xenos. The good news is that these aliens can be pretty intimidating foes, killing in just a hit or two and rushing at you by crawling on walls, leaping great distances, and moving erratically to make them hard to pin down. Unfortunately, despite their best effort, their menacing appearance doesn’t always translate to them being particularly crafty foes, and after you’ve learned their small bag of tricks in the first hour or two, they begin to feel downright dim as they mozy on out through a vent before pausing in front of you for a few seconds, giving you ample time to score the kill while they stand in place helplessly. Between the first Alien movie’s depiction of the Xenomorph as an all-powerful monstrosity that can scarcely be beaten, and the second movie’s tendency to blast through dozens of the creatures within the span of a few minutes, Rogue Incursion certainly finds itself in the latter camp.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Alien Recommendations</h3><p>If you love Ridley Scott's pessimistic galaxy filled with things that want to kill you, here are my top recommendations!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It also suffers from minor, but noteworthy enough to be annoying, bugs. Sometimes characters will repeat the same lines of dialogue multiple times in a row, Xenomorphs will move through objects in bizarre ways, and your controls aren’t always as precise and responsive as you’d hope when you’re staring down a room full of facehuggers. None of these issues are particularly troublesome, but they do add a slight lack of polish that I hope they’ll work on for the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while this isn’t the fault of Alien: Rogue Incursion alone, one especially annoying PSVR 2 issue that felt like a particular problem here is that the little PlayStation logo buttons are a tad too easy to hit, especially when you’re clamoring for your handgun after a Xenomorph surprises you. Most of the times I died were due to a menu popping up at exactly the wrong moment, sending me scrambling to back out before I was killed, which I was rarely successful at. That added an extra level of stress in the wrong kind of way. Again, this is a controller design problem at the end of the day, but it came up enough here that there really ought to be some built-in protection against it – maybe make me hold the menu button down for a second or two before you cause me to get impaled on an alien’s tail, guys?</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Alien: Rogue Incursion is a faithful and entertaining stab at bringing Alien to virtual reality. The excellent story, spot-on Alien environments, and creepy Xenomorphs keep the horrifying times going throughout its eight-hour duration, even when repetitive combat, predictable AI, and the odd bug here and there make it clear this is the first attempt that it is. But while there’s plenty of room for this budding series to grow, I can already happily recommend Rogue Incursion as a strong proof of concept to Alien fans and newcomers alike – one that’s left me eagerly awaiting part two.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
