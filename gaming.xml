            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-minecraft-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Markus "Notch" Persson, the original creator of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, says he's "basically announced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>" after releasing a poll in which he asked his fans what type of game they'd like to see him work on next.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">poll</a>, which was posted on social media platform X a few days ago, gave fans two options with regards to Notch's next project: "a traditional roguelike" in the vein of&nbsp;<em>ADOM&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Nethack</em>, or "a spiritual successor thing to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>".</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the poll, which has attracted over 285,000 votes at time of writing, heavily skews towards "<em>Minecraft 2</em>", as he calls it, with 81.5% of votes weighing in for that project and just 18.5% of votes supporting the roguelike concept.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced.jpg?itok=MWQpjJ3h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced.jpg?itok=aIleTtcQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Notch can't actually make&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>, since he no longer holds the rights to the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message posted later on</a>, Notch then says he "basically announced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>" in the poll. Despite feeling that "spiritual successors are usually kind of...tragic", he goes on to say "why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for".</p>

<p>Of course, Notch doesn't actually own the rights to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>anymore (which <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874532442637475973" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">he himself acknowledges</a>); since Mojang was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mojang-yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft-notch-leaves" rel="nofollow">purchased by Microsoft in 2014</a>, at which point Notch also left the company, it's Microsoft that owns&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, not Notch.</p>

<p>In his post, Notch says he intends to make the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor without "sneakily infring[ing] on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about". He doesn't elaborate on exactly what that means.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Notch doesn't reveal any details whatsoever about this project, so it's likely that we're a long way away from seeing any actual gameplay or even learning any concrete information about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced-portal.jpg?itok=BVZTQS7r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced-portal.jpg?itok=x_BYQmIk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>could be getting a "spiritual successor" courtesy of Notch.</figcaption></figure><p>Notch also doesn't sound particularly enthusiastic about making&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>; he's open about knowing it'll make more money than his roguelike idea, but he <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874530816216482169" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">implored his supporters</a> to vote for his roguelike project, so that's likely where his heart is (or was).</p>

<p>While the concept of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>'s original creator making a spiritual successor will be exciting to many, he's not a figure without his fair share of controversy.</p>

<p>He's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-ditches-references-to-notch" rel="nofollow">accused of homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, and other prejudices</a> due to his posts on social media, leading to Mojang <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-excluded-from-minecraft-anniversary-for-comments-and-opinions" rel="nofollow">excluding him</a> from&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>'s tenth anniversary due to his "comments and opinions".</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>itself, it's going from strength to strength.</p>

<p>It's still the best-selling game of all time, having <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67105983" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hit 300 million sales</a> back in 2023, and a number of tie-in projects are in the works, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments" rel="nofollow">real-life attractions</a>, an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix" rel="nofollow">animated series</a> on Netflix, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">a live-action movie</a>. As far as we're aware, Mojang and Microsoft have no plans for a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2&nbsp;</em>of their own.</p>

            <p>
Original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a> designer Tim Cain, also known for co-directing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> at Obsidian, has published a video responding to a player's question about why violence is the "default" path in so many big budget RPGs. That's specifically RPGs with "AAA" budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that "evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
His answer to the question isn't very satisfying: violence is the focus at those production scales because games in which bashing, bruising and bloodening are central tend to sell more copies. If you'd like that to change, you must get off your arse and "vote with your dollars". He does, however, have a few interesting reflections about his own experience as an RPG designer attempting to support more creative player approaches, whether <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-latest-starfield-controversy-is-a-reminder-that-gamers-really-love-pacifism">peacenik</a> or otherwise. Beyond that, the question of why violent games do numbers is always worth chewing over.

<p>
"I've always touted my RPGs as not only not needing violence, not needing you to make a combat character, but I don't even tout that one as the default path - I don't consider combat the main path and stealth and dialogue as the alternatives," Cain comments in the video. "I've always said this game supports multiple paths - you want to talk your way through it, knock yourself out, you want to stealth your way through it, go for it. Even when there's combat that has to be done, usually your companions can do it, or you can use stealth or dialogue to avoid it or reduce it so much that it becomes a relatively trivial fight." 
</p><p>

He points to the existence of easy modes, and more recently, story modes, as ways to sideline the process of decapitating elves and similar, even in games that prioritise violence. But the audience for such things is considerably smaller, he asserts, than the audience for wanton acts of elf murder. "There are options there, but people don't take them as much. People play the non-story modes more often than story modes."
</p>
<p>
Cain himself loves "rarely chosen paths" in RPGs, whether violent or non-violent, and is saddened by what he suggests is the mounting pressure in big budget RPGs to simplify everything to combat. "I put dumb dialogue in a lot of my games," he says. "I like to support generalists or really bizarre specialists, and these are supported in my games." 
</p>
<p>
Even the original Fallout, published in 1997, isn't as violence-led as the "war never changes" branding might indicate, Cain comments in the video. "You would think violence was the default in Fallout, but it really wasn't. People frequently made quests and thought this isn't what the player's going to do, violence is not going to be the go-to in this one."
</p>
<p>
Cain shares a few anecdotes from his play history of "rarely chosen paths": being the first person to complete a 1-INT run of Fallout, playing Arcanum as a swordsman with no magic or technology, and surviving Temple Of Elemental Evil with a party of halfling bards. "A lot of games remove these less common paths and they see little to no reduction in sales, meaning there weren't enough of you who liked those paths," he gloomily observes.
</p><p>
Cain also makes some familiar observations about violent games lending themselves to more impactful trailers, with particular reference to why action RPGs, in his experience, outsell turn-based RPGs and the like. After all, it's "easier to market those kind of games when you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching."
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Cain doesn't really comment at all on the obvious broad question here: why people are drawn to violence in art and entertainment media at large, from the Homeric epics to the latest Netflix horror shows. I have many thoughts, most of them utterly vacuous. One is that depictions of violence tend to involve a subject and object. Considering violence apart from the question of what or who is being violent to who or what risks rendering the whole debate meaningless.
</p>
<p>
Another thought is that violence in video games is perhaps better read as a kind of kinetic, collaborative performance of metaphor and symbol, not the mere sating of a desire to do damage. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-strange-and-bruising-poetry-of-rpg-combat-systems">I've written in the past</a> about how turn-based combat systems remind me of poetic forms in being a cycling set of rules that are used to "compose" an encounter. Combat in such games is often a form of characterisation: party roles like tank, DPS or support correspond to particular narrative archetypes and personalities. 
</p><p>
In shooters, meanwhile, guns are perhaps better interpreted as ways of calibrating the game's spacetime. The range and rate at which they fire, whether they fire in a straight line or an arc, the choice of accompanying light and sound, the size of the clip - all these things are ways of setting the tempo, mapping the space, and determining how you frame and understand other entities. Hand me a slow-loading shotgun and I'll start the level expecting a bunch of blind corners and point-blank quickdraw. I will develop a precise awareness of hand motions, details visible from certain orientations, and the seconds between an enemy looking my way and them noticing me. Hand me an assault rifle and I will tend to perceive enemies as a pleasantly mowable mass.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about violence this way makes me less glum about the undeniable bloodthirstiness of big budget games, from RPGs to open worlders. That said, I would absolutely love to play a "triple-A" RPG that prioritises non-violent methods. For example, a big budget video game adaptation of Alfred Valley's pen-and-paper RPG <a href="https://alfredvalley.itch.io/lay-on-hands">Lay On Hands</a>, which devotes all those triple-yay megabucks to the premise of being a travelling healer. It could still involve violence - can't have a healer without some kind of violence, probably - but it would centre healing as a holistic vocation that extends across dialogue, community interactions and the battlefield. In the meantime, there's Brendy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-play-foxhole-as-a-pacifist-medic-who-refuses-to-carry-a-gun-but-the-enemy-doesnt-seem-impressed">tale of being a pacifist medic in Foxhole</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-next-gen-xbox-prime/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new rumor has circulated online that the next-gen Xbox called ‘Xbox Prime’ is targeting a 2026 release date.</p>



<p>The news comes from X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1876099668482085289?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, who has a history of posting primarily Call of Duty leaks. According to Hope, he says that he’s heard the next Xbox console “is still coming in 2026 and will be called Xbox Prime.”</p>



<p>He continues to say that it’s unclear if the console’s name is the codename or not and that Infinity Ward’s next Call of Duty title, presumably Modern Warfare 4, will be a Day 1 release.</p>



<p>Hope later continues that the Xbox next-gen release is “pretty much an open secret within the industry.”</p>



<p>If the rumor proves to be true, it could suggest that we could be hearing about the next generation Xbox sooner rather than later, possibly by the end of the year.</p>



<p>As for whether the rumor is true, Hope has had a history of posting Call of Duty leaks and is known to have sources within Activision and Call of Duty development teams, and with the company now owned by Microsoft, it’s entirely plausible that he’s been given the information from a developer working on a next-gen version of Call of Duty 2026. </p>



<p>As Hope points out, hopefully, the rumor leads to others with knowledge of the console speaking out to other leakers or journalists to confirm or deny the rumors.</p>



<p>As of September 2024, the Xbox Series S|X has sold 29.64 million units, half of that of the PlayStation 5’s 60 million.</p>



<p>What do you think of a next-generation Xbox console releasing in 2026? Do you think the next-gen Xbox is called Xbox Prime? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 release date flings itself onto PC bringing New York’s web-swinging protectors to a new format. The PS5 launch was a summer blockbuster in its own right, but new life is breathing into this sleeping symbiote.</p>



<p>Insomniac Games don’t make bad games. It’s spent 30 years crafting one compelling adventure after another: Spyro, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Resistance. 2018’s Spider-Man elevated the developer’s status to new heights (literally), Miles Morales kickstarted the PS5 generation off in the right way, and 2024’s Spider-Man 2 is a technical marvel—pun intended.</p>



<p>PlayStation 5 was fortunate enough to get the exclusive launch of the third mainline sequel. However, a Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 PC release date is looking to kick some criminal butt, and it’s a crime for you to not know the launch date of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-million-copy-selling sequel</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-spider-man-2-pc-release-date">When is Spider-Man 2 PC Release Date?</h2>

<p><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 release date on PC is locked in for Jan. 30, 2025</strong>, and it is available to purchase from two different storefronts: Epic Games Store and Steam.</p>



<p>Sony users are accustomed to PS4 and PS5 exclusives releasing under a timed window. The early days saw 2018’s God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn eventually get ported to PC, and now most releases follow suit: God of War Ragnarok, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, and the original Spider-Man, for instance.</p>



<p>Now, it’s the turn of Spider-Man 2 to arrive on PC. 2024’s New York Comic Con fittingly played host to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Release Date announcement</a>. The “Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Announce Trailer” is a chance to revisit some of the open-world title’s most epic battles and emotional, gut-punching scenes, and is sure to whet the appetite of Spidey fans everywhere.</p>

<h2 id="h-every-new-marvel-s-spider-man-2-feature-on-pc">Every New Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Feature on PC</h2>



<p>So far, <strong>Enhanced ray-tracing options</strong> is the headline maker when it comes to Spider-Man 2 on PC.</p>

Stay tuned for more details on features and recommended specs closer to launch.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, Spider-Man 2 on PC gets all the cool features introduced to PS5 after launch: New Game Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-will-receive-8-new-suits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new suits</a>, free cosmetic packs, and more.</p>

    <div>
                      
                      
          
<p>The pastime of pinball has lived a fraught existence. Whether due to public sentiment, hostile legislation, or a simple lack of popularity, the entire silver ball industry has repeatedly teetered on the brink of collapse. Yet it has always come back, today again riding a wave of popularity driven by the successes of high-tech machines capitalizing on familiar brands like X-Men and Godzilla.</p>
<p>Pinball arcades are springing up everywhere, but private ownership is also surging. Those modern tables with their high-definition displays and brilliant LED lights are getting the most attention, but there is a breed of pinball enthusiast who not only owns a selection of classic machines but also obsessively maintains and restores them.</p>
<p>These collectors have just as much love for the maze of mechanicals beneath the surface as the trajectories the silver ball follows. The goal isn't high scores; it's keeping ornately complex vintage contraptions looking and playing like new.</p>
<p>That's an extreme challenge given some of those pinball machines date back to the 1940s and '50s, games designed to survive in the field for a year or two before being replaced. Keeping them properly flipping, dinging, and buzzing requires a good knowledge of electronics and a passion for troubleshooting—plus access to a dizzying array of specialized parts.</p>
<p>But one man, Steve Young, not only obsessively collects vintage pinball machines himself but has also acquired the dusty stockrooms and manufacturing components from the since-failed brands that built them. Over the past 50 years, he has built the world's greatest collection of rare parts and schematics that keep this detail-obsessed hobby humming. Along the way, he has also developed a unique way of running the business that has become The Pinball Resource.</p>
<h2>Sourcing the Resource</h2>
<p>Young doesn't really advertise these days, and finding his business, The Pinball Resource, is a little bit tricky. Yes, it's on Google Maps, but when you arrive at the building, you'll find just one small sign in a nondescript complex a few miles outside of Poughkeepsie, New York. It's situated between an auto repair shop and a beauty salon.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>When I finally found the entrance, Young told me he intentionally keeps the signage to a minimum. He doesn't exactly want a lot of visitors.</p>
<p>A casual pinball fan might walk in expecting to see a room full of big-budget, licensed pinball machines, maybe a Jaws game sitting next to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/hands-on-with-the-new-john-wick-pinball/">John Wick</a>, wedged in between any of a half-dozen Marvel-themed games, all blinking and blaring in full attract mode.</p>
<p>But The Pinball Resource doesn't have any of that on display. You're greeted by a couple of tired conference tables and endless filing cabinets. Yes, there are a few pinball machines in the next room, but they're half-covered in paper, serving as de facto cutting surfaces for the reprints of schematics and wiring diagrams duplicated by large-format printers.</p>
<p>Those repurposed machines date from the early 1950s, known as "wood rail" machines thanks to their reliance on maple and the like for much of their construction. Though simple by today's standards, the classic designs of these machines have earned them a legion of ardent fans.</p>
<p>"The art is fantastic," Young said, referencing a game called <em>Knock Out</em>, which dates from 1950. The machine depicts a boxing match, but there's far more fighting happening in the crowd, stylized brawls of all sorts. A clown is being led out on a stretcher. Shake the game too much, and a little speech bubble above his head lights up and says, "Tilt!"</p>

<p>This machine dates from the so-called Golden Age of pinball, each game a certified piece of Americana, most designed and manufactured in Chicago. The origin of pinball itself, though, is rather more exotic.</p>
<h2>A brief history of pinball</h2>
<p>For a game that feels refreshingly simple and two-dimensional compared to the latest <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-ps5-pros-biggest-problem-is-that-the-ps5-is-already-very-good/">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/xbox-series-x-s-review-beautiful-powerful-but-whatcha-gonna-play/">Xbox Series X</a> releases, pinball has a surprisingly tumultuous history, involving everything from organized crime to Supreme Court rulings.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Its roots date back to an 18th-century single-player form of billiards called bagatelle designed to give bored French nobility something to do when the croquet lawn was too soggy for the delicate heels of their buckle shoes. Players hit balls upward on an inclined table, angling shots to land in pockets and earn points.</p>
<p>That humble game (which also spawned pachinko) evolved into something played behind glass, with players launching silver balls with a spring-loaded plunger, nudging the game to get the balls into holes and earn points. Those holes were framed with pins, giving this odd pastime its eventual name.</p>
<p>By the 1930s, Chicago was the global epicenter of pinball. Games popped up in bars and corner stores across the US, gaining some unwanted attention along the way. Some religious leaders claimed pinball was a source of moral corruption, while some police said pinball was part of organized crime rings. It was banned or restricted in many municipalities. New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia's goons dragged hundreds of games out of businesses and smashed them in the streets in the 1940s, creating a sea of broken glass and shattered wood not seen since the prohibition's frothier demolitions a decade earlier.</p>
<p>Despite all that, pinball survived. Manufacturers implemented rule changes to stay within the law, but things really took off after a game called <em>Humpty Dumpty </em>in 1947 made a minor addition that changed everything: the flipper. Chance and skill were now more evenly balanced, and the game's popularity exploded again.</p>
<p>But it still was a game lingering under a shadow of dubious legality. It wasn't until 1976, when pinball guru Roger Sharpe famously called a shot on a machine set up in a New York state courtroom, that pinball was officially designated a game of skill, not chance. This led to most of the restrictions across the country falling. The game entered another wave of popularity, setting the stage for a new generation of machines using modern, solid-state electronics.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It was about this time that something else began: The Pinball Resource.</p>

<h2>Becoming The Resource</h2>
<p>Young's obsession with pinball dates back to the early '70s, when he was a college student at Lehigh University studying metallurgical engineering, a discipline that would eventually lead to a career at IBM. He and his friends became fascinated by the game.</p>
<p>"Being a bunch of engineers and math people and so forth, we got our fingers in there, and if we couldn't fix something, the tech came, and we'd watch him and learn from him," he said.</p>
<p>Eventually, Young and a friend began operating multiple machines, called "running a route" in the industry. "We had, like, 26 games out on campus at Lehigh. So, to maintain that, you've got to have parts." As Young's personal and professional pinball collections grew, so did his collection of parts, which he eventually started selling to others.</p>
<p>"By the time I graduated college, I had probably 30 or 40 games of my own outside of the games we were operating, and then I needed to maintain and fix those. And I kind of just stumbled into doing that, and I started advertising in some of the early magazines," Young said.</p>
<p>He took out an ad in Pinball Trader Newsletter, the biggest publication for the hobby at the time. The magazine's editor, Dennis Dodel, dubbed Young "The Pinball Resource."</p>
<p>"The name stuck," Young said.</p>
<h2>Beneath the glass</h2>
<p>If there's one thing you need to know about pinball machines, it's that they break—a lot. You'd never know it, thanks to the surprisingly effective sound-deadening properties of the glass under which it's played, but a game of pinball is shockingly violent. Each 80-gram silver ball gains remarkable inertia as it catapults from one target to another.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Remove the glass, fire up a game, and you'll quickly be reaching for some hearing protection. It's unpleasant, but playing like this is a good way to appreciate how much of a pounding a pinball machine takes every time you pull that plunger.</p>
<p>Factor into that hundreds of incandescent bulbs slowly baking all the machine's internals, plus grit and debris accumulating in every mechanism as the machine wears, and you have a recipe for something that needs a lot of attention to keep operating.</p>
<p>That violence made for short-lived games. "If you go back in the '50s, I think those games were designed for maybe 18 months on location, then they got traded back in," Young said. "Most big operators expected two or three years out of a game. Factories only supported them for five years."</p>
<p>Where modern, solid-state machines rely on software flashed to embedded systems, running on SoCs smaller than your thumbnail, earlier machines feature a far more convoluted set of mechanisms. These machines, called electromechanical (EM), instead rely on a series of discs and circuits to control the game's logic.</p>
<p>"This is like programming for electromechanical," Young said. "It's like programming a ROM, right? This is what made the game work the way it was supposed to work."</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>

<p>As the player progresses through the game, electric motors turn these wheels from one position to the next, advancing through different rules and bonuses.</p>
<p>Special when lit? Not if the wheel that controls that aspect of the game is missing or broken. But which discs go where, and in what orientation? Each game is a complex logic puzzle of circuits, switches, and relays, all connected through a wiring harness dizzying enough to make a rat seek shelter elsewhere.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Knowing how everything goes together requires extensive documentation and plenty of experience. Over the years, Young has gathered an unprecedented collection of both.</p>
<h2>Keeping hope alive</h2>
<p>Gottlieb is the most historically significant brand in pinball. This is the company that introduced the flipper in 1947 and kept making games through to the mid-'90s. It survived the big pinball downturn in the early '80s brought on by the arrival of arcade video games, but it couldn't weather the next drought.</p>
<p>"There's a cycle of pinball. It's like a seven-year cycle, ups and downs and so forth," Young said. "Peak might have been about 1992 if you look at the number of games produced. It was like 120,000 games." But, from there, Young said, it was a steady decline of roughly 10 percent per year.</p>
<p>"Gottlieb closed in '95, and they moved the parts to their distributorship in New Jersey, with the idea of setting up a parts department," Young said. But, the company quickly changed its mind.</p>
<p>Young eventually bought out Gottlieb's backlog of parts and numerous pieces of manufacturing equipment, operating a revenue share with the company for a time before taking outright control of the inventory. That's how The Pinball Resource became the de facto source for all things Gottlieb, but it wouldn't end there.</p>
<p>"We've picked up all these pieces as the pinball business has shrunk and fallen apart," Young said. "I sat down once with a yellow pad, and I started writing down the number of distributors that I bought their stock, right? And I filled the side of the page and turned the page over before I got done."</p>
<p>Along with the truckloads of parts and specialized equipment have also come stacks and stacks of schematics for all these machines, some bearing hand-drawn corrections penned by long-retired engineers. They all lie stacked and ordered in a series of wide cabinets.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>"This is probably one of the world's largest collections of schematics," Young said. "Every Gottlieb schematic in the world is in that filing cabinet." Schematics from other manufacturers sit nearby, along with endless manuals covering games from many brands and eras. I told him that the 1986 Williams machine <em>High Speed</em> was my favorite. Ten seconds later, he had the original manual in hand.</p>
<p>These manuals tell you which components you need if your machine isn't working, but a part number someone scrawled onto a sheet of draft paper in 1953 won't do you much good if that part went out of production sometime during the Eisenhower administration.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Young has you covered there, too. The Pinball Resource didn't just buy the parts from Gottlieb and others but also used numerous pieces in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Young took me into the storage and manufacturing area within The Pinball Resource, featuring shelf after shelf of parts plus tables covered with specialized machines.</p>
<p>"I have a lot of tooling set up over the world," he said. Rubber rings are a perpetual consumable in pinball machines. The little bumpers that cushion impacts take a beating. The Pinball Resource manufactures its own rings in Taiwan, using tooling acquired from yet another company's bankruptcy. Other parts are manufactured at a facility in pinball's traditional home of Chicago.</p>
<p>One item the company assembles at the company's New York headquarters is called a pop bumper cap, the colorful mushroom-shaped dome that covers the circular bumpers often found in clusters of threes on pinball playfields. There's an endless variety of colors and designs, many featuring custom embossed logos.</p>
<p>Creating these requires a specialized press that drives a heated brass stamp to create the logo, a process called hot stamping. Young has hundreds of these stamps to emboss everything from the American flag to Medusa's head. Some are decades-old originals. Others are modern reproductions he's sourced from artists, each costing upward of $500 to create. Young sells the caps they produce for $5 or $6 each.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Mechanical components receive just as much attention, including presses and punches to create the endless shapes and sizes of electronic switches required to ensure a machine accurately keeps score.</p>
<p>And then there's the coils. Pinball machines rely on small coils of wound copper wire, electromagnets that eject a plunger that pushes or pulls a mechanism to send the silver ball flying in a new direction. Young buys thousands of pounds of copper wire to wind custom coils in numerous sizes, even coming up with custom high-power models to make slow old games faster.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they're too fast. "I have a regular pop bumper coil, and I have a 'hot' pop bumper coil, and the hot one is <i>too</i> hot, okay? So, I'm trying to hone in on what a medium should be," Young said. "Everybody likes a medium, right? So I really want a little warmer pop bumper coil, but not a <i>hot</i> one. I don't want the lights to dim when the bumper pulls in."</p>
<p>Young also refines and improves upon original pinball parts known for failing early and often, subtly adding thickness or reinforcement to ensure that stressed components better survive the rigors of gameplay. "We try to make the part authentic to the original part, or better," he said. "You make the part, you might as well make the part right."</p>
<p>Improvements like these are thanks not only to Young's metallurgical background in the field but also thanks to the feedback he gets courtesy of the uniquely hands-on approach he takes to dealing with customers.</p>

<p>How do you order anything then? Well, you send an email or pick up the phone. Either way, don't be surprised if you hear from Young himself.</p>
<p>"I almost always call in my orders and talk to Steve. It's always informative and interesting. I'll only email an order for mundane supplies," Dave Golden told me. He's a Massachusetts-based pinball enthusiast who not only keeps busy maintaining his own collection of about 30 games but volunteers his time fixing machines at the ElectroMagnetic Pinball Museum in Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Golden estimates he's spent a couple of thousand dollars at The Pinball Resource since his first order in 2018, but plenty of Young's customers spend a lot more.</p>
<p>People like Levi Nayman, who runs <a href="http://www.crazylevipinball.com/">Crazy Levi's Pinball</a>, which restores and sells pinball machines in the metro New York area. He's been a Pinball Resource customer for over 20 years and has lost track of how much he's spent there buying hard-to-find parts. "I really have no idea, probably over $10k but it's not anything I've kept track of," he said.</p>
<p>What keeps Levi coming back? Steve Young. "He's got the stuff, the knowledge, and the personality," he said. "I also get my stuff overnight since it's so close."</p>
<p>Young fields questions from customers like Nayman every day, often firing a question or two right back at them.</p>
<p>Questions like: "Wait, what are you trying to do?"</p>
<p>With a complex system like a pinball machine, sometimes a misfiring coil or a flickering bulb can have a cause that's only tangentially related to the symptom. And so, Young frequently finds himself talking people out of ordering parts they don't need.</p>
<p>"I can't be comfortable taking people's money from lack of knowledge," he said. "I've had to be careful how I can do that because people take offense. 'You won't sell me that? What's the matter?' You know? 'Well, you really don't need it. Do this first.'"</p>

<p>Regardless of which parts you order, you'll of course need to pay for them, and that leads to the final unusual aspect of The Pinball Resource's business model.</p>
<p>"I don't do credit cards. We don't do PayPal," Young said. Venmo, Zelle, and other digital forms of payment also rank on the no-fly list. Young takes checks, money orders, wire transfers, cash, and that's about it. These forms of payment can be slow, but orders don't wait: The Pinball Resource ships most orders before payment is received.</p>
<p>Young likens it to a sit-down restaurant, something that confuses a lot of new customers. "When you place your order, do you have to pay? Or, do you eat the meal first, and then they give you your check, and then you pay?" Young said. "People really appreciate the trust I place in them."</p>
<p>That attitude has earned The Pinball Resource a perfect five-star rating in online reviews from Google to Yelp, plus legions of loyal customers worldwide, each with a shared passion for keeping machines once considered disposable alive for the next generation to enjoy.</p>
<p>And that's what Young is dedicated to doing himself, though lately on a somewhat reduced scale. He's pared his personal collection of games down from over 200 to about 70. "I'm really focused on wood rails, so that kind of ends at 1960. And the more I work on them, the more my attention really narrows in on the span from maybe 1951 to '54 as being the creme de la creme in terms of play and artwork."</p>
<p>There's some interesting irony that a man who came into this hobby through a study of metallurgy prefers games known for their wooden construction, but in the intervening 50 years, Young has helped maintain countless machines of all generations. Given that, I asked him what advice he'd give anyone who's just bought their first machine, that one special game that somehow captured their imagination. I expected a suggestion about online user groups or specific tools worth investing in.</p>
<p>His response was a little different: "Don't turn your back on them," he said. "They multiply when you're not looking."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-cross-9m-capcom-announces.1074738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake has topped another major sales milestone, so it looks like the game is selling solidly.</p>

<p>Back in October, Capcom revealed that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">broken the eight million sales barrier</a>, and now, according to <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1876175498398822673" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a new post</a> on social media platform X, the game has topped nine million sales.</p>

<p>That means that in the intervening months,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>notched up another million sales or so for itself. To celebrate this latest milestone, Capcom also posted a new piece of artwork that depicts many of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s characters enjoying a surprisingly civil meal together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m-artwork.jpg?itok=NeovxWmN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m-artwork.jpg?itok=IwStviWP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s sales milestones are growing increasingly impressive.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that it took&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240313.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">around six or seven months</a> to amass the million sales needed to take it from seven to eight million, this latest milestone is perhaps even more impressive than previous achievements, too.</p>

<p>The remake was originally released in March 2023, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-hit-3-million-in-just-2-days" rel="nofollow">racking up three million sales</a> in the two days following its launch and swiftly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-top-4-million-mercenaries-mode-now-available" rel="nofollow">reaching four million</a> within just a couple of weeks. The game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-reach-5-million-capcom-announces" rel="nofollow">hit five million sales</a> by July that year.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake, it's a reimagining of the influential 2005 action-horror classic, which sees Leon Kennedy descending into a European village in order to rescue Ashley Graham, the US president's daughter, from a sinister cult.</p>

<p>The remake introduces a number of changes and additional elements to the original, including new exploration areas, revamped gameplay that more closely resembles the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3&nbsp;</em>remakes, and more.</p>




<p>Our very own Sam gave&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake an impressive score of 9.5 in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-4-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, praising its "fantastic" gameplay improvements and "beautiful" visuals, among other things.</p>

            <p>The baggiest thing about PS1-harkening <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tyrants-realm">Tyrant’s Realm</a> is the ratty pair of prisoner pants you start out with. Everything else is pleasingly austere. It is, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.</p>

<p>There are a few fancy moves. There’s a parry you’ll never use because it’s too risky, and an execution you can build up a meter for, then trigger the moment an enemy is stunned following the parry you’ll never use. There’s some weapon-arty bits: very slowly applying poison to your sword and getting your face smashed in in the process. A large overhead axe swing, using an axe that appears from nowhere while you’re holding a club. The poison is especially good and PS1-faithful because the target flashes green and goes ‘ugh’ in periodic blips afterward. This stands out as nicely juddery and violent because the action is very smooth otherwise.</p>
<p>But I was mainly drawn to Tyrant’s Realm’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2259260/Tyrants_Realm/">prelude demo</a>’s Steam page’s download button because it looked a bit like Deathtrap Dungeon - the 1998 action adventure based on the Fighting Fantasy CYOA of the same name. I am fairly certain top Soulsboi Miyazaki has mentioned it as an influence, which is a nice bit of continuity, but it's a connection I make here simply for the low fantasy spikeyness and grime of it all. One of the less common uses for PS1 visual aesthetics, that, at least behind retrowave racers and horror games. More spikes, I say. It’s out on the 16th of January.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> Fest 2025 will be held in Paris in June, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> has announced. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go's biggest annual in-person event will kick off in Osaka, Japan from 29th May to 1st June, before a weekend in Jersey City, New Jersey from 6th to 8th June.
</p>
<p>
Paris will then become the latest capital city to host the event's annual European leg from 13th to 15th June. Previous years have seen the event held in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-director-discusses-avatar-backlash-and-a-course-correct-needed-on-the-slowdown-of-new-species">Madrid</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-joys-of-pokemon-go-fest-london">London</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-returns-in-person-after-three-years">Berlin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Full details of the event remain under wraps, as Pokémon Go is still to hold its big spring gathering, Go Tour: Unova, at the beginning of March. Still, for those looking to book travel now, you can now put those summer dates in your diary. 
</p>
<p>
Go Fest typically attracts hundreds of thousands of players to its three live event locations, before a global event is held for all Pokémon Go players. There are no details yet on exactly when that will be. 
</p>
<p>
Last weekend, Pokémon Go began 2025 with its first Community Day - though the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-gos-monthly-community-day-ticket-doubles-in-price">regular event's optional ticket price has now doubled</a>.

            <p>There is not long to go until you can rev your engines once more with an all new Tokyo Xtreme Racer game.</p>
<p>The upcoming release - which will mark the first series title in 18 years - will make its Steam early access debut later this month, on 23rd January. Developer Genki said it will use this early access stint to "utilise player feedback to elevate the game even further".</p>
<p>Early access is expected to last for around four months. Then, of course, the full release will launch. This version will include the remainder of the story, along with additional cars, additional rival characters, and "new features and improvements". Genki added those who plump for the early access version will have access to the full release version upon launch, at the discounted early access price (for now, that price is "TBA", so stay tuned). </p>

			<p>The elevator pitch for Skydance’s Behemoth promises you one thing: huge battles against behemoths. Enemies the size of skyscrapers that you have to dodge, climb, and eventually stab in just the right spot to bring down. It’s Shadow of the Colossus except in VR, with you doing the actual climbing motions yourself. It sounds like a perfect fit, and fighting them is as entertaining as you’d expect… except you only get to get to do so a handful of times. The rest of the game has you&nbsp;fighting human enemies, exploring levels, and solving puzzles, which is a bit less exciting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Skydance's Behemoth - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLjFsZAHuJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’ve played a combat focused VR game before, you’ll have an idea of what to expect from the person to person combat – scabbards on each hip and shoulder allow you to carry and switch between a variety of weapons ranging from standard swords, axes, shields, and bows through to giant, Cloud Strife-sized swords and yet another sword that can be re-summoned after throwing. Make no mistake, you are a very dangerous person in this game and that’s before you take into account the powers that you’ll quickly acquire, such as super strength that, when activated, lets you pick up whole enemies and throw them around, punch through damaged walls, and more.</p>


<p>Clearly the game gives you a lot of tools and you will use them in conjunction with a parry/riposte system to fight your way through levels in search of the behemoth. There’s more than enemies to contend with though, as there’s also the dreaded stamina bar-based climbing which, provided you glance at what you need to do first and keep the pace up, isn’t really an issue. You’ll also quickly find a wrist mounted grappling hook that allows you to pull, swing, and zip up to things, not to mention pulling enemies towards you during combat. It doesn’t take long before you’re doing typical platformer things like grappling between points without landing. Except in VR!</p>


<p>The only problem is that it’s all a bit too easy. The puzzles in particular are very simplistic and feel especially laborious when you’re the actual person dragging giant blocks around. The combat is a bit easy as well, only really raising its difficulty when you reach a boss, whether that’s a beefed up human or behemoth. It doesn’t bother you too much whilst you’re playing, because the moment-to-moment fighting is so much fun, but after a battle it tends to feel like it was over too quickly. Even the enemies with lengthy health bars are a bit too easy once you’ve got a handle on the parry system. Then it’s just a case of working down their health until their helmet pops off so you can stab them in the face. Lovely.</p>
<p>I do enjoy the staging of things throughout – one battle with an archer boss had arrows hit a save point as you’re using it, with a dramatic pause waiting for you to turn around to continue the encounter. It feels like the kind of melodrama you expect in medieval fantasy. Outside of moments like this the story itself isn’t particularly engrossing, but it’s good enough to keep you going at least and the voice acting sells it well enough.</p>

<p>Now we come to the behemoths. Yep, they’re actually that big and they look even bigger in VR, especially when you’re clinging to their ankles. These go too far the other way in terms of difficulty, and I found that there was a bit of trial and error involved in defeating them – obviously error means death. Sometimes it took a while before I noticed a weak point or climbable part, which makes you feel like an idiot when really, you just couldn’t see it from where you were or it wasn’t shining like usual for some reason. Outside of this, though, they’re thrilling. The build up to the behemoths is good as well – one of my favourite moments comes in the run up to the second behemoth, a large bat like creature. It’s hanging in front of you silhouetted so you don’t notice it in the environment until it unfurls its wings and roars before flying upwards through the cavern you’re entering. It’s just great.</p>
<p>The game runs flawlessly on PSVR 2 and looks good, if not great. It controls well enough most of the time, though there can be a bit of awkwardness around sheathing weapons as is typical in VR. Activating the super strength is a bit inconsistent as well – sometimes I thought I had done it but it hadn’t triggered for some reason and others it wouldn’t register me hitting a wall with it activated, which caused it to run out and forced me to wait for the cooldown. I also found that aiming with a bow would sometimes cause the bow to wiggle slightly with the hand tracking, which isn’t great for aiming really.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ultimately Behemoth is a good VR combat game that's a bit too easy, and with its impressively huge boss battles too few in number. Whilst the combat and exploration is enjoyable enough, the puzzling is too simple and, in a game about killing giants, you'd expect there to be a few more giants.	</p></div>

			<p>A The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake powered by Unreal Engine 5 could be in the works, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As spotted by Timur222, a Technical Art Director at Chinese development studio Virtuos Games is listing among the games they have worked on an unannounced Unreal Engine 5 remake in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. While the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda is not mentioned anywhere on the online resume, Virtuos Games has long been rumored to be the developer behind the Oblivion remaster revealed back in September 2023 via some <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">leaked slides</a>, so there's the chance the remaster could actually be a full-blown remake. However, as Virtuos is also the studio behind Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, an Unreal Engine 5-powered remake, there's also the chance the employee simply hasn't updated the resume since the game was officially announced. As such, we have to take this with a grain of salt until this project is officially revealed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="und">Hmmm <a href="https://t.co/KfbZ9EYTIV">pic.twitter.com/KfbZ9EYTIV</a></p>
<p>— Timur222 (@bogorad222) <a href="https://twitter.com/bogorad222/status/1875975208810713172?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>According to the aforementioned leaked slides, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion isn't the only older game developed by Bethesda poised to return to modern hardware, as a Fallout 3 remaster is supposedly in the works as well. Both of these projects have yet to be officially revealed, however, so there's the chance that plans may have been changed since 2022, when the leaked slides were shared with the FTC.</p>
<p>If The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion never gets remade or remastered, however, fans will still be able to experience an updated version of the game with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/">Skyblivion</a> mod. The total conversion project, which will recreate the game in Skyrim, will be released later this year, although it will lack the conversion of the DLC expansions, which will come at a later time.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the second installment in Square’s epic remake trilogy. It’s nearly time for the PC release date of FF7 Rebirth for new users to enjoy a fresh chunk of reimagined RPG gameplay, and the potential impact can only be rivaled by the use of Meteor Materia.</p>



<p>I’ve already said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-deserves-more-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth deserved more love in 2024</a>. Ultimately, it was overshadowed by fascinating new IPs, intricate roguelike card games, and an adorable PlayStation mascot. This doesn’t mean FF7 Rebirth wasn’t a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">success</a> (far from it) as it’s believed Rebirth has sold several million copies to go with its various game of the year awards and nominations.</p>



<p>PlayStation 5 players have had exclusive access to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but PC players are finally set to get their turn to strike.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-release-date">When is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strike down your opponents. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC release date is Jan. 23, 2025</strong>, marking the launch of FF7 Rebirth on only its second platform.</p>



<p>The PC release comes 11 months after the Feb. 29, 2024 debut of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on PlayStation 5. The launch was PS5-exclusive, but as we’ve seen with various PS5-only titles—God of War, Horizon, and Spider-Man—Sony has a habit of timed exclusivity. This means a PC release is always on the cards later down the line, and FF7 Rebirth is the latest addition to the crossover catalog.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s PC release date</a> was confirmed at The Game Awards 2024. The exciting reveal trailer’s climax shows the Jan. 23, 2025 date, but the brief announcement was not the full story here.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-new-features">All Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC New Features</h2>



<p>The “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzWvyncQh8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth PC Announce Trailer</a>” explains the PC port’s litany of upgrades over the original. </p>



<p>You can check out each promised improvement below:</p>



<ul>
<li>DLSS</li>



<li>Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling</li>



<li>Improved Lighting</li>



<li>VRR</li>
</ul>



<p>DLSS stands for <strong>Deep Learning Super Sampling</strong> and is a real-time technique designed to artificially boost the frame rate and upscale the rendered gameplay. <strong>Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling</strong> should help Mt. Corel, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-where-to-go-in-nibelheim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nibelheim</a>, and various biomes to pop in new ways never before seen. </p>



<p><strong>Improved Lighting</strong> allows environments to illuminate naturally and look more engaging and lifelike, whereas VRR means <strong>Variable Refresh Rate</strong> and this modern technical process provides various benefits from smoothing the frame rate to reducing lag and preventing screen tearing.</p>



<p>Additionally, “more” differences are indicated by the trailer, but we need to wait for the official launch to see what other surprises Square Enix has up its sleeve.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 rumor mill has been working at a neck-breaking pace lately. Just yesterday, we got our first proper look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new JoyCon controller</a>, thanks to a leak from China. Fans immediately noticed its much larger shoulder buttons than the original Switch controller, as shown in the comparison picture below.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The comparison between Switch 2 and Switch 1 joy-cons. Look at those massive top buttons! 💙 <a href="https://t.co/jcQel893Bg">pic.twitter.com/jcQel893Bg</a></p>
<p>— Mucrush 🦋 (@Mucrush) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mucrush/status/1875892254189162537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, a new rumor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hue20a/switch_2_shipping_data_indicates_the_joycons_will/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> that the new JoyCons could also be used similarly to PC mice. This stems from shipping data listing component parts as 'mouse soles'. Insider NextHandheld had also previously <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hh6flf/unexthandheld_could_be_hinting_that_the_surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that the controller's laser sensors will allow it to be used that way, as we've already seen with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-handheld-with-amd-ryzen-z1-apus-official-starts-at-e799/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo Legion Go</a> PC handheld. It could definitely be an interesting new approach for Nintendo Switch 2 gaming.</p>
<p>On a completely separate note, insider Nash Weedle has <a href="https://twitter.com/NWeedle/status/1873657637927338043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1873657637927338043%7Ctwgr%5Ebb0b8b52fbe2d6bbc48c4823ef81f0d8f5a12f58%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Frumour-no-mans-sky-to-land-on-nintendo-switch-2-1477163%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> quite clearly that No Man's Sky will be released for Nintendo's new console. This isn't earth-shattering news, as the game is already available on the regular Switch, where it <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-launches-on-nintendo-switch-this-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in October 2022 after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/near-impossible-no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'near-impossible' porting process</a>. The new console is also backward compatible, so the game's compatibility with the system was a given. Weedle probably hints at a new version of No Man's Sky optimized to take advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware improvements; while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-performance-range-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as powerful as Microsoft's Xbox Series S</a>, the upcoming hybrid console is rumored to be around the PlayStation 4 Pro, with certain built-in advantages over Sony's console like NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. As such, No Man's Sky should certainly look and run a lot better on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>At this point, it would be no exaggeration to say that Nintendo fans are nearly frothing in anticipation of the Japanese console manufacturer and game developer/publisher's official announcement. The reveal might come <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as early as this week</a>, so stay tuned.</p>

            <p>Last June, Valve’s trading card game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/artifact">Artifact</a> Classic peaked at 78 players. November was a little rosier for the abandoned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/01/01/12000-people-are-playing-artifact-right-now-and-no-one-knows-why/">who first reported on the phenomena</a>, don’t know. <em>No one knows</em>. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.</p>

<p>This latest 24 peak of 12,500 players echoes a uptick last December of around 14,000, which lasted but a single day. Forbes speculate that the reason is “likely bots” in the absence of any notable community or influencer activity on Twitch, YouTube, or similar. There’s no interest in Artifact’s cards on the Marketplace, say Forbes, so unless Valve is hiding something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-3">Half Life 3 </a>related, there’s no clear reason why this should be happening. Unless…</p>
<p>The game’s subreddit has been doing some theorising of its own, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-dead-tcg-artifact-suddenly-had-12000-players-on-new-years-day-and-the-community-is-baffled">IGN</a>. Is Artifact being used to train AI? Are there <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/comment/m4y3g74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">scammer bots increasing their playtime</a> to build legitimacy for other, nefarious purposes? Could it be pirates using the free-to-play game’s AppID/SDK to mask other games - an honour, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/12k_players_again/">according to one poster</a>, usually reserved for Spacewar?</p><p>Paul Curtin digs into <a href="https://www.githyp.com/piracy-on-steam-may-have-tripled-in-past-2-years-based-on-unexpected-source/">this here</a>, but the basic idea is that pirates will give cracked games the AppID of the game Spacewar, which used to be part of Steamworks’ software dev kit as a testing tool. The pirated game then shows up as Spacewar to Steam, which then does whatever the platform equivalent of a slightly suspicious British Bobby deciding to move along casually twirling their baton and whistling is.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in diving into Artifact’s deflating history, Will Partin’s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/artifact-isnt-a-game-on-steam-its-steam-in-a-game/">brilliant piece</a> for Waypoint remains the definitive chronicle. The game ceased development and went free-to-play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-have-stopped-working-on-artifact-20-and-so-theyve-made-the-game-free">back in 2021</a>, with Valve saying “we haven't managed to get the active player numbers to a level that justifies further development at this time."</p>
<p>Valve’s newest multiplayer offering is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, which Matt Cox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fiddly-parkour-is-the-secret-sauce-that-makes-every-moment-of-deadlock-compelling">wrote about here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mojang continues to work on the eternally popular Minecraft, of course, putting out multiple updates each year across all the platforms the sandbox game is available on. Minecraft is officially the best-selling video game of all time, with an incredible 300 million copies sold. Microsoft has made no indication that it intends to release a Minecraft 2, which comes as no surprise given how popular Minecraft remains. Perhaps that leaves the door open for Notch to fill a gap from the original creator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Notch noted himself, it remains to be seen whether this ‘Minecraft 2’ ever sees the light of day. Since selling to Microsoft, the Swedish developer has started and stopped a number of games, including space sandbox game 0x10c (pronounced "Ten to the C”). However, in another tweet, Notch said the odds of him finishing projects now are higher than they were because he has employees he feels responsible for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In later tweets, Notch answered questions from followers on social media about this Minecraft 2, and insisted he doesn’t want to use anything “too similar to the stuff I sold,” in this new game. He also said his Minecraft 2 wouldn’t be a story game, suggesting a new sandbox of some kind. “I'd make a similar game [to Minecraft] based on what I think the audience that says they want that game might enjoy,” he explained. “Probably do early access to make sure we're on track.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I mean best I've got at the moment is Adventureland, so yeah no idea</p>— notch (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1875234889773261240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Notch even went on to <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875244214272893244" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">say</a> that if Minecraft ever wanted him to make an official Minecraft 2 and both parties agreed on terms, “I'd absolutely be willing to to that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'd even give them a much bigger share than I'd feel obliged to just to make it clear I'm not doing it with ill intent,” he continued, before adding: “But I'll be a bitch to work with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems unlikely that Microsoft would work with Notch, given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/28/new-minecraft-update-removes-mentions-of-notch">it removed his name from the opening credits of Minecraft</a> following various controversial statements he made in the years following the sale of Mojang.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Yui Mok/PA Images via Getty Images,</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>If you are one of the many who play Wordle every day (I still like to use it to flex the ol' mental muscles with my morning cup of tea), you may well be interested to discover the one word in 2024 that stumped so many of us, it broke a whopping 5.6m streaks.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/news/new-york-times-top-wordle-connections-2024-rcna185738">Today</a>, editorial director of NYT Games Everdeen Mason revealed that 11.1bn puzzles were solved via the New York Times in 2024. Of those, Wordle accounted for 5.3bn plays.</p>

<p>The most played day for the New York Times' Wordle puzzle was 23rd April, when the word was Rover. But the word that left the most players scratching their heads arrived later in the year, on 15th October. That word was Corer. Like I said, this chap caused 5.6m Wordle streaks to come to an end.</p><p>In addition to sharing these little titbits, Mason revealed 2.8 million of us are creatures of habit and routine, and use the same starting word every day. As Eurogamer reported previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wordle-now-has-an-in-app-bot-to-analyse-how-good-your-guesses-are">the most popular starting word for Wordle is Adieu</a>, which is actually what my mother uses (for general interest, I always start with Ouija. My sister-in-law starts with Ocean).</p>
<p>I also learned a few weeks ago that Epona - Link's wonderful horse from the Legend of Zelda series - can not be used as a guess. I was quite upset by this, and took a screenshot to document this sad moment (and now, finally, I have somewhere to share it - so, hurrah!).</p>

<p>Along with Wordle, other New York Times puzzles also remain popular. In 2024, the Mini Crossword and Strands accounted for 2.1bn and 1.3bn plays respectively. I recently discovered Strands - which is a kind of themed word search - along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-responds-to-only-connect-resemblance">Only Connect clone Connections</a>, and have added these to my daily puzzle time. Anyone else?</p>

            <p>The Sonic film franchise has now surpassed $1bn at the global box office, following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> prior to Christmas.</p>
<p>The latest film earned over $187m in the US, for a worldwide total of $336.3m. It debuted globally with $211.5m in its first week.</p>
<p>The previous two films collectively grossed $725.2m globally, following releases in 2020 and 2022 respectively. In addition, they generated $181m in consumer spending on home rentals and purchases, while the Knuckles TV spin-off on Paramount+ was the number one Kids and Family series ever on the platform with 11m global hours watched in its first 28 days of streaming.</p>

<p>Sonic 3 has certainly been a success, then, earning franchise-best critics ratings, aided by the inclusion of Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>"We are so overjoyed with the amazing response to the Sonic the Hedgehog films from audiences and fans around the world and are proud to be part of the incredible, world-class filmmaking team that has come together to build this franchise," producers Neal H Moritz and Toby Ascher said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>"We make these movies for the fans; and their passion, support and love for these characters is what drives us every day to continue creating the fast, funny and action-packed stories that make up the ever-expanding Sonic Universe."</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-30-to-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we approach the midway point of our Most Wanted Games of 2025 list, there’s a suitably odd mish-mash of genres, new and old IP, and styles of game. From the turn-based RPG of Clair Obscur, to Borderlands 4’s looter shooter, and then onward to the Telltale successor studio’s superhero-infused Dispatch, there’s some great variety here.</p>
<h2>30 – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p>JRPGs are in a really good place right now, but who says you have to be a Japanese studio or developer to make a game in this style? French studio Sandfall Interactive has taken inspiration from this subgenre, belndingit with a Belle Epoque France fantasy world to create the turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dLBUD08_3A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Poignant and painterly</a>, as I described it for our Gamescom preview, the game sees you follow yet another doomed expedition as they venture out to try and stop the Paintress from literally just ending the lives of people of a certain age. It will lean in on the tried and true turn-based RPG combat, with a few invigorating twists mixed in, such as an active QTE element and Persona-like menus fanning out from characters. This could be a real treat for fans of the genre.</p>

<h2>29 – Borderlands 4</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the planet Kairos, a world that’s dominated by a ruthless dictator known as the Timekeeper, with an army of synthetic followers known as the Order. You, of course, will play as a Vault Hunter searching for mythical alien treasures in a race against time against the Timekeeper to uncover it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official First Look" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26vY2GMfYTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You pretty much know what to expect from Borderlands 4, with the procedurally generated loot pushing you on through each battle and mission, and a humour-filled script that will thankfully tone down the toilet humour of Borderlands 3. We’re yet to really be introduced to the Vault Hunters that will lead this adventure, but the gameplay first look showed an impressive sense of scale and slick snippets of action.</p>
<h2>28 – Dispatch</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – 2025</em></p>
<p>Coming from the minds behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>, and with a cast that features Aaron Paul, Laura Bailey and Jeffrey Wright, Dispatch is a narrative adventure that’s well worth paying attention to.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DISPATCH | Official Reveal Trailer - Extended Cut (HD)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbERWU5bc50?feature=oembed" width="780" height="439" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Casting you as a de-suited Robert Roberston, formerly known as Mecha Man, this is a superhero workplace comedy that sees him adapt to life without powers. He still has a role to play in the community, but as a part of the dispatch centre team, charged with rehabilitating ex-supervillains as they go straight. Between the narrative moments, you’ll also have to manage those heroes, sending them out to answer calls, managing their particular skills and helping to unlock their full potential.</p>
<h2>27 – Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>The early 2000s and PS2 era is proving to be a fertile source for modern remakes, and Konami is the latest to try to get in on the action with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Having been rumoured for years, this MGS3 remake was confirmed back in 2023, with 2024 giving us a couple of additional glimpses of cutscenes and story.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - Official Trailer #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sk6VdMoAgTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Very little is really known about the remake, how much the gameplay is being tweaked and modernised, but you can see from the cutscene-heavy trailers that the game does look pretty fab with Unreal Engine 5 powering it, and they’ve kept a lot of that Kojima tone.</p>
<h2>26 – The Sinking City 2</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</p>
<p>After all the trials and tribulations that Frogwares went through with the first game, it’s great to see The Sinking City 2 coming from Frogwares. This one’s a little bit different, though, with the team diving in on a full horror experience.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Sinking City 2 | World Premiere Trailer (PC, PS5, Xbox Series)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLIOZg9NzUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Taking us to 1920s Arkham – the Lovecraft one, not the Batman one – there’s still plenty of cosmic horror here, and you’re still trawling through a flooded city, but the detective elements of the first game have been toned down a lot. Combat and exploration will be the main focus now, the city and world you can explore will be smaller, and the team is aiming to have a much stronger visual horror as well.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we’ve heard an update on this one – Frogwares has its roots as a Ukrainian studio, so there’s some real hardships that they’ve faced this past few years – but we hope to hear and see more on this soon if they’re to hit their 2025 release target.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-9-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Japanese publisher and developer CAPCOM <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1876175498398822673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Resident Evil 4 remake has sold over nine million units since its debut in late March 2023. It is no doubt a remarkable result, especially when considering that the game is essentially the same as the 2005 classic from a content standpoint.</p>
<p>The first three million units <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-surpass-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were sold</a>&nbsp;<span>just two days after launch. The fourth million mark&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was passed</a>&nbsp;in early April 2023, while the fifth&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was reached</a> in late July 2023. CAPCOM provided the next sales update around the game's first anniversary, when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-over-7-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that&nbsp;</span>the Resident Evil 4 remake had sold over seven million copies.</p>
<p>The game was well received overall by critics, too, though our own Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't quite love it</a> (but still gave it an 8.5 out of 10):</p>
<p><em>Now, I have to say, while the tone of the last few paragraphs has been a bit negative, whether we’re talking about the original or the remake, Resident Evil 4 is still a very good game. I may be a bit disappointed by the scope and ambition of Capcom’s reimagining, but RE4 is still one of the most inventive and engaging action-horror games ever made, and this is a competent, technically-impressive new version of the game. The village battle may be largely the same, but it still gets your blood pumping. Same goes for the cabin defense sequence, your showdown with the village chief, or your first encounter with a Regenerator. The Resident Evil 4 remake is still a fun, bombastic dose of mayhem, I just feel like it had the potential to be even better. It also suffers from the fact that Resident Evil Village was, in some ways, the bigger, crazier take on RE4 that this remake could have been.</em></p>
<p>2025 might be a big year for the franchise, at least when it comes to announcements. Resident Evil 9 is expected to be unveiled, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rumor-resident-evil-9-reportedly-launching-in-second-half-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially with a late 2025 launch window</a>, and there are already rumors that the atmosphere will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired by Resident Evil 4</a> while also having two 'unkillable stalkers' possibly inspired by Resident Evil 3's Nemesis. The playable characters are rumored to be two of the most iconic protagonists in the series: Jill Valentine (Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 3, Resident Evil 5) and Leon Kennedy (Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 6).</p>
