There’s a rugged game of Connections waiting for you today. If you’re a foodie or a gamer, you’ll think you’ve got it all figured out, but then … Maybe not.

<p>CTO Hunter Bridges announced the redundancies on X/Twitter, saying, "this isn't a choice we wanted to make", but "due to volatile market conditions in the games industry and operational realities of our business, Evening Star is having to part ways with six team members".</p>

<p>"This is a post that I was hoping to not have to write, but Evening Star has been swept up in the same turbulence that has affected so many of our peers in the games industry for the last year and a half," added CEO Dave Padilla on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thedavepadilla_this-was-a-post-that-i-was-hoping-to-not-activity-7240439416752594944-FW_i/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>"Despite our best efforts to secure another project to keep our team together, we are in the unfortunate situation of having to lay off some of the folks that have worked with us for the last few years on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pennys-big-breakaway-review">Penny's Big Breakaway</a>. If you have room on your project for some best in class developers who shipped a critically beloved console title, then look no further than these amazing game devs."</p>

<p>"I cannot stress enough how amazing they all were to work with, how talented they are in their respective disciplines, and how lucky any team would be to have them on their project. Please don't hesitate to reach out if there are any opportunities that you would like to share with these folks, or if you would like a reference for them."</p>
<p>For those keeping track, with one quarter still to go, 2024 has seen almost 13,000 developers and publishers lose their jobs. Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">Microsoft laid off a further 650 Xbox staff on Thursday</a>, though no games have been cancelled or studios have been closed this time.</p>
<p>The layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">follow the 1900 people who lost their jobs at the company in January</a> this year.

			<p>The long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of the PS5 Pro proved to be highly controversial due to Sony's pricing choice. Whereas the PS4 Pro launched at the same price as the base PS4 ($399), the PS5 Pro is $300 pricier than the base PS5, surprising fans and analysts alike (although the latter group still <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believes</a> it'll sell as well as the PS4 Pro in the end).</p>
<p>Some gamers have started wondering if they wouldn't be better off simply buying a brand-new PC. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3zS2aUa3qQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a>, though, Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter said a PC with similar capabilities would probably cost 'a fair bit more'. He also compared the PS5 Pro GPU to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070.</p>
<p><em>Probably a fair bit more. I mean, for the GPU you're going to need, if you consider the holistic view of all of the different components, the enhanced ray tracing (no AMD GPU has that at the moment), the machine learning block (no AMD GPU has that), it's almost like essentially an NVIDIA style feature set but made by AMD, and the closest equivalent GPU you'll be looking at would be the RTX 4070. The RTX 4060 is quite close to the base PlayStation 5 (factoring out machine learning and ray tracing), so you're looking at a 4070. I looked on Amazon yesterday and the cheapest one of those is $540. Beyond that, you've got to get a CPU, a motherboard, memory, power supply, case, and 2 TB SSD, so the costs are going to ramp up.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Then you have your mitigating factors, which is that you aren't paying however many dollars per year for the glorious honor of being able to play online and have cloud saves, so you've got to kind of amortize costs over the year to get a proper idea of what the actual comparison is. I do think maybe though we might be slightly missing the point because if you consider what the PS5 Pro is, it's a machine that's designed - I don't think it's for new owners, it's for people that have got a PlayStation 5 but they've got the disposable income to have a better PlayStation 5, and I think that these guys are going to have an existing library of PS4 and PS5 titles and to make the jump out of the PlayStation ecosystem and into the PC ecosystem then you've got to leave those titles behind your entire library that you might have amassed over, like, 10 years.</em></p>
<p>The latter point made by Leadbetter is particularly relevant, I believe. Sony isn't trying to get PC gamers to abandon their beloved platform for a new PlayStation console—it is mostly asking existing PlayStation fans to upgrade to a better, faster version of the PS5. Whether they will manage to achieve the same level of success as the PS4 Pro (which sold around 20% of the total PS4 units) despite the high price remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>Nearly a decade after its first announcement, Ubisoft's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a> movie has finally finished filming.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-years-in-development-hell-ubisofts-watch-dogs-movie-finally-begins-shooting">The commencement of filming back in July</a> was revealed with a set photo with the caption: "Lights_Camera_Action.exe".</p>
<p>The end was celebrated in a similar way, only this time the set photo was accompanied by the text: "run film_wrapped.exe(#watchdogsmovie.mp4) … &gt;Filming complete!"</p>

<p>As Tom summarised for us when filming kicked off in the summer, Ubisoft has kept details of the film's plot close to its chest, and for years there was little movement on its plans to adapt its hacking-focused high-tech open-world franchise for the big screen.</p>
<p>But, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-watch-dogs-is-the-latest-game-series-to-get-the-live-action-movie-treatment">things appeared to finally get moving with a report via Deadline</a> that the project would be helmed by director Mathieu Turi (currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-plague-tale-is-being-turned-into-a-tv-series">adapting A Plague Tale for television</a>), working from a screenplay by Christie LeBlanc - the writer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s 2021 French sci-fi thriller Oxygen. It's thought to star Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde and Hunger Games prequel movie star Tom Blyth.</p> <div>

<p>It's unclear whether this Watch Dogs film will be an original tale or based on any of the three main Watch Dogs games released so far: the gritty Chicago-set original starring gruff hacker Aiden Pearce, the sunnier San Francisco-set sequel starring the youthful Marcus Holloway, or the grim post-Brexit London-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs Legion</a>, launched in 2020.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>So… the PS5 Pro became a thing this week, and I think the reaction to it has been pretty unanimous. We’ve got a couple months before its launch in November, at which point it will be fascinating to see how it sells. As with so many things on the internet, a blend of echo chambers and angry vocal minorities can really skew the reality of a situation, so Sony will be optimistic that it sells just as well as the PS4 Pro – reportedly around 15 million units through its lifespan.</p>
<p>That’s the biggest headline, but what else has happened this week in gaming?</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Now then, what have you all been playing?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> has been lured in to grab Astro Bot at launch price by all the rave reviews it’s had. He’s also been playing 60 Parsecs, and enjoying it even more than 60 Seconds, and chipping away at odds and ends in Dreams.</li>
<li><strong>MrYd’s</strong> added Lego Star Wars to his playlist, but strangely chose to start with Episode 1. He’s also been lugging around Sir Ian Livingstone’s book and dealing with signed art prints.</li>
<li><strong>Andrewww’s</strong> really doubting that he’ll manage to finish Horizon: Forbidden West before it leaves PS Plus next Tuesday, especially with little gaming time this weekend. Still, he thinks it’s “an excellent game with very good quest stories.”</li>

<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>

			<p>A Bloodborne fan-made remaster is currently in the works, and the modder behind the project showcased its current state in a new video.</p>
<p>Modder fromsoftserve already released a few mods that brought noticeable visual improvements to the game but has recently decided to merge some of their modding efforts into a bigger project that promises to bring even more visual improvements to the game, such as better <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-dynamic-shadows/">dynamic shadows</a>, a sky rework to make it better match the environment, improved textures and more. Needless to say, even in its current state, the project looks extremely promising.</p>
<p><iframe title="I'm remastering Bloodborne (kinda). Let's talk about it." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYDsYNBiaAM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fromsoftserve isn't the only modder who's working on Bloodborne, as the emulation improvements achieved by the shadPS4 emulator in the past few weeks have reignited interest in the PlayStation 4 exclusive. A Temporal AA mod was released on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/58" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> earlier this week, introducing better anti-aliasing to the game, although with a performance cost. A mod removing <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/56" target="_blank" rel="noopener">character light</a> was also released online recently, a small change that still brings some noticeable visual improvements.</p>
<p>While modders are hard at work to improve Bloodborne and create that remaster that Sony doesn't seem to be interested in releasing, the latest developments of the shadPS4 emulators are improving emulation considerably. You can check how much emulation has been improved in the past few days in the video by BrutalSam below.</p>
<p><iframe title="ShadPS4 Bloodborne Progress" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bRrQfRR9a_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bloodborne on PC is being made possible by the aforementioned shadPS4 emulator. You can learn more about it on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

		<p>Would-be Hobbits around the world have some bad news to handle this week, as Private Division and developer Weta Workshop have announced a delay for their life sim Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game. Previously expected to release in late 2024, it’s now been shuffled back to early 2025.</p>
<p>Tales of the Shire is in development for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, Nintendo Switch and PC, and we’ll get our next look at the game during A Hobbit Day Showcase on 22nd September.</p>


<p><a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1834336184639820240/photo/1">The team’s statement</a> reads:</p>
<p><em>“All of us here at Weta Workshop are excited to have you join us in the Shire, a peaceful corner of J.R.R. Tolkien’s world. When a new Hobbit steps into Bywater for the very first time, we want that moment to be everything you’re hoping for. </em></p>
<p><em>“To ensure we deliver that vision, Tales of the Shire will now be launching early 2025. </em></p>

<p><em>“Thank you for your patience and continued support. Be sure to tune in to our A Hobbit Day Showcase on September 22nd to learn more about Tales of the Shire and our new release date.”</em></p>
<p>As you’d expect from a life sim, this will all be about living out a day-to-day life as a Hobbit. Players will be able to fully customise their own Hobbit in Tales of the Shire, and be able to furnish their Hobbit homes in various ways. Stepping out into Bywater, players will be able to help the other residents with tasks, go foraging, cook, and do some gardening too. The key part is just living a comfortable life and making friends with those around you. Lovely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-is-currently-thinking-whether-to-switch-to-free-to-play-model/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Palworld was the first and (so far) biggest surprise hit of 2024. Launched in early access on PC and Xbox on January 19, the game developed by Pocketpair went on to break several <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-sold-3-million-units-in-40-hours-broke-1-million-concurrent-users-on-steam-surpassing-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales records</a>; in just a month, Palworld had sold 15 million copies on Steam alone and also had around 10 million players on Xbox (though the game is included with the Game Pass subscription there).</p>
<p>However, these incredible figures suddenly slowed down. Nowadays, the game is played by around 25-30K concurrent players on Steam, down from the massive peak of 2.1 million players registered at launch. Pocketpair is working on improving the game to renew the interest of players, as well as potentially <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-nintendo-switch-technical-limitations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing</a> it on other platforms.</p>
<p><span>In an interview with the Japanese website&nbsp;<a href="https://ascii.jp/elem/000/004/220/4220741/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASCII</a>, Pocketpair CEO and producer Takuro Mizobe revealed that the team currently faces the difficult choice of switching to a free-to-play model, which he believes is the only way to make a true live service game.</span></p>
<p><em>We will of course add so-called general content. For example, we will create a new map and introduce new Pals there. Also, for example, we will introduce raid bosses so that everyone can fight, but for the future of Palworld, there are two options that are really important directions. That is, to evolve it into a package game type or to evolve it into a Live Ops game. From the perspective of business opportunities, originally making it a live game as a managed game would stabilize profitability and extend the life of the game itself, but Palworld was not designed from the beginning with that in mind, so there are many difficulties in making it a live game.</em></p>
<p><em>And the most important thing is whether the players want it or not. As a prelude to a live game, it needs to be a F2P (free-to-play) game. It is common for managed games to make it a F2P game and then add paid elements such as skins and battle passes, but Palworld is a one-time purchase game, so it is difficult to turn it into a live game from the ground up. </em><em>At the moment, we are exploring how to attract more players while still cherishing existing players. There are several successful examples of games that have shifted from pay-to-download games to F2P midway through. In that case, they often give guaranteed items or items worth the amount of money. "PUBG" and "Fall Guys" are successful examples, but both took several years to shift.</em></p>
<p>What do you think? Should Pocketpair turn Palworld into a free-to-play game to increase revenue and improve its ability to deliver new content for players?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valkyrae-jason-momoa-comments/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valkyrae-accuses-jason-momoa-of-%E2%80%98mistreating%E2%80%99-crew-on-minecraft-movie.980931/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valkyrae-jason-momoa-comments/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rachell Marie Hofstetter, who is much better known as ‘Valkyrae’, recently made a damning claim about Jason Momoa. While appearing in a YouTube video with FaZe Clan, she mentioned that Jason Momoa contributed to her ‘worst celebrity experience’ when she appeared on set for a cameo in the upcoming Minecraft movie. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-pretty-disappointing">‘It Was Pretty Disappointing’</h2>



<p>Valkyrae recently sat down with FaZe Clan during a bit that resembles the iconic ‘Hot Ones’ series. As she chatted with ‘Jasontheween’, she was asked about her ‘worst celebrity or streamer experience’, to which she revealed she has a cameo in the Minecraft movie that’s being released next April.</p>



<p>She then mentioned that while on set, she caught Jason Momoa berating crew members, which set her on edge and now stands as her ‘worst celebrity experience’ ever:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Minecraft movie, I have a cameo. I would have to say Jason Momoa. I just saw him like, mistreat some of the crew, and it was pretty disappointing. It was after a very intense and emotional scene and maybe he was still in character, I don’t know. I was just surprised about how he treated some of the crew.</p>



<p>He was just really mad at them that they weren’t doing something right in setting up the shot and stuff. He was just angry, really mad, and yelling. I was like, this is not a good working environment, I would not be happy working under these conditions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full clip from Twitter:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Last year, Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/aquaman-2-jason-momoa-drunk-claims-amber-heard-cut-scenes-elon-musk-letter-1235747775/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published a report</a> claiming that Jason Momoa would appear drunk on set, so this isn’t the actor’s first brush with some bad press. Back in 2017, a ‘rape joke’ he made in 2011 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/12/jason-momoa-game-of-thrones-raping-beautiful-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was dug up and spread</a> around online.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts about Valkyrae’s comments? Are they justified, or is Momoa the victim of a stressful work environment himself?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Nearly 10 years ago, former Need for Speed developer Ghost Games copped a kicking for making its 2015 series reboot online-only, even in single player. In response, its 2019 follow-up Need for Speed Heat did <em>not</em> require a persistent online connection. Earlier this year, Ubisoft decommissioned The Crew, making it impossible for owners to play from now on – even by themselves. The move wasn’t received well. <em>This very week</em> Ubisoft has confirmed The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest will now get offline modes. In contrast to these course corrections, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown arrives in 2024 as another online-only racing game that seems to have little interest in being something that’s satisfying to play solo. It’s a baffling start and, despite a nice handling model and a lot of effort on display in its unique open world, it unfortunately doesn’t get any better.</p><p>The original Test Drive Unlimited was a pioneer of MMO, open world racing. It was <em>the</em> pioneer, really, and remarkably ahead of its time. However, despite being fondly remembered for its trendsetting online philosophy, 2006’s Test Drive Unlimited still had a dedicated single-player mode (one that remains accessible and playable offline today). It simply layered its multiplayer mode over the top of it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>The always-online Solar Crown is not built like this, and it’s infinitely poorer for it. There <em>are</em> AI opponents, but there’s no dedicated single-player mode to speak of – just a map full of events that other players may or may not hop into at the same time as you. During my time with it, prior to the standard edition release date, another player joining my race has actually been an extremely rare occurrence. But the threat of it is always there, because there’s no way to opt out.</p><p>This puts Solar Crown in a very weird place. It means that, even though my experience has almost exclusively been competing solo against the AI, I’m still burdened by all the foibles of online racing. This means lobby countdowns I can’t fully skip before starting a race, even though I don’t <em>want</em> to wait for anyone else and wish to start by myself. It means races I can’t even pause, which is an absurd problem to have when playing entirely against AI – and totally contemptuous of parents and anybody else with the audacity to ever need to… stop what they’re doing for a moment. It also means races don’t even have a simple, quick restart option; to restart you need to abandon the race entirely, re-enter the event, and sit through the same lobby period. Even when you’re the only human in an event, if there’s a connectivity issue during your race, you’ll be kicked out. If there’s a problem in free roam, you’ll be kicked out to the menu screen. Hell, if there’s some sort of server maintenance or technical snag when you boot up, you won’t be able to play at all. In my most recent session I haven’t been able to play for more than a few minutes at a time before being kicked out. Every online-only requirement feels like a punishment for playing it by yourself. You don’t want to play with other people? Too bad, you’re online anyway.</p><h2><strong>Turn That Crown Upside Down</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, the racing itself is not strong enough to make these online quality-of-life sacrifices worthwhile. At its best, on Solar Crown’s most well-plotted race routes, the racing is… fine. At its worst, however, it’s tedious and unsatisfying. The AI opponents are a constant sore point, and they undermine the experience by being rubbish in some conditions and supernaturally gifted in others. Solar Crown features a handful of named difficulty levels for its AI opponents but, unlike other racing games, it does <em>not</em> let us manually select their strength. This means Solar Crown automatically bumps up the difficulty as we progress. The spike, however, from ‘Experienced’ to ‘Expert’ is hideously ill executed – so your reward for good performances against the ‘Experienced’ opposition is simply a bad time.</p><p>Now, I should stress that you don’t <em>actually</em> need to win, or even podium, in Solar Crown’s races to earn credits; a better finishing position just results in a little extra gravy on top of a base payment for completing the race. There is, however, a list of secondary objectives that regularly <em>do</em> require you to be at the pointy end in specific events. This can be daunting against rival racers who – on some courses – will simply gallop away from you in cars that ostensibly have the same performance level as yours, recording race times that can be faster than the <em>quickest human players on the current global leaderboards</em>.</p><p>This is a ridiculous problem to have, and it’s one you can’t solve by simply opting out of the Expert AI setting. Again, we don’t actually have the ability to adjust it. It’s also not as straightforward as selling a car you’ve discovered is uncompetitive in the current class you’re grinding through and buying something that seems quicker, because you can’t sell cars. If you’ve just dropped a ton of credits on something that’s not working out, it’s back to the grind until you can amass enough to try again. It’s set to be quite a grind, too; some of Solar Crown’s hypercars are priced at over <em>10 million credits</em>, whereas a typical win only nets you around 20- to 30-odd thousand. There are no driving missions here like in the old TDU games; it’s just basic racing, repeated. As far as I’m concerned, if a game starts to feel like a job, something is amiss with the pace of progression.</p><p>At any rate, the only solution is to <em>complete and lose races</em>, and wait until the automated difficulty decides to do you a favour and bump things down a notch – to a place where the AI racers <em>aren’t</em> capable of driving faster than the entire player base. This is a total waste of time, but it gets worse. After being stalled chasing the objective on one particular race, Solar Crown started slashing my payouts and XP for subsequent attempts. By the time I eventually completed the goal, the credits and XP had been cut to a pittance and were virtually worthless. Several days later I noticed the payouts had returned to normal, but nothing about an apparent cooldown period on rewards is communicated to us in-game. Why are we being strung along with come-back-later mechanics like mobile gamers? Solar Crown just doesn’t feel like it respects your time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The racing isn’t unsatisfying because it’s <em>tough</em>; it’s unsatisfying because it’s inconsistent, and it often feels like the AI is cheating.</p></div><p>At the other end of the spectrum, in wet weather conditions, off road, and on certain circuits, AI opponents can be counted on to be much weaker. The counter intuitive thing here, however, is that these instances of slow or boneheaded AI tended to arrive as moments of relief – especially in the wake of a race I’d lost by, say, <em>not being the single fastest person on the planet</em>.</p><p>To clarify, the racing isn’t unsatisfying because it’s <em>tough</em>; it’s unsatisfying because it’s inconsistent, and it often feels like the AI is cheating. There’s nothing fun about sinking a huge amount of credits into a car to put it at the top of a performance window and having it totally unable to compete against opponents at the exact same level. It’s even worse when cars with <em>lower</em> performance ratings are gapping you on straights. There are clearly strings being pulled to make this happen, and that’s just cheap.</p><p>Is it better against humans? I can’t issue a verdict on that. While special edition Solar Crown buyers have been playing since last week, I’m really not encountering anybody. Only once have I started a race and been grouped with someone else apparently starting the same race a few seconds later. If anything, the racing was <em>worse</em>; the AI bots that filled the remaining six slots in this case seemed twitchier, heavier, and drove like I wasn’t there. But beyond that, nada. There are dedicated ranked races on the map, but they don’t appear to be attracting anyone yet. I’ve sat in the lobbies for those and have seen no one join me. While other racing games will pool interested players into quick races, Solar Crown seems like it’s relying entirely on people just… deciding to trigger the same race at the same time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Stressed Drive</strong></h2><p>Levelling up will eventually unlock new tyre compounds and pre-set driving modes that let us eek some more speed out of our cars, but there’s so much contradictory information in these options it’s hard to know what will ultimately help. At level 30, I decided to purchase a Nissan GT-R and scanned the driving modes before my first event. Dynamic mode, which claims to boost acceleration, only <em>lowered</em> my acceleration stat. Sport mode, which Solar Crown reports <em>will</em> lower my acceleration, actually <em>raised</em> it. So what do I go with? What’s going to help? Well, it’s slower than the rest of the field in either configuration, so who can say? It’s a mess.</p><p>The annoyances continue. The world is particularly handsome at night in the neon bathed streets, but there are sections that suffer reproducible pop-in, or objects cars can clip through. When on foot, button prompts disappear the instant you run too close to the door you want to open or person you want to speak to. You can’t easily invert the camera – you have to manually remap the controls for forward and back on the stick. Locations I’ve already discovered and have unlocked fast travel to are becoming unavailable. I can no longer use them for fast travel, despite the roads around them <em>clearly</em> indicating I’ve been to them before (and Solar Crown ultimately knowing I’ve been there before, because it won’t re-reward XP for “re-discovering” them). Driving to places I’ve already unlocked is more wasted time, so it’s a bug a game that’s already filled with time-sucking, always-online caveats and non-adjustable difficulty settings definitely didn’t need. On top of that, roads driven on during races don’t actually count as driven on in your game; you have to drive over them in free-roam to add them to your tally. Is this intentional, or just another bug? Hard to say, but either way it’s more double handling.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are a lot of things I enjoy about Solar Crown’s Hong Kong, but it lacks atmosphere overall.</p></div><p>It may sound by now that Solar Crown really gets nothing right, but that isn’t true. Crucially, it boasts a predictable and approachable handling model that’s easy to get to grips with. It’s arguably a little understeery, and the drastic speed reduction from hitting roadside destructables feels too heavy-handed for an arcade racer, but it drives quite well and is definitely a step up from the divisive feel of Test Drive Unlimited 2.</p><p>There are also a lot of things I enjoy about Solar Crown’s Hong Kong map. There’s a good mix of variety in terms of road width, from extremely narrow one-way alleys and accessways, to snaking hillside roads reminiscent of KT Racing’s own WRC games, to wide freeways and tunnels. There’s an eye-catching level of complexity to Solar Crown’s on- and off-ramps, and I really love the look of the many underground, polished-concrete parking garages that lurk everywhere under the city – complete with working boom gates.</p><p>Unfortunately, it lacks much in the way of atmosphere overall, and this version of Hong Kong certainly doesn’t feel like a living city in the same way it does in the likes of Sleeping Dogs. Sure, it’s an adjacent genre and the driving physics in Sleeping Dogs are sloppier than a soup sandwich, but it stands up as a world. In Solar Crown, people are rare and the futuristic augmented reality overlays are an eyesore. Virtual parking lane notifications are constant, ugly screen clutter, and the giant, identical AR lettering over key locations just makes everything feel the same. Of course, when you do enter dealerships – with their enormous layouts and sparse arrangements of cars – it’s evident they all look the same inside, anyway. They look nothing like the convincing dealerships in TDU1 and TDU2.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>The Best Racing Games Ever</h3><p>Tuna, no crust. </p></div><p>On top of that, traffic is light and doesn’t ever seem very authentic; too many of the NPC vehicles are just the same small handful of cars from Solar Crown’s drivable garage, so there’s no authentic variety.</p><p>The car selection is a letdown, both compared to its current peers and the original Test Drive Unlimited games. In 2006’s Test Drive Unlimited, for instance, a majority of the cars featured were current models released within a few years of its arrival. Classic cars still appeared, but the line-up felt fresh and cutting edge. Solar Crown doesn’t really have that same flavour. Only a tiny sliver of the cars here are even from this decade, so there’s an unavoidable staleness. Japanese cars have always been significantly underrepresented in TDU, but if you were thinking the geographical proximity at play with Solar Crown might trigger an increase, it absolutely has not. We get a 2011 Nissan 370Z, and a 2009 GT-R. That’s it.</p><p>There are some details I do really like, though, and there’s been some impressively granular work done regarding car sound. The hiss of wet asphalt or the bark of your exhaust note changing tone and volume as you wind down the window during the rain or in a tunnel is particularly lovely stuff. The visual effects for rain in cabin view still aren’t as good as the ones in the 10-year-old Driveclub, but I’ve been saying that about all racing games for a decade now.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-the-answer-dlc-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p><em>Spoiler warning: This review contains spoilers for the story of the base game, Persona 3 Reload, but avoids spoilers for the DLC itself.</em></p><p>What does it feel like when grieving the loss of someone you loved? Or when trying to move on from someone important who’s no longer in your life? For one, it’s painful. In its seemingly infinite emotional complexity, you perpetually mull over what you could have done differently or how great things would be if they were still around. In the constant cycle of getting lost in your thoughts while trying to go about your normal life, it’s as if you’re reliving the same day over and over again. In the best moments of Episode Aigis: The Answer – the epilogue DLC for the RPG <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a> – it portrays these struggles thoughtfully and candidly. And by the end, it poetically shows that so long as we have the means to do so, we can still carve a path forward no matter how hard it might be.</p><p>This is a faithful remake of the PlayStation 2 version of The Answer that came with Persona 3 FES in 2008, and uses the framework of Persona 3 Reload to bring its modern graphics and much-needed quality-of-life improvements to retell its story. Although it’s not a particularly great gameplay experience, largely focused on RPG dungeon crawling that overstays its welcome, its key story moments are a bittersweet stamp on Persona 3’s already emotional ending. More importantly, it’s a poignant lesson on living with grief and heartbreak shown through the lens of the series’ best cast of characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Persona 3 Reload: Episode Aigis - The Answer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>To understand The Answer is to also give away crucial parts of Persona 3’s original conclusion, since it picks up right after its ending. Even though you are not required to finish Persona 3 Reload to access this DLC, you don’t really have any business with it if you haven’t. It centers around the SEES crew coming to terms with the passing of their good friend (<span tabindex="-1" role="button">Tap to Reveal</span>), which comes with a certain melancholy in the way every character conducts themselves. Sometimes that creates an awkward tension that intensifies because these are characters with fresh wounds that barely had time to heal. As the DLC’s name would indicate, you now control Aigis as the main character – accounting for her arc in the base game, she’s wielded tremendously as the vessel for The Answer to examine how ugly yet necessary the healing process is. It’s also just really nice to see her in a leadership role as she works through her own personal struggles. And through her perspective it’s made clear that nearly everything in The Answer, from its very premise to the actions you take, are an extension of its broader message.</p><p>With the Dark Hour and Tartarus having been conquered by the end of Persona 3, what could possibly happen now? Well, time is at a standstill on March 31st, the day before everyone has to move out of the Iwatodai dorm, your de facto headquarters. And beneath the dorm spawns the Abyss of Time, an ethereal plane underground with 100+ floors that are functionally the same as Tartarus. It traps everyone within the dorm with nowhere to go but through each door that leads to sets of floors to get to the bottom of the mystery. And the newcomer Metis, an android who’s a direct contrast to Aigis, pops up to make a strong first impression by mistakenly wreaking havoc on the crew and the dorm. This sets up a lot of questions that don’t really come into focus until the very end; at that point, it leads to an incredible payoff that's definitely worth working for.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Aigis is the perfect character to represent what it’s like to bounce between the stages of grief.</p></div><p>Since there isn’t a daily structure, day-night cycle, or time-management element, The Answer’s gameplay focus is on the grind of its turn-based RPG combat and dungeon-crawling exploration. As you do in the base game, you fight against shadows sprinkled throughout its randomly generated, maze-like floors that make up the Abyss of Time. As a consequence, playing through The Answer can get monotonous without the other gameplay elements that help complement combat for a full Persona experience. However, the reward for trudging through its floors are the bits of story at the end of each block. These are relatively brief cutscenes that peer into critical turning points in each character’s past – while not often revelatory, they build toward something greater and leave just enough of a breadcrumb trail to motivate you to push through the Abyss of Time.</p><p>Combat in The Answer is still built upon Persona 3 Reload’s tried-and-true turn-based system where you account for elemental affinities, hit weaknesses for extra turns, and tactically knock down enemies to set up all-out attacks. With Aigis as the new lead, she also obtains the power to wield multiple personas, and the Pokemon-like nature of building her roster via persona fusion remains intact. It’s as sharp as it's always been, but when that’s what you’re doing for a large majority of your time it can start to wear thin, especially when blocks of dungeon floors were clearly recycled to pad out the roughly 25-hour runtime. I didn’t necessarily mind going through the motions, since I do enjoy the act of playing Persona 3 Reload, and the art style and personality of its characters still shine through in combat. Whether intentional or not, it is thematically fitting, I just wish it did more to mix up the gameplay dynamic throughout.</p><p>While you don’t get the kind of management and social sim elements typical of a Persona game here, there are charming little interactions you can initiate in the dorm that are new to this version of The Answer. Throughout the Abyss of Time you’ll find items in special chests that unlock cutscenes between Aigis and specific party members. Some of them are a bit tacky, for sure, but this is also how you earn additional perks that offer substantial benefits in combat. If anything, I was just happy to spend more time with this cast and fill a void from The Answer’s original version, even if these new interactions didn’t really lead to anything narratively crucial.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The message of The Answer is a very thoughtful one that comes together elegantly.</p></div><p>When I look back at The Answer, I find its gameplay secondary to what it’s actually about, despite it taking up most of its runtime. The interstitial cutscenes and character moments help flesh out the SEES crew a bit more, but also sets up a bigger picture for what Aigis is experiencing as someone who’s wrestling with her feelings, having lost the very person her life revolved around. From the growth she demonstrates in the original story to the final monologue she gives before the credits roll in Reload, Aigis is the perfect character to represent what it’s like to bounce between the stages of grief. And sharply written lines with an extraordinary performance from voice actor Dawn Bennett elevate Aigis as she ponders the big questions about life, death, and purpose.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I also appreciate the fact that while The Answer tries to give equal stakes for each character, it very clearly puts specific ones in the spotlight. While the rest of the party shares an intense sadness, the dynamic of Aigis and Metis showcases the internal struggle that happens when the burden seems too great to bear. Even though I am disappointed that Metis is still somewhat underdeveloped as a character, her role as a storytelling device and a foil to Aigis is so effective towards the end. And while the rest of the SEES crew have their moments, it’s Yukari who’s given a more prominent role in the story as an example of how tragedy changes a person. It's superb not just because she is my favorite of the crew, but also because her arc feels very <em>real</em>.</p><p>All of this doesn’t really come into focus until the last few hours of The Answer, so for as tedious as it may be to get there, the finale is worth it to see just how powerful the Persona series can be. And for all its metaphorical devices through its gameplay structure or overall premise – the time loop, the repetitive dungeon floors, chasing the shadow of someone who’s no longer there – the message of The Answer is a very thoughtful one that comes together elegantly.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Michael Higham's Persona Games Ranked</h3><p>Here is my personal order of my favorite entries in the Persona series (including spinoffs, but not SMT games).</p></div><p>In a year filled with games that have made me confront my own mortality and the untimely exit of those dear to me, it’s kind of poetic for The Answer to bookend the bunch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-the-things-money-cant-buy/1900-6418170/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review"><u>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1000xresist-review"><u>1000xResist</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review"><u>Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail</u></a>, and of course, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review"><u>Persona 3 Reload</u></a> have all provided their own unique perspectives on life’s big questions, which I’ve expressed in each of my reviews of those games. And they’ve all been anchors as I learn to live with loss, whether it be from death or circumstance. At a time when I’ve needed these lessons most, having become a demonstrably different and more emotionally exhausted person, Persona 3 has come back around in 2024 to take on a new meaning, even as the story remains the same. And of all the aforementioned games, The Answer is the one that gives the most definitive <em>answer </em>for what it means to move on.</p><p>Admittedly, I put a lot of stock into the story of The Answer, not to absolve it of its shortcomings, but because that is what I will remember most. It’s one of the tools I’ve been able to use as I experience the healing process myself since its strongest moments so closely represent what it's been like. At some point in the story, Aigis says to herself, "If this is what it’s like now, then I wish I could just be a machine again." I've thought a lot about cherished memories becoming painful to recall, and living inside your head yearning for what used to be. So when you’re going through it, it’s tempting to give into apathy and detach yourself from it all as a reprieve. But by having a support system, taking action, and giving herself the space to seek clarity, Aigis is afforded the opportunity to redefine closure, breaking free from the cycle of feeling trapped in time and forever in remorse. And so, the answer isn’t to forget the pain or let it consume you – because it never really goes away – but to accept it as an important piece to the mosaic that makes you who you are. It’s so much easier said than done, but sometimes you just need to see it to believe it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Episode Aigis: The Answer may not be the most exciting gameplay experience to come from an Atlus RPG, but its story is a crucial piece to Persona 3’s full picture. In its strongest moments, The Answer finds new ways to be just as powerful by understanding the pain that comes from heartbreak and loss in all its complexities, and how that changes a person. With its premise, it expresses the tedium of feeling stuck reliving the same day over and over again, but it’s also a moving statement about how we break out of grief’s vicious cycle and push forward. I always found The Answer to be thematically affecting, and having it repackaged for Reload means it’s no longer isolated as a dated PS2 game – and if anything, it’s a bittersweet epilogue to the series’ best story.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-first-preview-beautiful-and-full-of-potential-but-still-a-bit-hollow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In inZOI, Krafton’s ambitious all-in-one life simulator, you aren’t a God but rather an omnipotent office worker performing HR for miniature worlds under the tutelage of an adorable cat overlord. In addition to managing the needs and relationships of customisable avatars called Zois, you can build a metropolis with bespoke homes, businesses, and public parks. A slew of complications, like citywide mood sliders, weather conditions, and the potential for wild animals, juice up your all-seeing agenda, leading to a sumptuous simulation full of moreish chaos. It’s a gorgeous, formidable, system-filled world that, as of right now, still feels a little hollow. </p><p>Before jumping into the deep end on my first day on the job, inZOI ushered me in with a slick, hyper-realistic character studio that, if time permitted, could have easily swallowed my entire preview session. There was plenty of pushing and pulling as I warped my avatar’s facial symmetry with incredible freedom, like a kid making a beautiful monster out of Play-Doh. But any sincere attempts to create a stylish virtual self disappeared as I stumbled onto all of the Zoi Presets crafted by other creators – nightmare-fuel recreations of cultural icons like Shrek and Handsome Squidward. “We want to give (players) as much agency as possible,” explains Hyungjun Kim, director and producer of inZOI. “I grew up making custom content, and I made a lot of custom content when I was playing The Sims”, they continued. “I know what the players are feeling, and I've been in their shoes, so I wanted to give them as much agency as possible so they can make things as easy as possible.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Inzoi Players Recreating Real People and Pop Culture Characters</h3></div></output><p>You’ll choose a character’s gender expression, age range (child, young adult, adult, middle-aged, and senior), and personality before getting stuck into inZOI’s holistic anatomical putty parlor. “At first, we were looking at the option of stylising like The Sims, but we thought that making it realistic would help players become more immersed,” says Kim. “I wanted people to look at life in a more serious light, and if I have one vision for this game, it's that I want people to live meaningful lives and really think about life in general.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We want to give (players) as much agency as possible,” explains Hyungjun Kim, director and producer of inZOI.</p></div><p>inZOI’s fashion suite is a tour de force of customisable streetwear and abundant accessories. I could pick a cute top or skirt and adjust its length and colour using a rainbow palette, recreating some of my favourite archival fashion aesthetics like McBling and Indie Sleaze with ease. inZOI’s sizable wardrobe is refreshingly modern and mostly androgynous, too. “When making the game, we asked for help from clothing companies and brands,” explains Kim. “We asked a clothing designer who's worked with a lot of Korean singers and K-pop artists to help us, so with their help, we were able to make our own style,” they finished.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There is an unfortunate elephant in the room, though, and that’s inZOI’s integration of Generative AI. Players can upload a custom design to apply to their avatar’s clothing or toy with the plentiful built-in settings. However, a separate button opens up a prompt box where you can input word salad and receive a synthographic digital pattern based on your request. While it’s not all that surprising to see, given current technological trends, it does put a damper on what I feel is a compelling and inspiring character creator. It would cultivate a better community for inZOI if everyone were compelled to flex their unique visions, design skills and cultural milieu to make and share cool textures for other players to use rather than allowing a machine to speedrun creativity for them and produce shabby work.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There is an unfortunate elephant in the room, though, and that’s inZOI’s integration of Generative AI. </p></div><p>Once I had completed my household, I was thrust into inZOI’s Seoul-inspired city, Dowon, ready for my digital me to embed themselves in this impeccably dressed world. It’s here that I could start seeing the seams of this ambitious project. inZOI’s open world is enormous but feels very early. It’s chock full of intersecting people, places, and activities, but despite having so much to do, a haunting emptiness persists in the background, one that needs remedying before the game’s full release. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Starting in my Zoi’s brand-new apartment, they pottered around their gorgeous digs, cooking a frittata and chatting with their roommate. Communication in inZOI is divided between Love, Friendship, and Business, and as you start to talk, you can cycle through the different categories, prodding the relationships in your desired direction. Throughout, the Zois bantered in a Simlish-adjacent style of speech that was made especially for the game. “We have a language for inZOI, for the Zois,” Kim says. “We have a language for Dowon, and then we have Bliss Bay, which is based on America, and we need language for that. But the problem is, if you use English or Korean, you need to get voiceovers and actors.” they continued. “ And if you localise English to Korean, there might be a lot of difficulties, so that's why we made our own language. It’s written in Korean, but the voice itself is just independent. It's just a language that exists in inZOI.” Kim explains.</p><p>It’s a convincing package of interactions at first glance, even if the movement sometimes feels abrupt and goofy between activities. The physicality of a Zoi's animations often makes up for this, though – I was enamoured by the way they took and cracked the viscous eggs into a bowl. As my Zoi meandered around the house, they took a few selfies before spending a lengthy amount of time on the toilet – perhaps that frittata was a mistake. Either way, it was time to take my Zoi on the road, so I left the apartment to see what was outside. In the open world, my Zoi could walk the length and breadth of the city with barely any barriers. I could also instantly tinker with the environment's settings, turning my pristine and sunny landscape into a post-apocalyptic nightmare with a few clicks. Even with the occasional bout of texture pop-in, I was thoroughly impressed by how free I was to mould Dowon and torment the people of my world – and how intuitive it felt to do so. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>To balance out the complete freedom you’re given, friction in inZOI stems from the Karma system, which tallies your Zoi's actions and punishes them when they do bad things. Performing a social faux pas like littering or theft could cause your social standing to drop, with other Zois starting rumours about your misdeeds. I also ‘secretly farted’ in the kitchen next to my imaginary husband, which almost definitely made an impact, too. Much of inZOI feels borderless and determined to get out of your way, so I was pleased to see explicit boundaries to consider, even if the specifics of these systems were still a mystery to me.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I could also instantly tinker with the environment's settings, turning my pristine and sunny landscape into a post-apocalyptic nightmare with a few clicks.</p></div><p>With my time running out, I took a minute to try the build mode, filling my Zoi’s space with indiscriminate assets. Cycling through a collection of menus, I could easily shift the position of doors, build new walls, and add premade furniture. You can also modify the open-world environment in a similar fashion. “Right now, our Build Mode isn't complete—it's only 80% complete—but our rendering is pretty good,” says Kim. “I have big ambitions for Build Mode. I want the player to be able to build high-rise buildings with dozens of floors.” they continued. “Maybe later, we're going to add the ability to edit terrain.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>inZOI Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You can tweak almost every detail of a piece of furniture, too, from the wood type to how glossy you want it to be, or, if you wish, upload one of the aforementioned custom textures instead. It feels like an excellent foundation for criteria-based building challenges, and I’d love to try outfitting a low-budget or tiny-square-foot home with the available mechanics. Going forward, Kim told me that the team would observe what players were doing with the tools and try to nurture that however possible. “We have Unreal Editor that you can download from the shop, and you're going to be able to mod using that,” Kim said. “And we're not going to insert ourselves in any way.” </p><p>Kim is also thinking hard about the contentious topic of DLCs and add-on packs and how Krafton will support inZOI. “I think we might have to release DLCs, but we want to be careful around that,” Kim says. “I bought a lot of add-ons [for The Sims],  but when you make DLCs, what's important is that when you buy it, you need to feel that it's really worth it. You want to feel that it's a cool addition to your game.” </p><p>But before we think about the future, we need to focus on the experience of playing inZOI right now. The game’s world is extremely beautiful but somewhat empty in motion, permeated by a lack of grounding lore. It can sometimes feel like a playable version of a high-end real estate render or a picture-perfect Pinterest board. It does paw towards a playful narrative with its cat mascot and AR company framework. Still, it doesn’t transfer that same magical realist charm to its more minor interactions to imbue them with a sense of meaning or humour. But we’re still a while off the full game, and I’m hopeful it can carve out a chaotic corner for itself in this ever-fascinating and difficult genre, a space ripe for innovation which inZOI plans to evolve.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>RLCS day one has officially concluded with the Swiss bracket being held today. With 16 teams competing against each other, only three qualified for tomorrow’s event. With only two days left to the competition, the 2024 Rocket League Championship Series is making out to be quite eventful.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-3-teams-qualified-from-the-day-1-of-2024-rlcs-swiss-bracket">3 Teams Qualified from the Day 1 of 2024 RLCS Swiss Bracket</h2>



<p>The event, which is being held at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas, held a Swiss bracket today, with 16 teams competing against each other. Matches were first to three, with three players on each team. Some of the top competitors in the world face off against each other.</p>



<p>Only three teams, however, were able to qualify for tomorrow’s Playoffs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Throughout the day, the competition became nail-biting. It was tough at times to know who was going to advance forward, with many matches ending with a 3-2 score. </p>



<p>The final matches, though, of the Swiss bracket, were held between these three teams:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>PWR vs. M8</strong></li>



<li><strong>Team Vitality vs. Oxygen Esports</strong></li>



<li><strong>Spacestation Gaming vs. QuikTrip Pioneers Gaming</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The PWR vs. M8 series ended in a sweep, as M8 won 3-0, advancing them to tomorrow’s Playoffs. The same can be said for Spacestation Gaming vs. QuikTrip Pioneers Gaming, as Spacestation Gaming also swept the opposing team.</p>



<p>Team Vitality, however, put up a bit of a fight against Oxygen Esports, as the team lost 3-1. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h4 id="h-all-2024-rlcs-teams-advancing-from-swiss-bracket-to-playoffs">All 2024 RLCS Teams Advancing from Swiss Bracket to Playoffs</h4>



<p>Here are the three teams that are advancing to Playoffs from the Swiss bracket:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>M8</strong></li>



<li><strong>Spacestation Gaming</strong></li>



<li><strong>Team Vitality</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rlcs-playoffs-begin-tomorrow">RLCS Playoffs Begin Tomorrow</h2>



<p>Tomorrow (September 14, 2024) is when the Playoffs begin, with various teams set to compete against one another. The day will begin with both an Upper Bracket Quarterfinals and a Lower Bracket Round 1.</p>



<p>The entirety of the RLCS 2024 tournament has a $1,165,500 prize pool, with first place winning $300,000.</p>



<p>After the Playoffs pull through multiple rounds, the Grand Final will be held this Sunday, September 15, 2024. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Funko Fusion Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/funko-fusion-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/funko-fusion-review.980817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/funko-fusion-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At this point it almost seems that licensed Funko Pop figurines are being birthed into the world at a greater rate than actual human babies, so it makes sense that someone finally scooped up a bunch of these block-headed bookshelf warmers and stuck them in their own video game. Funko Fusion structures its campaign around seven beloved TV shows and films, including Masters of the Universe and Jurassic World, and stuffs it with iconic pop culture cameos from everyone from Marty McFly to Mega Man. However, despite the fact it certainly appears faithful to the distinctive Funko style at first glance, its meaningless story, mind-numbingly repetitive mission design, and maddening game-breaking bugs cause the whole thing to topple over like a doll with a head that’s too big for its body.</p><p>Effectively a third-person shooter spin on the tried-and-tested LEGO videogame formula (à la LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga) right down to the way literally every object around you can be belligerently smashed into studs – sorry, <em>chunks of vinyl</em> – Funko Fusion’s eclectic handful of familiar stories can be played in any order. I opted to open with Hot Fuzz and close with Scott Pilgrim vs The World, but the sequence I chose didn’t really seem to have any impact on the paper-thin overarching storyline, which centres around a good-versus-evil battle between Funko Freddy and the evil Eddy Funko. These two Funko faces may be familiar to the more dedicated Funko collectors, but from where I’m sitting having owned just a handful of them, the less said about these thoroughly uninteresting and underdeveloped arch rivals, the better. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Funko Fusion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Each substory runs for five stages and gives you four characters to switch between. In some cases there’s a strong incentive to do so, particularly in The Umbrella Academy where I found myself using Allison to persuade certain vulnerable NPCs to do her bidding and then swapping to Number Five for his ability to blink through the air to otherwise out of reach areas, but more often than not there’s not too much discernable difference between each character other than basic attributes, such as the rate of fire of their weaponry. </p><p>Across each of the seven substories, levels typically rehash the same escort missions and fetch quest formats, and also tend to copy and paste encounters to artificially lengthen each stage to frankly offensive degrees – like the Scott Pilgrim vs The World encounter that forced me to fight the same few variations of a cloned stunt double enemy in three or four near-identical scraps in a row. This is before each substory culminates in a boss fight that is each structured in the same enormously unsatisfying way, where you must blast purple blobs off a big bad’s body while fending off its crowding minions until you have enough purple goo to fill a towering Funko flask. At this point you can trigger the arrival of a super-sized Pop, like Battle Cat or a T-Rex, to finish the monster off while you shoot vinyl chunks out of its body on autopilot and try not to look bored until the cutscene comes.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I found combat in general to be pretty arduous for the most part.</p></div><p>In fact, I found combat in general to be pretty arduous for the most part. At first it feels satisfying enough to Funko pop the enemy Funko heads off their little Funko shoulders, but it quickly becomes tedious as you plough through these big-headed hordes in waves that are limited at certain times, and annoyingly neverending in others. The only substantial difference to each encounter is that some enemies you need to shoot, some you need to whack with your sword, and some you need to shoot until they’re stunned so that you can whack them with your sword. It gets old pretty Funko fast.</p><p>Puzzle solving fares a little better, at least in parts. There’s still plenty of basic timed switch-shooting and crank wheel-turning to be done, but there are some standout moments like the portal-heavy He-Man sections and using guitar amps to blast through fragmented glass windows in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. That is, provided these puzzles work as they should – but more on that later.</p><h2>Vinyl Fantasy</h2><p>Credit where it is due, the team at developer 1010 Games has done an admirable job at recreating the super deformed vinyl idols and placing them in some attractive little toy towns to roam around in. I was initially delighted to follow that meddling swan through the quaint village streets of Sandford when I started the Hot Fuzz campaign, and round up the huskies scattered amidst the cold steel surfaces of Thule Station in the Antarctic surrounds of John Carpenter’s The Thing. A vibrant bowling alley battle in The Umbrella Academy was particularly dazzling (even though that’s the series here I’m least personally familiar with) and the swirling cartoon explosions in Masters of the Universe’s Eternia were also a welcome touch. There’s clearly been a lot of work poured into crafting the look and feel of Funko Fusion, and plenty of Easter eggs to hunt for in its various worlds, too.   </p><p>Yet while Funko Fusion is absolutely teeming with recognisable characters and locations, it possesses surprisingly little of its own personality. Whereas I’ve regularly chuckled through the likes of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga or LEGO Marvel Super Heroes in the past as a result of the many clever comedic touches they bring to each adventure, I can recall laughing at Funko Fusion precisely once during its entire campaign – when the Cylons from Battlestar Galactica nod in approval at Knight Rider’s KITT after noticing the strobing red light on its grill mirrors the one on their visor lenses. For the most part, the absence of character voices and complete lack of facial expressions makes it very hard for these figurine fighters to seem like anything but charmless empty vessels in place of where some of my favourite fictional characters should be. When Adam raises the Power Sword with a completely nonplussed look on his face, it’s the accompanying He-Man theme song that’s really doing all the heavy lifting.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Mission objectives are incredibly obtuse and lack signposting.</p></div><p>Outside of the odd static speech bubble its cast of characters don’t really speak at all, and Funko Fusion itself is equally poor when it comes to communication. Mission objectives are often incredibly obtuse and lacking in any signposting. This often led to copious amounts of backtracking, especially since some of its environments, like the Jurassic World shopping district, are quite sizeable, yet you’ve got no minimap to assist in navigating them. I found myself routinely retracing my steps purely in order to find one of the vending machines to craft health potions and bits of puzzle-solving equipment like jump pads and gas cannisters with. In fact, I think I visited more virtual vending machines in Funko Fusion than I have in every Like a Dragon game combined. It’s also a little annoying that to change character you have to schlep all the way back to find a Funko Pop display box – I don’t see why we couldn’t have been given a menu button to just swap characters on the fly with.</p><p>It’s also not particularly good at giving feedback as to why some of your shots inflict damage on larger enemies and others don’t. I spent ages blazing away at the glowing red weak spot on the back of a big samurai mini-boss in The Umbrella Academy, continually registering as ineffective red X’s onscreen, only for it to suddenly change to hit point numbers flying off him with zero change in my approach. That was baffling, and not the only case of this unintuitive quirk with Funko Fusion’s combat.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Worse still, Funko Fusion doesn’t make it clear early on that you need 45 golden crowns in order to unlock its final story battle. After completing the seven main story quests, I had only accrued 38 of them, which meant that I had to turn heel and go back through levels I’d already completed searching for special cameo quests to harvest the extra crowns from, which put my story progress on pause for a full three hours. Then, when I did trigger the final encounter, I was forced to slog through an overly long final boss fight that had the audacity to make me pump round after round into its eight different forms for around 45 minutes before cutting to an unexpected and entirely anticlimactic endgame cutscene that closed the story with less of a Funko Pop and more of a burst bubble. </p><p>Arriving just a week after the launch of Astro Bot, a masterfully crafted adventure overflowing with invention and playful surprises at every turn, Funko Fusion’s rigid adherence to backtracking, bog-standard escort missions, plodding horde mode blast-a-thons, and bullet-spongey boss fights makes it seem instantly and disappointingly out of date by comparison. That’s to say nothing of the absolutely obnoxious invisible walls that make exploring its environments regularly mystifying, if not downright irritating. Just because you can use a jump pad to successfully leap above the height of a gate that’s blocking your path in the Shaun of the Dead bonus stage, doesn’t mean that Funko Fusion is going to allow you to clear it. What’s the matter, Funko Fusion? Never taken a shortcut before?</p><h2>Go Funk Yourself</h2><p>While most serious collectors like to keep their Funko Pops pristine, Funko Fusion has unfortunately arrived in stores a bit box-damaged, at least if the launch PlayStation 5 version that I played is anything to go by. In addition to relatively minor presentational problems like cutscenes freezing while the audio continued to play or background music just dropping out entirely for long stretches of a level, I’ve had puzzles break and prevent me from progressing, vending machine screens freeze up and not let me leave, and multiple crashes during boss fight loading screens, among many other annoyances. </p><p>At one point in a Masters of the Universe stage I needed two portals in order to solve a certain puzzle, however after crafting the first portal I was told by the vending machine that it was out of stock. After trying for about half an hour in vain to somehow solve the puzzle using just one portal, I ended up restarting the level only to find there were now multiple portals available, which was utterly infuriating. During the aforementioned Shaun of the Dead-based level, I was completely baffled as to why the car I was escorting just completely refused to move while I was bombarded with endless waves of zombies, only to eventually determine that a zombie had glitched inside a piece of scenery within the danger radius of the car, which was preventing it from getting a move on. Naturally, it was aggravatingly immune to my attacks and the level had to be restarted from the beginning.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lack of checkpoints makes game-breaking bugs hard to bear.</p></div><p>What makes a lot of these game-breaking bugs particularly hard to bear is the lack of any checkpoints in each chapter. If you meet a progress-halting glitch or even just lose your three lives towards the end of a stage, then you have to start that chapter all over again. Of the 20 hours it took me to complete Funko Fusion’s story, I’d estimate that close to a quarter of that time was just me redoing the levels that managed to break during my first time through. </p><p>The developers have assured me that they’re working on patch fixes to remedy some of the issues I encountered during my playthrough, yet even with these rough edges smoothed out, I can’t really see Funko Fusion appealing to any particular audience because it’s so hard to figure out exactly who it’s intended for. Its button-mashy combat and cutesy characters make it seem like it’s targeted towards more junior players, but some of its most prominently featured licenses like Hot Fuzz and The Thing makes it seem far more skewed towards adults who’ve actually seen those mature movies. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tristan's Favourite Games Based on Toys</h3></p></div><p>Unlike the LEGO video games that typically take the darker moments of Harry Potter or Star Wars and spin them into a cheeky moment of slapstick, Funko Fusion just presents the grisliest moments of these licenses, more or less as-is. The villainous Simon Skinner impales himself on a miniature church steeple at the end of Hot Fuzz, while Copper’s hands get violently bitten off by Norris’ teeth-filled torso in The Thing. The only difference is that they’re dead-eyed doll versions of these well-known characters, but the blood still sprays the same – which doesn’t exactly seem appealing for youngsters. Additionally, I don’t know too many grade school kids who are into the 2004 Battlestar Galactica, let alone the 1978 original which has been curiously reproduced here.</p><p>The absence of any cooperative play at launch means Funko Fusion can’t even be tag-teamed by a parent and a child, which is how I’ve enjoyed many of the LEGO games with my kids in the past. While co-op functionality is promised to be rolled out in piecemeal, starting with Jurassic World in October, according to the developers it will be online-only and therefore won’t facilitate families playing it on the couch together anyway. I’m really struggling to figure out exactly who Funko Fusion is for, but what I do know for certain is that it’s definitely not for me.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following a difficult year for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/immortals-of-aveum">Immortals of Aveum</a> developer Ascendant Studios, a "core team" of around 20 employees has now decamped to Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser's Absurd Ventures, establishing a new studio that'll be known as Absurd Marin.
</p>
<p>
Immortals of Aveum, a "single-player first person magic shooter", launched to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-of-aveum-review">mixed reviews</a> last August, and it failed to make much of an impact commercially. As a result, just a month later, Ascendent Studios announced it had made the "painfully difficult, but necessary" decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-of-aveum-studio-lays-off-45-of-staff-following-poor-sales">lay off 45 percent of its staff</a>, equating to around 40 employees.
</p>
<p>
And things didn't get much better from there; earlier this year, it was reported a "large portion" of the remaining team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-of-aveum-developer-furloughs-majority-of-staff-report">had been furloughed</a>, leaving the future of Ascendant in doubt. But now, Houser's Absurd Ventures has announced it's taken at least some of the studio under its wing, with a "core team" of around 20 former employees forming new developer Absurd Marin.

<p>
Based in San Rafael, California, Absurd Marin will be led by Ascendant Studios' founder and game director Bret Robbins, with its team set to expand as development of its new game - described as a "story driven action-adventure title set in another, as-yet-unannounced Absurd universe" - continues.
</p>
<p>
Since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">unveiling</a> last June, Absurd Ventures has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-reveals-graphic-novel-and-audio-drama">announced</a> two "universes" - American Caper and A Better Paradise - intended to form the basis of multiple transmedia projects, beginning with a graphic novel and podcast respectively. Meanwhile, a job advertisement spotted in May confirmed Absurd's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-company-is-creating-an-open-world-action-adventure">first video game project</a> is also in the works. Referred to as an "open-world action-adventure" that's aiming to deliver "best-in-class combat and third-person action across multiple game modes", no further information has been revealed. It's unclear if this is the same project now in Absurd Marin's hands.
</p>
<p>
As for Ascendant Studios, no official notice of its closure has been shared, so its current status remains uncertain. But having lost its founder and 20 employees from an already substantially diminished team, it seems doubtful it'll have much of a future.
