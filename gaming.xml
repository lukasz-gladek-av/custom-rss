            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-amazon-deal-yakuza-show-premiere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to hit the karaoke bars.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">With the recent success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: Refantazio</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, it’s safe to say Sega is having a pretty good year. While those may be the final big game releases from the publisher in 2024, Sega officially caps off its year of releases with a TV show based on the Yakuza game series. That’s a cause for celebration, and, more importantly, some discounts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the new TV show Like a Dragon: Yakuza <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-like-a-dragon-yakuza-show">premiering today on Prime Video</a>, Amazon has dropped prices on most of the Yakuza games. The critically acclaimed turn-based RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> is at its lowest price yet. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">$40 Off Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth on PS5 or Xbox Series X</h2><div catalogid="a0712628-1cdf-4bf2-ada6-3589574b52ab" id="209660"><div id="209660" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is the most recent addition to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza timeline</a>, and $40 off brings the game down to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CJHD3JZ8?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest ever price</a>. In my experience, 60% off a same-year release of this quality is about as good as video game deals can get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To clear up some confusion, the Yakuza series rebranded as "Like a Dragon" in English localizations back in 2022. If you’re an OG Yakuza fan, have no fear: The recent Like a Dragon games carry the spirit of the original PS2 series through and through. Here’s what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/tristan_ign_au">Tristan Ogilvie</a> had to say in his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">9/10 review of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>: </p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Yakuza Games on Sale</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a> (2020) and the spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-ishin">Like a Dragon: Ishin!</a> (2014) are also included in Amazon's deals. If you want to check out some of the OG Yakuza series, you're in luck. While not the same level of price slashing, the remastered collection of Yakuza 3, 4, and 5 is 25% off. The collection was released for the PS4 back in 2020, but because of the PS5's backward compatibility the games work on either console. Same goes for Yakuza Kiwami 2, a remake of the original Yakuza 2, which is also slightly discounted. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Preorders for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Are Still Full Price</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="73cb2eaf-df62-41ec-ac64-06de169b8249" id="207607"><div id="207607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The one Like a Dragon game that isn’t on sale is, as you could probably guess, the one that isn’t out yet.

The best map for getting started, especially for beginners, is the Liberty Falls map. Here we'll explain how to gain access to the Pack-a-Punch machine, as well as the costs associated with those upgrades for your weapons.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to find and unlock the Liberty Falls Pack-a-Punch</h2><p dir="ltr">When starting a match on Liberty Falls, the Pack-a-Punch machine will be on the opposite end of the gas station rooftop where you'll spawn. This will take some time to earn enough points to access the area you need to go.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also more than one path you can take, with doors to unlock on the left and right side of your starting area, but we recommend choosing the right side. This will give you quicker access to the most essential perks of Juggernog and Quick Revive.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390067" data-ratio="0.56277056277056" data-width="1848" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390067"></a><figcaption>Liberty Falls cemetery barrier </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 1:</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Spend the 1,500 essence points needed to unlock the right-side barrier.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 2: </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Head behind Ollie's Comic Shop to unlock the second barrier needed. This is 1,750 essence points to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 3:</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Follow the street leading up the hill to the church. This will include a barrier for 2,000 essence points to unlock access to the church front and cemetery.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 4:</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The front entrance to the church is also locked, so it will cost you 2,250 essence points to open this final barrier to the church.</p><p dir="ltr">You can now enter and find the Pack-a-Punch machine at the back of the room.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also helpful to note that Black Ops 6 finally <strong>allows players to share the costs of opening doors</strong>. You can choose to pay a portion of the barrier costs, and other teammates can chip in as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Pack-a-Punch costs</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390069-libertyfallspap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390069" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390069-libertyfallspap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390069"></a><figcaption>Liberty Falls Pack-a-Punch machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390069-libertyfallspap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Upgrading the power of your weapon with the Pack-a-Punch machine is a hefty price. There are three tiers of upgrades, which are priced as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Tier 1 costs 5,000 essence points</li><li dir="ltr">Tier 2 costs 15,000 essence points</li><li dir="ltr">Tier 3 costs 30,000 essence points</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Playing solo, you should be able to unlock access to Pack-a-Punch and get a tier-one upgrade by level 9.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Weapon rarity upgrades</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390065-libertyfallsarsenal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390065" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390065-libertyfallsarsenal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390065"></a><figcaption>Liberty Falls Arsenal machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390065-libertyfallsarsenal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can also upgrade your weapon's rarity by adding more attachments. This rarity upgrade is applied at any of the map's Arsenal machines. There's an Arsenal machine at the end of the street on the right side, which is just beyond where you open the first barrier. There's another Arsenal machine in the parking lot opposite the church.</p><p dir="ltr">Weapon rarity upgrades are paid for with the salvage currency dropped by fallen zombies. The costs are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">500 for Common (Green)</li><li dir="ltr">1,000 for Rare (Blue)</li><li dir="ltr">3,500 for Epic (Pink)</li><li dir="ltr">8,500 for Legendary (Orange)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For more on Black Ops 6, make sure to check out all the details on how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-works-plus-tons-of-unlocks-and-rewards/1100-6527292/">player progression and prestige work</a>.

            <p>
Remember Balatro's free Friends of Jimbo collaboration update back in August, which saw the acclaimed poker-themed rogue-like adding a bunch of card cosmetics inspired by popular video games? Well it turns out there was more where that came from, and players can now adorned their desks with cameos from the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>.
</p>
<p>
Balatro's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-free-collaboration-update-adds-the-witcher-vampire-survivors-among-us-more">original Friends of Jimbo update</a> gave players the option to swap out the game's usual Kings, Queens, and Jacks with characters from The Witcher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a>. So if fancied bolstering your deck with a beaming Jaskier, for instance, or a little red space-pal, then you were well and truly catered for.
</p>
<p>
And now, Balatro developer LocalThunk is doing it all again with the free Friends of Jimbo Pack 2, featuring cameos from The Binding of Isaac and Slay the Spire, alongside Cyberpunk 2077 and Stardew Valley. That means you can now set Johnny Silverhand as your ice-cool King, Isaac's Mother as your varicose-veined Queen, even Stardew Valley's general store manager Pierre as your Jack - with all 12 new card faces getting an airing in the trailer below.

<p>
And beyond that, there's not a lot more to report - other than the fact Balatro's free Friends of Jimbo Pack 2 update is available now on PC, PlayStation, Switch, Android, and iOS. As for what's next, LocalThunk previously confirmed he's working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-2m-sales-with-free-major-update-due-in-2025">major free content update</a> - promising to "bring new ideas and strategies to the game" - that'll launch sometime next year.
</p><p>
And if you've yet to play the absurdly compelling Balatro, it's definitely work a look. Christian Donlan had good things to say about its rogue-like spin on poker in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">four star review</a> earlier this year, calling it, "So striking and so brilliantly constructed, and something that has given me such pleasure for the last week".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278781/overwatch-2-season-14-6v6-test<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard is <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/">bringing back 6v6 matches</a> in testing for <em>Overwatch 2</em> when it launches its next season in December. The company had previously switched the series to a 5v5 format, and Blizzard is now trying these tests to find how it can “make the core game even stronger” through a balanced new version of the classic 6v6 mode that lets each team have multiple tank characters once again.</p><p>Game director Aaron Keller says Blizzard knows the 5v5 format appealed to and brought in a new group of players, and developers are hoping to repeat that success with the addition of 6v6 (which won’t replace current formats). For a detailed write-up of what’s changing, you can read <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/">the full director’s take</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206210/overwatch-2-six-player-team-multiplayer-test">In July</a>, Keller noted some of the issues 6v6 faced were hero balancing, game performance, and how to make sure players can still get into games quickly if it splits the population between 5v5 and 6v6 game modes. One hero balancing change includes giving tanks less survivability and making them not as powerful.</p><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> Season 14 will have two different opportunities to try 6v6; the first will use a new “Open Queue” format where each team of six must have at least one of each role (tank, damage, support) and no more than three of any role. You’ll also be able to switch roles on the fly. The second 6v6 test will happen in the middle of the season and will let you have two of each role per team.</p><p>There will also be a 5v5 test in Season 13 in which there will be a maximum of two players in each role, and tanks will be weaker than previously.</p><p>My colleague Richard Lawler, who is an avid player, said <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s change that removed one tank player from each team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206210/overwatch-2-six-player-team-multiplayer-test">made the game simpler</a>, but also “made it seem like the outcome of the game depended a little too much on that one role.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Titled <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>, the gritty crime drama follows the series’ longtime protagonist Kazuma Kiryu across two timelines: one as a teenage orphan in 1995, and the other as a hardened yakuza after ten years in jail in 2005. The adaptation is borrowing quite liberally from the beloved series, remixing numerous elements of the first game and its prequel, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-kiwami-like-a-dragon-amazon-show-1851662354&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-kiwami-like-a-dragon-amazon-show-1851662354"><em>Yakuza 0</em></a></span>, but controversially, it’s also charting its own path, and the move isn’t quite to everyone’s liking.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,194088,195755" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In one big change from the source material, Amazon’s adaptation appears to be mostly a straightforward and gritty drama. The <em>Like a Dragon </em>games<em> </em>are well known for their soapy melodrama, convoluted plots, humongous casts, and cinematic direction, but they also have a well-established penchant for irreverence. The streets of Kamurocho, where the games mostly take place, are filled with weirdos, like Mr. Libido, who gyrates and thrusts in a manic and sexual frenzy in casual conversation. There’s a yakuza family in the games composed of grown men in diapers who clearly have some oedipal complex. The next game in the series casts one of its best characters, Goro Majima, as a amnesiac pirate, and Kiryu could (and maybe <em>should</em>) leave behind the criminal underworld for a career in the arts, because that man fucks up a karaoke night like no one else.<br></p><p>And yet, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> features no diaper-wearing yakuza, nor are there any heart-wrenching renditions of “Baka Mitai,” and that is sure to disappoint a lot of people. This new show seems to cast aside many of these flourishes and embellishments, which the untrained eye might consider the fat of the <em>Like a Dragon </em>games. However, you’re far more likely to find fans who call these distractions and detours the very soul of the franchise, and I’m inclined to agree.<br></p><p>The cast and crew behind <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-amazon-kiryu-actor-interview-1851592856&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-amazon-kiryu-actor-interview-1851592856">aren’t without reverence for the source material</a></span> though. Interviews with the actors have provided insight into the production, revealing that developing Kiryu’s combat prowess in a logical way was a huge factor in the lead actor’s preparation. Ryōma Takeuchi, who plays Kiryu in the show, has gone on the record saying that Kiryu’s fighting style differs between the different eras covered in the series and is meant to be consistent with his growth and outlook on life, and his performance seems to be one of the more universally agreed upon highlights of the adaptation. There has also seemingly been an emphasis on Kamurocho itself, and capturing the way that the red-light district (based on the real-world Kabukicho) evolves over time similarly to how it does in the games, which span the decades between the late 80s and the present day. One spinoff even takes place in the mid-1800s, but that’s a conversation for another day.<br></p><p>Outside of the strength of its primary cast, though, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza </em>seems like a bit of a murky adaptation. Some reviews accuse it of oversimplifying storylines in order to fit them into a too-short six-episode season. With the action of two huge games being blended into just a handful of hours, it appears that some beloved characters have been minimized. The action choreography doesn’t seem to always leap off the screen, and the show appears to provide very little time and space for the audience to wrap their heads around the complicated structure of Japanese organized crime, which involves a lot of “families,” patriarchs, captains, and more that I’m <em>still </em>learning.<br></p><p>All in all, critics are divided, with some feeling that it’s another outstanding game adaptation in a year that’s already given us <em>Fallout</em> and that its concessions to realism still allow for enough of the surreal spark of the games to shine through, while others find it to be a creative misfire, lacking everything that makes the games so memorable. Here’s what some critics are saying about Amazon’s <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza.</em><br></p><h2 id="h26140"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inverse</a></span></h2><p>The performances by Kiryu (Ryoma Takeuchi), Nishiki (Kento Kaku), and Yumi (Yumi Kawai) are a strong-as-steel foundation for this show to build on, with each giving deeply emotional performances that have real complexity and layers — especially considering we’re essentially seeing two versions of these characters with two time periods. Takeuchi’s Kiryu especially is a tremendous highlight, a daydreaming boy turned into a stoic warrior who nonetheless has a heart of gold that’s never been chipped away. But past that, the rest of the cast also gives stellar performances that make this world feel grounded, from the far too-tired-for-this-stuff Detective Date (Subaru Shibutani) to the deliciously cold and uncaring Dojima (Masaya Kato), head of the Tojo’s Dojima Family.</p><p><em>Like a Dragon</em>’s other biggest strength is that it’s unapologetically authentic. The show is unafraid to use Japanese terms and yakuza jargon, and the set design and costuming in particular are a fascinating glimpse at 1995 and 2005 Japan. The floral shirts and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/yakuza-7-punch-perm-like-dragon-ichiban-kasuga&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/yakuza-7-punch-perm-like-dragon-ichiban-kasuga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Punch Perm</a></span> haircuts make <em>Like a Dragon</em> feel like a period piece just as much as a drama, exploring the life and inner workings of the yakuza and the seedy city of Kamurocho. It’s also beautifully shot, making fantastic use of space and angle to heighten the character’s emotions.<br></p><p>But at the same time, this show is taking inspiration from the video games, blending in a sense of surrealism and ridiculousness. There’s just a little edge of unreality to <em>Like a Dragon</em> that gives it extra flavor — from the<em> Fight Club</em>-esque underground combat arena to a secret mass surveillance room run by a police-officer-turned-yakuza. It’s that mix of the familiar and the unknown that makes Kamurocho such a compelling setting; it’s grounded and realistic but with a hint of the unknown.<br></p><h2 id="h26141"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/amazon-prime-video/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/amazon-prime-video/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paste Magazine</a></span></h2><p>On some level, I’ll admit it: I am biased and went into this TV series with preconceived notions due to my extensive time with these wonderful, dumbass videogames. I was bummed out that the wacky sense of humor was entirely absent from this telling, even if that strangeness would have been challenging to pull off outside of a game where there are more natural ways to create barriers between different modes of storytelling.</p><p>But even accounting for this, Prime Video’s <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> falls short of its own aims. There are some inspired flashes here and there, and you can see the scaffolding that could have formed a moving, decade-spanning tale of tragedy and revenge. But because the series is so eager to jump from scene to scene, it becomes difficult to care about any individual member of this large cast, robbing these turns of dramatic heft. It all ends up feeling like the show borrows a bunch of surface-level aspects from the games, like names and plot points, but fails to convey the deeper reasons why these characters and their storylines worked, all while it also comes up short of taking things in a new direction. Bad videogame adaptations aren’t exactly unique, but I was hoping for more from the Dragon of Dojima.</p><h2 id="h26142"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN</a></span></h2><p>The original game’s plot is reduced down to a rote tale of theft and revenge – I’ll save spoiling the specifics, but it’s both an unsatisfying setup <em>and</em> conclusion. And in shifting up the events of <em>Yakuza 0</em> to 1995 from 1988, there’s now no commentary on the absurdity of bubble-era Tokyo real-estate economics. It’s actually strange how much money is now flowing around at a time, when in real-world Japan, it categorically wasn’t.</p><p>That’s not to say the world of <em>Yakuza</em> isn’t rendered well in other ways. The detailed set of Kamurochō is delightful. The show is most enjoyable when you take in all the additional details of its worldbuilding – I especially enjoy the cinema showing posters of period-accurate film listings (even acknowledging the huge splash <em>Forrest Gump</em> made in Japan after it was released there in 1995). The final scenes here throw a ridiculous amount of the show’s budget on extras, and it makes the place feel genuinely alive and breathing<br></p><p>[...]</p><p>Without the <em>Like A Dragon</em> name attached, this series would get very little attention. There’s so little that’s very <em>Yakuza</em> in tone, and it’s so limited in inspiration from the games that there’s hardly much you’ll recognize from them. There’s great character work from some of the cast – particularly Kento Kaku as Nishikiyama – but sadly nothing very interesting for them to do.</p><h2 id="h26143"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/like-a-dragon-yakuza-sega-amazon-prime-video-1235141494/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/like-a-dragon-yakuza-sega-amazon-prime-video-1235141494/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a></span></h2><p>Video game adaptations shouldn’t be constrained with coloring inside the lines so fans can get their reference fix. They should, as <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> does, feel free to explore different avenues of a game’s mythos, even if that means leaving the series’ wackier elements on the cutting room floor and fully commit to telling a mob story.</p><p>Despite its shortcomings, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> not only puts a bold foot forward, making yet another worthwhile <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/t/video-game-adaptation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/video-game-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video game adaptation</a></span> in the wake of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/fallout-tv-behind-the-scenes-1234999546/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/fallout-tv-behind-the-scenes-1234999546/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> series</a></span>, but it also retains the game’s gripping drama and shades of its humor while teeing up what could be an enthralling second season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We put five pitches together (each more wild than the last) before they informed us that they were most interested in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a light hearted first-person adventure game set in a haunted house. It took us about nine months to get from that initial pitch to signing the project, by which time the core concept of the game had changed significantly. And since NanaOn-Sha doesn’t keep any fulltime programmers or artists on the books, we also brought U.K.-based development studio Zoe Mode onboard to implement the project. What followed was a 12-month development cycle jam-packed with blood, sweat, and tears unlike what any of us had ever experienced before. Was our mission successful? Well, that depends on what criteria you judge success by—but there are certainly plenty of aspects of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that we can take pride in, and some real takeaways to share.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, June/July 2012.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went right">What went right</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Successful multinational collaboration">1. Successful multinational collaboration</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With so many parties involved, it was hard to maintain a coherent vision for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In effect, we had three creative centers—us in Tokyo, our publishing team in Washington, and the Zoe guys in the U.K. One of NanaOn-Sha’s guiding philosophies is that in order to have games with cross-cultural appeal, you need to have staff from different backgrounds (Parappa’s character designer was American, as was the lead programmer for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vib-Ribbon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), and this project certainly fit the mold—indeed, it was our most ambitious yet in terms of multinational collaboration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, this approach isn’t without its downsides. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s development was anything but smooth sailing, and we faced creative disagreements at every milestone. This may sound like more hassle than it’s worth, but we really believe that creative conflicts are a great way to tease out unique products with that elusive “universal” feel. Also, we had been reading a lot of articles about failed collaborations between Japanese and Western studios, so we were determined to prove that when done correctly, a multinational partnership can make a game better.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking at the final product, we really feel that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> comes across as a “borderless” title. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn’t feel specifically Japanese, American, or British, and it has its own vibe as a result. From the very start of the project, we knew that the game wasn’t realistically targeted at the Japanese market, so anything overtly Japanese would have been a big risk. We did actually sound out several Japanese studios to collaborate with before settling on Zoe Mode, but we weren’t convinced that any of the other developers could grasp what a Western audience would expect from a “haunted house” experience. We needed our development partners to be able to synchronize creatively with us in Tokyo and understand what our U.S. publishing partners would expect. Zoe nailed it on its first pitch, which meant that we could focus on implementation issues instead of endlessly debating core philosophies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From a practical perspective, there were several things that helped us pull this off. First of all, we hired a Japanese-English translator who translated almost all of our email into each language for the entire project. This meant staff wouldn’t lag behind on certain issues, because they wouldn’t have to read in their second language. Second, we held frequent video conferences, because face-to-face contact helped ensure subtle things didn’t get lost in translation. We also visited Zoe Mode whenever possible to make an effort to get to know each other and understand our cultural differences. Finally, we made sure that we “clicked”—if you don’t have good chemistry with your partners, it’s harder to keep everyone on a unified course.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, June/July 2012.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Robust navigation system">2. Robust navigation system</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we were pitching the game to Microsoft, two crucial issues came up: the camera and the navigation system. We were pretty confident that for a game that relies on atmosphere and spooks, a third-person camera just wouldn’t cut it. For us, Kinect was an opportunity to get players closer to the screen, experiencing things firsthand. If your avatar looks scared when you aren’t scared, it kind of spoils the immersion. Navigation was an altogether different beast. We ended up with an implementation very similar to our initial vision, in which the player uses his arm to point his flashlight and pan the screen, and walks in place to move forward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Navigation has been a tricky issue for Kinect, even after 18 months on the market, but we were convinced that in order for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to be a spooky, immersive experience, players needed to physically drive the in-game movement themselves. Every movement forward is a step toward a potential scare, and we really wanted players to feel that anxiety, which we felt would be stripped away by any automove alternatives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Designing and developing a system in which the player walks in place and points with his arms might sound simple, but it ended up dominating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s development, and took up about 15 percent of our total resources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft was concerned that players would find walking around corridors a chore, so we tackled this in a few different ways. We balanced the parameters so that a minimum amount of movement was necessary to drive the player forward; we implemented an “autoturn” option so that the camera would automatically turn around corners, which was much more complicated than it sounds but definitely worth the effort in the end; and we increased the amount of distractions, such as small scares and wandering ghosts, to break up the monotony of wandering around empty corridors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite all this effort, which we hadn’t planned for in our initial budget, we were never able to fully convince our publishing partners that our navigation system was the best it could be, and every time they saw a different first-person Kinect title that used alternative methods, we would feel pressured to follow in line. It was a big risk and a big creative judgment call on our part to stick with it, but we feel that this has been justified by the number of reviews praising the system compared to the equivalent scorn poured on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s peers. Indeed, I’ve yet to come across a review that knocks </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s navigation system, and considering the generally harsh approach to reviewing Kinect games by the traditional game press, this praise was hard-earned.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Aesthetics defined early">3. Aesthetics defined early</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just one week after we had signed the contract, we were informed by Microsoft that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be featured at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show, which was just three weeks away—and that we needed a video for the announcement. It was a great marketing opportunity that we didn’t want to pass up, but coming up with a high-quality video that would be reflective of the final product in just over two weeks was a real challenge. However, it really served as a catalyst for all of us to define the aesthetics of the title very early in development, and after TGS we seldom had any concerns about the visual style of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During that period, we held Skype meetings with Zoe almost daily. Microsoft wanted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to have a “Disney’s Haunted Mansion” feel to it, and given that brief we attempted to forge a visual identity that was charming yet with a cheeky darkness to it. Our influences included the classic Italian horror director Mario Bava, Twin Peaks, and Pan’s Labyrinth, which were all pretty “serious” properties. But we knew that as long as the content was sufficiently mild, the game wouldn’t be too scary for our target market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only disadvantage to our aesthetic choice was the cost. It took a lot of resources to get the visuals to release-quality levels, and even then the rooms in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are relatively bare. We now understand why most Xbox Live Arcade titles are 2D or controlled perspective 3D; when players are playing through a first-person perspective, they can’t help but compare you to mainstream retail titles, even if your art budget is minuscule by comparison.</span></p><p>Some of Haunt's in-game paintings.

Modularized approach to Kinect scanning</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By choosing Zoe Mode as our development partner, we were choosing a team with a long experience in camera games, due to their work with Sony’s EyeToy. This turned out to be a massive advantage. After some early experiments, the tech and design teams determined that in order to get the most out of Kinect, we should modularize input systems, rather than layer them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has very few occasions in which you can do more than one interaction simultaneously. Most of the time, you either do a specific gesture, or you don’t. As soon as things get more complicated than this, Kinect gets into slippery territory. Sometimes the player will run into false positives, where the system thinks that the player has done a specific gesture he didn’t do, or false negatives, where the player thinks he’s done a specific gesture but the system doesn’t register it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These issues tormented us when we developed Major Minor’s Majestic March for Nintendo’s Wii, but we handled it much better in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by managing the number of inputs scanned at any one time and then doing whatever we could to reinforce the results to the player. The more plural and complicated the gestures are, the more likely false negatives and positives will frustrate players. This is made doubly dangerous in first-person games, where players don’t have onscreen avatars to visually synchronize their movements with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The one major exception to this in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is navigation; the system simultaneously monitors feet and knees (to move players forward) and arms (to point the flashlight and access the Xbox Guide). These actions are mapped to different halves of the body, so we could treat them as separate modules instead of layering them and relying on the system to distinguish them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kinect is a paradox. It’s labeled a “natural user interface,” but many issues prevent most ideas from being implemented in a straightforward manner. We had to do all kinds of hacks to make things feel natural, or as close to natural as possible, and taking this modular approach meant that we were able to test them in isolation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Problems that might ruin your amazing Kinect idea may stem from technical, cognitive, or cultural issues. Our technical issues generally involved balancing lag and smoothing—Kinect’s skeleton tracking jitters heavily, but the more you smooth it out, the more lag you get—and inaccuracy (the false positives problem mentioned earlier, as well as the large percentage of players who don’t calibrate their Kinect properly). Cognitive issues came up when Kinect was unable to map things 100 percent to the real world equivalents due to various limitations—such as the fact that you can’t walk forward much when playing Kinect because you’ll run into the TV. Our hack was to have players walk in place, but as this isn’t a 1-to-1 implementation, players are bound to experience some cognitive confusion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, there are cultural issues; players can interpret things in different ways. We found that many American players wanted to perform walking with minimum effort, with tiny real-world footsteps amounting to large game-world footsteps, so we implemented the minimum footstep height possible given Kinect’s granular accuracy. If the distance is too small, we’d get false positives, and the camera would move forward in the game even when players were standing still. By the middle of the project we were pretty savvy about Kinect’s capabilities, and we could eliminate ideas that sounded great on paper but would have been crippled by its limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the future, technologies like Kinect will (hopefully) become more accurate and reliable; from a player’s perspective, there’s a massive difference between 90 percent reliability and 99 percent. If that happens, game developers will be free to create more action-oriented, high-octane experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But for a spooky game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which encourages slow, deliberate movements, the current technology was a sufficient match.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="&nbsp;5. And introducing...Tim Schafer">&nbsp;5. And introducing...Tim Schafer</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking at the legacy of NanaOn-Sha titles, one of our hallmarks is the way we use voice talent. For the Parappa titles, we used musicians, not actors, to voice the characters. Their performances were never going to win any Academy Awards, but their flat deliveries had a certain charm— and the character models in Parappa were technically flat, too!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s vertical slice stage, we were using the partner of a Zoe staffer to voice our game’s only speaking character, mansion owner Benjamin Muldoon. The actor was very gifted, and gave a thespian, ultra-English performance with some gusto that many on the dev team were quite proud of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, for NanaOn-Sha founder Masaya Matsuura and me, something wasn’t quite right. Benjamin Muldoon—or “Benjy,” as we called him—is a grubby old geezer who came to riches by surreptitious means. And he’s trapped inside a painting. He has intentionally crude animations—his mouth flaps open and his pupils roll, much like a Terry Gilliam talking head in Monty Python. It was pretty cheesy, and we loved it. Sadly, the crude, flat Benjy character just didn’t match the hyper-animated performance of our thespian friend, but we weren’t sure what to do until one day, when we were talking with (Double Fine founder) Tim Schafer at a GDC party in 2011.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tim invited us on a tour of Double Fine’s studio the next day, and after the party I suggested the notion to Matsuura of Tim playing the part of Benjy for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He loved the idea, and it really seemed like a NanaOnSha thing to do. After the tour the next day, we popped the question to Tim, and after some moments of wild, inner panic, he said “Sure! Fuck it. Let’s do it!” and we never looked back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re very happy with Tim’s voiceover—his dry, flat performance is a perfect fit to the 2D painting his character inhabits. But it was a real challenge to get the performance just right; working with nonprofessionals requires that you focus the workload on their strengths and minimize the weaknesses.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first thing we did was allow Tim to rewrite the voiceover script. The original was written by British game designers (myself included), so in order to get a natural-sounding performance, we knew the script had to be in his voice. He wasn’t required to do any accent or place his vocabulary in a certain time or place. It was 100 percent Tim, with the freedom to take on Benjy’s malevolent mindset—which he tackled with relish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second key element is that we had to do a couple of re-recordings—Tim would tire as the day went on, and the more we tried to cajole him into tapping into more energy, the more tired his performances became. Doing re-recordings not only gave him a chance to re-energize but also allowed us to check the lines in isolation and weed out required pickups (of which there were plenty!).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Third, we found that the recordings went much better when someone 100 percent familiar with the game was able to attend the session and give some direction. This isn’t easy on an XBLA budget when 5,000 miles separate parties, but we managed to time a session to coincide with E3, which was truly worth its weight in gold.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, June/July 2012.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went wrong">What went wrong</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Flawed communications pipeline">1. Flawed communications pipeline</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There was one point of contact at Microsoft, Zoe Mode, and NanaOn-Sha, and generally this worked well. Having one point of contact helps to focus discussions, but sometimes it would clog up development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We would get feedback from our publisher’s top-level management, but by the time it had reached the coder or artist responsible for the implementation, it would have gone through up to five middlemen. This led to a feeling that the feedback was practically an order, rather than a suggestion or topic for debate. In the other direction, when we had to explain certain contentious development decisions—such as our choice of navigation system—we were never really able to take full control of the issue, and subsequently no parties ever felt satisfied.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was compounded by several management changes at the publisher during development, many of whom we never had an opportunity to meet with, speak to, or even email directly. We had to re-justify our navigation system decisions several times during development, but even then we could tell that the top brass weren’t satisfied. Having to repeatedly make the same arguments proved to be a real distraction, and there was a real sense of frustration and helplessness about not being able to control our vision. We should really have flown to the publisher HQ to communicate our vision and passion for the project and just hammer out these differences, but in the end we never visited and instead these troubles festered throughout the latter half of development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our failure to resolve these differing opinions on the navigation system really shook the publisher’s confidence in the project, which ruined any chance we had of getting marketing support at launch.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Survival by a thousand cuts">2. Survival by a thousand cuts</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we first pitched our projects to Microsoft in 2009, we did not distinguish between retail and XBLA. Microsoft liked our concept for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and suggested that we pitch it as an XBLA title. The problem was that our initial </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> pitch was envisaged as a title focused around user-generated content, with players creating their own haunted houses, doing their own monster animations via motion capture, and so on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By the time the project was signed, we’d scaled this down massively but were still promising “unlimited replayability” as one of our core pillars as a legacy of that initial concept. Half way through production we were forced to cut that pillar, and the end product features almost no replay value whatsoever. We cut tons of items from our burn list at several points, since it was the only way we could hit the quality bar with the resources available.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was a major letdown, and most reviews specifically point out that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a short experience with low replayability, which has cost us some Metacritic points for sure. At the time, we were hoping that games such as Limbo had made the prospect of quality-over-quantity titles more acceptable, but this ended up not being the case for us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the start, we were committed to using Kinect not as a tool to emulate Wii party games but as a way to bring the players into deeper experiences. For Kinect titles, where a significant amount of resources will be spent on refining the input methods, perhaps this “deeper” form is better off for retail titles, because on our limited XBLA budget, we found that three hours of quality left us with zero room for replayable features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps the only thing saving </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from utter disaster was Zoe Mode’s use of Scrum. Throughout development we were able to rapidly reprioritize our focus and iterate on things until they felt right. The scope kept on dropping, but the quality remained high.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would definitely suggest that any dev team embarking on its first Kinect project plan to at least double the usual contingency into its budget. There’s no avoiding the fact that to make an idea work with Kinect, all kinds of tweaks and workarounds will be required. In order to make room for this we had no option to cut, cut, and cut again.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, June/July 2012.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Moving goalposts and target market confusion">3. Moving goalposts and target market confusion</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was something of an experiment on several fronts. It was originally part of an initiative to get Japanese creators involved with Kinect, but our specific brief was considerably wider. As was the case with Parappa, Microsoft hoped that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be a title that appealed to both core and casual gamers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During development, the primary focus shifted like disturbed tectonic plates. At the initial pitching phase the goal was clear—get casual Kinect owners to “dip in” to XBLA—but at kickoff, in order to fit in with Microsoft’s keynote theme for Tokyo Game Show 2010, we were announced as one of a batch of titles intended to appeal to “core” gamers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was never clear which group we should specifically target, so we did our best to appeal to both, and we ended up making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> easier than core gamers preferred. Having said that, we’re pretty happy that the game does indeed have “universal appeal,” but upon releasing the title, it was evident that XBLA was truly the domain of core users. Should </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have been targeted more at those core users? Should it have been a retail title and marketed specifically to the mainstream? We never really addressed these issues by the time the game shipped. Instead, we were hoping that the game would create a new market, but we hadn’t done any spadework to create that niche.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, June/July 2012.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Nonexistent marketing and community management">4. Nonexistent marketing and community management</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At NanaOn-Sha, we don’t have any aspirations to self-publish. We focus on making games, and we’re happy to let our publishing partners take care of marketing and community aspects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wasn’t specifically envisioned as an XBLA title, and we never really adapted our mindset to developing an XBLA game. Microsoft told us on a couple of occasions during development that it wasn’t responsible for marketing XBLA titles, but I don’t think we ever fully took that to heart. The fact that just weeks into the project we were being showcased at TGS perhaps gave us the impression that there was actually room for some marketing assistance, but to be brutally honest, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> faded almost completely out of the public mind after that initial showing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m not sure if people in the West are really aware of this, but it’s very difficult to gain mindshare in the West from an office in Tokyo. Out of sight, out of mind. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was never really a part of the conversation in the Western press. Our only real chance to recapture some mindshare was TGS 2011, but we bungled the opportunity. Not only was this TGS notable for its scarcity of Western press, but we had only a single booth that we had to share with two other titles, and most of the time, it didn’t even have a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sign. Furthermore, our demo featured a level from the middle of the game that was too difficult for newcomers, and the atmosphere of the title was drowned out by the din and glaring lights of the show floor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overall, we were semi-aware that marketing was kind of our responsibility, but a number of issues stopped us from really tackling it. We had no in-house expertise in this area, and we all preferred to spend our time making games. Also, we hadn’t budgeted for it, so we couldn’t afford to bring in any specialist resources to help. Finally, any marketing that we wanted to do had to be vetted by the publisher. Put all these together and we had a genuine heads-in-the-sand issue that truly came to bite us when the game was eventually released.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Poor use of usability testing">5. Poor use of usability testing</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Usability testing and playtesting is vital when you’re working with something as analogous as Kinect. How you initially envision the game, how it’s implemented, how Kinect reads players, and how players perceive what they’re doing is all part of an opaque game of telephone in which you’ll inevitably have to make tweaks and additions to make the game as user-friendly as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sadly for us, our attempts at usability and playtesting were too few, often flawed, and occasionally detrimental.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our first usability session came after we produced our vertical slice fi ve months into the project. It took place in Washington, and none of the dev team were able to attend, which was a real shame, because certain problems arose that we didn’t anticipate. We didn’t instruct the session manager to calibrate the Kinect sensor before the session, so the Kinect mic didn’t register any sounds by the player, which broke parts of the level. It was so frustrating to watch the videos and be unable to do anything about it. But we took what lessons we could from the experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps the biggest lesson from this session was that you cannot take for granted players’ understanding of text prompts in the game. Some were interpreted in ways we would never have imagined; one of the attack gestures is labeled “thrust,” meaning players should stab at the ghost to hit it, but one player interpreted it as a pelvic thrust! You can imagine this issue worsening once it was localized, so to hedge the problem we included 3D arrows indicating direction of action for all gestures. Even with this, some players were still performing unexpected gestures, so we also added bodypose silhouettes where we could. Ideally we’d have animated these for maximum clarity, but it was beyond our scope.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After that usability session, we brushed ourselves off and thought, “Never mind, we’ll be more thorough in our preparations for the next one.” Unfortunately, that was to be our fi rst and last true usability session of the entire project. We were unable to secure further access to the usability team, so in the end we resorted to doing impromptu sessions ourselves using staff, friends, and family. It was better than nothing, but by the time we got around to this, there wasn’t really enough time to make changes based on the results.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the same period, in lieu of any true usability or playtesting, we received occasional feedback from assorted Microsoft employees in Redmond, but it never seemed to correlate with our own data. In the end, usability ended up becoming a political tool for our debates on the navigation system, when it would have been far more useful to focus on the minutiae of the game to improve the moment-to-moment experience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A haunting experience">A haunting experience</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From a purely selfish perspective, we’re quite happy with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We managed to release a charming title, with a unique control scheme and a memorable voiceover, and we did it all in just one year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our biggest mistake was a failure to convince our client that the final product was worthy of marketing support, and our inability to compensate when they didn’t come to that conclusion themselves. Now that the product has been on the market for a few months, and the Metacritic score is comparatively high for a Kinect title, we’re starting to see those reservations thaw. The next step will be to talk about where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fits in the overall strategy, because as a digital title, there is still plenty of time for promotions, and some exposure around Halloween could still reap some dividends.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Any title that is unique—and doesn’t fit logically into your client’s portfolio strategy—will always be a risk, and only the customers can decide the outcome of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s destiny. In the meantime, I’m certain that NanaOn-Sha will continue to make innovative, trend-bucking video games. After all, that’s what publishers always ask us for!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-q3-2024-financial-report-cites-growth-for-magic-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Hasbro Q3 2024 financial earnings report has been released. The report by one of the world's largest toy and game companies cites a decline in revenue alongside growth with their tabletop properties, specifically the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set and the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024 books.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/8150e0fd-4d0f-4f25-a904-639e74eb79c2">Hasbro Q3 2024</a> report, the company's revenue decline 15%. Excluding the divestiture of their film company eOne which produced the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> movie</a>, that revenue decline becomes 9%.</p>

<p>But this doesn't mean Hasbro has lost money. In fact, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is marked as a standout in growth for this financial quarter, lead by the release of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Bloomburrow</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/this-new-mechanic-is-magic-gathering-duskmourns-ultimate-weapon" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Duskmourn</em></a> sets and set to grow with the recently announced licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marvel cards</a>.</p>

<p>The wildly popular card game's revenue has increased 3% behind growth in both tabletop and the digital platform <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-gathering-arena" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, the Hasbro Q3 2024 report states the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 Player's Handbook</a> is the fastest selling product in the fantasy TTRPG's 50-year history, beating plan by over 50%. This, combined with ongoing support for D&amp;D Beyond has lead to more than 19 million registered users on the digital platform alongside 60% increase in revenue.</p>

<p>Before this earnings report went live, Hasbro announced <a href="https://toybook.com/hasbro-organizational-changes-fall-2024/">sweeping organizational changes</a>. This "operational streamlining" of their staff included laying off 100 employees. Among those employees were four <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/hasbro-hit-with-layoffs-wizards-of-the-coast-impacted.707539/">from Wizards of the Coast</a>, including creator relations manager Dixon Dubow.</p>

<p>Overall, Hasbro has reported a year to date operating profit of $630 million with a $98 million dividend payout to their shareholders.</p>

            <p>I played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> for an hour, had a pleasant time, then uninstalled it. I know a trap when I see one. Perhaps you are made of stronger stuff than I am, however. Perhaps you like that monkey on your back. For you, there's a new free update, which adds a second set of themed card art to the game inspired by the games Binding Of Isaac, Cyberpunk 2077, Stardew Valley and Slay The Spire.

<p>These aren't new cards, they're just card skins and so only make a cosmetic difference to the game. You can switch to the new card art via a new Customise Deck settings menu in-game. Or presumably a "Customize Deck" menu, but I can't bring myself to spell it that way.
</p>
<p>The first Friends Of Jimbo free update dropped back in August and likewise added card art related to four other games: The Witcher 3, Dave The Diver, Vampire Survivors and Among Us. 
</p>
<p>While my time with Balatro was short, other treehouse dwellers here at RPS dove deeper into the decks. Katharine gave it a Bestest Best in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-review">Balatro review</a>, and made a strong case for the worthiness of spending time with it:
</p>
<blockquote>Ultimately, Balatro is a game that delights in the art of making numbers go up - big, fast and on fire - by whatever means necessary. It reels you back in not to exploit psychological weakness, but to celebrate the inherent joy of learning, mastering and beating a system gamed around impossible odds, all while being just a teeny bit naughty in the process. It not only invites you to sit at the table, but openly hands you all manner of scalpels to tear into it, make it bleed, and gut it for everything it's worth - and it will smile and applaud you for it every step of the way. Balatro is very generous, in that sense, even when victories are seemingly few and far between. Indeed, the only way I ever felt cheated by Balatro is when I had to stop playing and not spend more time playing Balatro.</blockquote>
<p>Sounds great! I'm still not falling for it, though. Sure, Katharine said all that back in February, but has anyone heard from her since? </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It has been a long-term concern by fans of the first game that Beyond Good and Evil 2 was no longer in the works. However, it was recently confirmed that it is, and now we've received news via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fawzi-mesmar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> that Fawzi Mesmar is joining the team as Creative Director. This was announced publicly on LinkedIn, with Mesmar announcing his new role at Ubisoft Montpellier, after previously working as Vice President of Editorial over at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Emile Morel was the previous Creative Director for the title but unfortunately passed away suddenly last year. This led to Mesmar filling the role. This industry veteran has over 20 years of experience in the industry, working for companies such as DICE, King, and Gameloft. He additionally won an Ambassador Award at the 2024 Game Developer's Choice Awards.</p>
<p>For many, this news comes as a shock, as Beyond Good and Evil 2 was first announced in 2008, with a trailer being released during Ubisoft's 2017 E3 conference, and there has been very minimal information about the sequel since then. The original director Michel Ancel even left Ubisoft in 2020, and now works in a wildlife sanctuary instead. However, he is now consulting on a new Rayman project.</p>
<p>While there hasn't been any news on Beyond Good and Evil 2, a 4K remake of the original was released earlier this year. However, this meant that the original version of the game was removed, and people were forced to buy the 20th Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>With Beyond Good and Evil 2 still reportedly being in development, this now makes it the longest development time for a AAA game, with Duke Nukem Forever's record being fifteen years. It's said that development has taken so long due to toxic leadership, chaotic direction and constant gridlock when it came to making decisions about how the game was going to look, and what features would be in the game.</p>
<p>In addition to Fawzi Mesmar joining the team, Francide Coldeboeuf is now taking over as Producer on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/">struggles Ubisoft</a> has been dealing with their other projects, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-isnt-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer/"> XDefiant</a> not performing to their expectations, it's quite a surprise that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development all these years later.</p>
<p>However, the title has reportedly passed an internal milestone with positive feedback from the leadership, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Kotaku</a>. Whether that means that the game is actually progressing nicely is uncertain, and it's anyone's guess as to when the audience will finally see this game come to fruition.</p>

Highlights in the patch notes include more forgiving stealth conditions in “False Flag” and other missions, fewer collisions while riding speeders, more auto-saves while playing, and scaled “wanted” difficulty based on player progression. A bunch of bugs were also addressed, while overall stability and framerate drops are also supposed to be better.</p><p>Unfortunately, the thing many players on PS5 instantly noticed after booting the game up post-update wasn’t any of these improvements but a noticeable visual downgrade with screen tearing, i.e. ripples across your TV while navigating the world and even menus.

That patch is supposed to go even more deeply into fine-tuning combat and stealthy systems, with a Lando-based story pack and free new contract mission types also getting added that month. That’s just in time to make it an extra appealing Black Friday discount pickup for anyone who hasn’t already given the Han Solo simulator a try, at least as long as no more visual bugs get introduced along the way. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first will take place a week into the new season, which begins on December 10. Rather than a direct return to the 2-2-2 role spread of the original <em>Overwatch</em>, this test will require the team to have at least one hero of each role, but no more than three per team composition. For example, in a six-person team, you could have one tank, one DPS, and one support, and as long as those are accounted for, the other three players can freely pick whatever hero they want so long as there are no more than three per role. This way you’ll definitely have at least one person on healing and another person to tank, so a group can’t just queue up with six damage heroes.</p><p>The second test will take place midway through the season, but will “incorporate some new principles” from the sequel like incorporating hero reworks and deprioritizing crowd control abilities.

This means you can finally have two tanks again, but they will have the nerfs associated with the open queue format, so they won’t be quite as powerful as they are in the current, standard role-locked play. This will also include a midseason game mode codenamed “Kingmaker” that will reward any player who is the lone person in one role with a “bonus,” but they didn’t get any more specific than that.</p><p>Blizzard says it’s going to look at the reaction to these tests and determine what’s next, but the studio says there’s a possibility that both 5v5 and 6v6 could exist in the game simultaneously, which might be the best of both worlds, though it does sound like a lot to manage for a team that has seen such drastic cuts in the past year.</p><p>This is probably exactly what some folks who miss the days of the original <em>Overwatch </em>were hoping for, but I still find it hard to get too excited about <em>Overwatch 2</em> when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897">it’s given me so little in the past two years</a></span>. Maybe the return of folks coming back to the game to relive the glory days will be enough to rejuvenate my love for it. We’ll see when Season 14 starts in December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Surgent Studios Unveils Tales of Kenzera: Project Uso]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-tales-of-kenzera-uso/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surgent-studios-unveils-tales-of-kenzera-project-uso.1018881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-tales-of-kenzera-uso/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Surgent Studios, the creator behind Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, has unveiled Project Uso, the next game in the multimedia universe pioneered by the creative mind of Abubakar Salim. In a release issued by Surgent today, it was confirmed that Project Uso will be ‘darker and more visceral than our debut game.’</p>



<p>It’s a return to Kenzera but in a completely alternate aesthetic. Project Uso will be centred around a ‘vampiric android’ that’s designed to house the spirits of the deceased. It’s set to be a crossover between a choice-driven RPG and an ‘electrifying’ beat-em-up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-next-chapter">The Next Chapter</h2>



<p>Recently, Surgent Studios was in the news following the revelation that the games branch of the firm had been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-studios-game-division-redundancies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put on notice of potential redundancy</a>. This news came amid financial struggles and a lack of funding for future projects – including Project Uso.</p>



<p>The press release published by Surgent Studios to mark the announcement of Project Uso bore that message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Surgent Studios has developed a fully-functional prototype of PROJECT USO and is actively seeking a partner to bring it to life.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a statement attached to the press release, Surgent’s founder, Abubakar Salim, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Project Uso is set to be darker and more visceral than our debut game. Where ZAU is about dealing with death in a healthy way, USO is about letting your fear of death consume you. Inspiration struck following the birth of my daughter, when I grappled with a crisis of identity as I took on the role of parent for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Similarly, the concept for Tales of Kenzera: ZAU came about when Salim was wrestling with the untimely loss of his father and trying desperately to figure out how to cope with the grief that followed.</p>



<p>In Uso, players will assume control of a unique RPG system created by Surgent. They’ll have ‘the powers of an android and a god at their disposal’, given that the protagonist houses the spirit of Eshu, ‘the god of chaos’. </p>



<p>At first blush, it sounds a little deeper than ZAU in terms of gameplay mechanics, and the choice-based features should add a little more variety and replayability, whereas ZAU was much more linear and one-track. Project Uso is also set ‘decades’ after ZAU, so the world is much more advanced.</p>



<p>Here’s hoping Surgent manages to find a partner to help produce Project Uso.</p>

			<p>It's not long until the long-awaited release of the next installment in the Dragon Age franchise. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is just around the corner, with a release date of October 31. To celebrate the game being in a countdown period, EA and BioWare revealed the official launch trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The trailer is just over two minutes long and showcases some of the enemies that players can expect to encounter. The trailer is comprised of gameplay and in-game cinematics to show those interested in the game what they could be experiencing by playing the upcoming title.</p>
<p>To get people excited, it showcases the darkspawn, blighted dragons, and some of the treacherous choices Rook will have to make alongside their companions, which could have a lasting effect on their relationship. Rook and their companions are on a long, perilous journey to defy the gods, which will have consequences depending on their actions. In this game,<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-speaks-on-how-balancing-reappearing-characters-and-solas-role-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard/"> Solas is front and center</a>, which is a first for the franchise. Solas was first introduced in Dragon Age: Inquisition and had one of the biggest plot twists in the franchise, which led up to Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdtmtuzICOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This single-player fantasy RPG will be released worldwide on October 31 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. For those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who have pre-ordered the game</a>, you'll receive Rook's Blood Dragon armor cosmetic for the three classes available: Warrior, Mage, and Rogue. Fans have been waiting for this game for 10 years, and the comments under the YouTube video show off all of the excitement of those who love the franchise.</p>
<p>There is also some criticism in the comments, saying that this trailer should have been used as the reveal trailer, as there were a lot of complaints when the reveal trailer came out. However, this trailer seems to be the one that is turning the tide and making people excited for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. If you want to check out the trailer, make sure to check out the video above, which showcases some of what you can expect.</p>
<p>The video showcases stunning graphics and effects, with the world being consumed by blight. There are many different environments that players will get to explore, including bustling cities, empty beaches and catacombs.</p>
<p>If you want to know whether this game will be for you, check out<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/"> our preview of the game</a>, written by Kai Tatsumoto.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windblown">Windblown</a> looks rad. It's an action-roguelite for 1-3 players in which you dash-and-slash in rapid combat on floating islands, and I am extremely interested in feeling its game-feel for myself. Good news! I can get my game-feelers on it now because it's out in Early Access today.
</p>
<p>If you watch its launch trailer below out of context however, you might be fooled into thinking it's actually the emo second half of an Isekai anime series.

<figcaption>Windblown's launch trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPJER9uu8yE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>My interest in Windblown is partly driven by its trailers, but also by Motion Twin's previous game, Dead Cells, which was also an action roguelite that nailed game-feel from the off and was fun to follow through its Early Access journey.
</p>
<p>The dash impressed Edwin when he saw Windblown <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-cells-developers-new-roguelike-windsblown-has-a-dash-so-potent-it-makes-the-game-seem-disposable">earlier this year</a>, although he worried it was so powerful and quick it rendered the experience disposable:
</p>
<blockquote>Windblown's dash seems expressive, at times, of deep impatience towards the rest of the game, which sounds perverse on the surface, but makes sense when you consider the roguelike's intrinsic element of repetition. It's a dash dedicated to the experienced player's desire to immediately return to the biome where they last popped their clogs. There are some familiar elements that slow you down, however: boss enemies that must be fought to progress the story, and the basic pressure to defeat foes and gather new equipment, or else get your arse handed to you by an unskippable threat in the next biome along.</blockquote>
<p>Motion Twin reckon Windblown will remain in Early Access for at least a year, but it's already launched in a substantive state with 5 biomes and 12 main weapons. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911610/Windblown/">grab it from Steam</a> with a 20% launch discount for £17.59/$20/€20.

<p>The VCT Spotlight Series has officially concluded, crowning GIANTX as the winner. The popular co-ed tournament series was developed to give fans competitive Valorant action during the off-season. With 14 teams participating and a decent-sized prize pool, the series ended with quite a bang.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-vct-spotlight-series-concludes-with-giantx-taking-first-place">VCT Spotlight Series Concludes With GIANTX Taking First Place</h2>



<p>The VCT Spotlight series began back on October 10, 2024, and concluded today, October 24. Held in Paris, the event featured 14 co-ed teams formed from some of the best organizations within the VCT.</p>



<p>From G2 Esports to Karmine Corp, the VCT Spotlight Series was stacked with Valorant talent, and fans were able to witness both women and male competitors face off against one another. </p>



<p>Each team had both women and male members from its roster team up to face off against other organizations with a $32,000 prize pool on the line. In the end, however, GIANTX was able to take home first place by beating G2 Esports in a 3-1 victory.</p>



<p>The organization took to Twitter earlier today to post: “We have taken our revenge and made history by winning the first VCT EMEA mixed competition.”</p>

<p>History was in fact made, and it will be interesting to see how to organization performs next year. </p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-prize-pool-competing-teams-and-more">Prize Pool, Competing Teams and More</h2>



<p>The event marks a victorious era in competitive Valorant content, showing that normal tournaments are not the only types of tournaments here to stay. </p>



<p>With a $32,000 prize pool, GIANTX was able to walk away with $16,000. G2 Esports, who finished in second, left the tournament series with almost $11,000 in winnings. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-competing-teams">All Competing Teams:</h4>



<ul>
<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Karmine Corp</li>



<li>GIANTX</li>



<li>BBL Esports</li>



<li>KOI</li>



<li>ALTERNATE aTTaX</li>

<li>NOVO Esports</li>



<li>SK Gaming</li>



<li>Twisted Minds</li>



<li>Valiant</li>



<li>ZERANCE</li>
</ul>



<p>What’s even cooler is the fact that the event had 26 different nationalities represented by the players. These included Germany, the United States, Palestine and more.</p>



<p>With the event being extremely successful, it will be exciting to see if the prize pool rises for next year’s tournament.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Few games defined the Xbox 360/PS3/Wii generation as much as Bioware’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition">Mass Effect</a> trilogy. Whether you picked the red strawberry, blue raspberry, or green apple ending, characters like Commander Shepard, Wrex, Garrus, and others have become icons among the video game pantheon. Which is to say that when Mass Effect: The Board Game - Priority: Hagalaz was announced, I was stoked, and even more so when I got an early copy to play for this review. After rolling some dice with my old crew from the Normandy, I have to say, this board game version of Mass Effect is a pretty fun little romp.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mass Effect: The Board Game – Priority: Hagalaz</h2><div catalogid="7687b88c-2182-47f7-b35c-3978a43574ba" id="207003"><div id="207003" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mass Effect: The Board Game – Priority: Hagalaz</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Eric Lang and Calvin Wong Tze Loon (both of whom we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-preview">interviewed</a> in our preview) with art by David Benzal, Priority: Hagalaz,<em> </em>in Mass Effect style, is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a> with branching quests and alternate endings. More than 10 unique missions are neatly bound together in a campaign book containing each missions' map, along with the various objectives (each mission has neutral, paragon, and renegade objectives) and the list of the enemies you'll be facing. This campaign book, paired with a narrative book, handles the story and what the results of your actions turn out to be. Like I said in my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-review">review of the Divinity: Original Sin board game</a>, I love that more campaign games are opting to use books for their maps and are shifting away from the cardboard titles to construct the maps yourself. It makes it so much quicker to set up, and that makes this game all that more enticing to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Except for the player characters’ miniatures, the game’s components are full of cardboard tokens. From the enemies and elites to the treasure boxes and objectives, you can expect maps full of little markers. Thankfully, the cardboard is sturdy and punches easily with no tearing or pulling happening with my copy. Still, if you prefer to cram your board with plastic minis, then you can opt to purchase them separately from <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ywY2n?object_uuid=572fe1d6-d74f-47c2-916b-151eacfd9d55&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Modiphius’ store</a>, but expect to pay a hefty price, ranging from about $38 US for a single squad up to $325 US for 48 models (some assembly required and unpainted). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The player boards, one for each available character, is made of a sturdy laminated paper that allows it to be marked up with the included dry-erase marker. Each time a character levels up by gaining enough experience, you mark on the board to keep track of that character’s experience or skills they've unlocked, with one new skill unlockable per mission. It works fine, and so far I haven’t seen much in the way of staining due to the marker, but that being said, I wish that the game had gone with a duel-layered playboard instead with little areas that you would just slot in cubes or cards or something instead of the marker approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on these dangerous missions will of course require a hardened group of soldiers, and Priority: Hagalaz<em> </em>features a great selection of fan favorite Mass Effect <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect/Squadmates">squadmates</a>. Both male and fem Sheps are available to choose from, with identical skills and stats, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect/Garrus_Vakarian">Garrus</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect/Liara_T'Soni">Liara</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect/Urdnot_Wrex">Wrex</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect/Tali%27Zorah_nar_Rayya">Tali</a> each come with a unique set of skills that work best in different situations. Garrus, for instance, can take aim and dish out a bunch of damage all at once; Tali can send out her drone; Liara can use her biotics to freeze enemies in place with Statis; Wrex gets mad and takes it out on any unfortunate Cerberus soldier or Reaper near him; and Shepard can inspire and command the troops, letting them perform better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Missions require you to take four party members, one of whom must be Shepard (and loyalty missions require said character as well), which means you will always have to leave one of your alien friends behind on the Normandy. Every character has their own unlockable skill tree, including special abilities that can be learned by taking on their loyalty missions between main mission scenarios. Wrex has by far the best-named skills out of everyone, with attacks like “Wrex not happy” and “Shoot it 46 more times” that are just peak Krogan goodness. There will be missions where Character A will be better suited to handle the objectives than Character B, but Mass Effect is balanced in a way that you are never screwing yourself over if you don’t take that one crew member with you. Strategy and not spreading your team too thin is far more important than its composition, which I find to be faithful to the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that I really appreciate about Priority: Hagalaz is that it doesn't require players to meet up for a ton of games in order to see the story through to completion. In fact, with each scenario taking maybe 40 - 90 minutes, and each “run” of the story consisting of about five scenarios, you could comfortably make it through a playthrough in a day or weekend. No yearlong-plus commitments here! Now, if you want to see every outcome, then that will require a bigger time commitment and multiple playthroughs, but I wouldn't say that's necessary. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The designers should be commended for putting together a solid and rewarding campaign experience that supports multiple replays but is also welcoming to new players of the genre without much sacrifice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting into a game is pretty painless. All you have to do is flip to the correct page in the campaign book, pull that level’s enemy tokens from the included cloth bag and place them on the marked spots, grab either the Cerberus or Reaper hazard deck, and finally place your character minis at the starting location and you’re ready to go. The whole process maybe takes five minutes. Learning to play is also a straightforward affair with everyone I taught usually picking it up after a full round around the table. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turns start with the active player <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">rolling a set of dice</a>, picking three dice and using the face’s displayed actions by placing it on their boards. Then you draw a hazard card to see what enemies spawn or take an action, and then the turn passes to the next player who repeats the same steps. Each subsequent player rolls three less dice for their actions, meaning the last player is forced into whatever they roll – however, everyone but the first player can “lock” one of the dice that the previous player rolled and didn’t use. If you opt to complete the Paragon objectives in stages, you can earn yourself additional dice. Choose Renegade, and you earn special tokens you can use to change the face of a dice you roll.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reduction in dice is an interesting mechanic, but I would have rather have a smaller pool of dice, perhaps five, that everyone rolled as opposed to a shrinking pool of dice. It feels good to roll a lot of dice, giving you a lot of choice, but if you’re stuck at the end, only getting a few dice to roll – or less if you opt to lock in one the previous dice to play it safe – it’s not so much fun. You feel penalized, at no fault of your own, that you are last in the turn order, and I would much prefer giving up my ability to roll 12 dice as first player, if it means someone doesn’t get stuck with only three.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps my biggest issue with this game is the character Shepard and the mechanic that if they get taken out, the whole mission fails immediately. While this may be loyal with how it’s handled in the video games, in those, you never lose control over Shepard and can always move him out of harm's way – something that you can’t do here in the board game. Here, you have four randomly drawn enemy turns standing between you and when you can act next, with no real way to defend yourself if the cards aren’t in your favor. Instead of being the hero of humanity, who would run into any fight alongside their crew, this makes Shepard feel more like a liability or third wheel that should stay at home where it’s safe. I have had more than one mission fail simply because I died, and in one of them I was even at full health at the end of my turn, and everything went downhill before I could take any action. Had the game added a round timer or something that gave the rest of the party a chance to revive him, it may alleviate my issue with this decision, but as written, I quickly stopped wanting to be the person stuck playing as the Commander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This issue also touches on another aspect of Priority: Hagalaz, which prospective players should know. If you aren’t a fan of uncontrollable randomness in your games, this game may not be for you. From the actions you can take via the roll of the dice, to what enemies may or may not take action (and what character may be attacked), even to what enemies you may spawn by drawing them from the bag, is all left up to chance – chance that you and the other players have no way of mitigating. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect: The Board Game - Priority: Hagalaz releases this October just in time for N7 day (November 7), with pre-orders available now on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEV73M?object_uuid=572fe1d6-d74f-47c2-916b-151eacfd9d55&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Amazon</strong></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVmGq?object_uuid=572fe1d6-d74f-47c2-916b-151eacfd9d55&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1596000954.1718032005" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Asmodee</strong></a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bEvE?object_uuid=572fe1d6-d74f-47c2-916b-151eacfd9d55&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><strong>Modiphius’ website</strong></u></a>. </p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 24, 2024 6:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Mass Effect: The Board Game - Priority: Hagalaz does a good job adapting the personalities and gameplay of Bioware’s legendary space epic while offering some fun twists to the formula to make it work with this new cardboard medium. While it doesn’t land every shot it takes, it lands enough to make it a worthwhile time for fans of the source material and also campaign-style board game aficionados or newcomers alike. The system is sound and ripe for new modules and expansions with new characters and missions. I would love a more dedicated skirmish map or pack that offers a bunch of maps that are good to fight enemies on and forgo the whole narrative aspect. Until then, I will dream about flying around space in the Normandy and rolling dice with my bros, Garrus and Wrex.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-speedrunners-just-figured-out-how-to-save-aerithand-save-two-hours<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since the release of the original Final Fantasy 7, fans have agonized over the game's biggest, best-known tragic moment: Aerith's death. Could she be saved? Was it possible? For years, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resurrecting-aerith-the-final-fantasy-7-fans-who-re-wrote-fate">rumors have abounded about secret ways to save her and keep her in the party</a>. And now, speedrunners have found a path to keeping her around that may also be a massive time-saver.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discovered by speedrunners AceZephyr and Kuma and publicized by Luzbel, a new skip allows players to jump from Midgar all the way to Forgotten Capital with Aerith still in the party. Because it skips the part of the game where Aerith leaves the party, she sticks around, and ultimately witnesses her own death at the hands of Sephiroth only to join the battle against Jenova Life moments later.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The biggest skip in FF7 has been found. <a href="https://t.co/HXVfrbOJd4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HXVfrbOJd4</a></p>— Luzbel / ルズベル (@Luzbel789) <a href="https://twitter.com/Luzbel789/status/1848974866516742269?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The actual skip is pretty complex and the kinks are still being worked out. It involves using a Chocobo on the world map to trick the game into letting you walk on the ocean, and then Cloud simply strolls across the water over to Forgotten Capital without doing any of the other stuff required to get there. The cutscene there plays as normal, but the party composition remains what it was before. Kuma's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x02RR6qZb9E" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got a tutorial on YouTube here</a> for anyone interested in trying it themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, there are a lot of asterisks on this skip actually working. For one, if you don't use a version of the game that lets you disable encounters, the skip is impossible, because getting into an encounter while walking on the water will softlock the game. And because Aerith isn't supposed to be in the party at this stage, the game also softlocks whenever there's a scene with the party that she shouldn't be involved in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The community is currently working to try and find ways around this, including <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2282022243" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one agonizing five-hour effort from AceZephyr</a> using pause buffering to avoid encounters while walking across the water. Hopefully they find one, because if it ever becomes viable it will supposedly save runners around two hours, allowing them to blast through disc one faster than ever.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If this has sparked your interest in Final Fantasy 7 again, you don't need to speedrun the original to enjoy it. Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth are pretty incredible too, and together they cover a sliiiiightly different version of all the story that speedrunners are skipping on ye olde disc one. We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">Final Fantasy 7 Remake an 8/10</a>, and Rebirth got a 9/10. Our reviewer wrote: "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion as both a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth, and as an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>
Following Blizzard's announcement earlier this year it was considering bringing 6v6 matches to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, having ditched them when it transitioned from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> 1 to its sequel, the studio has now made their reintroduction official: 6v6 will come to Overwatch 2 in the form of two test modes next season, and Blizzard says it'll be 'watching the results closely'
</p>
<p>
When Blizzard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-exploring-reintroduction-of-6v6-in-a-series-of-upcoming-tests">revealed it was mulling over 6v6's return</a> back in July, it explained the original mode could have "really high, highs, but reaaaally low, lows" in Overwatch 1, and that 5v5 was ultimately selected for Overwatch 2 in a bid to "raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of some of those high moments." However, the studio acknowledged the changes had come "at the cost of match variety and player freedom" and so it was looking at how 6v6 could potentially be reintroduced.
</p>
<p>
And now, four months on from that announcement, Blizzard has confirmed 6v6's imminent return. In <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion">new post on the Overwatch website</a>, game director Aaron Keller said the studio will be introducing "two different 6v6 tests" as part of Overwatch 2's upcoming Season 14. The first of these is set to launch a week into the season and will be a variation of Open Queue - requiring each team to have at least one of each role but no more than three, with players able to switch roles on the fly during a match as long as the limit isn't broken.

<p>
Blizzard's second 6v6 test will arrive as part of Season 14's mid-season refresh, offering the classic 2-2-2 team composition while incorporating some of Overwatch 2's "new principles", such as less crowd control and hero rework. Both test modes will feature rebalancing specific to 6v6 - such as a reduction in the power and survivability of tanks - but they'll still have their own card in Unranked alongside other modes. Keller says the goal of Season 14's 6v6 format tests is to understand if it "can make the core game even stronger", adding that it'll be "watching the reception and results of these tests closely."
</p><p>
"In the world where a surge of players join this mode and continuously play it, then we have the signal we need to do more with it," Keller continued. "I think what that 'more' is depends on the level of excitement. Is there a world where both 5v5 and 6v6 exist permanently in Overwatch 2? If you had asked me a few months ago, I would have said no. As we've discussed Overwatch 2's future... we know our players can want more than one experience, and it would be something we'd need to consider moving forward."
</p>
<p>
Notably, Blizzard isn't stopping at experimenting with a potential 6v6 mode. It also plans to test variants of Overwatch 2's existing 5v5 mode as part of Season 13, examining the "flexibility within this format". There's a Quick Play: Hacked variant called Limit 2 coming soon, which caps each role per team at two, and there's a mid-season mode called Kingmaker that'll feature Limit 2's role cap while giving a bonus to the player not sharing a role.
</p>
<p>
Blizzard says it'll have more information on all the above "closer to their launches".

            <p>Blizzard announced earlier this year that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzcon-wont-happen-in-2024">BlizzCon wouldn't happen in 2024</a>, with the live event instead being replaced by a series of franchise-focused streams. Next on the schedule is Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct, which Blizzard have now announced will stream on Wednesday, November 13th at 6pm GMT/1pm ET/10am PT.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It's a big year for the Warcraft universe and whether you're a Hearthstone fan, you've joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you're a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> player, there's something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream," according <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24149105/save-the-date-for-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-on-november-13">to the announcement</a>. "You won't want to miss a moment - or a single surprise."
</p>
<p>The stream will be followed by a 20th anniversary concert celebrating 20 years of World Of Warcraft music.
</p>
<p>World Of Warcraft's The War Within launched earlier this year, but Blizzard have already spoken about it being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcrafts-next-three-expansions-have-been-announced-starting-with-the-war-within">the first in a trilogy of new expansions</a>. The next in line is World Of Warcraft: Midnight, which will then be followed by The Last Titan. 
</p>
<p>An expansion aside, I've no idea what other surprises or announcements could appear at the event. Hopefully something less disappointing than Warcraft 3 Reforged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warcraft-3-reforged-review">turned out to be</a>, and more exciting than a mobile game like Warcraft Rumble.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
