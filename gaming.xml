			<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is setting out to be one of the most visually impressive games launching this year, as the latest iteration of id Software's proprietary engine has fully embraced cutting-edge technology to deliver a complex game world at high performance.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VawgKaIfbg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> shared today, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a first look at what the id Tech 8 engine delivers in the new entry in the series. While the demo that media played did not feature path tracing, it did feature regular ray tracing, which included ray-traced reflections like in DOOM Eternal and ray-traced global illumination in the vein of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,</a> which is powered by the same engine.</p>
<p>Both work extremely well. The Siege map, for example, features a lot of reflective surfaces, which wasn't entirely expected, given the change to a more naturalistic environment over past entries in the series. This change also makes ray-traced global illumination shine, delivering more accurate lighting through vast spaces lit almost entirely with natural light sources like fire and the sun. Additionally, the emphasis on dynamic objects and the removal of baked lighting makes said objects blend more seamlessly into the environment, resulting in a more pleasing visual experience.</p>
<p>Besides ray tracing features and the robust physics simulation DOOM: The Dark Ages features, the game also seems to feature a virtualized geometry system similar to Unreal Engine 5's Nanite. While this couldn't be confirmed at the time, the behavior of some visual elements, such as the absence of LOD swapping, heavily suggests this system is being used. Targeting 60 FPS with this virtualized geometry system in place together with high enemy numbers on screen, the ray-traced lighting and reflections, and the physics simulation show the amazing potential of the id Tech 8 engine. What remains to be seen is how it will actually deliver all this on consoles, but id Software has already proved in the past to have the technical chops to deliver solid experiences on all sorts of hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/sam-riegel-talks-wildmount-wildlings-beau-and-yashas-adoption-plans-and-campers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've only just seen the close of Critical Role Season 3, some entertaining sponsored games related to the world of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c9d86c47-b86e-43a2-bfe0-a023f6d37eee" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-story-attempting-to-hit-word-limit" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a> and <em>Suikoden</em>, but Critical Role fans are in luck because this week we go back to Exandria. Sam Riegel is the GM for <a href="https://critrole.com/wildemount-wildlings/" rel="nofollow">Wildmount Wildlings</a>, a new adventure following Veth, Yasha, and Beau as they attempt to help some troubled campers earn some badges.</p>

<p>Ahead of the shows release on <strong>April 3rd</strong>, 10th, and 17th at <strong>6pm Pacific</strong> I got to sit down with the GM and Camp Director Sam Riegel to hear what it was like to bring his home game back to the public, where this game picks up, and what level of "rules lite, entertainment heavy" gameplay we can expect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"That's what the Wildmount Wildlings is, it's a camp"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//rCzXUz8UyRQ"></iframe></p>

<p>To give a brief recap of what led to the Wildmount Wildlings Riegel explained "In Campaign 2 of Critical Role Nott The Brave/Veth Brennato retired from adventuring to open a summer camp for adventuring kids. Ever since then she's been running this camp with her family."</p>

<p>Riegel explained that he's been using Veth's post-campaign story to run a game of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> at home for his children and their friends as they're campers. "They all play campers, and they learn stuff and go on adventures. Sometimes on weekend breaks they go off and explore Wildemount and it's been a lot of fun".</p>

<p>I asked him about what decision led to bringing a part of Exandria that he's taken home and made himself back to the public's eye with this mini-series. The answer came in two parts "Everything we've ever done at Critical Role starts from a place of us wanting to have fun, and us playing games". He referenced the origins of Critical Role and how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow">Vox Machina</a> began as a home game between friends. "It just felt natural to take some of the fun that I've been having at home and put it up on Beacon, and Twitch, and YouTube for our fans to see."</p>

<p>The second part of his answer referencing the business side of Critical Role as he stated "also we're between campaigns right now, we finished Campaign 3 and frankly we need stuff to put on on Thursday night and Marisha (Ray) has been amazing at programming some really great one-shots and mini-series and specials that have been airing and this just felt like a good one to throw up there and it's within our world and it's a different take on our content and we thought it would be really fun"</p>

<h2>Where in time is Wildmount Wildlings?</h2>

<p>"Right at the end of Campaign 3 Yasha and Beau were talking about what they were going to do next and I think they mentioned something about taking some time off, maybe visiting Veth at her camp, or at least taking some time off to explore and so Wildmount Wildlings, our little 3-episode series, picks up right after the events of Campaign 3 and Yasha and Beau are going to come to the camp, partly for vacation, but partly to check out what it's like to hang out with kids"</p>

<p>This did lead to a question about Yasha and Beau's other current objective, to figure out if they want to adopt a child yet, when asked if we'd be seeing them consider adopting one of these campers Riegel explained "Beau and Yasha have been debating whether to have kids, or if they're ready to be parents"</p>

<p>"I think this little three shot is a way for them to figure out where they are in their life, if they're ready for kids, what kind of parents they would be, and to work out some stuff with each other." Riegel compared it to the real life conversations that many couples have to go through when they're growing up together</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This will be [Beau and Yasha's] opportunity to have that conversation and for the audience to get a glimpse at it"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that this session was taking place after the level 20 party of The Mighty Nein took on the Weave Mind on Ruidus I did ask about how the party balance worked between seasoned adventurers and literal children.</p>

<p>"The kids are all level 1, all the kids in the O.L.G.A Cabin (Oops, Let's Go Again) are outcasts. They're underperforming kids, they need a little extra help. Beau and Yasha are being brought in to give them a little bit of tough love, almost like a scared straight program to whip them into shape so that they can advance up a level"</p>

<p>"Beau and Yasha are terribly overpowered, and could mop the floor with these kids, however Veth as a good counsellor and also Sam Riegel as a decent GM comes up with ways to nerf them so that they are a little bit less powerful"</p>

<h2>Building A World With A Childs Eye</h2>

<p>Riegel explained that when this idea was first drafted there were early thoughts to have kids be the players, "we quickly decided that that wasn't a good idea because our channel is very dirty, we have a lot of adult themes." Instead though the adventure, including monsters that the party will face, were created with the input of Riegel's children and their friends that are part of his homegame.</p>

<p>"We had these brainstorming sessions with these kids where they came up with monsters, encounters, traps, NPCs that Beau and Yasha and the campers are going to meet. Not only did we have this pitch session but you're actually going to get to see those pitch sessions."</p>

<p>When asking for clarification if those sessions would be Beacon exclusive Riegel clarified "I believe they're going to be part of the episodes. You're going to see at the beginning of each episode kids coming up with the encounters for each episode. Later when you see the monster you'll know exactly where it's coming from"</p>

<p>Moving on to talk about the cast of campers for this season – Eden Riegel (<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b75fcbb-a1e5-4678-ad54-cccd2ebfde56" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Crash Bandicoot 4</em></a>), Aleks Le (<em>Solo Leveling</em>), Brennan Lee Mulligan (<em>EXU: Calamity, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental" rel="nofollow">Dimension 20</a></em>), Libe Barer (<em>Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur, Sneaky Pete</em>) – I asked about how it was having family at the table.</p>

<p>"I've been wanting to get Eden involved in one of our shows for years now and schedules haven't aligned. But because this is my game I get to do what I want. Eden has not played a lot of <em>D&amp;D</em>, in fact this is the second time she ever played. The first time was a week earlier when she came over to my house and I taught her how to play"</p>

<p>Riegel explained that aside from Brennan Lee Mulligan, who has obviously played a lot of <em>D&amp;D</em> and TTRPGs, all of the other campers are very very new to tabletop roleplaying games. "They've either only played once, or not at all."</p>

<p>"It worked great. As level 1 campers at a camp where they're supposed to be learning about their powers it works great that they don't really know what they're doing. It fit in beautifully."</p>

<p>Riegel explained that Mulligan being an "expert in all things tabletop roleplaying" his character was able to help the other campers along.</p>

<h2>Who Are The Campers?</h2>

<p>I didn't get too much information about the campers of the O.L.G.A cabin but Riegel was able to share that "they're all between the ages of 14-16, they're all the lowest rank at the camp which is called Dainty Feet." He didn't want to spoil their introductions but that they're newly coming into their powers.</p>

<p>He referenced mages having trouble casting their spells, a rogue who isn't good at stealing or attacking."Over the course of these three episodes they sort of figure it out, or at least try to."</p>

<p>Talking about the ranks at cap Riegel began to explain that by obtaining these badges they'll work to achieve the Three Below rank.</p>

<p>Riegel talked further about the world of Wildmount Wildlings that he's build up. "For the home game I have the campgrounds set, there's different areas of the camp that I identify that the players know about that they can go to."</p>

<p>"I developed camp counsellors, other camp cabins, other campers who my kids have met, and definitely spots around the campground that they either need to avoid or that they can go interact with."</p>

<p>Listing off some of these locations Riegel told me about "the 'Do Not Hike' trail, the Hubbub Hub where they meet for camp meetings, the Gross which is the cafeteria and Phyllis the Centaur lunch lady, Salmon Lake which has no salmon in it, it's just a disgusting lake that's the color of salmon."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There's all kinds of spots that my kids are familiar with and now our audience and these campers will also be familiar with too"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the show they also had artwork developed to better define the look of the setting, a camp map, and new creations. One of these was a curfew creature that "is so adorable and weird and so I'm going to bring that into the home game."</p>

<h2>A setting for your own home games</h2>

<p>Riegel's hope for Wildmount Wildlings, a setting that he created for his kids, is that "people watch these episodes and can maybe set their own home game for their kids in this camp. It would be so cool if other people around the world were playing set in this weird camp that my kids play in"</p>

<p>Before we hit our time limit I wanted to know what Riegel really wanted to make sure the audience knew coming into this three-parter. "I hope it's going to be a fun time, as many people know who have watched me GM before, I'm Rules Lite and Entertainment Heavy. You'll see me flounder a bit as I try to remember rules, and I even turn to Brennan Lee Mulligan a few times and ask him to help me"</p>

<p>"We had a lot of fun, this series is done out of love, it's done out of family, and it really celebrates being a kid, being who you are, and just Wilding out"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-update-11-experimental</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/satisfactory-update-1-1-brings-controller-support-and-more-on-experimental-branch.1151055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-update-11-experimental<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Factory-building sim&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>has received its first post-launch update (well, via the experimental branch, at any rate), and it's bringing controller support, a photo mode overhaul, and much more.</p>

<p>The game launched out of Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-10-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>, so it's fair to say that this update has been a long time coming, but it's finally available via the game's experimental branch, although it's not yet available in the full release.</p>

<p>The first major addition for this update is controller support; you can now use your Xbox controller or your DualSense in&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, which is always nice to see. You'll need to head into the game's Options menu to select which controller you're using, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-update-1.1-experimental-controller.jpg?itok=B1qaQR1M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-update-1.1-experimental-controller.jpg?itok=HmbUXxfU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Satisfactory</em>'s 1.1 update brings controller support and more.</figcaption></figure><p>The update also brings an overhaul to&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>'s photo mode; you'll find "a multitude of new filters, effects, poses, frames, color adjustments, [and] camera lens controls", plus more.</p>

<p>You can now dismantle crash sites to get some extra resources back, and a new Personnel Elevator has been added to help you get around larger multi-level factories. Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>'s narrative has been significantly expanded; it now boasts "many, many more ADA voice lines".</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>update, you'll also find tons of other tweaks and changes that should make life on the factory floor easier. You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/520835140699555676" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full list of changes right here</a>.</p>

<p>Since this is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2025-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">April Fools' Day</a>, Coffee Stain also commemorated the release of&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1 on the Experimental Branch with a rather amusing video, which you can see below. Watch (or skip) to the end for a satisfying surprise.</p>




<p><i>Satisfactory&nbsp;</i>is a factory-building sim available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. There's been no word of console releases for the game yet, but last year's April Fools' gag <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">imagined what might happen</a> if&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>was ever ported to the Switch.</p>

"Hopefully, this is an oversight from WotC, who often use external agencies to hunt down violating content, and they will reverse their decision," they said. "Fingers crossed for Baldur's Village."</p><p>The mod makes some of Baldur's Gate 3's main characters into villagers, even giving them their own parts of the map. These include Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, Karlach, Halsin, and Astarion.

		<p>Marking the tenth anniversary of Goat Simulator’s bizarre goat-laden shenanigans, Coffee Stain North has released a brand new update for Goat Simulator 3, the latest game in the series. This free update is now live, and entitled Gifts from the Rifts.</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Gifts From The Rifts  | Free Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zba_mk_4KyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s 27 new gear items added in Gifts from the Rifts for Goat Simulator 3, while there’s two new in-game events to bring April Fools silliness to the game world of San Angora.</p>
<p>There’s also a new alternate goat model: Plushie Pilgor, to tie in with a new merch collab with YouTooz. This soft toy goat has a new ability that will turn anything in its path into a plaything as well. That’s quite a feat for Coffee Stain North to have accomplished for this game!</p>

<p>Gifts from the Rifts is available now for Goat Simulator 3 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, PC, iOS and Android. It’s coming soon for the game on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Aside from this, the Goat Direct stream was filled with other Goatee stuff. There’s <a href="https://youtu.be/l1_kh4Wse4k">a Goat Simulator: The Card Game Kickstarter</a> launching on 30th April, there’s <a href="https://youtu.be/DiNTH-CP_3U">Goat Simulator themed controllers from CRKD</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TwitchRivals/status/1904290415160832309">Goat Simulator 3 is hitting Twitch Rivals tonight</a>, a crop top wearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qZpCO5qO4">Goat is available in Fortnite</a>, and there’s the aforementioned <a href="https://youtooz.com/">YouTooz collectible Pilgor plushie</a>.</p>
<p>And then there’s just <a href="https://youtu.be/rTV5W0S4qoY">one more thing</a>…</p>

		<p>Rounding off the Goat Direct stream was a teaser for the next paid DLC expansion for Goat Simulator 3. Wherever will Pilgor be going next?</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Expansion 2 | Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTV5W0S4qoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having launched back in 2022, Pilgor’s adventures in Goat Simulator 3 continued with the 2024 expansion, Multiverse of Nonsense, with its distinctly out-of-this-world tone. But what’s next? Well, it looks quite a lot like a vast and blank desert from the teaser trailer above, but is that then a tiger or lion growling at our tongue-dropping goat? Oh dear.</p>
<p>Well, it’s just a teaser, and I’ve absolutely no doubt that Coffee Stain will have a bigger reveal as we inch closer to its release. But in the meantime, there’s plenty with which to celebrate the tenth anniversary of what started as a dumb meme game.</p>
<p>For Goat Simulator 3 specifically, there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/goat-simulator-3-gets-a-big-new-free-update-with-gifts-from-the-rifts-and-a-plushie-goat/">a free new update, Gifts from the Rifts</a>, while iOS and Android players can finally buy and play Multiverse of Nonsense.&nbsp;There’s also <a href="https://youtu.be/l1_kh4Wse4k">a Goat Simulator: The Card Game Kickstarter</a> launching on 30th April, a <a href="https://youtu.be/DiNTH-CP_3U">Goat Simulator themed controllers from CRKD</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TwitchRivals/status/1904290415160832309">Goat Simulator 3 is hitting Twitch Rivals tonight</a>, a crop top wearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qZpCO5qO4">Goat is available in Fortnite</a>, and there’s a <a href="https://youtooz.com/">YouTooz collectible Pilgor plushie</a>, which is rather cute.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent.1151010/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, just one week after Ubisoft launched its biggest game of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the company revealed it had formed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/">new subsidiary with Tencent</a> that would house its three core franchises, Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, along with the studios that work primarily on those titles.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, an alleged leaked memo from within Ubisoft reported today by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-plan-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed/">Insider-Gaming</a> seems to provide some insight into how things will be changing for the company and the impacted studios moving forward. Insider-Gaming claims the memo is from Ubisoft Montreal general manager Christophe Derennes, who now appears to have taken on the role of 'Zone 1 managing director,' per the new structure the company is shifting to with this new subsidiary.</p>
<p>For now, this memo reveals less about Ubisoft's current plans going forward and instead shows that Ubisoft is still working out exactly how this new subsidiary will be structured. The only thing that seems sure is that big changes will be coming to some of its biggest studios in Canada.</p>
<p>You can read an excerpt from the memo below.</p>
<p><em>What will this mean for us in Zone 1? Certainly, we can expect some major changes in terms of structure and organization, since these three brands compose a significant part of Zone 1’s population. For now, what we can say is that once the agreement is finalized and confirmed by legal authorities, our Quebec, Saguenay and Sherbrooke studios will move entirely to the new entity, while our Montreal project teams will be spread between the new entity and the current Ubisoft organization. Our studios in Toronto, Winnipeg, as well as Red Storm and Blue Mammoth, will continue evolving in the current organization.</em></p>
<p><em>It is still very early in the process and I know you must have many questions, but the short answer to the “what’s next” question is: we need to take the time to figure this out and the next months will be dedicated to determining the transition plan. [...] While there are many things that will only be defined during the planning process over the next few months, I can assure you that Ubisoft will continue to be a world class creator of video games, and your great ideas and energy will always be a critical part of our success.</em></p>
<p>We contacted Ubisoft for a comment on this story but did not hear back in time for publication. If we get a comment, we'll update this story.</p>

Miller shone a spotlight on a growing question developers face as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/sag-aftra-authorizes-video-game-actor-strike-over-ai">SAG-AFTRA's strike</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> against games signed under the Interactive Media Agreement enters its second year. What, exactly, do studios not under the agreement owe the actors they work with?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though the union's sticking point in negotiations with the bargaining group that includes Electronic Arts, Activision, and Take-Two Interactive is centered on disagreements on terms covering generative AI, Miller and Supergiant's conflict derives from a bigger purpose: actors asserting that now more than ever, they want contract terms to be backed up by unions with the resources to enforce them if things go south.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's one of the many messages that SAG-AFTRA Interactive Negotiating Committee chair Sarah Elmaleh and national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland hope developers are starting to hear. As the strike winds onward, the number of games being completed through under "side letter six" (the clause in the Agreement stating games that entered production before the strike are not officially struck) is dwindling down. That means publishers are eyeing casting needs for their next game—and actors, waiting for them to reach an agreement with the union—are looking for work with studios that hadn't previously signed any agreement.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/how-ninja-theory-created-hellblade-ii-s-unsettling-soundscape" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Ninja Theory created Hellblade II's unsettling soundscape</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the surface, it's fair for a studio to ask why they would need a union contract. If they previously enjoyed a good relationship with an actor, and offered favorable terms, wouldn't that be enough?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answer, Crabtree-Ireland and Elmaleh said in an interview with Game Developer during the 2025 Game Developers Conference is "No."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why is the SAG-AFTRA strike still going?">Why is the SAG-AFTRA strike still going?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studios hoping for the strike to resolve and for pressure to ease up any time soon might have a while to wait. According to Crabtree-Ireland, the nine companies that make up the game industry negotiating group can't agree with each other about "the basic principles that underly the AI protections we're looking for," he explained. "That hasn't been our experience with other bargaining groups."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In case you need a reminder, Crabtree-Ireland fought that fight in 2023 during the SAG-AFTRA theatrical and television strike with the Producers Guild of America. "It took a minute to get there, but we made progress a lot faster toward that ultimate conclusion: informed consent, improved compensation, and parameters around generative AI use."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To put his comments into context, with over 120 companies having signed the interim agreement, any members of the industry negotiating group that want to agree to SAG-AFTRA's terms are effectively being held back from casting union talent for new games. That means for however brief a window, smaller studios have a competitive edge against major industry players.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/supergiant-denies-recasting-hades-ii-actor-over-interim-sag-aftra-contract-request" target="_self" data-discover="true">Supergiant denies recasting Hades II actor over interim SAG-AFTRA contract request</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Which brings us back to the ongoing campaign by actors to secure interim agreements with their studio partners. As demonstrated in Marin's comments about Supergiant Games, more and more actors want "the very particular protections and strength of a union contract," Elmaleh said. "[The threat of AI] is new. It's unique, it's more serious than possibly any other threat we've faced as a community and that's really motivating people to recognize that the contract is special for many reasons, not only because of AI protections, but also the ability for a union to enforce those and...other protections in the contract" (Supergiant Games declined to comment after we reached out in advance of this story).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If an actor enters a dispute with a developer (or third-party recording studio) over an individual contract, they have to pay their own lawyer to take it to court. If they enter a dispute over a union contract, their union dues pay for legal protection, among other benefits like health insurance, both of which carry over from job to job.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord-composer-winifred-phillips-wins-grammy-award" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord composer Winifred Phillips wins Grammy award</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elmaleh said that if one of your actors is asking for you to sign the contact—to "go union"—what they're saying is "this contract matters to me and these are my terms that I need to protect my career...I would love for you to sign this because this matters to me for self protection."

If the strike continues, could we see studios head overseas to fill gaps in production—especially if they're in search of talent more willing to sign away their voice for generative AI use?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That question has been on the lips of several voice actors Game Developer has spoken with in the last few months, with some pointing to a statement </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-entire-french-cast-of-voice-actors-risk-jobs-in-ai-dispute">made by</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> French voice actor Pascale Chemin saying her castmates on an unnamed game had been asked to sign a contract allowing for their voices to be used for generative AI by an unnamed publisher. (Pascale did not state which publisher or dubbing studio presented the contract, though she tagged the other actors in her Instagram post—all of them are the French-language voices on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The tagged actors offer the only clue as to which game she was referring to).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chemin and her colleagues held the line against this unknown publisher—but will every actor do so? In every territory?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"AI is a mandatory subject of bargaining, and that means you should not be circumventing or attempting to circumvent this process," Elmaleh said when asked about the possibility of currently-struck companies eyeing international replacements. Crabtree-Ireland agreed, saying it would be "reprehensible" for a company to go to such lengths to "foist unfair AI terms on performers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You should expect to be called out not only by performers, but other fans too."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He did say that that "there is no need" for any studio under the struck Interactive Media Agreement to take such steps. "More than 175 games and more than 50 percent of production earnings are covered under our interim or tiered independent agreements. It's entirely feasible to produce your game responsibly and under union contracts with fair AI protections."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And as Chemin demonstrated, actors in other regions are willing to demonstrate solidarity if need be. As Crabtree-Ireland put it, "Most of the unions in other possible video game production jurisdictions have stated that they will fight against productions relocating to their jurisdictions to avoid the strike, not only out of solidarity but also because they don't want to work under unfair terms either."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Worker protections are about more than legal terms">Worker protections are about more than legal terms</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game development is a risky business and even salaried developers know their jobs are not the shining picture of stability. But by nature of the work, actors are in a more precarious position. Actors like Elmaleh hop from project to project as contractors, juggling the challenges that come with that life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is a wild puzzle," she said when describing her relationship with the craft. When she's in the studio she needs to be able to keep a consistent performance that will allow a developer to seamlessly blend recordings from multiple days, a task that can be "potentially very athletic and flexible."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a post-GDC chat with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/">Skin Deep</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Blendo Games, writer and narrative designer Laura Michet offered practical reasons for why the low-budget indie team went through the process of casting talent under the interim agreement through a third-party signatory. Blendo hasn't used voice acting in its previous games, and "I've worked with the union previously at some of my other jobs. I really love how everybody that you tend to get through there is very experienced," she said. "This is smooth sailing for them. There's no ambiguity, and they're very confident. It's always great to be in good hands when you're doing your first big game with [voice acting]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The union's standards, Elmaleh said, protect actors and offer stability they can rely on to keep themselves healthy and deliver high-quality work like the kind described by Michet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If developers prefer not to cast through a union agreement it's an actor's choice as to whether they want to keep working with that employer. But even if a studio has no legal obligations to the union, and believe that their choice to not sign a contract has limited consequences, Elmaleh argued there is still a bigger picture they need to consider. "You might feel like you're off in a corner, doing something on your own and doing things your own way, but you are part of a larger industry, and your games have an impact on people in that industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For an example of the "impact" developers can have, let's return to Supergiant Games, a company that has produced inspiring, high-quality work with the help of voice acting talent. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was such a popular game that you can now find game mechanics and narrative systems inspired by the studio's work all over Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Inspiration takes many forms—and the decision to work or not work with a given voice actor, or SAG-AFTRA—may send a message to other developers watching to see how their peers respond to the strike.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is an illusion to think that we don't impact each other," Elmaleh said. "That's not how this industry works."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

		<p>A release date has been scheduled for Monster Train 2, a locomotive-sized sequel to the hit deckbuilding roguelite. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a> will launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC on 21st May – and if you can’t wait that long, then there’s still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830">a Debut Demo available on Steam</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="Get on board Monster Train 2 by Shiny Shoe and Big Fan Games!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfyQXesmn2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Monster Train 2 release date trailer gives us a look at the arriving Titans, who have turned up to try and destroy the world, forcing Heaven and Hell to put their differences aside to survive the new onslaught, and push them all the way back to their home in the Abyss.</p>
<p>Building on the&nbsp;original’s three-floor battle system, you’ll have this new enemy faction to face off against, and helping you to do that are the five playable clans, each of which has specific advantages and battle styles. New unit abilities have been added, which can be activated at the player’s choosing to maximise their effectiveness, while there’s hundreds of new and familiar cards in your deck, with the debut of some new card types. Room Cards will boost a single floor of the train, Equipment Cards stack powers onto units, and the clan-agnostic Neutral Cards will be a general purpose stopgap.</p>
<p>There’s new ways to play with an Endless mode, Daily and Dimensional challenges, run mutators, leaderboards and more, and you can draw upon some buff-granting train customisation too.</p>

<p>The demo gives two of the five new clans in Monster Train 2 – the Banished and the Pyreborne – and is limited only to the full run experience. It also doesn’t include many of the new clans,&nbsp;cards, artifacts, modes and features that will come to the full game… but it is a demo, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed playing Monster Train after its debut into Early Access in 2020. “Monster Train already feels like a fairly well-polished roguelike,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/21/monster-train-preview-roguelike-card-battling-in-hell/">Jason said at that time</a>, “and it’s doing something a little bit different with the card-battling side of things too. It’s exciting to see it playing so well and already feel perfect for the “one more run” mentality that lets a roguelike thrive. It’s certainly one to watch, and hopefully, the arrival time of the game will be more reliable than the form of transport it’s based on. Given that they’re Hell trains, I assume it’s Southwest Trains specifically.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/tomorrows-nintendo-switch-2-direct-will-be-around-60-minutes-long-watch-it-here/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-direct">Nintendo Direct</a> for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">taking place tomorrow, 2nd April at 2PM UK time</a>, and Nintendo has now told us just how long the presentation will be.</p>
<p>It’ll be around 60 minutes, Nintendo states on social media, and you can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 – 02.04.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1uGRs-ispRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s basically the whole story, but you might think it mildly interesting that Nintendo didn’t choose to use a different unit of measurement. They could, for example, have said it would be 3,600 seconds, got a little bit of fractional love in by saying it would be 1/24th of the day, or gone a little more obscure to tell you that the stream will be 0.00011408% of the whole year of 2025.</p>
<p>“Interestingly”, that’s shorter than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuLci-lSeCo">the PlayStation 5 reveal stream in 2020</a>, which came in at around 70 minutes, but it is six times longer than <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/ps5-pro-reveal-launch-date-specs-confirmed/">the PS5 Pro technical address</a>.</p>
<p>I guess saying that it’s 60 minutes is pretty clear and to the point, it just doesn’t help with word counts and search engine rankings.</p>

<p>Alright, enough messing around. There’s an hour of time to fill for the Switch 2 reveal, and plenty of ground for Nintendo to cover properly, after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware reveal</a> arrived back in January. It was a pretty abstract and brief look at the console hardware, showing lots of points of comparison for how the design has changed compared to the original Switch. It showed the added USB-C port on the top of the console, the new kick stand design, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>However, it also hinted quite heavily at a long-rumoured mouse-like mode for the Joy-Con, and there’s a mysterious C-button on the right Joy-Con that everyone remains puzzled by. Expect those to be properly details, alongside some more technical expectations, such as if there’s 4K output and upscaling, <em>how</em> the game will handle <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/nintendo-finally-confirms-switch-2-backward-compatibility/">backward compatibility</a>, and if there’s paid Switch 2 game upgrades.</p>
<p>And once that’s out the way, it will have to be time for the games. From January,&nbsp;the real highlight was the tease of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/">Mario Kart 9</a>, and we expect to see a lot more of that during the Nintendo Direct, in addition to seeing some more first party games, and details on pricing and release date.</p>
<p>This is all leading into a string of hands-on preview events around the world through April and May, and we can’t wait to go hands on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/atomfall-surpasses-1-5-million-players-in-its-opening-weekend/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>More than <strong>1.5 million</strong> players jumped into the post-apocalyptic world of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a> in the game's opening weekend, publisher and developer Rebellion announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The single-player survival action game that took the nuclear apocalypse to Britain arrived on current-gen consoles and, notably, Xbox's Game Pass subscription service this past Thursday, March 27, 2025. Which means it reached this milestone in just five days.</p>
<p>In a press release, chief executive officer and co-founder of Rebellion, Jason Kingsley expressed his joy about how the game has been received so far, saying "<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">To have surpassed the one million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off."</span></p>
<p>For years now, the most popular post-apocalyptic game about a nuclear war ending the world as we know it, Fallout, was always set in the USA. That's due mainly to Fallout always being a commentary on the United States, as Todd Howard explained <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-bethesda-plans-to-keep-fallout-set-in-the-us">last year</a>, but that didn't stop fans of the series from wanting to explore a post-nuclear war world outside America's borders.</p>
<p>That's why we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a>, the Fallout 4 mod that overhauls the entire game to bring the flavor of Fallout from the US to the UK. Just ahead of Fallout: London's release, though, Atomfall was first revealed during Xbox's 2024 Summer Showcase, and now we have two variations of what post-nuclear war Britain looks like.</p>
<p>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside, but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series," Kingsley continued. </span>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game."</span></p>
<p>While Atomfall is surely benefiting from the 'Game Pass' effect of having millions of players being able to just jump in and try it at no extra cost, even considering that, it's still an impressive launch for a new IP from an independent publisher and developer.</p>
<p>In our review of Atomfall, we praised the game for its narrative and approach to exploration, but as it stands just outside of launch, the experience is bogged down by a number of bugs and a few issues with the voice acting.</p>
<p>So it might be worth waiting for an update to jump in, but definitely still keep it on your radar, as we said "Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles."</p>

            <p>The upcoming Resident Evil movie reboot from Zach Cregger will be "unlike any of the previous films" in the franchise.</p>
<p>That's coming from the director himself, who was speaking during Sony Pictures' CinemaCon presentation earlier this week.</p>

<p>"There's a moment that comes in almost every Resident Evil game where you find yourself in a dark passageway, your health is almost zero and there's no way around," Cregger said (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-resident-evil-movie-will-be-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films-director-promises">IGN</a>). "You have to go through but you know there's something awful for you in the darkness."</p>
<p>Continuing on, the director - whose previous work includes 2022's Barbarian, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">our Matt describes as "wonderfully unpredictable"</a> - added this is "a thrill that the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>" have managed to perfect.</p>
<p>"My movie will be built in the spirit of those games and follows one central protagonist from point A to point B, as they descend deeper into hell," Cregger closed.</p>
<p>As to who that central protagonist <em>could</em> be, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-austin-abrams-1236170177/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> states Euphoria's Austin Abrams (pictured below) is being eyed up for a role in the upcoming film, although nothing has been finalised. Cregger and Abrams previously worked together on upcoming horror film Weapons, which is scheduled to release later this year.</p>
<p>Constantin Film is producing and co-financing Cregger's upcoming Resident Evil adaptation, with PlayStation Productions also on board. Sources told The Hollywood Reporter the reboot "is decidedly on the horror track", and will have "elements of a wilderness survival thriller". </p>
<p>
The Resident Evil film is currently set for release on 18th September, 2026. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-direct-duration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its upcoming Switch 2 Direct show will run for around an hour, and that you can expect to see hands-on gameplay footage of some Switch 2 games in the days to follow.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907055353742700718" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media platform X, Nintendo confirms the Nintendo Direct, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">scheduled to air tomorrow</a> at 6am Pacific (9am Eastern), "will be approximately 60 minutes long". That's longer than Directs usually run; they're normally about 30-45 minutes.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907056611610243535" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup post</a>&nbsp;subsequently confirms that two Nintendo Treehouse presentations will be held on April 3rd and 4th, each of which will feature "hands-on gameplay of Nintendo Switch 2 games", although we don't know which games those will be just yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-duration-mario-kart.jpg?itok=34WiHVZ_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-duration-mario-kart.jpg?itok=EFJbckjP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 Direct presentation will run for about an hour.</figcaption></figure><p>It's very likely that tomorrow will bring a reveal for the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game that was teased when the Switch 2 was first revealed, assuming that it's not an enhanced port of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>.</p>

<p>Other than that, however, the Switch 2's launch lineup is shrouded in mystery, so it'll be interesting to see what Nintendo has up its sleeve for which a console that the company is reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">gearing up to ship 20 million units</a> during its first year.</p>

<p>We're also expecting that the Switch 2's release date will be revealed tomorrow; according <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-release-april-september-nacon" rel="nofollow">to accessory maker Nacon</a>, said date is likely to land somewhere in the April-September region. If I had to guess, I'd put my money on June or July.</p>




<p>Whatever the case may be, we'll find out exactly what Nintendo has up its sleeve for the Switch 2 during the Direct presentation tomorrow.</p>

<p>You can watch said presentation on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official YouTube channel</a>, and we will, of course, have all the news from the show for you as it happens as well.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-plan-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cplan%E2%80%9D-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed-in-internal-memo.1150935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-plan-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Insider Gaming has obtained another internal memo from Ubisoft, this time from Christophe Derennes (Zone 1 Managing Director) on the plan for Ubisoft’s new subsidiary with Tencent.</p>



<p>The announcement on the new subsidiary was made on March 27 and thus far, not much detail has been given as to what can be expected moving forward. Officially, we know that certain Ubisoft teams and IP’s will be moving over to the new subsidiary, but details on what it means for the overall company, its future projects, and employees is currently unknown.</p>



<p>On the investor front, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-falls-double-digits-days-after-tencent-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft stock has fallen a staggering 19%</a> as of the time of writing since the subsidiary news hit the internet. Speaking to one investor, who wished to remain anonymous, he said that the stock price drop is a result of the unknown and how the new structure will work out with Tencent and its cash injection. Another investor casted doubt on the move too, saying that the move means little in the medium to long term if there’s not more changes to the company. </p>



<p>Speaking with employee’s on the move, over half a dozen tell me that internal communication has been fairly lackluster apart from a few company-wide emails. Some tell me that they feel like the deal was probably rushed due to the positive negotiating power Ubisoft had following the initial success of Assassin’s Creed Shadows – but as to when the deal was finalised is unclear. </p>



<p>The apprehension on the future becomes more clear after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading the company’s emails following the subsidiary announcement</a>, and the latest email obtained by Insider Gaming sent from Christophe Derennes paints a clearer picture of why investors and employees are nervous. </p>



<p>But in short, it’s because Ubisoft doesn’t seem to have much of a plan, yet.</p>



<p>You can read the full memo below:</p>



<div><p>“Hello all –</p><p>By now you have seen the message from Yves about the decision to create a new subsidiary that encompasses the three biggest Ubisoft brands: Rainbow 6, Assassin’s Creed, and Far Cry. This new entity will remain part of the Ubisoft family and will continue to be operated by us, with Tencent being a minority shareholder. This important decision is a key turning point for us after the last few difficult years and is an opportunity for Ubisoft to rebuild stronger than ever.</p><p>What will this mean for us in Zone 1? Certainly, we can expect some major changes in terms of structure and organization, since these three brands compose a significant part of Zone 1’s population. For now, what we can say is that once the agreement is finalized and confirmed by legal authorities, our Quebec, Saguenay and Sherbrooke studios will move entirely to the new entity, while our Montreal project teams will be spread between the new entity and the current Ubisoft organization. Our studios in Toronto, Winnipeg, as well as Red Storm and Blue Mammoth, will continue evolving in the current organization. </p><p>It is still very early in the process and I know you must have many questions, but the short answer to the “what’s next” question is: we need to take the time to figure this out and the next months will be dedicated to determining the transition plan.</p><p>Step one was this announcement, where we shared the decision and kicked off the planning phase.</p><p>Step two will be from now until this summer, where we will work out how to support the new entity with the existing organization and determine what the new model looks like on both sides. There will be a variety of guided consultations and discussions over the next few months, and your leaders will be involved as we take this opportunity to set up Ubisoft and the new entity for success.</p><p>Step three will be the implementation of the new model, with a longer period to complete the transition. Of course, there are many things that have not been determined yet such as who and how we will manage the new entity, what will happen to the structure we have created around the Zone, what will be the impact on the studios, and more. While there are many things that will only be defined during the planning process over the next few months, I can assure you that Ubisoft will continue to be a world class creator of video games, and your great ideas and energy will always be a critical part of our success.</p><p>I’m sure you have many questions for which we have no answers yet. Your MDs have also been just recently briefed on this announcement, and like me, don’t have any more information than I do. However, as always, we will try to keep you updated on our progress as we go along and share the latest decisions as soon as we can. In the meantime, we are looking forward to this opportunity of rebuilding a new and stronger Ubisoft, and of maximizing the contributions of all our people.</p><p>Thank you for your patience and resilience: living through change is never simple, and this is a big (and important) one for us and for the future of Ubisoft. My ask to you is to keep focusing on what you do best and where you have the biggest impact: making great games that enrich the lives of our players. I’m thankful to be able to count on your cooperation as we move forward together.</p><p>Christophe<br>Managing Director, Zone 1″</p></div>

<p>Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered PC port release is closer than an alerted Clicker. It adds a lot of new content and quality of life features, and PC users finally get the refined and remastered edition of the game. </p>



<p>We get it, Naughty Dog can probably slow down with The Last of Us remasters, remakes, and rereleases. There’s a reason they keep doing it, though, and that’s because they sell. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> did well on PS5, and in keeping with PlayStation and PC’s partnership in recent years, a port is on the way.</p>



<p>We have information on the PC port’s release date in different time zones, and extra info on Early Access, and more.</p>

                <p>Director Jared Hess' A Minecraft Movie is what the world needs right now, according to stars Jack Black and Jason Momoa. Speaking at the movie's premiere, Black quoted Burt Bacharach's 1965 song "What The World Needs Now," and added, "We've got to work together, my god."</p><p>"There's so much violence and war and hatred. And that's what I love about this movie--there's a lot of love in it and there's a lot of creativity. There is some anger and violence too, but in the end it's about friendship and working together to make [the world] a better place," Black told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jason-momoa-jack-black-minecraft-movie-jennifer-coolidge-1236175713/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter.</a></p><p>Momoa, meanwhile, said "everyone needs to escape a little bit right now," and A Minecraft Movie could be a solution for them.</p><p>"It's nice to sit back and have a really fun adventure and giggle and laugh," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Momoa said he's hopeful A Minecraft Movie is well-received and performs well at the box office so he can make a sequel.</p><p>"We won't let you down. We worked our ass off for you, and I think we brought the world to life. I think everybody's gonna love it," he said. "There's so much more to tell; I just hope the fans will be delighted and let us make more."</p><p>A Minecraft Movie comes to theaters this Friday, April 4, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-minecraft-movie-could-compare-to-other-video-game-films-at-the-box-office/1100-6530115/" data-ref-id="1100-6530115">it's expected to perform about as well as Sonic the Hedgehog 3 did in the US.</a> April also sees the release of HBO's The Last of Us Season 2 (April 13) and then Sony's Until Dawn movie (April 25), so it's a stacked month for video game adaptations.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-social-media-reviews-to-a-minecraft-movie-are-in-heres-what-people-are-saying/1100-6530503/" data-ref-id="1100-6530503">first social media reviews for A Minecraft Movie have begun to appear online</a>, with people calling it "appalling" and "awkward," as well as "hilarious" and "sharp." That seems to be in keeping with tradition for movies from Hess, whose previous releases, including Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre, divided audiences.</p>

		<p>10 Chambers know how to make a multiplayer shooter. The team, built from the ground up by Ulf Anderson, Simon Viklund and Anders Bodbacka, spawned from the Payday 1 and Payday 2 team, with their opening studio salvo being the bloody and tough GTFO. If that was the game they ‘had’ to make, Den of Wolves is the game they ‘need’ to make. From our early hands-on session, this is the culmination of everything they’ve previously built, but they’re exploring the genre in some unexpected and intriguing ways.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RlKiBVO1GLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Den of Wolves is a techno-thriller, a multiplayer heist, and an Inception-like journey into the human mind. Fundamentally, this is Payday and GTFO by way of Deus Ex, set in 2097 in a future where corporations have built their own superstate in the middle of the Atlantic Sea.</p>


<p>Den of Wolves is set in Midway City. The island of Midway began life as one of Pan-Am Airways’ refuelling spots on its way to cracking travel between the US and Asia, before it became a crucial base for America during World War 2, but in this future, a giant cityscape has overwhelmed the island, spilling into the sea and thrusting into the clouds.</p>
<p>This evocative setting, one that ties the East and the West, plays host to the Corporations. The team describe it as a high-tech Venice, with a stock exchange that sits at the centre of global trade. All Corporations have a presence there, and the island is split into five distinct districts, each controlled by a different company.</p>

<p>Within this setting, cybercrime and industrial espionage are rife. You work for the Corporations, taking jobs from the highest bidder, and in Midway City, loyalty is bought rather than earned. You’re not, as you may have guessed, the hero of this piece; you’re a criminal mastermind, putting together a crew that’s capable of shooting, looting and hacking their way to success.</p>

<p>Each heist is built upon a series of smaller jobs, culminating in the central mission. The prep jobs might see you building up your tech or collecting information, but each acquisition affects how the final act plays out. For our playthrough, we got to play a single prep mission, and the team describe these as being ‘bitesized’ experiences, which will fit into a lunchbreak and let you move forward with the game even when you’re short of time.</p>
<p>Our team of four blasted through this vault theft in just under ten minutes – the fact that we were grouped up with Vlad and Calle of 10 Chambers might have helped us out a bit – but you can opt to extend these prep missions by heading back into the area to try and grab more loot.</p>
<p>There’s serious risk to balance against the reward though, and Vlad and Calle told us that the difficulty seriously ramps up the longer you stick it out, making the chances of success much slimmer. It’s a tantalising challenge, and the ghost of GTFO’s hardcore difficulty level satisfyingly rears its head here. The main run through both the prep and the final mission felt tough but fair, and we had to communicate and work as a team, balancing gunplay while breaking into vaults, reviving fallen comrades or throwing up defensive shields and turrets.</p>

<p>So far, you might be thinking that this is Payday in the future, and while it’s undeniably built on the same foundations, Den of Wolves has a digital ace up its cybernetic sleeve: The Dive. You are one of the few people capable of The Dive, which is an ability to hack neural networks in a way that AI can’t. In gameplay terms, they’ve crossed Inception with Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>The Dive can, fundamentally, be whatever 10 Chambers want it to be. These sections of a heist are separate in terms of their structure, and the way they play is notably distinct from the bombastic gunplay of the central heist. In our playthrough, The Dive saw our team leaping through the mind of a prisoner, jumping between floating platforms as gravity tilted and turned the landscape in disconcerting ways. It was set against a timer as well, where failing to make a jump and the inevitable drop into the abyss was a devastating blow to our team. Thankfully, only one player needs to make it to the end to succeed.</p>
<p>What’s exciting, for both players and the team at 10 Chambers, is that the possibilities here are nearly infinite. Simon spoke animatedly about the idea, saying, “The only thing where it limits us it it needs to be a first-person experience. It’s not going to be a Match-3 or an RTS or a side scroller, but you could be running through a maze hunted by a monster. Right now we’re working on a forest setting where there’s a creature tracking you. We can lean into military simulation or it can be a Japanese temple where you’re fighting ninjas, and what’s interesting is that it’s not just providing variation for the players, but for us developers as well”.</p>

<p>This idea is Den of Wolves’ golden bullet. The freedom and creativity that it allows is unprecedented, and the fact that in the midst of a heist you could suddenly be free-running across city rooftops like Mirrors Edge or battling demons in the ruins of a castle. I wasn’t the first to suggest that we might see a GTFO-like Dive, and the team seemed open to that possibility. Hell, they’re open to all possibilities.</p>
<p>Beyond the heists, the guns and the masks, it’s clear that 10 Chambers want Den of Wolves to be a truly global force. The team have already started on this path, releasing deep dive videos into different aspects of the game’s development, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNroOU2W1C4">motion capture</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpcCbA7jrE0">music</a>, and releasing a music video for Viklund’s stellar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oli2M8Z1EU">Inject</a>.</p>
<p>The iconography, the visual design and the ethos all speak to a team that are creating a brand as much as they’re designing a game. In the modern development sphere, it’s a canny approach, and much like League of Legends, Den of Wolves’s rich, tangible sci-fi world has the potential to capture fans beyond the game’s frantic robberies.</p>
<p>The music is an integral part of that, and Simon, who was the composer for Payday 1, Payday 2 and GTFO, relished the opportunity to craft something fitting for the game’s futuristic settings. He told us, “In part, it’s the arbitrary choice of wanting to do something different, to challenge myself, while at the same time staying in the wider genre of EDM. I chose to go for something slower and heavier, like an unstoppable force type of energy.” He continued, “Hip-hop and rap music has a little bit of that, with the super deep 808 bass sounds and the slower tempo, and I felt that was a good fit – at least for the parts of the mission where everything is going to plan!”</p>

<p>When things go wrong, the audio tempo ticks up, reflecting the sudden overwhelming enemies that are homing in on your position. As your heart rate ramps up, and your teammates start shouting for support, Simon’s tracks take on a completely different tone.</p>
<p>Eye’s glinting, Simon says, “The music here still has the gritty texture and the electronics, but it’s more high-octane. It’s adrenaline-pumping music. I’ve sectioned off a certain part of EDM where I feel I can move around, and we can cover the emotions that we want the players to feel.” From first-hand experience, it definitely works.</p>
<p>Den of Wolves is another statement piece from 10 Chambers, and perhaps more clearly than ever, this is a game that’s about grasping the anonymity of the teams’ signature masks. Where the Payday games gave you the chance to be the villain, Den of Wolves explores some of the darkness that lurks at the edges of everyone’s psyche.</p>
<p>Simon describes this as ‘moral escapism’, the idea that beyond the mechanical freedom of firing a gun in a military shooter, here players can do something wholly illegal, become someone wholly different. It’s less Ocean’s 11, more neo-noir techno thriller , a dark undercurrent running through its narrative threads. Wherever your conscience sits on this moral scale, Den of Wolves brings a new sense of catharsis and freedom to the multiplayer space.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2025-gaming-roundup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's April Fools' Day once again, and you know what that means: time to take literally everything you read on the internet today with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn't necessarily include this article; we're gathering up everything we see that looks like an April Fools' joke to us, but there's every chance we're wrong and some of these announcements are legit. In any case, here's our roundup of this year's April Fools' shenanigans!</p>

<hr><h2>Level-5 invites you to cross "New Horizons"</h2>




<p>Level-5's April Fools' joke this year involves a trailer that will look very familiar to you if you were glued to a certain Nintendo game during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's intended to promote the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date" rel="nofollow">impending release</a> of RPG sequel&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>.</p>

<h2><em>PUBG</em>&nbsp;gets romantic</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-dating-sim-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=qXtIPUXS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-dating-sim-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=JtFweEi4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to date your&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>weapons? Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton is celebrating April Fools' Day in&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>in the form of <a href="https://pubg.com/en/events/wwrdevent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Winner Winner Romantic Dinner"</a>, a dating sim that lets you romance, uh, your weapons. This one's been created with the help of gen AI, which is a bit yucky if you ask me.</p>

<h2><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>adds infantry into the mix</h2>




<p>This is one of those announcements where I'm not sure whether it's an April Fools' joke or not, but in any case, Gaijin has announced that <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/9447/current" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ground troops</a> are on their way to vehicular combat game&nbsp;<em>War Thunder</em>. Judging by the comments, this one might do well if it wasn't a gag.</p>

<h2><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWords&nbsp;</em>wants to have some words with you</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-racing-crosswords-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=S1Sx2Z8p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-racing-crosswords-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=X8RKD4KE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This game is extremely real. Honest.</figcaption></figure><p>You've heard of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>, but <a href="https://www.sonicracingcrosswords.com/special/crosswords" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">what about&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWords</em></a>? A "demo" for the game is available now, and it challenges you to, uh, solve a word puzzle as fast as you can. I see what you did there, Sega.</p>

<h2><em>Party Animals&nbsp;</em>is calling your bluff</h2>




<p>A brand new board game mode has been added to party game&nbsp;<em>Party Animals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1260320/view/498317142563751751" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in the form of "Bluffalo Club"</a>, in which you must take turns saying ridiculous things and hoping your friends fall for them. There's more in the update besides the new game, too.</p>

<h2><em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>wants you to sign a binding marriage contract</h2>

<p>Are you intending on marrying one of&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>'s handsome and beautiful NPCs? If so, then you'll want to sign this extensive and extremely legally binding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1084600/view/514079741259548841" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">marriage contract</a>, which asks that you jump through all kinds of hoops in order to prove your love is enduring.</p>

<h2><em>Palworld</em>'s dating sim surely can't be real, right?</h2>




<p>I'm including this one mainly for posterity, but it's also worth mentioning the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>dating sim that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">once again announced yesterday</a>. There's...just no way&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>can be real...is there?</p>

<h2><em>Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing&nbsp;</em>is making a triumphant return</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=Zw7uyVVL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=-0Zwutc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you ready to very decidedly not race?</figcaption></figure><p>Notorious terrible, horrible, very bad, not good video game&nbsp;<em>Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam, apparently. Again, I can't tell if this one's serious or not, but hey, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3598130/Big_Rigs_Over_the_Road_Racing/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can wishlist it here</a> if you want to find out.</p>

<h2><em>Dave the Diver: Remastered&nbsp;</em>is bringing realistic visuals to Mintrocket's pixel art extravaganza</h2>




<p><em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>is probably one of the most diverse and minigame-stuffed games of all time, but wouldn't it be better if it looked a little more...realistic? Well, Mintrocket clearly thinks so if this&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver: Remastered&nbsp;</em>trailer is anything to go by. You'll only have to wait until 2049 to play it as well!</p>

<h2>THQ Nordic reveals&nbsp;<em>ArcAInia - The Fall of Sans Serif</em></h2>

<p>In the world of THQ Nordic's&nbsp;<em>ArcAInia - The Fall of Sans Serif</em>, "typography and magic are one", and you must destroy the corrupt sans serif fonts, who have allowed their power to go to their heads. This game is absolutely real and is absolutely launching in 2026. Cough, cough.</p>

<h2><em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>is getting a feature film</h2>




<p>Jiggly mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>is apparently getting itself a feature film, complete with epic mecha battles and plenty of waifu-style characters. Whether or not this is all a huge, elaborate April Fools' Day prank remains to be seen (hint: it is).</p>

<h2><em>The Talos Principle Reawakened&nbsp;</em>has tons of features so you don't need to think anymore</h2>




<p>Are modern puzzle games too difficult for your brain? Do you wish they made you...well...think a little less? Croteam and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-release-date" rel="nofollow">The Talos Principle Reawakened</a>&nbsp;</em>have you covered with a suite of hilarious features designed to stop your brain from needing to activate even once.</p>

<h2><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is, erm, throwing shade at&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>?</h2>

<p>I'll readily admit I don't get this one; I don't think there's any shame in that. Riot Games' FPS&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is apparently either teaming up with, throwing shade at, or affectionately ribbing&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>&nbsp;in <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1907062942022910313" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this strange video message</a> posted on the game's official X account.</p>

<h2><em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has some burger-flipping goodness for you</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-burger-flipper-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=kIEBeuwb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-burger-flipper-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=yOfo0Vkk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ready to flip some burgers in&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>?</figcaption></figure><p><em>Selaco</em>'s Burger Flipper minigame <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/517457440980076004" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">is in full swing</a>, and not only that, but it's getting all the good stuff like microtransactions and loot boxes as well. Don't worry; this isn't really happening. I think.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis&nbsp;</em>has yet more school visual novel shenanigans for you</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-ever-crisis-academy-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=tyaW0wBF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-ever-crisis-academy-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=SO2SLdbf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just look at them.</figcaption></figure><p>If there's a more iconic duo than&nbsp;April Fools' Day and visual novel spinoffs, I can't name it, and apparently, nor can Square Enix.&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis Academy&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.ffviiec.com/ec-academy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promises a cute school-set visual novel</a> starring Cloud, Tifa, and the gang, but it's almost certainly not real. Boo.</p>
