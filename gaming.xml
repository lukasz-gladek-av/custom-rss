                <p>Work has begun on a new "major" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> Classic project, according to Blizzard. As a result, development on Season of Discovery looks to be coming to a close.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/update-from-the-wow-classic-team/2110944" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a>, WoW Classic producer Josh "Aggrend" Greenfield explained what's next for the WoW Classic team and dove into its philosophy behind the more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">experimental Season of Discovery servers that launched in 2023</a>, and what comes next.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYGvtbrDiiw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYGvtbrDiiw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"Season of Discovery was a success beyond our wildest imagination in 2023," Greenfield said. "We learned so much, we grew as a team both literally and figuratively, and we've been invigorated for the future like never before. That future for Season of Discovery is somewhat bittersweet, as we've made the decision to slow down on Season of Discovery and begin work on our next major project in the original WoW design space."</p><p dir="ltr">He said Blizzard has "big plans and big ambitions" for its next WoW Classic project, plans that will require Blizzard to take the time to "get in the proverbial kitchen and cook," he said. Blizzard will use that time to further shape and iterate on ideas from Season of Discovery into "something truly exciting."</p><p dir="ltr">What that next major project will be is still unclear, but many WoW Classic fans are assuming (and hoping) it's what the community, and even Blizzard itself, has for years referred to as Classic+. It's an idea that calls for essentially a new version of WoW Classic with new content like class changes, raids, and zones. Rather than progress to a new expansion and landmass as was the case originally, Classic+ would remain in the core regions of Azeroth and explore locations that never made it into the original version of WoW, like Mount Hyjal and others. In theory, it's something that would be similar to Season of Discovery, but less radical in some of its class changes and intended to continue as an ongoing game rather than a seasonal server meant to run its course.</p><p dir="ltr">Greenfield said the original plan for Season of Discovery, which added new abilities and content to the over 20-year-old original version of WoW, was for it to end with the release of the game's retooled Naxxramas raid and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-wow-most-famous-pieces-of-cut-content-is-playable-today/1100-6529076/" data-ref-id="1100-6529076">introduction of a new dungeon, the Karazhan Crypts</a>, in January 2025. Instead, the team decided to realize one more unfulfilled dream, releasing an entirely new raid several months later, the Scarlet Enclave.</p><p dir="ltr">It's that new raid where Blizzard is now offering a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-away-free-wow-classic-mists-of-pandaria-boosts-but-youll-have-to-earn-it/1100-6531833/" data-ref-id="1100-6531833">free level 85 character boost to use in the upcoming Mists of Pandaria Classic</a> for players who defeat its first boss. Greenfield said the character boost serves as a "capstone" for Season of Discovery and a way for players to jump straight into a new version of Classic now that Season of Discovery development is winding down. While development is slowing for Season of Discovery, Greenfield said it has no plans to shut down servers, and that they will remain online for many months if not years to come.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we think of the impact that Season of Discovery will ultimately have on World of Warcraft, we think about how it helped prove something that a lot of us already knew: there is an enormous appetite for new experiences set against the backdrop of original World of Warcraft," Greenfield said.</p>

The battle royale's next live event, titled Death Star Sabotage, kicks off on Saturday, June 7, at 2 PM ET // 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET, and it will have players participate in an organized assault against the planet-killing space station, which has its sights aimed at the island.</p><p>Developer Epic Games doesn't detail what the event will entail in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/death-star-sabotage-on-june-7-the-fortnite-live-event-concluding-galactic-battle" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, but players can queue up for the event two hours before it begins, flying around in X-wings or TIE Fighters as a countdown ticks down. The event will support parties of up to four players.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to the event, Epic Games is providing players with several new goodies and toys to use in battle. Following an update scheduled for May 29, players can enter rift gates in Battle Royale or Zero Build modes to take control of a Star Destroyer's Turbolaser. Players will fire the destructive weapon from orbit, destroying any structures and damaging opponents that its lasers hit.</p><p>Players can redeem an "Assault on the Death Star" loading screen and Captain Phasma's "Quicksilver Baton Spear" as a pickaxe as login rewards between June 3 at 9 AM ET and June 10 at 9 AM ET. Fortnite fans can also nab rewards through Twitch; starting May 29, viewers of any streams by creators with the "Galactic Battle" Twitch extension can earn a bundle of five sprays, each representing a different Star Wars faction, to use in-game.</p><p>Additionally, simply linking your Epic and Twitch accounts will yield you a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-darth-jar-jar-skin-takes-a-ridiculous-amount-of-xp-to-unlock/1100-6531655/" data-ref-id="1100-6531655">Darth Jar Jar</a> emoticon. Participants of the Twitch event will also get a loading screen if a community goal is met, and according to Epic, those players "might get a jump on what's coming in Death Star Sabotage."</p><p>Despite its relatively short length, this Star Wars mini-season of Fortnite has been quite eventful, introducing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-voice-draws-union-complaint/1100-6531662/" data-ref-id="1100-6531662">controversial Darth Vader AI character</a> and welcoming mobile players back to the game after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-ios-in-the-us-heres-how-to-download-it/1100-6531696/" data-ref-id="1100-6531696">its return to the iOS App Store</a>. It's unknown what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">next season of Fortnite</a> will look like, but rumors suggest the battle royale is shifting from a galaxy far, far away to superhero-themed antics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt has announced that the tentatively-titled <i>Cyberpunk 2</i>, the upcoming sequel to the hit RPG&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, has officially entered the pre-production phase.</p>

<p>This news comes via CD Projekt's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/05/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q1-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial presentation</a>, in which it's also revealed that the company's profits are down when compared to last year, although sales revenue has remained largely the same and gross profit is actually up.</p>

<p>Last year, CD Projekt raked in around $26.6 million in profits, while this year, that figure fell to about $22.9 million, a drop of roughly 14%. It's likely not a figure CD Projekt will be losing sleep over, but it's less than ideal.</p>

<p>Those back catalog sales are still pretty strong, though, it seems. Back in November, CD Projekt revealed that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sales have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">passed the 30 million mark</a>, with the game managing to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-generated-752-million-in-revenue-as-cd-projekt-shares-update-on-its" rel="nofollow">generate $752 million in revenue</a> for its publisher in the 2023 fiscal year alone.</p>

<p>As for the&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>sequel entering pre-production, it could still be a while before we hear anything more about the game, unfortunately. Pre-production is a pretty early stage; it involves prototyping, conceptualizing, and other tasks necessary to get a game ready for full production.</p>

<p>Still, the fact that the sequel is moving ahead is encouraging in and of itself, and given the extensive problems&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>faced at launch, it's probably a good thing if the sequel has a more protracted development process.</p>

The game will star Ciri as its protagonist, although it's probably a few years off yet, so we don't know too much else about its setup.</p>

<p>Not only that, but a full remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-remake-announced-by-cd-projekt-red" rel="nofollow">also in the works</a>, with Polish outfit Fool's Theory (which itself counts several ex-<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>developers among its staff) handling the game's development.</p>

                <p>Former Grand Theft Auto lead developer Leslie Benzies had an ugly exit from Rockstar Games nearly a decade ago when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-gta-5-exec-suing-take-two-claims-hes-owed-1/1100-6438762/" data-ref-id="1100-6438762">he sued its parent company, Take-Two Interactive</a>. Benzies subsequently co-founded Build a Rocket Boy and developed a GTA-like game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-producers-mindseye-brings-sci-fi-action-to-ps5-this-summer/1100-6529472/" data-ref-id="1100-6529472">MindsEye</a>, which is releasing next month. Now, Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard has suggested that the bad word of mouth about MindsEye is part of a "concerted effort" to trash the game and his studio.</p><p>Gerhard recently took part in a Q&amp;A session on Discord (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), where he agreed with the potentially explosive allegation that the negative responses to the game "were financed by someone." Gerhard's response to that suggestion was, "100%... Doesn't take much to guess who."</p><p>Although Gerhard didn't back down from his initial implication, he later clarified that he isn't accusing any specific players of being paid to bad mouth the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbhEMXn_osc" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="23">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rbhEMXn_osc?start=23" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. Its [sic] pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out."</p><p>Gerhard went on to suggest that "there are bot farms posting negative comments and dislikes" for MindsEye, but didn't elaborate beyond that.</p><p>MindsEye will be released on June 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game puts players in control of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier who has a implant in his head that's called the MindsEye. That device gives Jacob the ability to control drones and a few other tricks. It also shows him glimpses of a mission he can't remember, which results in an unknown faction attempting to kill him before he can piece that part of his past together.</p>

            <p>A Death Stranding anime is in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The news was confirmed by the game's creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, who when discussing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">the upcoming live-action Death Stranding film</a> with <a href="https://www.vogue.co.jp/article/my-view-hideo-kojima-game-creater">Vogue Japan</a>, casually slipped in that an anime adaption is also in the works.</p>

<p>"I am currently working with A24 on a live-action film adaptation of Death Stranding," Kojima said (translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works-hideo-kojima-confirms/">VGC</a>). "When it comes to adapting games into visual media, there are works like The Last of Us, which stays true to the original storyline, and films like The Super Mario Bros Movie which are more of a service to fans of the game.</p>
<p>"While these works have their own merits, as a film enthusiast, I want to pursue the expressive potential of cinema. I aim to create a Death Stranding that can only be realised through film, one that could win awards at festivals like the Cannes Film Festival or the Venice Film Festival. In fact, we are also currently working on an anime adaptation."</p>
<p>So, there you have it! One Death Stranding anime coming up, although for now we don't know when.</p>
<p>As for the film adaptation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie">Kojima announced his company was partnering with A24 in December 2023</a>. A24 is the production and distribution company behind the likes of Everything Everywhere All At One and Hereditary, so it sounds like a good match for Kojima.</p>
<p>More recently, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-movie-reportedly-being-helmed-by-a-quiet-place-day-one-director">A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski was attached to write and direct the Death Stranding adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>But, while all of this is going on behind the scenes, we have Death Stranding's sequel releasing via PS5 next month, on 25th June.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is clearly a labour of love, filled with carefully balanced gameplay systems, exceptional visuals, and extraneous details and secret scenes," our Ed wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">Eurogamer's Death Stranding 2 preview</a>.

In retrospect, it’s easy to see why: it’s a device that seamlessly transitions from a home console to a handheld, erasing the distinction between the two.

The Switch’s eShop wasn’t exactly barren, but early on there was a lot of room for new releases. To put it into perspective, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200603111823/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Put0Dtck164">Nintendo announced in 2018</a> that around 1,000 games were added to the platform in its first year or so. The number of games released each year just adds to the number of games available on the eShop; in 2024, <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-the-biggest-switch-eshop">GameDiscoverCo reported that 50 games were added per week</a>, leading to more than 2,300 new games in 2024 by November.</p><p>What started as a gold rush for indie developers slowly spoiled, and eventually the eShop became overrun with slop. This pushed some developers to the margins, while platform degradation soured the experience as a whole.</p><p>Coming out of the so-called <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/28/17911372/there-are-too-many-video-games-what-now-indiepocalypse">indiepocalypse</a>, the period after the indie golden age from 2008 to 2015 — think <em>Fez</em>, <em>Braid</em>, and <em>Super Meat Boy</em> — developers were reeling from the massive influx of competition and a decline in discoverability. The eShop, for some time, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14764956/nintendo-indie-games-switch-yooka-laylee-stardew-valley">was a reprieve to that</a>. Nintendo itself seemed poised to support that period of growth; days ahead of the Switch’s launch date, the company announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14764956/nintendo-indie-games-switch-yooka-laylee-stardew-valley">that it had already locked in more than 60 “quality indie games” for 2017</a>.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/will-the-nintendo-switch-gold-rush-affect-indie-games-on-pc/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reported</a> in October 2017 that “almost every indie release on Switch” had sold better on Switch than on other platforms. <em>Enter the Gungeon</em> sold more than 75,000 copies in just two weeks, <a href="https://x.com/DodgeRollGames/status/946866495124049920">developer Dodge Roll Games said</a>, while Team Meat posted in January 2018 that <a href="https://x.com/SuperMeatBoy/status/951949505171144704"><em>Super Meat Boy</em>’s first day on Switch had “shockingly close” numbers</a> to its Xbox 360 debut. <em>SteamWorld Dig 2</em>, one of the titles Nintendo was boasting about, sold between five to 10 times more copies on Switch than it did on Steam, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/indie-veterans-on-the-state-of-indie-games-on-nintendo-switch-versus-steam/">per a <em>PC Gamer</em> report</a>.</p></div><p>Rodrigue Duperron of <em>Spiritfarer </em>developer Thunder Lotus says that the studio “missed the gold rush” when it published <em>Jotun</em> on the Switch in April 2018, but was still “quite pleased” with its performance. (It was published on Wii U in 2016.) “I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that monthly releases to the eShop still numbered in ‘mere’ dozens in early 2018,” he says. Thunder Lotus expected its next game, <em>Sundered</em>, to sell better, but Duperron said the team was “mildly disappointed” — and pointed to the massive increase of games released monthly. “It didn’t feel at the time that shovelware or bargain basement titles were yet flooding the platform, but this was more of a low simmer which would come to a boil over the next few years,” he says.</p><p>2020’s <em>Spiritfarer</em> saw increased success outside of the “indie boom” for several reasons, one of which was that Nintendo included it in its featured section. “More visibility led to more sales, led to being included in the Best Sellers section,” Duperron says. Abhi Swaminathan, founder of <em>Venba</em> developer Visai Games, echoes this sentiment. The game, which was released in 2023, was featured in two Nintendo Indie Directs, which he partly attributes to success on the platform. (Sales remain “almost neck-to-neck with Steam sales,” he says.)</p><p>Over the eight years since the Switch launched, the platform became crowded. It began looking a lot more like Steam, which is blasted daily with new games. The Switch, clearly, is not immune from the low-effort games that muck up the market. In recent years, they’ve gotten a name: <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-could-make-fart-fart-boobie-fart-the-game-and-maybe-it-would-eventually-get-taken-down-devs-reveal-why-the-consoles-are-drowning-in-eslop">eShop slop</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-could-make-fart-fart-boobie-fart-the-game-and-maybe-it-would-eventually-get-taken-down-devs-reveal-why-the-consoles-are-drowning-in-eslop">As <em>IGN</em> put it in February</a>, slop games are distinct from the otherwise “unremarkable games” that get released every day. They’re rarely what they’re advertised as, are based on popular or trending concepts, and are rife with technical issues. It’s not really that the eShop has started to rust, just that it wasn’t “particularly sophisticated from a discovery point of view to start with,” <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/">GameDiscoverCo</a> author and industry analyst Simon Carless tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><div><p>“I don’t know if any store is free from the eventual onslaught of ‘slop games.’”</p></div><p><em>Among Us</em> studio Innersloth CEO Forest Willard tells <em>The Verge</em> that the process of getting games onto the eShop is more specific and time-consuming than with other platforms, like Steam. “Many games on the eShop are ones that have gamed the system and streamlined their processes to churn out content (slop), while developers who go through the process with care and intent aren’t necessarily rewarded by the algorithm,” he says.</p><p>But it’s not an easy fix — nor is it a problem unique to Nintendo. “I don’t know if any store is free from the eventual onslaught of ‘slop games’ unless they’re highly curated or gatekeep-y, which would present its own problems,” Innersloth communications director Victoria Tran adds.</p><p>Nintendo has made tweaks to its system over the years, but its biggest one happened recently, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641966/nintendo-eshop-smooth-switch-2">likely in anticipation</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641966/nintendo-eshop-smooth-switch-2">of the Switch 2</a>. <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/the-biggest-discovery-change-in-switch">Nintendo updated how it ranks games</a> in its top-sellers category, changing the ranking from <em>number</em> of sales to <em>highest</em> sales. Carless said this is a shift from three-day revenue to 14-day downloads, a way of pushing out highly discounted games that sell a lot. (Nintendo declined to comment.) James Barnard of <em>Let’s Build a Zoo</em> developer Springloaded says this system “could help to reduce certain titles climbing the charts solely through continued deep discounts.”</p><p>But he warns that it’s not a total fix. “The new system still isn’t perfect, as it seems that the charts instead favor games with higher price points,” he says. “This means we would potentially need to sell three times as many copies as a AAA game to feature as highly in the listings.”</p><p>Game developers <em>The Verge</em> spoke to agree that there <em>are</em> improvements Nintendo can make to help indies shine on its new eShop. Duperron suggests user reviews, while Barnard and Willard would both like to see better performance overall — load times, curation, and search functionality can be an issue. “It’s fine to know exactly what you want to play, but there’s no ‘You might like’ that would get me from <em>Hollow Knight </em>(easily found on the best seller lists) to <em>Unsighted</em> or <em>Iconoclasts</em> (incredible and similar games, but not evergreen sellers),” Willard says.</p><p>Nintendo is trying something like this with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641966/nintendo-eshop-smooth-switch-2">its “Game finds for you” feature</a> so that players don’t have to “search every nook and cranny” of the eShop, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said in an <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F" rel="sponsored">Ask the Developer interview</a> from April. In that interview, Nintendo senior director Takuhiro Dohta addressed performance on the eShop, too, stating that it will run more smoothly even with a huge amount of games. He added that the act of finding a game to play is an important part of the Nintendo Switch 2 experience.</p><p>Nintendo is clearly thinking about the problems of the past, and has implemented some fixes to support the eShop on its new hardware. The key detail, however, will be how it continues to tweak the platform — developers and analysts hope Nintendo won’t simply set the shop then forget it.</p><p>“Nintendo has made some much-needed changes to both Switch and Switch 2 eShop ahead of launching the Switch 2, but we’d like to see iterations more often than ‘once per platform cycle,’” Carless said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You play up its<em> Elden Ring</em> ancestry, full of enemies and sights from one of the best games of the decade. The moment-to-moment combat remains familiar but dialed up with much faster movement and special ability cooldowns. <em>Nightreign</em> is full of haunting iconography and spectacular boss fights, hallmarks of FromSoftware games you can now enjoy together over voice chat in real time. </p><p>What you don’t tell them is that <em>Nightreign</em> is a messy mishmash of other genre mechanics that don’t always mesh together, especially with the grace and high degree of craft players have come to expect from the studio behind <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, and <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. You don’t mention the frenetic and occasionally repetitive scrambles to farm resources during the day in time for the boss fights at night, or the fact that <em>Nightreign</em> feels like a loot-driven numbers game that doesn’t want you to easily understand how any of its math works. You definitely don’t talk about how the matchmaking systems seem archaic, or how, despite the ability to play solo offline, that is not something your friends will ever want to actually bother with unless FromSoftware drastically nerfs the difficulty at some point.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="dd62c3811f7699515af6a018bba46c05" data-recommend-id="image://dd62c3811f7699515af6a018bba46c05" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant boss moves through a cave.

When you struggle together for hours on a tough challenge, learning encounters and boss fights, training both your mind and muscle memory to play a specific role that will contribute to the overall group’s success, it can be the highest of gaming highs, magnified by the shared experience of what it took to get there and the personal stories and anecdotes that flow from that. But when victory never comes or weak links in the chain become impossible to conceal, people get angry, they log off, they uninstall.</p><p>That might sound like a major red flag for the millions of people who played and enjoyed <em>Elden Ring </em>and have either never heard of Bungie’s sci-fi MMO or  <em>have </em>heard of it and learned early on to stay as far away from it as possible. It might also be why <em>Nightreign</em> is just $40, the same price of last year’s GOTY-nomination-worthy <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>expansion. Not because it isn’t a full-fledged game but because, unlike <em>Elden Ring</em>, it does not contain all of the tools you need to enjoy it right out of the box. <em>Nightreign</em>’s secret sauce is other human beings, and that is not something FromSoftware can patch in later after the game is out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is a weird one. It takes the foundation of one of the best open-world RPGs of a generation and turns it into not just a roguelite where death is even more of a big deal, but a three-person, co-op-focused roguelite. And in many ways, that strange experimental concoction is a success. Under the right conditions, Nightreign’s 45-ish minute runs are positively thrilling. They are packed with surprising encounters, challenging decisions, satisfying opportunities for teamwork, and some of the best boss battles FromSoftware has ever come up with – and that’s a very high bar. The <em>big </em>problem, however, is that those right conditions are far more difficult to create than they should be. You really need to have a consistent squad of similarly skilled players that are able to devote hours at a time in order to see what makes Nightreign special – and when you don’t, the flaws of its design are magnified tenfold. There<em> is</em> excellence in this Elden Ring spin off, but it’s excellence that is just a little bit tarnished. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s get the most important caveat out of the way first: If you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn’t for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn’t patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To understand why, we first need to go over what Nightreign even is. On a very basic level, this is a roguelite that takes place on an island called Limveld, which is kind of like a melting pot of Elden Ring’s environments, enemies, bosses, and structures. The general flow of a run is split up into a three-day cycle: On days one and two, it’s all about farming gear, defeating bosses, and leveling up so that you’re as prepared as possible when you face off against one of the eight extremely difficult Nightlord bosses on day three. It’s a great formula, and while you might think that the mostly static map would get old after a while, there’s a good amount of procedural generation every run that mixes up the locations of every point of interest, requiring you to plan out a unique route on each new attempt. On top of that, there are also random events like boss raids, summoning portals, and other occurrences that inject a heavy level of chaos every once in a while. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Random events inject a heavy level of chaos.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Efficiency is key because you are on a very strict time limit, with a battle royale-esque circle that constricts at set points throughout the day, eventually shrinking to the size of a small battlefield and setting the stage for the boss battle that ends the night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is immediately obvious that Nightreign was designed with a three-player squad in mind. Enemy encampments that don't require you to fight a single boss will instead have you spread out to takedown three tough enemies; basic encounters against five or more enemies that would be trivial with three players become costly time wasters when you’re on your own; and the new Nightlord bosses all seem explicitly designed with having allies in mind, and I’m not sure how I’d approach several of them by myself. Nightreign at least scales up your damage when you’re alone, but it doesn’t change any of these fundamental design decisions in any way that would make solo play more reasonable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not sure how I’d approach several of the bosses by myself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the biggest issue is that co-op partners are able to revive each other when someone goes down, but you’ve only got one life to live when you’re on your own. That’s generally the case in roguelites, but usually there’s some sort of safety net that you can fall back on. For example: Hades has Death Defiances, and part of the progression of that game allows you to work toward unlocking more of them with every run; Returnal has artifacts you can find that give you extra lives, rewarding you for being more thorough in your exploration; Spelunky has shortcuts that allow you to skip the early stages and get practice on the enemies, traps, and bosses you only have limited experience with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The list goes on and on, but Nightreign has virtually nothing to make up for the fact that solo players lose access to that crucial revival option. There is an item that will resurrect you once with half of your life, but it’s limited to the highest rarity tier, meaning you have to choose it over a legendary weapon if one does appear as a reward – similarly, you may find them in a shop, but they cost a substantial amount of runes that you could instead use to level up. Either way, it’s just not a solution that makes up for the crippling detriment of not having someone to revive you if you go down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is to say that solo play is outright impossible, and I <em>have </em>had a few successful runs on my own. Just that the balancing of solo play feels like a job half finished, and as a result, the frustration of playing alone wasn’t worth the triumph for me to have any desire to play more without a squad. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>It Takes Three</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign’s saving grace is that when you <em>do </em>have a squad of three people who all know what they’re doing, communicate well, and are generally pretty skilled at Elden Ring, it really is a lot of fun. The central idea of taking an entire game’s worth of progression and condensing it into a 40-minute run is a strong one. Going from cutting down rats with a basic weapon to culling Elden Ring’s most fearsome bosses with a badass armament that you may or may not have gotten to use in the main game is one of the coolest and most satisfying parts. It's 80+ hours of character growth condensed into less than an hour and shot straight into your veins.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dropping into a run the first couple of times is certainly overwhelming, mostly because of the amount of information on the minimap you have to process, but at least FromSoft keeps the inventory and stat management very simple. Level ups are automatic, letting you press a button at a Site of Grace to automatically level your class’s preferred stats. And as far as weapon stats go, all you have to worry about here is the damage number, the elemental affinity, the passive bonus you get simply for having the weapon in your inventory, and the weapon skill that comes along with it. This meant when I had a choice between three rewards, I was able to very quickly make a judgment on what I needed at that moment and continue on my way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>FromSoft keeps the inventory and stat management very simple.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, I started to understand what rewards were offered at which camps, which ones were quick and could be cleared before the circle closed in, which ones I should only do if I had a lot of extra time, what level I should attempt certain roaming bosses, and which bosses I should absolutely avoid unless my team was really confident in our builds. Exploring these areas can be more frustrating than it needs to be thanks to a new wall climbing ability that feels straight up bad, especially when it takes three attempts to jump over what looks like it should be an easily scalable wall as you’re trying to escape the encroaching circle. But learning the ins and outs of the map helped my efficiency and led to a very satisfying feeling of skill progression that wasn’t tied to the <em>actual </em>progression system that offers persistent improvements between attempts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That system is tied to relics that can be won after completing a run. Whether you win or lose, you still get relics, but the better you perform, the better the quality and quantity of relics you earn. These can be equipped before a run and impart stat bonuses, starting skills or elemental affinities for your initial weapon, buffs for performing certain actions, and in some cases, they can even improve the skills of a specific class. When you’re just starting out, these bonuses are hardly noticeable and too random to really make any sort of compelling build from. Eventually though, with enough runs under your belt, you’ll get some powerful relics that can really start to have an effect on your power level in a run. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there really should be more of an element of choice with regards to the meta progression, or at least a way to control some of the randomness. There are a small selection of relics that you can buy at the Jar Shop inside your base before runs, and there are set relic rewards for beating Nightlord bosses and completing class-specific objectives called remembrances – but other than that, you’re completely at the mercy of the RNG gods when it comes to what relics you get. It can be really annoying when you’re looking to strengthen your preferred class and you keep getting relics that don’t do anything for you. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Select Your Nightfarer</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest departures compared to what we’re used to from Elden Ring is that the classes are now <em>actual </em>classes, with unique skills and gameplay styles as opposed to soft classes that just determine your starting stats and weapons. They’re called Nightfarers, and the eight options are varied and well defined, with even the more basic archetypes having some interesting twists to them. The Wylder, for instance, is the general jack of all trades, but also has access to a nifty grappling hook that can be used to pull weak enemies towards you, zip you toward larger enemies, or simply zoom you around the field at high speeds if you aim it at the ground. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the basic fighter, mage, and ranger archetypes, you also have a few completely unique choices that don’t fit into any pre-existing mold. One of the most interesting classes is the Executor, whose main skill has you pulling out a unique sword with a Sekiro-like parrying mechanic tied to it. Basically, by blocking attacks with proper timing, you completely negate damage, don’t lose any stamina, and reduce the enemy’s own stamina, potentially opening them up for a critical hit. It’s a very risky class, especially in a game where missing a parry can mean almost certain death, and it feels like the offensive power of the Sekiro sword is too weak to justify the risk of the parries, but I appreciate this inclusion nonetheless as both a nod to Sekiro, and as a completely different way to approach combat. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bosses are almost all unlike any boss FromSoft has designed before.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, each of the classes has a remembrance tied to them, which is essentially a collection of journal entries that chronicle the story of how they wound up in Limveld and their purpose for being there. It’s a far cry from the rich lore that we’re used to in FromSoft games, but at least each remembrance has a handful of playable chapters that have you completing specific objectives in order to earn powerful relics, as well as a healthy amount of runes to help you level up during the actual run itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost all of Nightreign is made up of existing Elden Ring parts, but there are a few surprise bosses that are pulled from the Dark Souls series as well. But the eight Nightlords are brand new, and hoo boy, they’re almost all unlike any boss FromSoft has designed before. Many of them are clearly inspired by MMO boss battles, with a number of party-wiping attacks that must be stopped or interrupted before they get a chance to finish their preparation. Others are designed to split the party up into roles to either hold aggro or press the assault, and some are just designed to be all out wars against absurdly aggressive foes. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Soulslikes</h3><p>My 15 favorite soulslike games, ranked. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">They’re almost all bangers, with only one of them being a dud due to the best strategy simply being hanging back and pelting them with arrows for what felt like an hour. Still, seven out of eight is pretty great, especially when those seven are among the very best FromSoftware has ever crafted, with excellent accompanying soundtracks to match. I don’t want to spoil them too much, but the fight against the Fissure in the Fog boss in particular is so good it gave me goosebumps all throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the creativity of those bosses once again shines a light on the eldritch elephant in the room: they only really work with a team, and by far the two biggest issues facing Nightreign right now are, one, the shocking lack of crossplay and two, the absence of a duos playlist (you will be forced to fill the third player with matchmaking). It is simply a lot to ask of a group of three people who all must have purchased the $40 game, play on the same platform, be of a similarly matched skill to be able to handle the extreme challenge of the day 3 bosses, have the time to devote at least 45 minutes per run, and also can all agree on fighting the same boss that they may or may not all need to beat for their own individual progression. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a decent pinging system that at least makes it possible for light communication with a group of randos, but there’s no built-in voice chat, which makes nuance like trying to communicate that your group should hit the basement of the castle instead of the front or side entrance virtually impossible. It’s just a night and day difference when you’re able to group up with a squad that communicates well and knows what they’re doing versus when you’ve got one that doesn’t listen to you or just constantly makes bad decisions, especially with no way to vote to cancel or quit out of a run without a penalty. That makes the prospect of random matchmaking on the live servers pretty unappealing. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Yuri Lowenthal, a voice actor who portrayed Yosuke Hanamura in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-4-golden/" data-ref-id="5000-115427">Persona 4</a>, seemingly revealed that a Persona 4 remake was in the works in a Bluesky post about not being invited back.

            <p>A voice actor from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4">Persona 4</a> has confirmed a rumoured remake is indeed in development.</p>
<p>Yuri Lowenthal, also known as the voice of Spider-Man in Insomniac's superhero series, was the voice of Yosuke in the original release of Persona 4 back in 2008 (as well as the protagonist of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a>).</p>

<p>While <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a> was the game to truly give the Japanese RPG series huge success, Persona 4 was arguably the game that popularised it by building on the formula of its predecessor. In short, Persona 4 is particularly popular among fans, and the rumoured remake is highly-anticipated.</p>
<p>It would follow the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> last year, which enhanced the 2006 original with elements of the more recent Persona 5. Fans have therefore expected a similar remake of the fourth game to follow suit.</p>
<p>Even more eagerly anticipated is the expected Persona 6, though little is known beyond a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-6-will-be-coming-to-multiple-platforms-leak-suggests">leak suggesting it's coming to multiple platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Until then, spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-the-phantom-x-coming-to-pc-and-mobile-next-month">Persona 5: The Phantom X is due out next month</a> on PC and mobile.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>With the video games industry being ever more averse to taking risks and launching new IPs, last year's release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a> was a breath of fresh air. While the game developed and published by CAPCOM failed to set the sales charts on fire, the tower defense-meets-action game was, by every metric, a fine game that deserved more recognition and success, which the soon-to-be-released Nintendo Switch 2 port could bring, considering the experience is sure to work well in handheld format and with mouse controls. The Nintendo Switch 2 port of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess will also feature a new play mode called Otherworldly Ventures, which is also coming to other versions of the game to provide better replay value.</p>
<p>The Otherworldly Ventures mode is a sort of replayable "endless" mode with some light roguelike elements powered by a more streamlined version of the game's formula set in the same locations seen in the campaign, but with rearranged elements. Villagers, for example, don't have to be rescued; crystals are much easier to come by; contraptions, barriers, and other structures are located in different places than in the original maps, and can be repaired instantly; Soh doesn't have to guide Yoshiro to purify gates, only protect her. At the beginning of an Otherworldly Ventures run, Soh will come with limited abilities, and can only assign the roles of Woodcutter and Archer to the available Villagers, but after clearing a Seethe wave, it will be possible to pick one among a few available upgrades, including additional Rations, new Villagers, new Masks, higher defense, increased damage and so on. Items and new abilities can also be purchased during waves as well with enough crystals, providing players with every option they need to survive the night and take on the next wave. After enough waves have been completed, the stage will change, repeating the loop until the final stage, or Yoshiro's health has been depleted. In Hard difficulty mode, the Otherworldly Ventures mode can go on indefinitely, though waves will progressively become more challenging, as the health of any character is not replenished automatically. At the end of each run, the player's performance will be scored, accompanied by several rewards that provide some incentive to engage with the new play mode.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250528114418_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though the new Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess play mode doesn't shake up the experience much, the faster pace makes the Otherworldly Ventures mode a fine addition to the game. And a rather challenging one to boot, as right from the onset, you will be dealing with powerful Seethe that only appear later in the campaign, so if you haven't played the game in a while, it will take some time to get back into the swing of things. After this happens, however, the new play mode becomes quite enjoyable, so much so that it could be difficult for some to return to the slower pace of the main campaign.</p>
<p>Twisting the main campaign's formula only slightly, and unlocking only after completing the campaign, the Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Otherworldly Ventures mode is not going to change anyone's opinion on the game, as only those who liked it enough to complete the campaign will get to experience it. Still, it is a great way to put one's skills to the test, and a solid addition to an already solid game that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves.</p>
<p>The Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Otherworldly Ventures additional content will get added to the PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S with a free update on June 5th, the same day the Nintendo Switch 2 port releases worldwide.</p>
<p><em>Tested on PC. Early access provided by the publisher.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've been hearing <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/">for a while now</a> that a Persona 4 Remake was on its way, but now the game is all but officially confirmed by Atlus after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">Marvel's Spider-Man</a> and Yosuke voice actor, Yuri Lowenthal, posted about not being asked back to reprise his role as Yosuke.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r">In a post on Lowenthal's personal BlueSky account</a>, as a response to people who have been asking Lowenthal about the upcoming and not-yet-officially-confirmed remake, he wrote "<em>And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake. I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don't want me to come back</em>."</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nsyqlbwtvzs4iu37szt3ndn5/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqad6pjmrs2r" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreif7qijwd43romugsgml5j2ee7gpah36vaz2lacnvrzogoyosqzygq">
<p lang="en">And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake. I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nsyqlbwtvzs4iu37szt3ndn5?ref_src=embed">Yuri Lowenthal (@yurilowenthal.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nsyqlbwtvzs4iu37szt3ndn5/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r?ref_src=embed">2025-05-28T13:37:47.019Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So not only does Lowenthal seemingly confirm that the rumors about a Persona 4 remake coming have been true, he also confirms that, at least in his case and likely in the case of the rest of the original voice cast, Atlus is taking the same route it took for Persona 3 Reload and recasting the core characters in the game.</p>
<p>Considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-3-reload-is-the-fastest-selling-game-in-the-franchise/">Persona 3 Reload's success</a>, it could be that the decision not to ask Lowenthal back came from Atlus trying to take the same steps it took with Persona 3 Reload to repeat that success with the Persona 4 Remake. We'll likely never know exactly why Lowenthal and potentially the rest of the voice cast aren't coming back, but Lowenthal's words seem to make it clear he's not too happy about the decision.</p>
<p>Regardless, hopefully, Persona fans don't have to wait too much longer to get the official confirmation we all know is coming. Summer Game Fest 2025 is around the corner, and there's always a good chance an announcement like this could appear at Keighley's big showcase.</p>

But it’s all been leakers and insiders sharing tidbits and possible information, nothing concrete. However, with a famous voice actor from the original game talking openly about the project and implying that it might have recast some characters, it seems the cat is out of the bag, even if Sega and Atlus didn’t plan on that happening. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 28, Lowenthal posted on BlueSky</a></span>—in response to fans asking him about the remake and his return—saying that he wasn’t coming back despite possibly begging Atlus to return. </p><p>“And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the <em>Persona 4 </em>remake,” posted Lowenthal, who also voices Spider-Man in the Insomniac games on PS4/PS5. “I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back.”</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Sega and Atlus for more information about the remake and the recasting.</p><p>The last big <em>Persona </em>remake, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1bfec2j/what_do_you_think_about_the_new_voice_cast_in/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1bfec2j/what_do_you_think_about_the_new_voice_cast_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, did recast the main group</a></span> of characters. While the decision was controversial at the time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927">many praised the new voice acting in the RPG</a></span>. So it seems that Atlus might be doing the same thing again, assuming <em>Persona 4</em> remake is real and happening. And it wouldn’t be the first time:&nbsp;<em>Persona 4</em> was previously partially remastered and improved. That version of the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/persona-4-golden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/persona-4-golden"><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></a></span>, was then ported to Vita in 2012 and consoles and PC in 2020. </p><p>As for why Lowenthal, a famous voice actor with a long career in the industry, would seemingly leak a project ahead of an official announcemen? Well, perhaps the rumors have been swirling for so long that he forgot it wasn’t actually official yet. Or maybe he was grumpy about not being cast.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The custom NVIDIA DLSS 4 "High Performance" mode strikes a good balance between the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, delivering image quality on par with the latter with better performance.</p>
<p>A comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows games like Cyberpunk 2077, Oblivion Remastered, STALKER 2, The Witcher 3 next-gen and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 running on an RTX 4070 at 1080p with the official NVIDIA DLSS 4 Performance and Ultra Performance mode and the "High Performance" mode which can be enabled in the NVIDIA App by setting the Ovrerride Super Resolution to 42% input resolution. The custom mode essentially delivers the same image quality as the vanilla Performance mode but with better performance in most of the tested games, and with noticeably better image quality in some games like The Witcher 3 next-gen over Ultra Performance mode.</p>

<p>With the release of the NVIDIA App earlier this year, it has become possible to tweak NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution with different input resolutions, giving users more control over how the upscaler behaves. Besides the "High Performance" mode showcased in the video below, the App also allows users to use the Ultra Quality mode that was added to the upscaler a while back but has never been properly implemented, allowing users to enjoy<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-ultra-quality-mode-better-perfromance-image-quality-dlaa/"> better performance than DLAA with a negligible impact on image quality.</a></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 officially launched together with the RTX 50 series GPUs, introducing a new Transformer model that delivers better image quality than the old CNN model, Multi Frame Generation for the latest RTX GPU generation and more. More information on these new features can be found <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-3-remake-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Forever Entertainment has revealed that mech RPG&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>is launching next month, completing the set of remakes for the original PlayStation-era trilogy.</p>

<p>Following on from 2022's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-1st-remake-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">remake-of-a-remake</a>&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 1st&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-2-remake-for-nintendo-switch-delayed-to-q3-2023" rel="nofollow">the following year's</a>&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 2: Remake</em>, the latest entry in the series will be arriving on June 26th, per a brand new trailer.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, no Nintendo Switch 2 Edition version of the game has been announced, so it sounds like it won't be getting any Switch 2 enhancements at launch, at the very least. It's entirely possible that's coming in the future, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-battle.jpg?itok=Ai3I8Rkg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-battle.jpg?itok=3GiU7iWC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>is set for release in June.</figcaption></figure><p>There's also no word yet on whether&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>will be coming to other platforms, although given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-1st-remake-steam" rel="nofollow">both of its predecessors</a> were eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-2-remake-pc-console-release-date" rel="nofollow">released outside of the Switch ecosystem</a>, it's a distinct possibility.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3&nbsp;</em>was the first game in the series to make it outside of Japan, as well as the franchise's final numbered release on the original PlayStation (if we don't count&nbsp;remake&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 1st</em>, which also wasn't released in the West in its PS1 form).</p>

<p><em>Front Mission 3</em>'s plot revolves around pilots Kazuki Takemura and Ryogo Kusama, who are caught up in one of the&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>series' signature political conflicts. As tensions rise and military zones become more "volatile", Kazuki and Ryogo must pilot their "wanzer" mechs to survive.</p>

<p>Just as with previous&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>remakes, you can expect this one to come complete with a number of improvements, including sharper visuals, smoother performance, and gameplay tweaks.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Forever Entertainment intends to continue remaking&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>games; if so, the next logical candidate in the string would be 2003's&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 4</em>, the first series entry on the PlayStation 2.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>launches for Nintendo Switch on June 26th. It will likely also be playable on Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">thanks to backwards compatibility</a>.</p>
