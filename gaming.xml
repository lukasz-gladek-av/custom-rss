<figure data-uuid="17dd7efc036ac"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/17dd7efc036ac/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After 105+ minutes of gameplay and breakdowns, we have finally arrived at the launch week for Masahiro Sakurai's latest joint, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>The game is mere hours away from boosting onto Switch 2 on <strong>20th November</strong> (that's tomorrow!), and that means that it's time to take a look at the reviews and give you a summary of all the different opinions out there.</p>
<p>We'll start with our own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">review</a>, naturally, where the wonderful PJ O'Reilly granted Air Riders a 'Great' 8/10, praising the sheer amount of content and depth of the racing — once you get your head around what's going on. Here's a snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193790 @ 1763564402 -->
<p>But are we alone in our admiration? Let's take a look around the web and find out...</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with a whopping 9/10 review from <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-2-best-racer-791012-20251119">GamingBible</a>, where the outlet enjoyed just about everything the game had to offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> may fall short in terms of track selection compared to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t the best racing game released this year, and one of the best first-party Nintendo games to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-air-riders-review/">The Gamer</a> opted for a 4/5, giving particular respect to City Trial mode and the game's overall presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more so than the kart racing adjacent Air Ride, City Trial isn’t for everyone, and I can see a lot of people being put off by how relentlessly hectic and loud it can become. Still, as a connoisseur for carnage, I can’t wait to keep playing online and get wrecked by real players instead of CPU bots</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On much the same page, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/">VGC</a> also awarded Air Riders a 4/5, even if it conceded that Road Trip, not City Trial, is the standout mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this combines for a game that appears almost insultingly simple at first – virtually any action except for the special attack is performed with a single button – but hides a hidden depth in its vehicle diversity and special moves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These good times continued in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">IGN</a>'s 8/10 review, where the outlet sang the praises of the game's scope and strangeness, but felt the overall formula and controls didn't stack up to multiplayer mayhem elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest hurdle to enjoying its dizzying amount of content is how it all controls, as its frantic pace and slippery one-button control scheme is endearingly novel, but occasionally too simple for its own good</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/kirby-air-riders-review">GFinity</a> went marginally lower in its 7/10 review, appreciating the frantic excitement of it all, but feeling slightly let down by some game modes and the generally overwhelming nature of the race structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a game that fully embraces its mayhem, with it rather unapologetically overloading your senses. Sometimes that’s overwhelming, sometimes it’s confusing, but more often than not, it makes Kirby Air Riders uniquely entertaining</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, for a contrasting opinion, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/">Metro</a> wasn't as keen on Air Riders, giving it a 4/10 after struggling to get on with just about every game mode on offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, however, you want to play an irritating, formless, racer that’s simultaneously overcomplicated and far too simple then Kirby Air Riders is the game for you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, Kirby Air Riders is sitting on a 78 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirby-air-riders/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a> score based on 64 critic reviews. Hey, at least there's not long to wait until we all get to go hands-on with the full game tomorrow.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-says-game-characters-should-be-able-to-be-ai-trained-on-human-made-scripts-to-have-more-natural-conversations.1358080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a recent appearance <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/11/17/gaming-is-americas-pastime-and-the-entertainment-business-of-the-future-says-take-two-ceo-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on CNBC's morning business news program Squawk Box</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that in the future, game characters will likely be AI-trained on human-made scripts to have more natural conversations with players, instead of being limited to the scripted interactions that the developers had foreseen when they envisioned the game. </p>



<p><em>Historically, we had to script every single action that a character engaged in, and because it is interactive, think about how much scripting that is. Now, we're always going to need great writers, and we always will have plenty of scripting, but characters should be able to be trained on that very scripting that has been created by great writers and then interact in a way that feels more natural. I do see that happening.</em></p>



<p>Could that be one of the major new features that Rockstar Games has prepared for Grand Theft Auto VI, now officially one year away from its launch (provided there are no further delays)? Just two days ago, a new rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-is-likely-to-be-unmatched-for-almost-two-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surfaced</a> about the game featuring extremely ambitious features that may remain unmatched for 'decades'.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether a similar feature makes it in GTA VI or not, the technology is absolutely here now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA ACE</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-and-nvidia-demonstrate-on-device-ai-character-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inworld AI</a> already offer something like that, where game characters can respond to natural conversations depending on what they should be aware of. </p>



<p>Zelnick's comment, however, comes at a time when there's a lot of tension on the usage of AI in the industry. Black Ops 7 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized for its 'AI slop' assets</a>, while ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came under fire for using generative AI to voice NPCs</a>. On that subject, the developers behind the highly successful episodic adventure game Dispatch <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told GamesIndustry</a>:</p>



<p><em>You're not going to be surprised because it's built on something you've heard before if you go the AI route. So, yeah, honestly, AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one. Maybe it's a creative one if you aren't creative.</em></p>



<p>Of course, when discussing AI, there's much more beyond just empowering game characters or voicing them. As part of his reply on CNBC, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick also highlighted that the company is using the technology to create 'efficiencies', which, however, won't reduce the headcount but will instead let them focus on creative tasks.</p>



<p><em>Table stakes are creating more efficiency in development and marketing, and every enterprise is trying to do that. We're trying to do that and we're seeing some good early results in creating efficiencies. By the way, efficiencies is not code for reducing employment, it's code for taking away mundane tasks so people can focus on more interesting, creative tasks. </em></p>



<p>That is, after all, the sentiment behind many other AI statements we covered recently, from <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ricard Pillosu</a>. Perhaps, though, it was Dean Hall who, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dayz-creator-says-ai-fears-remind-him-people-worrying-about-google-wikipedia-ai-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to Wccftech</a>, really got to the heart of the issue:</p>



<p><em>I think that regardless of what we do, AI is here. So really, then, it's about a matter of how do we deal with what the impact of that is.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-cinematic-short-bungie-ai-plagiarism-2000645435</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/director-of-marathon%E2%80%98s-incredible-cinematic-short-can%E2%80%99t-believe-some-people-are-calling-it-ai-slop.1358068/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Whatever your feelings about <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935">Bungie, the state of<em> Destiny 2</em>, or the promise of <em>Marathon</em></a>, the cinematic short created to reveal the studio’s upcoming extraction shooter earlier this year was one of the coolest introductions to a video game world I’ve ever seen. It also looked like the complete antithesis of cheaply and amorphously generated slop, so I didn’t expect to see its director, Alberto Mielgo, recently try to defend it against accusations of being made with AI.</p> <p>“I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI,” the <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> art director <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D&amp;img_index=11">wrote</a> on Instagram on November 17. “HELLO. Everything you see in this film: paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with huge team — 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months…Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940">The cinematic short</a> combines CGI, live-action footage, and <em>Marathon</em>‘s broader design language to convey a sci-fi short story about mercenary runners pillaging an alien planet who slowly lose themselves, their memories, and their humanity as they are cloned over and over again to serve their megacorp sponsors. It prompted some fans to dream of a version of <em>Marathon</em> that married that worldbuilding to a completely single-player, story-driven campaign.</p>   <p>“I truly love this little film,” Mielgo wrote on Instagram. “Many of you ask me what my opinion on AI is… Honestly, I have no idea. But one thing is certain: AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced. (This text was kindly edited with ChatGPT).”</p>

 <p>It’s not entirely clear where the allegations of the short being made with AI first sprang from. Were they serious critiques or simply online passersby assuming that it could only look so good and otherworldly with the help of AI, because increasingly that’s what the rest of the internet’s algorithms are teaching them?</p>

 <p>Mielgo also weighed in on <em>Marathon</em>‘s brief plagiarism controversy earlier this year in which <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">graphics lifted from another artist</a> online made it into marketing footage and playable builds of the game. Bungie apologized and promised a thorough review of what went wrong in its pipeline, but it left some wondering where the theft ended and <em>Marathon</em>‘s exciting aesthetic began, though it was also clear at the time that part of the backlash was coming from bad-faith critics looking for something else to pile on Bungie about.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Marathon</em> plagiarism controversy was ‘blown out of proportion’</h2> <p>“But you know what I hate the most?” Mielgo wrote in what now appear to be deleted comments, according <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/">to<em> The Game Post</em></a>. “Working our asses off for years to create something cool, only for it to get eclipsed by sphincter smelly press and headline readers.”</p>

 <p>He continued, hitting back at people who didn’t believe him in the comments, “It&nbsp;was genuinely a mistake, blown out of proportion by people like you and hungry sphincter press. Regardless, to your pseudowistle, none of the text/fonts ever reached our team. The Bungie team is fantastic, and the work they did before us was f****ng outstanding. I loved working with them.”</p> <p><em>Marathon</em> was supposed to already be out but got delayed following negative feedback during an alpha test earlier this year. The team’s been making lots of changes to the game in the interim, including the highly requested addition of proximity chat. Sony says the game will release before April 2026. Hopefully, people take whatever gets released on its own terms rather than letting it be overshadowed by all of the other baggage swirling around its development.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch has given you all the time to breathe. By now, you’ve probably finished Ghost of Yotei and need a fresh challenge, which is where New Game Plus comes in handy.</p>



<p>New Game Plus is a great way to extend the shelf life of any game. Moreover, it offers new challenges and usually adds extra options and features into the mix for good measure. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a>‘s sun isn’t setting anytime soon, and the November inclusion of New Game Plus will be a game-changer.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Aim true, you’ll need to. Screenshot from PlayStation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghost of Yotei is getting New-Game-Plus capabilities from November 24, and this isn’t all.</p>



<p>An official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Blog</a> revealed more bits, from New Game Plus to new gear and extra PlayStation Trophies. The original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-trophy-and-achievement-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei trophy list</a> was generous, but now you have an additional two trophies to fight for.</p>



<p>On top of this, New Game Plus behaves as it does in every game: Once you’ve finished the story, you can begin the adventure again from scratch, but your progress rolls over, and there’s a new, harder difficulty setting for the sadistic samurai in all of you.</p>







<p>Here are some other features that will feature in the New Game Plus update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New currency: Ghost Flowers (Used on a new vendor packing many cosmetics).</li>



<li>A new tier of upgrades for armor sets and weapons.</li>



<li>You can replay content from the main game.</li>



<li>New accessibility features, such as button remapping and fresh Photo Mode tweaks.</li>
</ul>



<p>Check out the New Game Plus trailer below, giving you a glimpse into the game’s future.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest is one of the most recognizable names in classic RPGs, and also one that has recently leaned heavily on the past to attract new fans. Square Enix has remastered the first three classic DQ games, dubbed the Erdrick Trilogy, and is now skipping ahead to the seventh installment with Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined. It's an unexpected move, but partially explained by DQ7 having such a notorious reputation among fans. Namely, it was a slog. Even its own key developers acknowledge that much, which made it ripe for a remake that trims the fat. I played a little over an hour of Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined and talked with producer Takeshi Ichikawa. My limited time was not enough to get a feel for the full scope of the cuts, but I was impressed by the other ways it's being modernized.</p><p dir="ltr">It starts with the art style, which is immediately striking. Square Enix noted during a presentation that to establish the revised look, it constructed physical dolls for each of the major party members, giving them the ability to focus on small details like the texture of their clothing. Those dolls were then scanned in to act as digital puppets, and the rest of the game was developed to match their style. That gives it a handcrafted look that is, I dare say, cozy. The perspective is still primarily following your characters from above, as you'd expect in a classic RPG, but the character detail is readily apparent even there, and you get a closer look at them in cutscenes and battles.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="495716916" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

also created the visual style for all of the Dragon Quest games before his passing in 2024. When Toriyama designed the characters for DQ7, they were given a more "cutesy, adorable aesthetic" compared to other Dragon Quest games, with more squat designs that differed from his usual art. The company researched ways to maintain and update that visual style and found inspiration in other media, like movies and TV shows, that have used a doll motif. That inspired the creation of physical dolls to define the look, which he says helped create realistic fabrics and textures that influenced the overall style.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the cozy appearance, though, the story in Dragon Quest VII is remarkably dark for the series. As Ichikawa said, that contrast was one major motivation in remaking the game for modern audiences.</p><p dir="ltr">"The overall goal, or what inspired the creation of this remake, was we really wanted to tap into the unique and dark world in storytelling of Dragon Quest 7 and these adorable characters," Ichikawa said via translator. "We really wanted to bring it back to the modern audiences again."</p><p dir="ltr">I played just one story mission, and it was as dark as I had been led to expect. The party began in the small seaside town of Wetlock, where the people are enamored of an old traveling busker. After being prompted to sleep at an inn, you're awoken to find the town has been emptied, lured into a portal by the busker for some unknown purpose. Something sinister seems afoot, so you follow them into the portal and confront him--only to discover the old man was actually attempting to save the townspeople from disaster. An evil creature named Gracos was planning to flood the continent and consign everyone to a watery death. Some people were even feared to have been left behind and presumably drowned. The busker, Old Man Riffer, was actually a hero trying to atone for his own past mistakes by saving the town. You then venture into the sunken lair to confront the monster.</p><p dir="ltr">The dark subject matter is somewhat softened by the cute art style and voice performances, so it never felt too scary or intense for kids to enjoy. The voices, especially, are played with the melodrama of living cartoons, so it all works thematically with the art style.</p><p dir="ltr">Inside the dungeon, I was able to battle through hordes of monsters, familiar from other Dragon Quest titles, but given a new figurine-like look. The monsters didn't get dolls of their own, but the studio was able to follow the art style established by the character models to make them consistent, and the result is beautiful. The maze-like dungeon was a delightful way to engage with the monsters, too, as I could see them roaming around and carefully sneak around them or look for safe paths if needed. Within the battle interface, you have a similar behind-the-back perspective to traditional Dragon Quest titles, but pulled in close enough and with some cinematic movements to really let you soak in the lovely art style.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I remember thinking, 'When am I ever going to get to the monsters?'"</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Battles are traditional and turn-based, but they've been given a slight twist with revisions to the vocation system. Instead of your primary vocation defining your skills, Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined introduces a "Moonlighting" system that lets you set a secondary vocation. I was able to experiment with the secondary jobs by either augmenting my party's natural talents or filling in gaps, and while my brief demo didn't allow me to see the full breadth of experimentation, it was enough to see how this will have a major impact on strategizing your party composition.</p><p dir="ltr">"It is going to be a bit easier to start for the players, but we also reworked the entire balance of the battles too," Ichikawa said. "The battles are reworked based on the assumption that the Moonlighting system is going to be implemented. So it's not going to be too easy for our players. It is going to be a challenging experience for them. The team does feel that the battle and the vocation system overall has balanced up very appropriately."</p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate confrontation, against the fiendish monster Gracos, was an appropriate challenge to end the dungeon, forcing me to balance my healing, skills, and special abilities, and search for opportunities for synergies. It was a satisfying culmination to the fights, even thrown in with a party I hadn't developed myself. The old man Riffer chimed in to help as well, and the crisis was averted.</p><p dir="ltr">So why follow up the first three Dragon Quest games with a remake of the seventh? For Ichikawa, it's personal. He said his first Dragon Quest game was Dragon Quest Monsters. When he tried to play Dragon Quest 7 in its original incarnation, the task was just too daunting. It took an average of three hours to even reach the first battle, which tested the patience of Ichikawa and many other young RPG fans.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was very young back then. I was still in elementary school, but it is kind of a painful experience because I had to give up," he said. "I remember thinking, 'When am I ever going to get to the monsters?' I couldn't even carry on before even getting to that part."</p><p dir="ltr">He didn't know at the time he would go on to work on the Dragon Quest series, joining Square Enix and developing Dragon Quest Builders 2. Times have changed since Dragon Quest VII was first released in 2000. Ichikawa said he and Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii discussed the changing landscape of RPGs, and how players now have expectations that games will better respect their time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605909-dq7r_2_07.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4605909" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605909-dq7r_2_07.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4605909"></a><figcaption>Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605909-dq7r_2_07.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605910-dq7r_2_06.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605911-dq7r_2_01.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605912-dq7r_2_02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605913-dq7r_2_03.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605914-dq7r_2_04.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605915-dq7r_2_08.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605916-dq7r_2_05.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605917-dq7r_2_09.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605918-dq7r_2_07.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4605910,1300-4605911,1300-4605912,1300-4605913,1300-4605914,1300-4605915,1300-4605916,1300-4605917,1300-4605918" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605910-dq7r_2_06.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605911-dq7r_2_01.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605912-dq7r_2_02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605913-dq7r_2_03.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605914-dq7r_2_04.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605915-dq7r_2_08.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605916-dq7r_2_05.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605917-dq7r_2_09.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605918-dq7r_2_07.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605910-dq7r_2_06.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605911-dq7r_2_01.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605912-dq7r_2_02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605913-dq7r_2_03.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605914-dq7r_2_04.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605915-dq7r_2_08.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605916-dq7r_2_05.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605917-dq7r_2_09.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605918-dq7r_2_07.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Back then, it was more acceptable to have a longer form of entertainment, especially in video games where you get to sink in so many hours. It was just more acceptable and standard back then," Ichikawa said. "But fast forward 25 years later; that's not really the case anymore. There's a lot of video games out there, there's a lot of forms of media and entertainment out there. So naturally people just have an upper limit about how [much] time they can put into one single form of media or entertainment. So that was in the initial discussions that I had with Horii-san, so that was why we wanted to streamline some of the elements and the game to ensure that we are able to grow a smoother gaming experience for Dragon Quest 7."</p><p>Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined appears to be a different kind of remake than Square Enix's other recent output. It isn't an HD-2D makeover like the other Dragon Quest remasters, which have been mostly careful to keep the original mechanics intact, or a full reboot like the Final Fantasy 7 trilogy. Instead this appears to bereimagined, in a true sense, by borrowing the core concepts and philosophies that drove that original game and modernizing them for today. It's being reverent but not overly precious, which just might be the right approach for a lauded, but divisive, part of Dragon Quest history.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>With three weeks to go until the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> DLC drops, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has unveiled its next brand new Mega Evolution, and this time it's a Mythical Pokémon getting an upgrade.</p>
<p>Zeraora was first introduced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_ultra_sun_and_ultra_moon">Pokémon Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon</a>, way back in Gen VII, and its Mega form makes a few subtle changes to its original design.</p>
<p>Its mostly-yellow fur has turned black, and there's now a lot more blue on its knees, head, and chest. its blue tuft on its head has turned to something resembling a horn, and it has a few blue spikes across its body in general. And, lastly, it now has two ponytail-like features instead of one.</p>
<p>It's definitely one of the lighter Mega Evolutions we've seen so far, especially compared to Mega Chimecho, but hey! The Thunderclap Pokémon has its fans.</p>

<p>According to the Pokédex, "The electric energy it stores in its body is equivalent to ten bolts of lightning. Protrusions on its forehead, chest, back, and the backs of its hands are where the electric energy is particularly concentrated."</p>
<p>We'll be getting one more Mega Dimension update in two more weeks (2nd December), which will likely be another Mega Evolution. Stay tuned until then!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At least one of Bungie's ongoing legal troubles has been put to rest, as the company settles a copyright lawsuit it was facing against author Matthew Kelsey Martineau, who alleged Bungie had pulled storylines for its Red War campaign in Destiny 2 and the Red Legion from his work published on WordPress between 2013 and 2014.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/author-sues-bungie-for-copyright-infringement-over-destiny-2s-story">Martineau sued Bungie last year</a> for the alleged copyright infringement, and you'd be forgiven if you thought this would have been a simple case for Bungie to dismiss. In its motion to dismiss, Bungie refuted Martineau's claim, saying he "<em>failed to plausibly allege that Bungie copied constituent elements of Plaintiff's work that are original, and, specifically, that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege factual copying by Bungie and that the works incorporated by reference into the Complaint are not substantially similar as a matter of law</em>."</p>



<p>However, to Bungie's chagrin, Judge Susie Morgan did not dismiss the case. Bungie was unable to demonstrate direct examples from the Destiny 2 Red War campaign to prove its argument, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-content-removed-vault-beyond-light-november/">because that content has since been vaulted</a>. Not only is it no longer available to the public, but it's no longer compatible with the current foundation of Destiny 2.</p>



<p>To make that content available would be a mountain of an engineering effort, so when Bungie tried instead to resort to YouTube videos of old Destiny 2 gameplay footage and Destiny 2 wiki content, Judge Morgan disallowed it as evidence. "<em>While Plaintiff does reference Destiny 2 in his complaint, he does not reference the YouTube videos containing Destiny 2 game footage, the Destinypedia pages, or the Tyson declaration</em>," Judge Morgan wrote at the time.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/bugnie-attempt-at-dismissing-copyright-lawsuit-denied-by-court-due-bungies-inability-to-provide-vaulted-destiny-2-content-as-evidence/">So Bungie's dismissal attempt failed</a>, and the case entered an extended discovery process, which allowed Martineau to further expand his arguments and, eventually, as reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/">The Game Post</a>, reach a settlement.</p>



<p>"<em>A settlement conference was conducted on this date before the undersigned Magistrate Judge</em>," the new filing reads. "<em>Negotiations were successful and resulted in the settlement of all claims. The Court thanks counsel and the parties for their efforts in bringing this matter to an amicable resolution</em>."</p>



<p>The public settlement filing doesn't include details on what the conditions of the agreement were, if Martineau was awarded a monetary sum or if a deal was reached another way, but as far as the court is concerned, this is a closed case so long as the settlement terms are met by both parties and agreed upon for the next 60 days, which is the period of time given in case either side wants to open the case back up.</p>



<p>At least this is one less thing for Bungie to worry about now, as it continues trying to pick itself up amidst Destiny 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/">reportedly selling very poorly</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-epic-teamup-fortnite</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unity-and-epic-team-up-to-bring-unity-made-games-to-fortnite.1358023/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic and Unity have announced a collaboration that will allow developers working in the latter engine to release their games within the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>ecosystem, and it'll have benefits for Unreal Engine developers too, apparently.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/news/unity-and-epic-games-together-advance-the-open-interoperable-future-for-video-gaming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Unity says the ability for Unity games to be brought into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will create "more opportunity and value for players and developers", pointing to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s status as "one of the world's largest gaming ecosystems".</p>

<p>As part of the collaboration, Unreal Engine support will also be added to Unity's cross-platform commerce management system, which will in turn give Unreal Engine devs "more choice for managing everything from their digital catalogs and payment&nbsp;providers to web shops across PC, mobile, and web".</p>

<p>Epic boss Tim Sweeney, meanwhile, says that companies should work alongside one another "in order to build the open metaverse in a way that's interoperable and fair", and that this partnership allows Epic and Unity to "help developers build fun games, reach bigger audiences, and find success".</p>

<p>News of this collaboration comes after Unity reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-unity-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> back in February, including the engine's Behavior team, which worked on the "visual tool" of the same name.</p>

<p>Those purported layoffs came after the engine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-runtime-fee-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled its controversial runtime fee</a> for developers and publishers in September last year, the revision of which caused a firestorm of controversy among industry figures when it was introduced in late 2023.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/capture-lifes-precious-moments-with-this-dedicated-vlogging-camera-from-dji-down-to-its-lowest-price-yet-2000645281</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-osmo-pocket-3-just-hit-all-time-low-after-multiple-drops-as-amazon-quietly-offloads-the-top-vlogging-camera.1358020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="504">If you’re into vlogging, having the right gear can really clean up your content and make your workflow smoother in one go. Allow me to introduce the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. It’s a dedicated vlogging camera that lets you leave your phone in your pocket and focus on capturing great footage. Whether you’re into YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram Reels, this camera is designed with you in mind.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/"> And right now, you can grab it for 34% off on Amazon. Normally priced at $799, it’s now going for just $524 — saving you a solid $276.</a> This deal is coming in over a week before Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, so you can even get some holiday shopping wrapped up ahead of schedule.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="506" data-end="1025">So, why go for the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 instead of using your phone? Sure, phones like the iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S25 have impressive cameras, but there’s one thing they can’t offer — unlimited storage. While the Osmo Pocket 3 doesn’t have endless storage either, it uses a MicroSD card, so you can expand your storage as much as you need. Plus, you can keep your vlogs and personal stuff separate. It’s a lifesaver for people like me who are always scrambling to delete old videos just to take a quick selfie with my iPhone.</p>

<h2 data-start="506" data-end="1025">Impressive Videography</h2>
<p data-start="1027" data-end="1453">Now, let’s talk about the footage. This little camera packs a punch with 4K resolution at up to 120 fps, which means you can create smooth, cinematic slow-motion shots in your edits. The lens also swivels and auto-focuses to track your subject, so you’ll get steady, dynamic shots as you move around. Thanks to its three-axis mechanical stabilization, the camera removes a lot of annoying shaky cam that can ruin your videos.</p>


<p data-start="1455" data-end="1804">You can use the Osmo Pocket 3 in two ways — either facing forward to film whatever’s going on in front of you, or flipped around to capture yourself. The built-in mini display is one inch across, touch-sensitive, and rotates both vertically and horizontally, so you can switch things up depending on how you want to frame your shots or where you plan on posting the finished product to later.</p>
<p data-start="1806" data-end="2041">The camera has advanced color-grading tech that shoots in 10-bit color depth, meaning you’re capturing up to one billion colors for richer, more vibrant visuals. It’s also capturing professional-grade audio in stereo sound right on the camera itself. For even better audio, connect it directly and easily to up to two DJI Mic 2 or Mic Mini transmitters, sold separately.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-rolls-out-major-black-friday-deal-on-fenix-8-now-priced-like-a-used-previous-gen-model-2000645396</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/garmin-rolls-out-major-black-friday-deal-on-fenix-8-now-priced-like-a-used-previous-gen-model.1358017/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Serious athletes need watches that can survive extreme conditions and track every metric that matters for performance optimization. Budget fitness trackers cannot keep up with ultramarathons, technical climbs or dive expeditions. The <strong>Garmin Fenix 8 is the brand’s first push beyond the $1,000 threshold</strong> in their flagship multisport line, and packs features that justify its position as the ultimate tool for dedicated athletes.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon has just dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5696/">the 51mm Solar Sapphire model to $849 for Black Friday, down from its regular $1,199 price</a>. That makes it <strong>an all-time low</strong> that brings the grail of sports watches within the grasp of those committed athletes who previously shy away from four-figure pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5696/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Survives Toughest Challenges</h2>
<p>The scratch-resistant sapphire lens on this <strong>1.4-inch display</strong> holds up to impacts from rock scrambles, trail running branches, and the many accidental door frame collisions that destroy cheaper watches. <strong>Solar charging extends battery life to 48 days</strong> in smartwatch mode if you spend three hours daily in 50,000 lux sunlight-representative for outdoor athletes training regularly.<strong> GPS mode is functional for 149 continuous hours</strong> with solar assistance, accommodating multi-day ultra races or extended backcountry expeditions with no external chargers needed. The<strong> always-on display</strong> is readable in direct sunlight and automatically adjusts brightness based on ambient light to save battery while keeping it visible during activities.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon gray DLC titanium construction</strong> balances strength with wearability, keeping weight manageable for all-day comfort while maintaining structural integrity during hard use. DLC coating resists scratches better than standard titanium finishes and preserves the watch’s appearance through years of abuse. The 51mm case size accommodates larger wrists comfortably and houses the sensors and battery capacity that smaller models sacrifice for compactness.</p>



<p><strong>Multi-band GPS with SatIQ technology</strong> simultaneously accesses signals from multiple satellite constellations and calculates your position with a degree of precision unreachable for single-band receivers under the most difficult conditions. The system will automatically switch between single and multi-band modes depending on environment difficulty, saving battery during open-sky running while engaging full accuracy under tree cover or canyon walls. Various<strong> inbuilt sensors like a three-axis compass, gyroscope, and barometric altimeter</strong> independently generate navigation data from GPS which becomes vital when satellite signals are blocked or you need to economize on battery life over longer trips.</p>



<p>Training readiness scoring analyzes sleep quality, recovery metrics, training load, and heart rate variability to calculate whether you should push hard or scale back intensity. The<strong> watch tracks HRV overnight through wrist-based sensors</strong> that detect autonomic nervous system balance, which indicates recovery status. Real-time stamina tracking during activities shows how much energy remains before exhaustion so you can pace your efforts appropriately during long races or intense training blocks.</p>
<p>The<strong> 40-meter dive rating with leakproof metal buttons</strong> allows for scuba and apnea diving activities, monitoring depth, time, and decompression requirements during underwater exploration. Metal buttons maintain seal integrity far better than capacitive surfaces that leak under pressure, ensuring the operation of the watch under the most adverse conditions.</p>
<p>The built-in speaker and microphone <strong>enable phone calls directly from your wrist</strong> when it is paired with your smartphone. This makes calls possible during runs or rides, with no need to stop and dig through pockets. Voice assistant integration lets you respond to messages hands-free and stay focused on the activity. Also, ECG monitoring records heart rhythm while screening for signs of atrial fibrillation and enables health insights beyond standard fitness tracking.</p>
<p>You’re paying what used Fenix models sell for on secondary markets at $849 for titanium construction, sapphire crystal protection, solar charging, and dive-rated durability with professional-grade training analytics. This $350 discount transforms Garmin’s flagship from an aspirational purchase to an achievable upgrade for serious athletes.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-wishblossom-ranch-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-dreamlight-valley-wishblossom-ranch-review.1358014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot off of dozens of hours reviewing the sweatiest kind of game imaginable in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review"><u>ARC Raiders</u></a>, wading into the cozy waters of Disney Dreamlight Valley once again was like stepping into a warm bath at the end of a hard day’s work. I’ve managed to mostly keep up with this charming, Disney-infused life simulator for the past three years, which has been content with adding a handful of new areas and characters here and there rather than innovating in that time. But with its latest expansion, Wishblossom Ranch, developer Gameloft Montreal promised a massive new region to explore atop the back of various recognizable steeds that seemed like a perfect reason to return for an extended stay. It’s without question the most ambitious update yet, with some interesting mechanical tweaks, like the focus on riding and building bonds with horses to unlock new abilities – but that ambition comes at the cost of this being the most buggy version of Disney Dreamlight Valley so far. Similarly, the new map has some of the most creative and unique regions I’ve seen in any cozy game, but that’s offset by new characters that I had a hard time connecting with and the usual, completely unnecessary grind to get through its main quests. All-in-all, I’m still glad to be back in the comforting embrace of this incredibly zen game, but the admirable risks Wishblossom Ranch takes only pay off some of the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve yet to visit Dreamlight Valley’s colorful, cartoonish world, this is a life simulator that’s centered around reconnecting with Disney characters from your childhood and the hopeful, optimistic sense of wonder you presumably had beaten out of you in the years since. You’ll run around performing low stress activities like gardening, cooking, and fishing while hanging out with the likes of Simba from the Lion King, Elsa from Frozen, and Goofy from… well, y’know, it’s Goofy. Wishblossom Ranch is the latest made up compound word followed by a location noun to be added to the mix, and it asks you to solve a mystery surrounding a place where one’s wishes are granted that seems to have run out of magic. While hot on the case, you’ll meet a handful of new Disney characters to befriend, explore and settle the biggest regions Dreamlight Valley has seen so far, and, most importantly, unlock a roster of iconic mounts to ride around on. When all of that is working, it’s some of the best-spent hours this chill adventure has offered me yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name Wishblossom Ranch implies, the main attraction this time around are the four-legged creatures you’ll tame, each with their own special ability to help you navigate the world and solve simple puzzles. The brave and bold Maximus from Tangled will let you leap across large gaps, while the mighty and battle-tested Khan from Mulan can kick apart physical barriers, and the goofy looking Pegasus from Hercules lets you fly to the highest heights of the mountainous area. You’ll also get to customize and name your own horse (mine was called Neighthan), which has the ability to push around heavy objects with its head like a big ol’ dummy. The puzzles you’ll solve using this suite of ponies are extremely basic, mostly serving as reminders that you can and should switch between mounts instantaneously and use their unique skills to push heavy blocks onto weighted pressure plates or kick obstructions to pieces, but they do a good job at giving you a reason to toggle between each of the loyal stallions and a good reason to level up your bonds with them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is definitely the most unstable version of Dreamlight Valley so far.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The best part of these new companions, though, is the fact that they solve one of my least favorite things about Disney Dreamlight Valley since the very beginning: how insanely slow you move. I’ve had a bone to pick with this game for many years now on how painfully sluggish it feels to move around, even when aided by fast travel from zone-to-zone, but hopping atop a mount makes travel times so much faster it’s completely resolved that issue. And since you can also train your mount to help with things like stomping on ore deposits to mine for gems or dig holes in the ground for gardening, you can do lots of activities without ever having to dismount, which is a great touch. Really the only issue is that now the old areas feel so claustrophobic and small because you can sprint across them so quickly, and they could already be fairly tough to navigate on foot. Thankfully, the new areas have been designed with mounted travel in mind and are properly expansive, and getting caught in small environments in the old regions is still a lot less annoying than spending minutes on end slowly crawling through them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the process for actually improving your relationships with each of these guys can be a bit of a slog, and represents the biggest timegate you’ll find in Wishblossom Ranch, which otherwise does a pretty good job of getting rid of annoying grinds like the one found in A Rift in Time. Every time you unlock a new mount, you’ll have to spend an increasingly long amount of time leveling up your relationship with them until you unlock their unique ability that’s needed to get through the next step in the main story, and the primary way to do that is by waiting for real-life days to go by so that you can feed, pet, and brush them for large XP boosts… or do what I did and spend hours riding around aimlessly, jumping over random objects in the world to brute-force your way through it. I’m sure it would’ve been far less annoying if I would have just played more casually over the course of a few days or weeks as is likely recommended, but I’m really not a fan of arbitrary obstacles to progression that have no point beyond padding out how long  it takes to finish the story, and this one is particularly silly. I’m okay with having to earn my social links with each of these quadrupedal friends, but it shouldn’t prevent me from unlocking the next area until I do, especially if the only way to speed it up is by doing meaningless busywork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that once I did get through the grind and proceeded to the next region, I was rewarded with some of the most interesting places that Dreamlight Valley has featured to date. For example, the Pixie Acres is a magically-infused garden area with golden honey waterfalls in the distance and waterballoon fish swimming in the rivers, while my personal favorite area, Glamour Gulch, is entirely fashion-themed, and has pincushion fruit growing on trees, flowers that are made out of needles and thread, and mushrooms on the ground that are actually little buttons. The flavor and themes of these places are easily the most clever and compelling yet, and would probably even top the list of some of my favorite locales in any cozy game. It’s especially cool when you start gardening with seeds found in these areas to grow things like a vegetable made out of silk thread or cooking recipes out of those ingredients to whip up an entree called button stew. This is exactly the type of over-the-top goofiness Dreamlight Valley really needed, as opposed to the quite grounded options in the first area where you were harvesting regular ol’ tomatoes to cook tomato soup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, I personally was less enthused about the new characters than the environments themselves. Snow White, Cruella de Vil from 101 Dalmatians, Tigger from Winnie the Pooh, and Tinker Bell are the four new besties to befriend, only one of which didn’t completely annoy me over the course of the story. Snow White’s creepy cheeriness and impossibly high-pitched voice gave me the willies, Cruella de Vil was just straight up mean to me for several hours while I was forced run errands for her when I would have rather just told her to take a hike, and Tigger’s stretch of the story is so untethered from reality that I was just confused about what the heck I was doing the whole time, like one part where I had to reunite a family of balloons with faces drawn on them for some reason. Tinker Bell was genuinely the only one who was consistently helpful while also not boring into me with unnerving, wild eyes. I think this is probably the cast of added characters I connected with the least so far, even though Cruella de Vil did make me laugh by being such an irredeemable monster (as she should be). Don’t get me wrong: I’m sure lots of folks will enjoy adding these icons to Dreamlight Valley’s already impressive roster, and you can always just bring along an existing character you prefer, but man, Snow White is just not for me.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The main thing holding Wishblossom Ranch back, however, is the fact that it’s definitely the most unstable version of Dreamlight Valley so far, and that’s coming from someone who started playing during a preview period slightly <em>before</em> its Early Access debut back in 2022. I encountered all sorts of issues: I phased through an elevator that broke my ability to progress until I quit to the dashboard, my horses regularly hopped inside objects in the world in a super awkward and noticeable way, menus would randomly stop responding to me until I closed them and tried again, and quite a few other bizarre problems. And of particular annoyance, the absolutely atrocious camera problems Dreamlight Valley has always suffered from are amplified by the existence of bulky horses you spend a lot of time trotting upon, whose unwieldy nature cause the camera to clip through all sorts of pieces of the environment and cause a ton of issues. I appreciate that Wishblossom Ranch takes some really neat risks to make these maps bigger and add cool horse mechanics, but that seems to have come at the cost of everything feeling really janky at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At one point I even found myself locked out of a critical quest line that would have resulted in me not being able to see the ending were it not for a developer-provided debug option that let me skip past the blockage. Were it not for the fact that I was working on this review, my journey would have come to a disappointing end right there. There were a few moments during the course of my adventure where it felt like I was walking on eggshells around the expansion’s bugs, and if I did a part of a quest too early or too late, I’d hold my breath hoping it wouldn’t result in a catastrophic error like the one I ultimately fell prey to. The devs at least know about this particular bug now, so hopefully they can fix it at some point, but I would recommend waiting for a round of polish or two before diving in yourself.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Disney Dreamlight Valley’s Wishblossom Ranch expansion is an intriguing new chapter in a cozy game I’ve enjoyed for several years, but it also suffers from some growing pains. The new areas are filled with some of the most creative stuff I’ve seen in a life simulator in quite some time, and the four-legged companions you can ride offer fun ways to engage with familiar cozy activities, not to mention make getting around so much faster. I would have liked some more exciting new characters to befriend, and the grind to level up your relationship with each of the mounts has unnecessary timegates that I could have done without, but these missteps didn’t drag down the good times too much. Instead, the real issue is that, at the time of this review, Wishblossom Ranch has just been way too buggy to comfortably enjoy (or in my case even finish without a workaround). Hopefully its biggest issues will get patched up, but for now it’s made an otherwise enjoyable expansion significantly less so.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-wishblossom-ranch-review]]></content:encoded>

Oscar-winning animator and director Alberto Mielgo has hit back at accusations his cinematic short for Bungie's Marathon is AI-generated, insisting the production is "not AI", and was in fact the result of "155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, [and] months" of time.
</p>
<p>
Mielgo - who won an Oscar for his animated short The Windshield Wiper in 2021, and has created two short features for Netflix's Love Death and Robots - served as director on Marathon's eight-minute-long reveal cinematic. The short, narrated by Ben Starr, was released in April as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">developer Bungie's big news blowout for the extraction shooter</a>.

Marathon's reveal was, of course, a chance for the increasingly embattled Bungie - which has faced ongoing reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">tumbling staff morale</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">senior management toxicity</a> over the last 18 months - to shift the narrative to something more positive. However, the studio instead found itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">embroiled in a plagiarism scandal</a>, which appears to have led to unfavourable discourse around Mielgo's trailer - and the director has now clearly had enough.
</p><p>
"I can't believe we've reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes," a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/">clearly exasperated Mielgo wrote on Instagram</a>, "this is not AI. HELLO. Everything you see in this film:  paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with huge team - 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months... Yes, our Achilles' heel: time."
</p>
<p>
"Many of you ask me what my opinion on AI is," he continued. "Honestly, I have no idea. But one thing is certain: AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced."

<p>
According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/">The Game Post</a>, Mielgo also addressed Marathon's plagiarism scandal in now-deleted follow-up comments, saying none of the assets Bungie admitting to using without the original artist's permission "ever reached [his] team]" and did not feature in the trailer. He reportedly also said he believed the incident was "genuinely a mistake, blown out of proportion".
</p>
<p>
As for Marathon, Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">delayed the game indefinitely in June</a> following "passionate" alpha playtest feedback. However, comments by Sony CFO Lin Tao this month appeared to confirm it'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">still launch by March next year</a>.

<p>This confirms the validity of a leak on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeLeaks/">Pokeleaks subreddit</a>, as the game has been datamined to see what's to come in the DLC.</p>
<p>Mega Zeraora joins Mega Raichu X and Y, and Mega Chimecho as officially revealed Mega Evolutions coming in the DLC, while Mega Baxcalibur will soon be added to the online Ranked Battles in some form. </p>

<p>The trailer above shows Mega Zeraora facing off against Zubat, Golbat, and Crobat, confirming those three Pokémon will also be added to the Pokédex in the DLC.</p>
<p>The paid DLC is available to pre-order now ahead of its release on 10th December.</p>
<p>It's set to expand on the story of the base game, as spatial distortions appear throughout Lumiose City for Team MZ to investigate.</p>
<p>It will also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-dlc-arrives-in-december-and-for-the-first-time-in-series-history-lets-you-grow-your-mon-over-level-100">allow Pokémon to grow beyond level 100</a> for the first time in series history.</p>
<p>What other Pokemon could be on the way? Leaks suggest the likes of Staraptor, Tatsugiri, and Meowstic may be getting Mega Evolutions, along with Heatran and Darkrai.</p>
<p>Fans are also speculating Mega Mewtwo could be added as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-mystery-gift-codes">Mystery Gift event</a> in the game.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/outbound-brings-campervan-crafting-and-open-world-road-trips-to-switch-2-next-year</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/outbound-brings-campervan-crafting-and-open-world-road-trips-to-switch-2-next-year.1357984/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>If you're into cosy games with crafting, farming, and the like, but <em>also</em> like driving around in an open world, Dutch studio Square Glade Games has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/outbound">Outbound</a> is coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>Previously announced for the original Switch (don't worry, it's still coming to that console if you're a Switch 1 faithful), the game was a Kickstarter success back in 2024, raising a chunky €265,679 to bring Outbound to PC and consoles in <strong>Q2 2026</strong>, and that now includes Switch 2.</p>
<p>The trailer above will give you a good idea of the gameplay blend the small team is working up, but it looks to be combining elements of open-world exploration (co-op with up to three other players if you want) with campervan decoration, crafting, farming, cooking, patting the dog - all the cosy things you might want wrapped up in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/firewatch">Firewatch</a>-esque art style.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter broke every stretch goal going, so you've also got fishing, beekeeping, other minigames, and a character editor. Here's the offical blurb and feature rundown, plus a bunch of screenshots showcasing the breadth of options available, not to mention the incredible breadth of your camper's roof that allows for all that customisation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Outbound is an open-world exploration game set in a utopian near future. Start with an empty camper van and turn it into the home of your dreams - alone or together with your friends. Build and explore at your own pace. Scavenge materials, craft, and build in and on top of your vehicle with modular parts. Advance in technology and efficiently use energy to power your home. Adjust your playstyle to adapt to new landscapes and changing environmental conditions.<br>
<strong>Source Energy<br></strong>Power your electric camper van with energy from the sun, wind, or water.<br>
<strong>Build<br></strong>Build your moving base with a modular building system. Customize your vehicle with paint, decorations, and furniture to create your own perfect cozy place.<br>
<strong>Craft<br></strong>Craft workstations and tools from resources provided by Mother Nature. Research advanced technology to refine and combine them into new materials.<br>
<strong>Grow<br></strong>Create gardens to nurture delicate and delicious plants and mushrooms. Eat them raw or cook delicious meals to refill your needs.<br>
<strong>Play together<br></strong>Explore a colorful open world with a variety of biomes, resources, and secrets, together with your friends. Play Outbound alone or with up to 4 players cooperatively.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>"A utopian near future..." Yep, we'll have a drop of that, please.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter page still has an estimated delivery date of January 2026, but Q2 2026 is the official word at the moment. Given the ambition (we particularly like the sound of the four-player co-op) of this two-person team indie endeavour, we'll be impressed if it doesn't slip a little.</p>
<p><em>See? Not a single mention of BOTW visual vibes. Let us know below if you like the look of Outbound and plan on getting away from it all sometime in the first half of 2026.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/outbound-brings-campervan-crafting-and-open-world-road-trips-to-switch-2-next-year]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a%E2%80%98s-latest-mega-evolution-reveal-pretty-much-confirms-the-leaks.1357975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s</span></i></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is just a few weeks away, and it’s bringing a handful of new <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459">Mega Evolutions</a>, a <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765">roguelike mode</a>, and additional story to the Nintendo Switch RPG. Today, Game Freak announced that Zeraora, one of the rare mythical Pokémon from Generation VI, is getting its own Mega Evolution in the DLC with a new trailer, and it sure does sound like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">datamined list of new Megas is completely legit</a>.</span></p> <p><span>The trailer is brief, but shows the </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>protagonist running around and fighting hostile Pokémon in a weird bizarro version of Lumiose City with Zeraora by their side. Just as the pair seems about to be overwhelmed, Zeraora mega evolves and manages to win the fight:</span></p>

  <p><em>Legends: Z-A</em>‘s Mega Evolutions have been so lopsided in terms of the goofy/cool ratio that it’s kind of refreshing to see that Mega Zeraora is a super edgy, overdesigned electric cat boy. It’s straightforward and has that “middle schooler’s notebook doodle” design philosophy that is pretty prominent in a lot of the original Mega Evolution designs from <em>Pokémon X </em>and&nbsp;<em>Y</em>. I like the silly designs like Mega Victreebell and Slowbro, but we need some cool cats in the mix, too.</p>

 <p>Zeraora is one of several leaked Mega Evolutions dataminers found in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>‘s code, and thus far, every new form Game Freak has revealed for <em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>has been on that list. We knew Raichu was getting two forms, then Baxcalibur and Chimecho were <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644">revealed in the DLC’s first gameplay trailer</a>, so we’re just waiting for the rest of the list at this point.</p> <p>The new Mega Evolutions will apparently include new forms for Pokémon who have already received Megas in the past, including Lucario, Absol, and Garchomp. At the moment, it’s unclear if those forms will have the same “X” or “Y” naming convention of other Pokémon who have gotten multiple Mega forms, including Raichu, Charizard, and Mewtwo, so fans have taken to calling them “Z” forms. Until we see those, I guess we’re stuck with Game Freak’s latest attempt to force Zeraora on the <em>Pokémon </em>community despite it never really feeling like it has that big of a fanbase. The Pokémon Company is determined to make fetch happen, so we’ll see if this Mega Evolution changes hearts and minds.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[If You Own an iPhone, Amazon Gives You 2 Free AirTags for Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-own-an-iphone-amazon-gives-you-2-free-airtags-for-black-friday-2000645425</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-own-an-iphone-amazon-gives-you-2-free-airtags-for-black-friday.1357972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing keys and wallets is a source of stress that tracking devices solve by locating the exact position through your phone. Individual (Apple) AirTags sell for $29 apiece which puts two units at around $60 before you add in Apple’s usual premium.</p>
<p>Amazon’s deal for Black Friday flips this math on its<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> head by offering a four-pack for $64, down from the regular $99 price</a>. You’re basically<strong> paying for two AirTags at full price and getting two additional units as bonus freebies</strong>. This all-time low pricing makes stocking up on trackers for every item you frequently misplace finally affordable, and for iPhone users, it means access to Apple’s <em>Find My</em> network.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision Tracking via Apple’s Vast Network</h2>
<p>AirTags use the<strong> more-than-a-billion-strong Find My network of Apple devices worldwide</strong>, crowdsourcing locations even when items move beyond your Bluetooth range. Any passing iPhone, iPad, or Mac picks up your AirTag’s encrypted signal and relays its location anonymously back to your account without the intermediary device owner ever knowing. This network effect works great in cities where Apple devices are everywhere and provides near real-time updates as your lost item moves through populated spaces.</p>
<p>Precision Finding allows the iPhone 11 and newer to display directional arrows and distance measurements and leads you directly to where lost items are located. Ultra-wideband technology calculates the precise spatial positioning to show you which direction to walk and how many feet remain. The capability turns vague searches like “somewhere in this room” into guided treasure hunts leading you to the couch cushion holding your keys.</p>



<p>The built-in speaker plays sounds when you activate the Find My app which can help you find items buried under papers on your desk or tucked in jacket pockets you might have forgotten to check. The speaker volume gets loud enough to be heard from adjacent rooms, though thick materials like couch cushions muffle it significantly. You can also trigger the speaker when an AirTag separates from your iPhone beyond a certain distance and warns you that you’ve left something behind before you drive away or hop on a train.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is around a year on the user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery</strong> which is a standard size available for a few bucks at grocery stores and gas stations. That replaceable design means you’re not tossing the entire tracker when power runs out, unlike sealed competitors that’ll become e-waste when their batteries eventually die.</p>



<p><strong>Water and dust resistance rated at IP67 lets AirTags survive splashes, rain, and brief submersion</strong> up to one meter for 30 minutes. The sealed construction protects internal components from pocket lint, dirt, and the general abuse that small accessories endure.</p>
<p>With four AirTags costing just $64, when singles are $29 apiece, you’re essentially getting $116 worth of trackers for barely more than the price of buying two units separately. The $35 discount and underlying buy-two-get-two-free math makes this four-pack the only sensible purchase option for iPhone users needing to track multiple items.</p>
