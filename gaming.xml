			<p>While there’s a new film in the Jurassic World series full of smuggling, foolhardy families, and Scarlett Johansson, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> takes a little more inspiration from its celluloid predecessor, Jurassic World Dominion, sticking with the dinosaur conservation angle. It’s this that really lends itself best to building parks and attractions around the world. The aim of the campaign is to build a more interconnected network of parks, bouncing back and forth between locations as you make new discoveries and research groundbreaking technologies.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jurassic World Evolution 3 | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Yx9J3T6gT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The core experience should be immediately familiar to players of the first two games, and to fans of Frontier’s other park management games –&nbsp;though there’s generally less biting in Planet Coaster 2 –&nbsp;and managing your park will be a steady diet of placing enclosures, sending expeditions off to dig sites to find new species, breeding them, tailoring their habitats, and trying to figure out how to make money from the visitors to your park.</p>


<p>Chatting with Jurassic World Evolution 3 Creative Director Andy Fletcher, he told us, “Jurassic World Evolution 3, in many ways, it sort of combines a lot of the best things that we loved about the first two games. You know, there’s some things that we’ve kind of harked back to in the first game – the main campaign’s a bit a bit less linear, so there’s a bit more freedom there, but it’s really, the impetus behind TWE3 was some of the big, big new features that we wanted to add to the series. So, you know, the advent of dinosaur families and the complete overhaul of the park construction tools, those are the real drivers behind this game. ”</p>
<p>One of the delights for dinosaur fans is how each new film and game brings new dinosaurs into the mix. Jurassic World Evolution 3 has a selection of newcomers like the Lokiceratops and Utahraptor, but perhaps more notable is the addition of dinosaur breeding and juvenile dinos that need to mature into adults.</p>


<p>I put it to Andy that this is maybe a doubling of the number of dinosaurs, but he pointed out that it’s beyond that, as there’s male dinos now as well and “they’ve got like crests and they’ve got like frills, they’ve got an entirely new patterns on them… so yeah, there’s a fair bit of work put in to make sure that male and female are different too. Some have bigger body masses. There’s lots there.”</p>
<p>“We wanted to go sort of deeper on the dinosaurs. Rather than just add more, it was about what really takes that element of the gameplay to the next level, when it’s the introduction of family units and the dynamics that come with that. How do the parents behave around the juveniles? How many juveniles want a certain number of other juveniles want in the herd? What happens when the juvenile T. Rex grows up, and wants to be an alpha male? You’ve got to go back in and manage that potentially chaotic situation. So it was just a really fruitful area to explore.”</p>
<p>So how do you get a baby dino now? Well, obviously the way you get a baby dinosaur is to find a mummy dinosaur and a daddy dinosaur who love each other very much, but as you start the game, you’ve only really got the technology and the DNA strands for all the female engineered dinos that stemmed from the founding of the original Jurassic Park.</p>

<p>Cabot Finch’s latest start-up is the DIN (Dinosaur Integration Network), bringing in the familiar voice of Dr Ian Malcolm for some sardonic advice, alongside a cast of other scientists and researchers. “It would kind of make sense that he might sort of do a start up of this nature,” Andy quipped about Cabot’s ongoing role. “You know, he’s a well meaning character, but he’s ambitious and demanding, and he makes for a really fun kind of boss, effectively, who you are trying to satisfy and trying to please.”</p>
<p>One of the first missions you have in the story is to go and research some genetically engineered male dinosaurs, create them in your labs, and then introduce them into the herds, groups and enclosures. Get everything in the right sweet spot and you’ll get little reports of nests with dinosaur eggs in them that can hatch naturally to have little dinos start bounding around getting into trouble. They can also, of course, be captured from the wild and brought to your park and enclosures as a family unit.</p>
<p>Juvenile dinos, and their parents, can start to have some different demands and behaviours as a consequence of this. Andy explained, “The paleo needs are usually quite similar, but someone was mentioning earlier that they released a a some juvenile Sauropod and they were like, “oh, this needs food that’s lower down, when its giant parents were eating them from the tree top.” So, you know, that’s quite an obvious example compared to adults need more space and things like that.</p>
<p>“It’s more in the social needs. It’s more in how paternal are the parents? How much do they are they going to sort of, how many juveniles do they want in their herd? So that’s where we’ve tried to kind of change the either partly on the diet and navigation as well.”</p>
<p>“That’s another dimension, because we have semiaquatic dinosaurs now, but there’s an interesting example of one of the semi-aquatics that where the adult can swim across deep water, the juvenile can’t, so you’ve gotta kind of think about how do I manage that enclosure if I’ve use deep water disclosure?”</p>

<p>I’m really keen to see how deep this system goes in the full game, while still trying to keep things intelligible for the typical player –&nbsp;I have enough trouble figuring out the specifics of what my cat wants, so dealing with teenage raptor mood swings might be a bit much!</p>
<p>And if this style of dino breeding really isn’t your thing, then you’ll still have the ability to wave your scientific magical wand to incubate dinos at your hatcheries, and a Marketplace Facility will let you simply purchase animals. Just note that sellers have a degree of trustworthiness, and you may come across a dinosaur deal that’s a bit too good to be true.</p>
<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 gives you a lot more control over the look and layout of your park, completely overhauling the terrain tools to be a bit more fluid and flexible. It’s this that Andy would highlight as his favourite new feature – surprisingly it’s not the raptor chasing a goat on the loading screen.</p>
<p>“I think my favourite feature is the overhaul of the environmental tools that basically your ability to form terrain so that it’s really satisfying to use. You don’t have to be super creative to do something quick and fun, that feels good, and that is really impactful on the park.”</p>

<p>He continued, “When you go to put down a building, it’s just the same as it ever was, it’s exactly the same number of presses it ever was – I counted. But you’ve got this new area where you can go and explore custom creations, you can you can custom create this particular building from scratch, if you like, and get involved in that section if you want to.</p>
<p>“It’s all about kind of nesting that complexity of the features so that you can kind of always dive down deeper, but if you just want to enjoy the fruits of it all you can stay at that top level.”</p>
<p>On the surface level, it does have the same immediacy and feel as previous Jurassic World Evolution games, but now there’s more types of ground manipulation brushes to give different effects. One of those is to create waterfalls, placing water at the top of a mountain and then pushing pool from a lower level to get the gravity to do its thing. You can also, as Andy pointed out to me, create natural enclosures out the terrain.</p>

<p>It’s a good enhancement, but, as I always find with 3D terrain manipulation tools, it still takes a bit of getting used to with fairly wide brushes to paint not always giving me the precision I wanted, and the intensity and slope metrics to handle. It’s a similar way to how you have to juggle the various terrain and foliage types in an enclosure, getting the right balance in grass for pasture taking away from the muddy swamp that they might also want some of.</p>
<p>It’s lovely to have Frontier continuing to grow their prehistoric park manager, and Jurassic World Evolution 3 looks to be hitting a lot of fan-pleasing notes. Revamped terrain tools, alongside blueprints and sharing, and then the impressive introduction of juvenile dinos and family units, and a broader world-spanning campaign will all go down like a live goat to a T. Rex.</p>

<p>We'll miss you, friend</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's always difficult to say goodbye to someone, and today we bid farewell to our lovely, <em>lovely</em> video producer Zion Grassl, who is leaving Nintendo Life for pastures new.</p>
<p>Zion joined us all the way back in 2019, and helped our YouTube channel grow exponentially as we navigated the world of the Nintendo Switch. His enthusiasm and infectious passion for all things Nintendo really struck a chord with our viewers, and we're incredibly sad to see him go.</p>
<p>He leaves us with some truly incredible videos, including the hugely ambitious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsuFsGwpJgs">'I Tried 3DS StreetPass For 365 Days'</a>, the hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VglKld20Hic">'The MOTHER We Share'</a> documentary, and the delightfully ridiculous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuQZVtzdIo">'I Bought 100 Copies of Mario Paint for the Art'</a>. We simply cannot put a price on Zion's remarkable contributions to the channel, and we're certain that wherever he ends up next, he'll go on to do even greater things.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, I (yes, me, Ollie) am incredibly grateful for Zion's friendship over the years. His presence during my first trip to LA for Summer Game Fest was immensely comforting, and it made the trip infinitely more enjoyable. He truly is one of the most caring, uplifting spirits you could ever hope to meet, and I'm proud to call him my friend.</p>
<p>So from me, and from all of us here at Nintendo Life, we wish Zion the very best of luck. If you want to keep up with his work, you can find him on socials under the handle @ZionDood. In the meantime, please do continue to support the wonderful work that Alex and Felix continue to do over on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nintendolife">YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
<p>Love you, Zion!</p>

<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159239/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're a long-time fan or just curious, it’s natural to approach the release of a new JRPG with measured expectations. These games often build on rich lore and deep series history, rewarding those who enjoy exploring vast worlds and narratives. On the surface, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> might seem like just another drop in the genre ocean, especially since it belongs to <strong>The Legend of Heroes</strong>, where the Trails cycle alone spans 13 games. However, this reboot benefits from the clean narrative slate of a series opener and a generous modernisation that will appeal to fans and newcomers across the board. This may be the beginning of a long remake series, but it’s a hell of an intro.</p>
<p>The story takes place in Liberl, a technologically advanced region of a much larger world. Here we meet two siblings, who are beginning their training as freelance guardians of the land. Estelle and Joshua are engaging dual protagonists; their endearing relationship and playful bickering are the heart of the story. As they rise through the ranks of a peacekeeping force called the Bracers, they are joined by a huge cast of characters and a constantly shifting roster of party members. There are too many to list here, but aside from the Bright siblings, I was especially fond of the musical fop Oliviere (voiced by Matt Mercer in the English audio track).</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159229/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Liberl feels like a living, breathing world, with bustling population centres and NPC dialogue that shifts based on the story's events. Dialogue choices offer a sense of narrative agency and it always feels worth chatting up locals when you frequent a town. In true JRPG fashion, the story takes a while to really breathe (you can easily spend a dozen hours in the prologue), but there is plenty to do from the outset, so you won’t be stuck in stop-start dialogue or endless tutorials.</p>
<p>There will be many an info screen in the opening hours, however, largely thanks to a pleasingly complex battle system. As trainee Bracers, Estelle and Joshua spend much of their time completing missions that pit them against a wide variety of monsters. Fighting the fauna of Liberl is both flexible and accessible. While the systems on offer aren’t unique, the sheer number of options available to your party keeps combat exciting.</p>
<p>Ability sets are built using a slotting system called Quartz, crafted from a material known as Sepith. These materials drop from enemies in several types, and combining them to fill gear slots unlocks different spells and abilities. Beyond quartz-based magic, your party also has a suite of melee and ranged techniques that can be chained, overcharged, and combined for devastating critical damage. Each party member has utility and can support their companions with elemental boosts.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159232/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat can play out in real time or switch to a queue-based tactical variant. Most battles will require the strategic turn-based mode, while traversing the open world is a breeze with the real-time system.</p>
<p>It takes some time to get comfortable with the options at your disposal, but once it all clicks the fighting is a blast. For anyone familiar with the series, these mechanics are a mix of ideas from earlier entries, which is just part of the modern overhaul this remake provides.</p>
<p>Falcom’s update shifts the perspective away from an isometric, polygonal style to a fully animated 3D Liberl. The world is bright and colourful, while combat feels fluid and looks spectacular. The industry may currently lean in favour of remasters, but this is a ground-up remake with some generous quality-of-life updates included.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159226/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Newly recorded Japanese and English audio tracks are solid, though the Japanese voices edge out their counterparts thanks to some especially endearing performances, particularly Tomoyo Takayanagi as Estelle. On the music side, the option to switch between three different suites is a welcome addition. The arranged option is particularly stunning.</p>
<p>As for gameplay, high-speed mode will be a blessing for returning players and a boon for anyone looking to grind XP without the drag. Difficulty settings cover a wide spectrum, from casual mode to the punishing nightmare, a series staple that makes its return here.</p>
<p>The game releases on both Switch 1 and 2, with a cheap upgrade pack for those that might invest in the new console at a later date. Performance-wise, the original Switch outputs in a noticeable 30fps with an impact to the quality when compared to its big brother. The journey of our sibling Bracers is most impressive on Switch 2, which targets 60fps.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159237/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Undocked is notably the best mode and runs with what feels like flawless stability in combat and wandering the open world. Docked is also strong, but there is the odd frame hiccup in population centres and during visually busy battles. The game isn’t a visual powerhouse by any means, but it’s nice to see the characters adventure through lovingly designed environments without any compromises on the newer console.</p>
<p>1st Chapter is an exciting start to what may become a successful series of remakes. Its engaging, emergent story and wealth of charming characters deserve to be experienced anew or discovered for the first time. Most of all, it revitalised my love affair with JRPGs, a saturated genre of which this feels like a refreshing new high-water mark.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a comprehensive audio-visual update of a classic series opener, with great characters, a world that you’ll want to explore, and deep combat with a wealth of options. The updated style runs best on Switch 2, with only the odd stumble in docked performance.</p></section>

Based on time of day and year, global fertility rates, and our own secret, illegal research into RPS supporter breeding patterns, I calculate that there's a 12% chance you are reading this while carrying or cradling a small child. If that's the case, then: what on Earth are you doing here? We post all kinds of awful grown-up things on RPS. Mark is threatening to do another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">salacious mod article</a> and just this very morning, I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-final-fantasy-tactics-vr-free-alien-wooden-mice-mazes-and-opulent-card-games">posted</a> a picture of a xenomorph covered in blood. 
</p>
<p>
This piece should be safe for kids, however, as long as you don't explain what a xenomorph is or what "salacious" means. It's about Messenger, a free browser-based game in which you run around a very small 3D watercolour planet, delivering post. I suspect you and your child will enjoy it, unless we've already corrupted them and you're now playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aliens-fireteam">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Created using WebGL, Messenger is from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">Short Hike</a> school of vibes-driven pocket worlds with gentle to-do lists. The controls consist of moving with WASD and jumping - more of a lazy hop, really - with space bar. You've got a few deliveries to make off the bat, and you can take on more assignments by chatting to people.

The dialogue writing is quite spry. I delivered a letter to a bald man which turned out to be from his past self. "Take care of your hair," it read. Sad trombone. You don't really need an objective, mind: it's enough just to amble down the road and watch the horizon unroll. There's also the option of customising your outfit, and an emoji system for communicating with the other players - yes, those are other players! - who pop into your session at random.
</p><p>
<a href="https://messenger.abeto.co/">Find Messenger here</a>. Try not to get it confused with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-the-messenger"><em>The</em> Messenger</a>, an upsettingly hard game about ninjas. It's kind of ridiculous that this kind of game now hums along in a browser, isn't it? Imagine that it's 2000 and you found this on AOL - your head would asplode. Your modem would probably asplode, as well. "Asplode" is a reference to noted early noughties comedy website <a href="https://homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner</a>, by the way - your kid likely isn't old enough for Strongbad yet, but it's the kind of thing they'll love when they start school. Better than the rest of the junk you find on those modern videophones, anyway.
</p>
<p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When we look back on 2025, we might remember it as the Year of the Mini PC. These mighty mites broke out in a huge way this year, with powerful and fast new models flooding the market and putting to rest the idea that the mini PC is no more than an amusing toy. Virtually all of these new-breed mini PCs have pushed the productivity and work angle as their selling point, but now the BOSGAME P3 Mini Gaming PC has arrived, combining serious processing and graphics power essential for PC gaming with the ultra-compact body that has made the mini PC such a hot item.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/">There’s a limited-time 27% off deal on the BOSGAME P3 at Amazon right now which gives you the chance to shrink your gaming rig smaller than you ever thought possible, and do it for just $400.</a> With the P3 running the show, your gaming station can now fit three massive 4K gaming monitors and your specialized keyboard, mouse, and controller while the PC at the heart of the system is tucked behind one of those monitors, delivering top-level performance while remaining unseen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gaming PC, Not a Toy</h2>
<p>The old-school thought that these fun-sized desktop PCs are mere curiosities and toys that could never possibly compete with a full-sized rig is just that — old school. Beneath its teeny hood the P3 packs an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 processor with a top speed of 5.1GHz, more than enough to keep you in the game even during a fast-action first-person shooter or battle royal game.</p>
<p>There’s also 32GB of RAM built in, along with a fat 1TB NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD. And while you certainly would not guess it from looking at this palm-sized PC, you can expand that RAM to 64GB, and there’s even a vacant NVMe PCIe slot available for you to max out the storage.</p>



<h2>Fast, Smooth Graphics</h2>
<p>And, yes, we did say three huge 4K gaming monitors, because the P3 can support them all with HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C ports at the ready. The AMD Radeon 780M graphics chip is able to keep up with the fastest and most visually detailed games without lag or glitching. And whether you go with the Wi-Fi6E connection, the Bluetooth 5.2 one, or either of the two Gigabit Ethernet RJ45 ports for hardwired online gaming, you will never be lacking in speed.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before a mini PC for gamers hit the market, and when you look at the prices of those enormous rigs with the fancy neon lighting and clear panels showing the guts of the machine, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/">you’ll really be blown away by the $400 price tag on the BOSGAME P3 Mini Gaming PC that you’ll find right now at Amazon.</a> But, it’s only there for a limited time, so be as fast as the P3’s impressive processing and internet speed and get to Amazon now before it’s over.</p>

                <p>A new Lord of the Rings game is in development and is a third-person action game designed to "compete with Hogwarts Legacy," according to a new report.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> said it heard from sources close to the project that the unannounced and untitled game is funded, in part, by the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), to the tune of around $100 million USD. A deal could be made public as soon as next week, the report said.</p><p>In addition to ADIO, the rumored new Lord of the Rings game is said to involve Embracer, which is the company that owns the rights to Lord of the Rings games (and other extensions of the fantasy series). The developer Revenge is said to be involved as well.</p><p>A spokesperson for Embracer said, "We do not comment on rumors or speculation." The developer Revenge declined to comment as well when approached by Insider Gaming.</p><p>The report had no specific details on the supposed new Lord of the Rings game, so it's unclear at this stage what it means that the game could be designed to compete with Hogwarts Legacy. That game, released in 2023, was an enormous success, becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4951">No. 1 best-selling game of the year in the US.</a> A sequel is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">now a top priority at Warner Bros.</a></p><p>As for The Lord of the Rings, games based on the franchise have not fared all that well of late. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum had such a troubled launch in 2023 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gollum-studios-next-lotr-game-canceled-dev-no-longer-making-games-at-all/1100-6515620/" data-ref-id="1100-6515620">its developer canceled its next game and stopped making games altogether.</a> This year's Tales of the Shire got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-of-the-shire-review-concerning-and-also-there-are-hobbits/1900-6418389/" data-ref-id="1900-6418389">mixed reviews.</a></p><p>The existence of a new Lord of the Rings game from Embracer is no surprise at all, as the company said more than a year ago that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lord-of-the-rings-games-being-prototyped-right-now/1100-6525818/" data-ref-id="1100-6525818">prototyping multiple new games.</a> Before this, Embracer's Lord of the Rings boss, Lee Guinchard, spoke about how <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/a-new-generation-of-j-r-r-tolkien-games-is-coming-lee-guinchard-exclusive-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he wants there to be a renaissance for Lord of the Rings games.</a></p><p>In addition to this new mysterious project, Embracer is working with Amazon Games currently on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-lord-of-the-rings-games-on-the-way/1100-6514561/" data-ref-id="1100-6514561">new MMO in the Middle-earth universe</a>.</p><p>There have been many iconic Lord of the Rings games over the years. In particular, some of the early movie tie-ins were well-received, while the more recent Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War were enjoyable as well--but developer Monolith has since shut down. On the less-serious side, there are also Lego Lord of the Rings and Lego The Hobbit titles that are fondly remembered. Check out the gallery below to see some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-lord-of-the-rings-games-ranked/1100-6503738/" data-ref-id="1100-6503738">best Lord of the Rings games ever.</a></p><p>Beyond video games, Embracer is working with Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema on multiple upcoming films, including The Hunt for Gollum. Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in Peter Jackson's original The Lord of the Rings series, is coming back to direct this film.</p>

            <p>Epic has pulled a Peacemaker dance emote from battle royale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, after the latest episode of the TV show proves just how controversial that dance is.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler warning for Peacemaker Season 2 Episode 6</strong></p>
<p>The Peaceful Hips emote was added to Fortnite earlier this month, which features John Cena's character hip-thrusting and holding his arms in rigid 90 degree angles.</p>
<p>Now, though, it's been removed, with refunds likely to be issued in the next few days. "We're disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in Fortnite as we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote," reads a social post from Fortnite. "Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in Fortnite as we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks.</p>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Why so controversial? Well it turns out, as revealed in the latest episode, Peacemaker has been living in an alternate dimension where Nazis won World War 2 and the American flag's stars have been swapped for swastika.</p>
<p>And looking at the dance emote in retrospect, yeah, it's pretty obviously imitating swastika.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Peacemaker’s dance emote from Fortnite has been disabled.</p><p>“As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days.” <a href="https://t.co/hwHqOiid1o">pic.twitter.com/hwHqOiid1o</a></p></div>— DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) <a href="https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1972176095580754324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>What's most remarkable about this is that Warner Bros. agreed on the collaboration with Epic, but seemingly didn't forewarn them of the emote's true meaning. Perhaps they were worried about spoilers leaking ahead of the episode airing last week.</p>
<p>Peacemaker writer and director James Gunn posted earlier this month about Peacemaker's inclusion in Fortnite, adding "check out his bundle, complete with Peacemaker's best friend Eagly and a peace-spreading, hip-swaying emote or two ;)" - that winky face is doing a lot of heavy lifting here.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Nobody wants nazi symbolism in their kid-friendly battle royale, but it's not just the TV show's viewers who have been duped by a big twist.</p>
<p>Could this impact any future collaborations between Epic and Warner Bros.? Eurogamer has contacted Epic to find out.</p>
<p>Leaks have suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-and-shadow-coming-to-fortnite-leaks-suggest-but-not-how-youd-expect">Sonic and Shadow will be headed to Fortnite</a> in some form soon, though hopefully will prove less controversial.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gearbox Debuts the First New Vault Hunter Coming to Borderlands 4 in Paid DLC]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gearbox-debuts-first-new-vault-hunter-borderlands-4-paid-story-dlc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gearbox-debuts-the-first-new-vault-hunter-coming-to-borderlands-4-in-paid-dlc.1311556/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over this past weekend, during Tokyo Game Show 2025, Gearbox and 2K unveiled the first of two new vault hunters that'll be joining Borderlands 4 as part of the game's first paid story DLC set to release sometime during Q1 2026.</p>



<p>The new hunter's name is C4SH, a former casino bot turned vault hunter whose skills and abilities will be "<em>distinctly unpredictable, as they all involve an element of chance</em>," <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/c4sh-vault-hunter-teaser/">according to Gearbox in a blog post</a> on the Borderlands 4 website.</p>



<figure><figcaption>C4SH's kit in Borderlands 4. Image credit: Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>We don't exactly know what that means for now, but Gearbox has said that we'll learn more about who C4SH is and his abilities as we get closer to the release of the first story DLC pack, Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned. A short teaser trailer released alongside the reveal of C4SH gives us a visual of the character and his kit, but doesn't go into detail on them.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Vault Hunter Teaser: C4SH" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1XYW_fOS3k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>If you purchased the Super Deluxe Edition of Borderlands 4 or the Vault Hunter Pack for the game, then you won't have to make an additional purchase when C4SH and the Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned story pack go live. If you just bought the base game, then you'll have to grab this paid DLC separately.</p>



<p>It's all well and good to see what Gearbox is working on bringing to Borderlands 4, particularly for players who've already blown through the game's main story campaign in the last two weeks since it was released and are looking for more to do. But it would be easier to be more excited about it if it weren't for the fact that players are still experiencing major technical issues with the game.</p>



<p>Gearbox is updating the game as quickly as it can, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-update-adds-fov-slider-consoles-stability-improvements-more/">adding technical fixes and (in some cases) adding features that really should have been in the game at launch</a>, but it'll likely be a while before all of its major issues have been mopped up.</p>



<p>It can also only be seen as humorous that the teaser trailer for C4SH includes a mention of the Nintendo Switch 2 version, which, on top of Borderlands 4's other issues, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">was indefinitely delayed last week</a> after initially scheduled to release on October 3.</p>



<p>A new Vault Hunter on the scene is nice. A game without major frame rate issues that didn't crash all the time would be better.</p>

Unlike the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir G8 Plus</a> that offers similar functionality by clamping on to the top and bottom of a phone turned sideways recreating the ergonomics of the Nintendo Switch, this new controller is much smaller and keeps the phone vertical. GameSir didn’t make any formal announcements of what the accessory is called, what it will cost, compatibility, or when it will be released.</p><p>Although the accessory is visible in the background of a <a href="https://x.com/mygamesir/status/1971130648166564029">photo GameSir shared of its TGS booth on X</a>, better photos were shared by the <a href="https://x.com/yoshivesmovie">X account, @Yoshivesmovie</a>, after getting the chance to go hands-on with the controller. The C-shaped accessory slides on to the bottom of a smartphone and features a D-pad, Start and Select buttons, and four action buttons that are all styled after the Game Boy’s. There’s also a pair of additional face buttons plus shoulder buttons on the back ensuring it can be used to play more than just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150467/delta-emulator-apple-app-voice-notes-ai-vergecast">emulated Game Boy titles</a>.</p><p>It’s not known how the controller will connect to a smartphone, but the photos seem to show a cutout on the bottom that may keep a phone’s charging port accessible. If the accessory isn’t relying on a USB-C connection, it will probably use Bluetooth which also means it will have its own rechargeable battery. Having yet another accessory to remember to charge isn’t ideal, but the ergonomics look much better than the recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785720/xiaomi-retro-handheld-phone-case-17-pro-gaming">Retro Handheld Console Case for the Xiaomi 17 series smartphones</a> that only works with the camera bump screen on the back of the phone.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/787200/gamesir-controller-smartphone-nintendo-game-boy-tokyo-game-show]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-has-one-of-the-best-and-creepiest-puzzles-of-the-year.1311550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Early on in <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><i>Silent Hill f</i></a>, as Hinako and friends try to regroup after the fog and its monsters roll into town, our girl finds herself stranded in the middle of a field, surrounded by scarecrows dressed like schoolchildren wielding sickles. Like many moments in <i>f</i>, the way through this challenge involves some puzzle solving and a couple of scuffles. What really makes this moment sing, however, is how it combines the separate elements of <i>Silent Hill f</i> into one: Puzzle solving, paranoid dread, and combat that will punish you for sloppy mistakes.</p> <p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em>: The&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></p> <p>The scarecrows are, of course, no ordinary scarecrows, and can definitely turn those sickles on you. They don’t attack immediately, however; instead, they remain frozen, waiting for you to pick the right one based on a cryptic riddle, after which the correct scarecrow will point you in the direction of the next challenge and eventually out of the fog. Choose the wrong scarecrow and you’ll get attacked, with few replacement weapons in sight. Oh, and you’ll regularly hear footsteps behind you as you try to figure out which scarecrow is the correct one. Yes, they are following you, but only when you’re not looking. The number of scarecrows and the speed with which they freeze when you turn to look at them is enough to make you question whether or not you’re hearing things, and even those footsteps don’t guarantee an attack every time you hear them. Early on, I wondered if the game was just playing the sound effect to screw with me. Nope! I was eventually attacked by one of these freaks.</p> <p>The horror of this whole scene isn’t one of blood dripping red in your face, but instead comes from the pressure to figure out the puzzle, which is virtually immune to brute force solutions, in a timely manner. The sheer tension of this situation, sustained in the perpetual gray fog of this endless field, makes it one of <i>f</i>’s best moments.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629872" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629872"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629872">© Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Most of <i>Silent Hill f</i>’s puzzles resist brute-force solutions due to their sheer number of variables. Many of them are technically solvable by just trying out every possible combination, but it’s all too easy to end up spinning your wheels in frustration for far longer than is necessary instead (ask me how I know). What makes the field puzzle so uniquely resistant to brute force is that it punishes you rather harshly for just trying to spam your way through it.</p>

 <p>Each scarecrow segment starts with a riddle like:</p> <blockquote><p>Can you even imagine how I feel?<br> I’ll put on my polite smile for now.</p></blockquote> <p>You’ll then need to choose the one that best fits the description from among around half-a-dozen scarecrows. It’s not easy; you’ll have to determine which scarecrow seems to give a “polite smile,” or in another instance, which scarecrow looks like it’s betraying another.</p>

 <p>Against your better judgment, you’ll have to get up close and personal with many of the scarecrows, with footsteps playing behind you sporadically, and the chance that one of these freaks is actually ready to jump you at any moment.</p> <p>During my first playthrough, I screwed up the final puzzle of this whole sequence and had about five or six scarecrows stalking me around the feels as I frantically tore at the remaining ones to find the correct solution.</p> <p>The puzzle also deals with <i>f</i>’s consistent themes about love, longing, betrayal, and harm; so, not only is the game asking you to survive the dread of the endless gray fog and murderous scarecrows, but you’ll also be trying to figure out how this sequence fits in with <i>f</i>’s cryptic narrative. It’s a nice mixture of traditional survival horror puzzle solving,&nbsp; the threat of the game’s punishing combat, and its looming sense of dread, all without feeling like it’s a bunch of abstract symbol-matching or number crunching.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-peacemaker-dance-pulled-over-nazi-concerns-following-latest-episode%E2%80%99s-big-reveal.1311544/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>“Peaceful Hips” is an&nbsp;emote that was added to <em>Fortnite</em> earlier this month. Part of the “DC Series,” it cost 400 V-Bucks and referenced HBO’s show <em>Peacemaker</em>, specifically a dance move the character does in the season 2 intro that has him flapping his arms and swerving his hips around. That was all fine and good until the comic book series’ big season 2 reveal last week cast it in a different light. Epic Games has now pulled the cosmetic over concerns about its “creative intentions.” In plain English, Epic is worried it might be intended to look like a Nazi Swastika.</p> <p>“We’re disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in <em>Fortnite</em> as we inquire into our partner’s creative intentions in this collab emote,” the battle roayle’s <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447">official account</a> announced over the weekend. “Assuming it’s not coming back, we’ll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks.” All of this weirdness stems from the following dance which players were previously able to buy separately or as part of the Peacemaker bundle:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629848" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629848"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629848">Epic Games / DiscussingFilm / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It wasn’t until <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2 episode 6 that some people started seeing it in a different light. Full <strong>spoiler warning</strong> ahead if you haven’t watched yet and don’t want to know what happens.</p> <p>Chris Smith, AKA Peacemaker, doesn’t want to leave the alternate dimension where things seem “perfect” despite that menacing suspicion that something is very, very off.&nbsp; It turns out that this Earth-2 the mercenary’s been hanging out in is actually Earth-X, our planet in an alternate timeline where the United States lost to Hitler’s Germany in WWII. In case the lack of any non-white people didn’t give it away already, the big reveal comes when Chris realizes there’s a Swastika on the American flag. It now seems like that Nazi theme may have made it into the <em>Fortnite</em> emote. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/09/28/fortnite-disables-alleged-nazi-peacemaker-emote-after-show-reveal/"><em>Forbes</em> notes</a> its similarity to a&nbsp; dance Donald Duck performs in the&nbsp; Disney short “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7vb89c6pQY">Der Fuehrer’s Face</a>” when he’s trained to become a Nazi.</p> <p>The headscratching part is how Epic Games didn’t know about this twist coming ahead of time, or who at Warner Bros. or HBO would have tried to keep its “creative intentions” hidden. The show is written and directed by James Gunn, the creative force fueling <em>Superman</em> and the rest of the rebooted DC universe right now. Epic would have seemingly developed the emote in-house, suggesting that it didn’t initially raise any suspicions internally. Live by the branded cosmetic, fail by the branded cosmetic, I suppose.</p>

                <p>Epic Games has announced that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> emote associated with retiring WWE superstar and current movie mega-star John Cena has been disabled, maybe indefinitely, because of its possible Nazi connection.</p><p>Peaceful Hips, <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1972176095580754324" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an emote in the popular battle royale shooter</a>, was created in collaboration between James Gunn's DC show Peacemaker and Epic Games. The emote sees your character goofily rotate their hips before making alternating "L" shapes with their arms. If you've watched Peacemaker, then you're familiar with the dance; it's what Cena performs in the second season's opening montage. It's awkward and stiff, which is what's supposed to make it a lighthearted gaff, particularly given the character's often violent personality. However, with the show's latest episode, the quirky dance--and Fortnite emote--have taken on a whole new meaning.</p><h4>Light Spoilers for Peacemaker S2, E6</h4><p>Titled "Ignorance Is Chris," the September 25 episode sees Peacemaker discover that the alternate dimension he's so fond of is actually Nazi America. This version of the US shows a true Anglo state, where there are only white people, and the stars of the American flag have been replaced with swastikas. It's this fact that unlocks the new meaning behind Peacemaker's dance in the opening of Season 2; those alternating "L" shapes he's making with his arms are stand-ins for the swastika.</p><p>With some <a href="https://x.com/JonesyFrotting/status/1971989740489789894" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fans pointing this</a> out on <a href="https://x.com/CTropes/status/1971797634576011500" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X/Twitter</a>, Epic Games has pulled the emote offline, possibly indefinitely, as it investigates its partner's "creative intentions."</p><p>"We're disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in Fortnite as we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote," Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on X/Twitter</a> on September 28. "Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks."</p><p>Peacemaker showrunner James Gunn hasn't publicly commented on the situation. As noted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/fortnite-quickly-pulls-peacemaker-emote-while-it-figures-out-our-partners-creative-intentions-after-the-shows-huge-twist-gives-it-a-whole-new-meaning/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, however, Gunn <a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1967015798939283554" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">promoted the collab on X/Twitter</a> on September 13. Considering how frequently he posts on the social media site, there's a possibility he'll say something about Epic Games' decision.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Hades 2 is the first sequel that Supergiant has ever created. The studio formed in 2009 and previously made Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and the original Hades. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">Hades 2 review</a> rewarded the follow-up with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamespot-10-10-review-score/2900-153/#16">a prestigious 10/10</a>--the second title to earn that score this year (Split Fiction being the other).</p><p>Looking ahead, Supergiant hasn't teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-dev-on-how-it-will-choose-next-game-and-major-industry-issues/1100-6535044/">what could be next from the developer</a>. However, it's expected that Hades 2 will come to PlayStation and Xbox platforms in the future, similarly to the original.

If approved, the acquisition would be one of the most expensive in the history of the video game industry and would make Electronic Arts a privately held company. Given the questionable ownership, the internet is not taking the news well.</span></p> <p><span>The Saudi Arabian government’s attempts at sportswashing away the stink of its dire human rights laws, as evidenced by its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367"><span>investments in various facets of the video game industry</span></a><span>, are well-documented at this point.

Beyond that, the Saudi Arabian government has been hosting events with industry figureheads like Hideo Kojima. The nation’s monetary investment in video games has been extensive, but buying one of the biggest companies in the space, whose games are played by millions every year, is almost certainly the farthest-reaching move it’s made thus far. We don’t know what impact this will have on EA, its studios, and its IP in the future, but in this moment, things look bleak.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We may not be getting a handheld Xbox anytime soon, but this will be the next closest thing. Asus has partnered with Microsoft to create an update to the ROG Ally with official-branding for Xbox. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally enters the market as a new competitor to the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch 2 to be your go-to gaming handheld. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/">It’s set to arrive on October 16 and the pre-order window has just opened up.</a> Head on over to Amazon and reserve yours today for $600.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the core improvements on this model over the existing Asus ROG Ally. This new model is now powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and puts to use an all-new streamlined Windows OS. Both will lead to a smoother user experience both in and out of your games.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Your Gaming Library, Anywhere</h2>
<p>Access your full library of PC games and boot up directly into the new Xbox App UI. Stream Xbox games from either your console or from Microsoft’s cloud streaming service. The Xbox Game bar can be accessed quickly via the Xbox button on the left side of the handheld. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally also has support for Steam, Epic Games Store and other game stores so you won’t just be locked into the Xbox architecture.</p>
<p>The gaming handheld comes with 16GB of dual channel RAM along with a 512GB PCle Gen4 M.2 2280 SSD. Storage is upgradable if you wish to download more games than the default capacity allows.</p>



<p>The screen measures in at seven inches across, same as the Steam Deck, and weighs just under 1.5 lbs. — almost exactly the same as the Steam Deck on that front too. The display is capable of 1080p HD along with a refresh rate of 120Hz. The redesigned chassis is pulls inspiration from the model Xbox wireless core controllers, employing new contoured grips for better comfort gaming all day long. Choose to play either handheld or hooked up to your TV via the dual USB-C ports.</p>
<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally has a 60Wh battery to your game time running long and can recharge fairly quickly. Just have it plugged in for a half hour will get it back up from zero to 50% battery life.</p>
<p>Alongside this model is the upgraded Asus ROG Xbox Ally X which features a more powerful processor, more RAM and a full 1TB SSD, doubling the base model’s storage capacity. It also comes with an 80Wh battery. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/">Unfortunately, most storefronts appear to be sold out on the X model, but you can still pre-order the Asus ROG Xbox Ally for $600 over at Amazon.</a></p>

<p>Silver Lake was part of the consortium involved in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/china-keeps-the-algorithm-critics-attack-trumps-tiktok-deal/">this month's controversial deal</a> to bring Tiktok under the control of US-based companies. Back in 2013, the private investment firm also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/michael-dell-wins-buyout-bid-after-icahn-takes-ball-goes-home/">helped take computer-maker Dell private in a $25 billion deal</a>.</p>
<p>Affinity Partners CEO Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump, said in a statement that he has "admired [EA's] ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games – and now enjoys them with his kids – I couldn’t be more excited about what’s ahead."</p>
<p>EA first went public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1990, and by 1996 its market cap had risen to $1.61 billion. Last week, the company's valuation was hovering around $43 billion.</p>
<p>EA brought in $7.5 billion in revenue in the 2025 fiscal year (ending March 31) on the strength of franchises including <em>Madden NFL</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, <em>Battlefield</em>, <em>The Sims</em>, <em>Dragon Age</em>, and <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>.</p>

            <p>Heart Machine, the studio behind sci-fi Zelda-like Hyper Light Drifter, has a new metroidvania out next month called Possessor(s).</p>
<p>Publisher Devolver released a new gameplay overview trailer over the weekend revealing its PS5 and PC release date of 11th November.</p>
<p>Possessor(s) is a metroidvania (or "search action" game, as the developers are describing it) set in a quarantined cyberpunk city, with players taking the role of high school student Luca who's struck a deal with a demon.</p>

<p>As with Hyper Light Drifter, the game is visually arresting, here a clean animated aesthetic as Luca explores a cityscape controlled by a corrupt energy megacorporation.</p>
<p>Combat, meanwhile, is inspired by Nintendo's Smash Bros. fighting series. Luca will be able to juggle enemies with aerial attacks, with makeshift weapons ranging from a computer mouse, to a guitar and a pair of sunglasses.</p>
<p>It's looking great, especially if it can live up to the exceptional quality of Hyper Light Drifter, though there's stiff genre competition from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> at the moment.</p>
<p>Still, Heart Machine in January released a surprising miss with its roguelike Hyper Light Breaker that remains in early access, but has a Mixed rating on Steam. It's still being regularly updated, though, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-breaker-receives-community-suggested-fixes-as-studio-acknowledges-risk-of-early-access">studio acknowledging the "risk" of early access</a>.</p>

<p>The deal, which is expected to close in Q1 FY 2027, was confirmed earlier today, following a report last week from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjGI4bh2ChypG-9gaU4qrQZFignKjZm8EjJFqEKJbszfMv0Uyk0spCKAkIGRcw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68d6e0aa&amp;gaa_sig=Zf9usHKAPLc-xSauIbct6cEJae6QEXZDp84TM7SJsSlbIQtorAg_Hxy8OCUW_MYx6L4o8fLt5FyADejiqmwsQA%3D%3D">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>. The company is most famous for its series of sports titles, <strong>The Sims</strong>, <strong>Battlefield</strong>, and for publishing BioWare's <strong>Dragon Age</strong> and <strong>Mass Effect</strong> series.</p>
<p>Notably, the deal is made up of an equity investment of $36 billion dollars, with a $20 billion dollar debt in EA's name. This, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lzy2ieztws2w">as Schreier puts it</a>, could lead to layoffs, more monetisation, and cost-cutting measures.</p><div><figure data-videoid="zEeK-8I84eI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEeK-8I84eI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zEeK-8I84eI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEeK-8I84eI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61cb68vyxlit&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of Electronic Arts has shared this statement on the deal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PIF previously owned 9.9% of the company and was already the third-largest institutional owner of EA. As a reminder, the PIF owns stakes in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/saudi-arabias-pif-further-reduces-its-stake-in-nintendo">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/5percent-of-capcom-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund">Capcom</a>, Embracer Group, and Take-Two Interactive.</p>
<p>Turqi Alnowaiser, the PIF's Deputy Governor and Head of International Investments, says that “PIF has demonstrated a strong commitment to [global gaming and esports] sectors, and this partnership will help further drive EA’s long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale.”</p>
<p>In terms of the other acquirers, Silver Lake is one of the companies potentially involved with TikTok's US spin-off, while Affinity Partners is the investment firm founded by the current US President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silent Hill f officially arrived on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this past September 25, 2026, <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/">and according to Konami, by Sept. 26, 2025</a>, the latest entry in the Silent Hill franchise and the first one to make several big changes such as setting the game in Japan and not in the US for the first time, hit one million copies sold.</p>



<p>One million copies sold in one day is a huge milestone for what is the first new Silent Hill game in years and a continuation of the momentum that Konami was able to kickstart with the help of Bloober Team delivering above and beyond what players expected in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>



<p>It took the Silent Hill 2 Remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/">a week to hit one million copies sold</a>. Konami could have had no better endorsement in the return of its beloved horror series than to see the first brand-new entry hit the same sales milestones as a nostalgia-charged remake six days faster.</p>



<p>"<em>The remake of Silent Hill 2 released last year, surpassed one million units shipped worldwide within a week of its release, but Silent Hill f is growing in shipments at an even faster pace in each</em> <em>region, including Japan</em>," Konami writes in its announcement of the sales milestone.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's good to see one of the videogame industry's most influential series make such a strong return with its last two entries, but more particularly with Silent Hill f simply because it's the first brand-new game because of how many big swings and risks it takes to change things up.</p>



<p>In our review of Silent Hill f, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo wrote</a>, "<em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for the next major&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>update, and since it'll arrive not long before the spookiest day of the year, you can expect lots of creepy treats to enjoy.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Version 2.3, which will, naturally, follow on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-22-release-date" rel="nofollow">September's Version 2.2</a>, will be arriving on October 15th, bringing three brand new Agents for your team, a new map to explore, and more.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you'll be exploring the brand new Timesworn Hills area, which, as HoYoverse says, is a place where "ghost stories echo through abandoned ruins". You'll be investigating the disappearance of miners in the region, which will lead to the discovery of "unsettling truths".</p>

<p>She's joined by Yidhari, an S-Rank Ice Rupture Agent whose damage is boosted as her HP falls. You'll need to strike a balance between risk and safety if you want to maximize her damage potential.</p>

<p>Your final new Agent in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.3 is Komano Manato, an A-Rank Fire Rupture Agent who gains damage as his HP scales. S-Rank Agents Vivian and Ju Fufu will also be available during this update as rerun banners.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new powered-up version of Soldier 0 - Anby, who first debuted during&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-16-march" rel="nofollow">Version 1.6</a>, as well as a new turn-based combat challenge and the return of the Snap! Shining Strike photography event.</p>




<p>News of this latest&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>update comes shortly after HoYoverse announced two brand new free-to-play games being added to its lineup, namely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">autochess creature-collector&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">cozy life sim&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em></a>.</p>

              <p>Lots of awesome movies that hit theaters over the summer have finally released to streaming. So if you missed them on the big screen, now’s your chance to see them on the small-to-medium screen. James Gunn’s take on<em> Superman&nbsp;</em>starring David Corenswet as the titular super-powered man arrived on HBO Max. There you can also check out Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd’s painfully awkward, intense, and hilarious <em>Friendship</em>. And Zach Cregger’s invigorating horror flick <em>Weapons&nbsp;</em>can now be rented from most places that offer digital on-demand. But in order to watch any of these, you’re gonna need something to stream to —something like Amazon’s Fire TV Stick. Right now, you can get one for dirt cheap. These things normally aren’t too pricey to begin with, starting at $35. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">For a limited time, however, you can snag one for about half price at just $18.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Amazon has upgraded its line of Fire TV Sticks over the years and this is the latest model, albeit, the first in the lineup. It doesn’t support 4K, and it’s still stuck back on Wi-Fi 5. While it does only stream in Full HD 1080p, most streaming service charge extra for 4K streaming to a point where they’re not even worth it. Netflix’s premium plan is now up to $25 per month. That’s more than you’re paying for the Amazon Fire TV Stick and that’s just for a single month. You’ll likely be streaming most content in regular HD anyway, so in practice, you may not even notice the difference between getting this one or shelling out for the Fire TV Stick 4K.</p>



<h2>Xbox Games Right to Your TV</h2>
<p>One big bonus of the Fire TV Stick is it now supports Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You no longer need an Xbox console to play Xbox games. Stream games from the cloud like&nbsp;<em>Black Myth Wukong</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, or even the newly released <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The first two are just part of Game Pass, but the latter does require you to purchase a copy.</p>
<p>If you are intrigued by the prospect of playing Xbox titles directly off the Fire TV Stick, you can consider picking up the unit bundled with a Luna Controller. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4360/">That normally goes for $105, but has also been marked down halfway to just $53</a>. You can also choose to pair a different Bluetooth controller such as the official Xbox core wireless controller. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">Otherwise, just go with the standard Fire TV Stick HD, now only $18.</a></p>
