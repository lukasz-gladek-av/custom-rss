            <p>
Sales of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> games have dropped compared to last year, despite the high profile release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>.
</p>
<p>
According to its latest earnings report, the company's overall net sales dropped by 18.4 percent year-on-year for the most recent quarter. 
</p>
<p>
This is driven in part due to a decline in sales of new games. By comparison, the same quarter in 2023 saw the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.

</figure>
<p>
However, the company has still turned a profit with its games this year on lower development cost amortisation and advertising expenses.
</p>
<p>
What's more, its MMO sub-segment saw a rise in sales and profits compared to last year. This latest quarter does not include the July release of Final Fantasy 14 expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail</a>, though clearly interest has risen ahead of its release. Expect a considerable boost to profits in the next quarterly results.
</p>
<p>
Mobile games, meanwhile, have also seen sales decline "due to weak sales of existing titles", presumably including last year's release of free-to-play gacha game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-turns-square-enixs-best-into-an-avalanche-of-money-grabbing-tactics">Final Fantasy 7 Ever Crisis</a>. However, profits have increased due to "optimisation of operational expenses".

</p>
<p>
Overall, Square Enix is "continuing determined efforts to strengthen the competitiveness and profitability" of its business.
</p>
<p>
At the start of the year, company president Takashi Kiryu announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-reviewing-overall-game-development-to-improve-quality">review of the company's development system</a>, to boost quality and profits. 

</p>
<p>
As part of this, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-abandons-112m-of-in-development-projects-in-an-effort-to-improve-quality">company abandoned £112m of in-development projects</a> that resulted in a loss for the previous financial year. It's now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">"aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a>.


</p>
<p>
It's clear, then, Square Enix is in a reset phase and its restructuring has resulted in a profit despite disappointing sales of its existing games.
</p>
<p>
The company also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">laid off staff in its US and European offices</a> as part of "structural reforms".

</p>
<p>
Sales of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth were not specifically included in this financial report, though previously it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">reported sales were "underperforming"</a>. 

</p>
<p>
The third and final part of that trilogy is yet to be fully revealed or a release window provided, but director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed the popular card game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-finale-will-receive-revamped-queens-blood-card-game">Queen's Blood will make a "revamped" return</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gold/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth Wukong, the action role-playing game developed by Game Science, has gone gold today and will be released as scheduled later this month.</p>
<p>The development studio itself confirmed the news with a message on <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1820649285450649680">X/Twitter</a>, adding that the entire team is working hard on the final stages of <em>"experiencing, testing and deploying the game."</em> Before the game launches on August 20th on PC and PlayStation 5, the studio will give another look at Black Myth Wukong with a new trailer that will be shared later this week, on August 8th, at 10 am Beijing time. 10 am will also be the time the game will unlock on all platforms it releases, which include Steam, the Epic Games Store, and PlayStation 5 in the West.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong was also supposed to be released on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S later this month, but the game was delayed on Microsoft's consoles to allow the developer to better optimize the game on these platforms, although the delay may also have been caused by some sort of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-on-xbox-black-myth-wukong-delays-doesnt-want-to-comment-on-possible-exclusivity-deals-from-rivals/">deal</a> with Sony. Unfortunately, a new release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong launches on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 20th. The game will also launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on a yet to be confirmed release date.</p>

            <p>
The remake of cult classic Lollipop Chainsaw will now arrive a couple of weeks earlier, on 12th September here in Europe and in America. 
</p>
<p>
Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, as this new version is titled, was previously announced as launching on 26th September, for Nintendo Switch, PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
After some initial confusion, developer Dragami Games has now made clear that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zombie-hack-and-slash-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-gets-september-release-date">RePop is a remaster of the original game</a> by Grasshopper Manufacture, first launched in 2012, and not a full-on remake. 
</p>
<p>
A surprisingly fun hack-and-chainsaw zombie game, it was the brainchild of No More Heroes' Suda51, with a script penned in part by James Gunn - before his days in the superhero space.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Update！Release date of LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP（Digital）is September 12 in North America,Central and South America, and Europe.<br>And the retail price has been confirmed $44.99.… <a href="https://t.co/NoNaYXVGpg">pic.twitter.com/NoNaYXVGpg</a></p>— 安田善巳 Yoshimi Yasuda (@yasudaD5) <a href="https://twitter.com/yasudaD5/status/1820610762534244625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
Dragami has said this new version should replicate the original Lollipop Chainsaw as closely as possible - though will sadly not include the game's licensed music soundtrack. 
</p>
<p>Eurogamer gave the original a mixed write-up when it first landed:</p>
<p>"Grasshopper's latest really is a bit of a lollipop: it's sugary, colourful, insubstantial - and perhaps a bit sickly with it," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lollipop-chainsaw-review">Eurogamer's Lollipop Chainsaw review</a>. "It all makes for an oddball game that struggles to be odd in the right way."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Popular Fortnite leaks sources ShiinaBR have revealed that some new Dragon Ball Z and X-Men characters are soon arriving in the Item Shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR posted two tweets today about future collaborations. The first one revealed new Dragon Ball Z skins for Fortnite, this time from the Android Saga, which will feature Android 17 and Android 18. Shiina added in a <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1820742996477784139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later tweet</a> that these skins and their respective backblings should be available for purchase from August 10. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While revealing the Dragon Ball Z skins, the Fortnite leaker also leaked upcoming skins from the X-Men franchise. The latest X-Men characters coming to Fortnite include Cyclops, Jubilee and Colossus. All of these characters have their specific backblings and pickaxes too. Similar to the Dragon Ball-Z skins, the X-Men skins are also encrypted, so for now players will need to wait to see the items in their ‘showcase’ state (in-game).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dragon Ball Z and X-Men are not new collaborations for Fortnite, and we have received several characters from these two franchises in the past. Regarding Dragon Ball Z, we already have skins like Goku, Vegeta, Goku Black, Beerus, Frieza, Cell, Bulma, Gohan, and Piccolo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With X-Men, there are a similar number of skins in Fortnite for the franchise, including characters like Wolverine, Deadpool, Rogue, Gambit, Mystique, Dark Phoenix, Magneto, Cable, Domino, Storm and Psylocke. Some of these characters have additional variants, too.</p>



<p>In other news, the LEGO Fortnite update recently added<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-fortnite-update-adding-bus-stations-new-styles-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bus Stations for fast travel and new styles</a>. Also, a recent leak claimed that more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leak-claims-creative-mode-could-add-collab-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration items could arrive for Creative Mode</a>.

            <p>
Chatty gun game High on Life is set to be turned into an animated TV series, with Curb Your Own Enthusiasm's JB Smoove signed on as producer. 
</p>
<p>
Smoove starred in High on Life game as Gus, one of the game's talking fish/guns, and <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/j-b-smoove-produce-star-series-high-on-life-video-game-1236031133/">Deadline</a> reports there's a "good chance" he'll reprise the role in the upcoming animated series as well as producing the project.
</p>
<p>
High on Life launched in December 2022 for PC and Xbox and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-is-now-the-most-popular-thing-on-xbox-game-pass">was the year's biggest launch on Xbox Game Pass</a>, but proved controversial even before release, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-contains-ai-art-and-voice-acting">it emerged the game included AI art and voice acting</a>.

Just weeks after High on Life launched, Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland - co-founder of the game's development studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squanch-games">Squanch Games</a> - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-high-on-life-creator-justin-roiland-charged-with-domestic-violence">charged with domestic violence</a> (charges which were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-high-on-life-creator-finally-responds-to-allegations">later dropped due to "insufficient evidence"</a>). Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-co-creator-departs-high-on-life-studio-he-founded-following-allegations">Roiland departed Squanch and was fired from Rick and Morty by Cartoon Network</a>.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-is-now-available-on-playstation-4-and-5">PlayStation version of High on Life</a> launched in the summer of 2023 for PS4 and PS5.
</p>
<p>
Smoove is now working with Squanch and his own production company, Alternate Side Productions, to adapt the property into a Rick and Morty-style series.
</p>
<p>
"When Squanch Games originally reached out to JB Smoove (I like to talk about myself in the third person) about voicing a character in their incredible video game High On Life, my first question was what does my character look like? They told me that I would be a fish that shoots... which makes perfect sense to me! As a vegan I feel a fish should have the right to defend itself! I mean right?!" Smoove said. 
</p>
<p>
"And now that I'm partnered with Squanch Games and Striker Entertainment to bring the hilarious High On Life to series it feels like it was inevitable! They invited me to join them in the gaming universe and now I'm helping them move into the TV world! It's a case of a game recognising game! High on Life is wild, weird, and wonderful, and the series is going to be that and more! Get ready to laugh your way through space with some unforgettable characters like myself! We are locked and loaded and ready to go!"
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer was less a fan of High on Life in its review.
</p>
<p>
"A miserable cocktail of ideas from other action-platformers and the worst parts of Rick and Morty," Edwin Evans-Thirlwell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-review-a-mediocre-shooter-with-an-unfunny-attitude-problem">Eurogamer's High on Life review</a>, dubbing it "a mediocre shooter with an unfunny attitude problem".

<p>Black Ops 6 is fast becoming one of the most-leaked Call of Duty games ever. In recent days, we’ve seen full multiplayer matches uploaded to YouTube, streams appear on TikTok, and even a PS4 build of the game has appeared online. Everything from perks to weapons and from movement mechanics to multiplayer maps has been exposed online for all to see.</p>



<p>Activision Blizzard is trying to keep pace with DMCA strikes and takedown notices, but at the moment, it’s like fighting a wildfire with a water pistol.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-months-in-advance">Months In Advance</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 isn’t due to be released until October 25, 2024. However, scores of content have been released online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-multiplayer-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcasing the game’s multiplayer</a> platform and everything you’d need to know about it more than three months in advance. </p>



<p>While the multiplayer offering has been plastered online for all to see, little has been revealed regarding the single-player portion of the game or the new Zombies mode.</p>



<p>Most recently, an unfinished, mid-development build of the game was released to repositories online, giving players unparalleled access to an early version of the upcoming first-person shooter. It was arguably the most devastating point in the line of Black Ops 6 leaks that have wormed their way onto social media in recent days.</p>



<p>Toward the end of August, Activision is hosting Call of Duty NEXT, a showcase designed to reveal the future of the ecosystem – and it’s also when the first multiplayer reveal will take place. Unfortunately, the only edge the team will have over the leaks is that the version of the game they’re showing will be much more polished.</p>



<p>Even Warzone hasn’t proven immune to the Black Ops 6 leaks – recently, the ‘2025 map’ known internally as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-new-map-avalon-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avalon was revealed</a> in full.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/jb-smoove-high-on-life-animated/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jb-smoove-set-to-produce-%E2%80%98high-on-life%E2%80%99-animated-show.945528/</guid>

<p>It was recently reported that JB Smoove is on board to produce and potentially star in an animated show set in the universe established in 2022’s High on Life. The quirky, bizarre first-person shooter was released last year to a positive reception, and since it dropped, many have commented on the game’s potential to be converted into an animated series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-perfect-for-television">Perfect For Television</h2>



<p>High on Life is an original and entertaining title with a unique story that sees players battle all types of alien lifeforms in a fight to stop humans from being consumed as a potent drug. It’s a humorous and satirical title with ‘Rick and Morty-like’ funnies written into it. </p>



<p>One of the more kooky elements of the game is that all the player’s weapons are sentient lifeforms themselves, each with a unique personality and the ability to influence the player’s actions.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/j-b-smoove-produce-star-series-high-on-life-video-game-1236031133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published by Deadline</a>, JB Smoove is set to produce an animated adaptation of High of Life, working side-by-side with Russell Binder, Mandy Bardisbanian, and Alec Robbins, who worked as the narrative director on the 2022 game. </p>



<p>In a statement, Smoove said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that I’m partnered with Squanch Games and Striker Entertainment to bring the hilarious High On Life to series it feels like it was inevitable!&nbsp;They invited me to join them in the gaming universe and now I’m helping them move into the TV world! It’s a case of a game recognizing game!&nbsp;<em>High on Life</em>&nbsp;is wild, weird, and wonderful, and the series is going to be that and more!&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent years, the concept of the live-action adaptation has blossomed immeasurably, and that naturally extends to animated adaptations, too. Earlier this year, we saw Fallout released on Prime Video to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and before that, The Last of Us scooped Emmy Awards for the first season of the show that debuted in 2023.</p>

<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP, the highly anticipated remaster of the 2012 zombie slasher, was set to be released globally on September 26. However, Dragami Games has just announced that it’ll drop earlier in several markets, arriving <strong>digitally </strong>on September 12. The team also confirmed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP will cost $44.99 (or the local equivalent).</p>



<p>It’s dropping on September 12 in NA, EU, and Central and South America.</p>

<p>In 2012, Lollipop Chainsaw was released to a relatively positive reception. It had a punchy soundtrack, flashy visuals, and a typically attractive female lead running around in a cheerleader’s outfit while wielding a massive chainsaw – instant win, right?</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update！Release date of LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP（Digital）is September 12 in North America,Central and South America, and Europe.<br>And the retail price has been confirmed $44.99.… <a href="https://t.co/NoNaYXVGpg">pic.twitter.com/NoNaYXVGpg</a></p>— 安田善巳 Yoshimi Yasuda (@yasudaD5) <a href="https://twitter.com/yasudaD5/status/1820610762534244625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It’s not the game everyone expected to be remastered, but there’s no reason why it <strong>shouldn’t </strong>have been. It was entertaining enough more than a decade ago to provide a few hours of mindless entertainment as players were charged with slashing through hordes of zombies, so why wouldn’t it be just as entertaining today?</p>



<p>In a similar vein, gamers worldwide are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, which will be released just one week after Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP, giving players everywhere the opportunity to embark on a nostalgia-filled journey that takes them back to the days of the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>UFL, which has been dubbed the ‘FIFA/FC killer’, is set to be released on September 12. Following a few successful test runs, which saw more than 1.5 million downloads recorded during the first beta weekend, UFL is ready and raring to go.</p>



<p>Building on community feedback from the previous beta tests, Strikerz Inc. was able to make significant improvements to the game ahead of the most recent testing period that ran from August 2 – 4 and in little more than a month, the full (free) game will be released for everyone to enjoy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-keeping-it-fair">Keeping It Fair</h2>



<p>At the heart of UFL sits the claim that the game is ‘fair-to-play’ and that it prioritises skill over spending. It’s an ambitious and realistic title that rewards strategy and it has already proven to be a hit with fans worldwide. This single- and multiplayer game boasts cross-platform functionality, create-a-club mechanics, and some of the most impressive visuals we’ve seen in a debut sports game for years.</p>



<p>If you need any more convincing that great things are in store for UFL, consider that Cristiano Ronaldo invested heavily in the game during a fundraising round that pulled in $40 million. Not only that, but the likes of Firmino and De Bruyne have signed on as ambassadors.</p>



<p>Strikerz Inc. has a lofty goal in sight: 15 million players within 12 months. It has already been confirmed it’ll be free to play <strong>but </strong>it will of course have a battle pass system and microtransactions woven into it.</p>



<p>Will you be downloading and playing UFL when it’s released on September 12?</p>

The latest one showcases how the meat shield mechanic looks when performed on another player.</p><p dir="ltr">Whenever players sneak up behind another enemy, they can use them as a human meat shield instead of automatically performing an execution on them. As shown in a clip by<a href="https://x.com/charlieintel/status/1820554144324927648?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" rel="nofollow "> Charlie Intel on X/Twitter</a>, when using someone as a meat shield, the player will pull out their pistol and use that to defend themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Once players have someone, they can also kill them. Players will be able to perform a "Quick Kill" which presumably means they'll die right away, and they'll also have the opportunity to perform their execution.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on what the clip provides, it appears that the meat shields will still be alive during this. But if the person using them as a shield dies before them, the other player will resume playing. So you can still potentially save teammates if you aim your shots right.</p><p dir="ltr">As previously mentioned, various leaks around Black Ops 6 have made their way online. The reason is that a<a href="https://x.com/charlieintel/status/1820567152996519980?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" rel="nofollow "> version of the game was uploaded to the PSN database</a>, which allowed people to play a beta build on the PlayStation 4. So, if you want to avoid spoiling certain features for yourself, avoid looking up specific Call of Duty content for the time being.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is scheduled to come out later this year on October 25. It'll be playable on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

Tim Burton is back directing the follow-up alongside new and original cast members like Keaton and Winona Ryder. And one of these new actors, Jenny Ortega, was selected to share some depressing news: Beetlejuice is coming to <em>Roblox</em>. </p><p>Announced today, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.roblox.com/games/17811071580/BEETLEJUICE-Escape-the-Afterlife&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/17811071580/BEETLEJUICE-Escape-the-Afterlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice Roblox</em> experience is live now</a></span>. Players can hop in and play a few mini-games, unlock in-game content for their Roblox character, and explore a digital landscape inspired by the upcoming film. And yes, you can hang out with Beetlejuice, who looks like a demented knock-off mini-fig based on a kid’s cartoon drawing of the famous character. But this is just what <em>Roblox </em>looks like to me any time I’m forced against my will to learn more about this <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-gambling-robux-lawsuit-metaverse-court-kid-safe-1850751687&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-gambling-robux-lawsuit-metaverse-court-kid-safe-1850751687">horrible game filled with shady people, scam artists, and probably some actual kids</a></span>. </p><p>For those who want to get nuts (editor’s note: wrong Keaton franchise), they can line up at a fake box office in <em>Roblox </em>and buy real-world movie tickets via Fandango. And now the real reason for this odd marketing stunt is clear: to get people to buy tickets to a movie. </p><h2 id="h90197"><a id=""></a>Let’s read some buzzwords! </h2><p>“We are always looking to engage audiences and amplify our reach in new and exciting ways; this first-of-its-kind collaboration with <em>Roblox</em> and Fandango for <em>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice</em> allows for just that,” Cameron Curtis, VP of marketing at Warner Bros. totally said out loud. For real. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/warner-bros-launches-beetlejuice-roblox-experience-with-virtual-box-office/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/warner-bros-launches-beetlejuice-roblox-experience-with-virtual-box-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And not just in this buzzword-laden comment shared in a press release</a></span>. </p><p>“As we continue to test commerce, offering an opportunity to purchase tickets within the movie-inspired immersive environment is a way to explore a new consumer category and further engage users who are looking to purchase different things,” said Stephanie Latham, <em>Roblox’s </em>VP of global partnerships in a comment that feels like it was spit out by a robot pretending to be human, but failing.</p><p>Anyway, that new <em>Beetlejuice </em>movie arrives in theaters on September 6. You can visit this new <em>Roblox</em> experience now. </p><p>Or, instead, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">you can just read <em>Roblox </em>Studio head Stefano Corazza’s comments</a></span> suggesting their game helps “kids” living in the “slums” make money via content creation.

This map adding depth is a fantastic change that reminds me of the maps in the <em>Metroid Prime </em>games. Those maps are the gold standards of navigation in an interconnected 3D environment, so anything even close to them is good in my book!” The only major complaint some have is how much it spins, though past <em>Monster Hunter</em> games have usually had settings to lock the minimap to true North. </p><p>Elsewhere, the new trailers show off some of the ways that monsters <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ekqni5/the_phases_of_wounding_seen_on_doshaguma/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ekqni5/the_phases_of_wounding_seen_on_doshaguma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">change their appearance</a></span> as they take more damage through each successive phase of a fight. There’s also a new focus mode that lets you aim attacks like you’re looking down the scope of a gun in a first-person shooter. The camera and your character will stay locked-on and static even as you strafe so you can repeatedly target the same weak points and do more damage. There are even focus attacks that, in addition to being more effective, just look really cool. </p><p>You can watch all three of the trailers in full below:</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I loved it so much that I even went as far as to call it the best game the genre has seen in recent memory, a game that could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a></span>. Five months later, I stand by everything I said. This is a spectacular accomplishment by developer Vanillaware that more people need to get their hands on. The main selling points are its phenomenal gameplay and beautiful art.</p><p>The quality of <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>’s art almost goes without saying, this is a Vanillaware game after all. The same team behind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-crown-the-kotaku-review-977366436&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-crown-the-kotaku-review-977366436"><em>Dragon’s Crown</em></a></span> and <em>13 Sentinels</em> delivers its signature painterly environment and beautiful character design. And, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> applies that amazing art to a medieval fantasy world, so expect to see lofty castles and plenty of knights in shining armor. The game’s world, which is broken into multiple kingdoms with different terrain, is also a delight to the eyes. Travel from one end of the map to the other and watch it change from deep blues on the coastline to verdant green forests and eventually to blistering white snowfields or burning yellow deserts. Of course there is more to do than just look at pretty art in this world.</p><figure id="" data-id="0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-recommend-id="image://0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large scale battle in front of a walled castle scene in top down view" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large scale battle in front of a walled castle scene in top down view" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-recommend-id="image://0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large scale battle in front of a walled castle scene in top down view" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The meat of <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> is its seemingly endless number of combat systems that meld together to make a truly thrilling tactical RPG that melds real-time and turn-based action. When large scale battles are triggered you control your units on a real-time map, directing your troops on the field against the enemy. When a unit does clash with the opponent, it turns into an automatic face-off that fans of<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-games-ranked-three-houses-engage-awakening-1850234583&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-games-ranked-three-houses-engage-awakening-1850234583"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a></span> might be familiar with. Based on how you built your unit—with position, troop makeup, and equipment, the battle will automatically be won or lost. It means that while the moment-to-moment of battle is real-time, the bulk of your success is determined before you step onto the battlefield.<br></p><p>Mastering<em> Unicorn Overlor</em>d requires getting deep into the systems that take place before battle. You must understand how each troop’s class gives them different advantages and disadvantages in battle against certain opponent types, and how positioning troops can drastically change the outcome of a battle.

Even when you start to think you are getting the hang of <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> it tests you. Battles will continue to add new gimmicks or challenges to test your knowledge of the game’s systems. If you like a tough tactics game, <em>Unicorn Overlord </em>is for you</p><p>I implore any tactical RPG fans to take advantage of the PlayStation sale while you can. Until August 15, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> available for $41.99 instead of $59.99. Trust me, it’s worth it at either of those prices, but why not get it for cheap? </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While Star Wars Outlaws isn't even out yet, the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3oDeg1rH3qrXBttnBaxN5Y/star-wars-outlaws-postlaunch-roadmap-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-launch roadmap</a> for the game, which includes a Season Pass, has already been revealed. For those who will be purchasing the game, the base game isn't the only thing players have to look forward to in the upcoming future.</p>
<p>Ubisoft have revealed in their roadmap the plans for a Season Pass which will include two story packs. This Season Pass doesn't have to be purchased right away with the game, and it can be purchased on its own.</p>
<p>For those who purchase the Season Pass in time for the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-pc-system-requirements/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> will get the Kessel Runner character pack, which will include outfits for scoundrel Kay Vess and her companion, Nix. By getting the Season Pass, players will also get access to an exclusive mission called "Jabba's Gambit."</p>
<p>Players will meet Jabba the Hutt in the base game regardless, but owners of the Season Pass will gain an exclusive mission where they have to aid the Hutt Cartel.</p>
<p>Past launch day, the first story pack named Star Wars Outlaws :Wild Card will be released in Fall 2024. This comes alongside two cosmetic packs titled Hunter's Legacy and Cartel Ronin.&nbsp; This first story pack will be included for those who have the Season Pass.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card features missions where Kay is hired to infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament which goes well until she is introduced to Lando Calrissian, and things begin to go awry as it's not as clear cut as it seemed.</p>
<p>The Hunter's Legacy Bundle and the Cartel Ronin Bundle contains additional outfits for Kay and Nix, as well as additional cosmetics for Kay's speeder and her ship, The Trailblazer.</p>
<p>The next story pack is going to be released in Spring 2025, and is titled Star Wars Outlaws: A Pirate's Fortune.</p>
<p>In this story, it turns out that The Trailblazer's reputation precedes Kay, as she collides with Hondo Ohnaka, a veteran pirate. They are aiming to settle some scores with a deadly gang of pirates.</p>
<p>So far, this is everything we know about what is coming in the Season Pass for Star Wars Outlaws. Whether there will continue to be more content past Spring 2025 remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will launch on Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC via Ubisoft Connect and the Epic Games Store come August 30. If you preorder the game now on the Ubisoft Store, you will receive the Kessel Runner Bonus Pack, which includes cosmetics for Kay's speeder and The Trailblazer.</p>
