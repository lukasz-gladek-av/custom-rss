<section><p>We often only see one finalized version of a video game story. What if you could see 100 permutations of it?</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At the beginning of 2025, I fully believed I had grown tired of stories about multiple timelines. During the past decade, the Marvel Cinematic Universe pushed the classic comic book narrative device into the mainstream, fueling a film conglomerate with legally approved cameos, flashy visuals on the silver screen, and loose plots that, eventually, came together for one final pay-off.</p><p dir="ltr">While the concept of the multiverse has been explored in film and TV even before Marvel's takeover, it quickly became the narrative foundation of choice. When done right, the potential is undeniable--works like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Everything, Everywhere, All at Once are heartwrenching displays of interpersonal relationships, making characters face the reality of what-if scenarios, reconciling with their choices and what could have been if they had turned the other way instead. But you can only hear the same tune so many times before it starts to lose its original impact.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't until The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy that my interest was reanimated. The visual novel and strategy-RPG hybrid presents itself as deceivingly linear, only to push you into a completely different story structure at the very end. It makes for a sprawling web of outcomes based on your choices, all while showcasing different perspectives on events and characters that weave absurdity and sentimentality in equal measure in a showcase of creative prowess from the development team.</p><p dir="ltr">It all started after an eShop sale in July encouraged me to finally catch up with the Danganronpa and AI: Somnium Files series. It was the perfect motivation to prepare myself for this behemoth of a game, in which the lead developers of both series got together for a joint project that features 100 endings.</p><p dir="ltr">The concept sounded exhausting--as someone who's constantly playing games for work, I figured I'd never be able to justify the time for it, especially since I wanted to at least play the most prominent modern works from the developers first. To my surprise, I ended up adoring the messiness of Danganronpa's cruel killing games. But it was AI: Somnium Files and its sequel, Nirvana Initiative, that led me to begin to understand The Hundred Line's potential.</p><p dir="ltr">Both games kick off from linear storylines that set up a detective-style mystery. Eventually, the plot begins to branch out--depending on key decisions you make, you end up pursuing different timelines, all represented in a flow chart that you can use to jump back and forth between them, especially when routes get locked until you've made progress on a different timeline. There's a true ending that, on paper, symbolizes the intended culmination of events. Yet, the process of witnessing what could have happened if I had made a different decision, experiencing the ramifications on characters and their fates and getting alternative endings, was immediately arresting.</p><p dir="ltr">In a way, playing through The Hundred Line is similar to the experience of getting through both of these franchises as I did. You play as Takumi Sumino, one of 15 high school students who are sent to the mysterious Last Defense Academy to protect humanity from invaders. The story is structured in 100 days, which is exactly the period of time that the students have been commanded to endure. While none of them have as many in-game days, all mainline Danganronpa games share this structure, splitting the visual novel aspect of the story with exploration and trials--in The Hundred Line, the latter takes the shape of strategy RPG battles, as well as free time to increase bonds with characters.</p><p dir="ltr">But getting to the final day doesn't mean reaching the end. While there's little reason to believe that day 100 isn't basically the story's culmination, it only signifies the end of a prologue. Once you get to the tantalizing date, the game radically changes and becomes similar to AI: The Somnium Files (as well as previous games led by lead developer Kotaro Uchikoshi, such as Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward and Zero Time Dilemma). Your task, then, is to explore different timelines and dive into their own what-if scenarios, making decisions that lead to the aforementioned 100 endings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4624305-img_7357.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624305" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4624305-img_7357.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624305"></a><figcaption>As per usual, there's no shortage of meta text.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4624305-img_7357.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-11/-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-nearly-bankrupted-too-kyo-games" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, Danganronpa lead designer Kazutaka Kodaka said that writers were given the freedom to take characters in wild directions, from a comedy route to one where they all turn into zombies. The further you plunge into the flow chart, the more this becomes apparent, with characters adopting different personalities, or the game itself changing drastically in comparison to the calendar schedule of the original 100 days.</p><p dir="ltr">Normally, choice-driven stories fix you to certain paths depending on what you pick, and they have you carrying those choices from that moment on. Games like this year's Dispatch, for example, brought back the Telltale Games formula into the zeitgeist, as former developers of the studio led the project. There are plenty of "this character will remember that" messages on screen, and while some of your decisions do carry some weight toward the end, the main story is structured largely the same. Despite the player's input, the bigger outcomes have already been decided.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Hundred Line, experiencing different outcomes is akin to opening a treasure trove that will seemingly never run out of surprises. It embodies the curiosity of a whiteboard filled with ideas that the developers had, and the rare chance of actually being able to see them manifested. What would have happened if this character hadn't died? What ramifications could a seemingly small decision have in the lives of your fellow students? The answers to these questions are all laid bare for you to pick and experience for yourself. There is a true ending that you can pursue to uncover the overarching mysteries introduced during the prologue. But there's also the precious opportunity of witnessing completely different stories.</p><p dir="ltr">At its core, The Hundred Line makes a singular case of how the interactive nature of video games fits stories about multiple timelines like a glove. It's not often that we're able to witness the developers' creativity on such a big scale, either. Yet, it was that exact display that gave me a reappreciation of this narrative device, and left me ruminating about my own choices in life. 2025 marked the tenth anniversary of my first published article. It was the result of responding to a call for writers from someone in a Facebook group I barely knew who was starting her own blog. Had I done differently, that day would have been as any other. I would have continued studying graphic design, perhaps. I would have met completely different people in the years that followed, while video games would have been nothing but a mere hobby. It was only a short message that, at the time, seemed innocuous. I had no idea how much it'd completely change my life.</p><p dir="ltr">The more end-of-the-year discussions I get to be a part of, the more I realize I'll simply not be able to get to everything I want to see, do, and play in this lifetime. The time commitment of a story with 100 endings is daunting, to put it mildly. But I don't regret spending months preparing for it, as well as the dozens of ongoing hours dissecting its every route. It's a bold showcase of ambition and years of accumulated knowledge paying off, time and time again, in a way that only video games can muster. And it's also a constant showcase of how much our lives can change on a whim without us realizing.</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/01/01/why-im-excited-to-become-the-boogeyman-in-illfonics-halloween</link>
            <guid>1395571</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>If you know me at all, you know my favorite horror icon of all time is Michael Myers, his first appearance – 1978’s <em>Halloween</em> – being my favorite horror movie, too. With hundreds of hours played in IllFonic’s ill-fated <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/friday_the_13th_the_game/b/playstation4/archive/2017/06/02/a-killer-formula-suffering-massive-casualties.aspx">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, which launched in 2017, I have been devoutly awaiting the day this studio tackles <em>Halloween</em>. It is the natural next step, and though I had to wait nearly a decade and play other (great) IllFonic asymmetric multiplayer titles during the wait, the time has come. And with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/halloween">Halloween</a> set to launch this September, it will arrive just in time for me to perfect my abilities as Michael Myers for what will no doubt be a fun Halloween night play session the following month.</p><p>Halloween promises to flip IllFonic’s asymmetrical multiplayer formula, pitting one Michael Myers player against four Civilian players. But unlike Friday the 13th, for example, where your primary goal was to escape, Civilians in Halloween are both attempting to bring in local police to stop Michael Myers and save as many residents as they can. It’s not prey vs predator this time, but rather predator vs some Laurie Strode-like characters who refuse to let this boogeyman plague their home.</p><p>“Halloween is a special one because it is a true slasher horror game,” IllFonic chief creative officer Jared Gerritzen tells me. “We wanted to go back to the basic rules, jump scares, lots of gore, tension of what is around the corner; a real back-to-the-basics of what is seriously scary.”</p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/haddonfield-heights-multiplayer-map-revealed-for-illfonics-halloween">The team revealed the Haddonfield Heights map last month</a>, which faithfully recreates the iconic neighborhood from <em>Halloween</em>, and while I’m excited to see what the multiplayer survivor action is like on it, I’m just as excited to become the boogeyman there and use his Shape Jump ability. It lets you show up out of nowhere and terrorize player-controlled civilians with great effect. But it’s not a cheat code to kill.</p><p>“[Michael’s] ability to show up in the most insane moments [during films] was not only a great jump scare but a really great way to break up moments,” Gerritzen says. “I noticed he shut the lights off in a scene, and we thought maybe he just wants it dark all the time, and why would that be? Then the idea of how we could play with that as a game mechanic started to form, and Shape Jump, as an ability to move around the map without anyone knowing, was born.</p><p>“We made some gameplay rules around it for balance purposes, of course. [As] long as there is no direct light and no one is looking at the area Michael is in, then the ability can be used. It really adds a great level of play, [and] the ability has brought a horrifying element of being stalked by Michael and never knowing where he will pop up.”</p><p>To use that ability, though, it’s likely the player controlling Michael will need to power up to an extent by racking up their kill count. Gerritzen says the biggest element IllFonic has been focusing on is adding a major focus on the bots in multiplayer. “They really add to the body count and allow a Michael player to power up if they desire,” he tells me. “This also affects the hero players as well, with their fear systems.”</p><p>What’s so exciting about all of this is it’s only one part of Halloween, which also features <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/25/everything-we-learned-about-single-player-and-multiplayer-in-illfonics">a single-player campaign where you play through the events of the original film</a> (and a little beyond it) behind that terrifying, sterile white mask. It represents IllFonic’s first crack at a single-player campaign in one of its multiplayer-centric games, and I can’t wait to see how the Shape shapes up in it later this year.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/01/01/why-im-excited-to-become-the-boogeyman-in-illfonics-halloween]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Happy new year, or almost new year, or just… whatever time it is when you’re reading this. For me, it’s the very tail end of 2025, and what better time to take a look ahead at some of the games coming out in the new year? Here are 2026’s biggest game releases</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into it, just a heads up that this is by no means a 100% comprehensive guide to all the games coming out in 2026, as many of those haven’t even been announced yet. Also, as always, release dates are subject to change - I made something very much like this exactly a year ago in which I told you that GTA would be the biggest game of 2025… assuming it came out in 2025, which it didn’t. So, this is true in our regular monthly game release updates, but it’s especially true when we’re talking about games that are 11 months away, or games that don’t have release dates yet.</p><p id="january"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="January">January</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On January 15, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> gets a new lease on life, and also a new mortgage to pay off when the beloved debt, yard work, and interior decoration sim comes to Switch 2 - and if you happen to be one of the 50 million people who bought Animal Crossing on the original Switch, you’ll be happy to hear that you can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for just 5 bucks. Meanwhile, if you’re still playing on Switch 1, you’ll still be getting access to a ton of new features with the 3.0 update, which adds a ton of new features including hotel renovation, and in-game items based on other Nintendo properties, as well as LEGO’s line of Animal Crossing sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t spell “Purchase a Game In January” without JRPG, or a lot of other letters, but this is the time of year when fans of that particular genre are bound to be especially busy. Still on the 15th, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond The Horizon</a>, which is the seventeenth installment in The Legend of Heroes series, or the thirteenth installment in the Trails series, and a direct sequel to 2022’s Legend of Heroes Trails Through Daybreak II. That’s coming to all the Switches, PlayStations, and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/highguard-1765988376157.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Highguard is the new PvP game from ex-Titanfall and Apex Legends devs, landing January 26.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 22nd, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a> comes to Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series as well as Xbox on PC - this includes the base game, all the visual and technical improvements that it got when it was ported to PS5, a whole side story that follows Yuffie, and this latest release will add a new streamlined mode that maxes out your party’s stats and has all attacks do 9,999 damage so you can just blow through the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not quite a JRPG, but JRPG-adjacent, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors Origins</a> also hits Switch 2 that day, alongside the Visions of Four Heroes DLC expansion, which also comes to the other platforms the game’s already on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 26th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> drops, which is the new PVP raid game from a bunch of ex-Respawn devs who worked on Titanfall and Apex Legends - and while you can see some similar DNA, it’s clearly going a very different direction, and instead of bunch of a bunch of wallrunning dudes and Neil Blomkamp mechs, it’s got more fantasy flair - so if you’ve ever wanted to bear arms while riding a bear, go nuts. That’s free to play on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, rounding out January’s JRPGs, on the 28th there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-seven-deadly-sins-origin">The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin,</a> an open-world RPG based on the hit anime series for PS5, PC, and mobile. And then on the 30th, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/code-vein-ii">Code Vein 2</a>, the sequel to Bandai Namco’s 2019 vampire anime soulslike, which is on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point in January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a> will hit PS5 and Xbox series, which is Riot Games’ 2v2 fighting game featuring a roster of characters from League of Legends - that’s been in early access on PC since October.</p><p id="february"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="February">February</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 5, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a> hits PS5, Xbox Series, both Switches, and PC. Originally released stateside for PS1 in 2001, and then 3DS 15 years after that, it’s now getting a full modern overhaul. JRPGs aren’t exactly known for being concise, but this one is pretty infamously beefy, and don’t be surprised if you sink 100 hours into this just doing the main quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d rather just make a bunch of colorful characters hit each other, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/my-hero-academia-alls-justice">My Hero Academia: All’s Justice</a> is a 3v3 arena fighter featuring several dozen characters from the beloved anime series. That’s on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC February 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on the 6th is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, the third installment in Team Ninja’s tough-as-balls soulslike series that is actually its first true sequel, as Nioh 2 took place before the events of the first game - which probably has no bearing whatsoever on the moment to moment combat that’s the main selling point here. That’s on PS5 and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/nioh-3-1765988443560.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nioh 3 promises even more tough-as-balls soulslike action on February 6. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 11, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo is a Deadman</a> is the latest whackadoo action game from Suda51 and the fine folks at Grasshopper Manufacture, who gave us such cult classics as Killer7 and No More Heroes - this latest one looks to be as stylish, absurd, and over-the-top as we’ve come to expect. That’s on PS5, Xbox series and PC. I’ve had the pleasure of interviewing a lot of really interesting people in this job, and Suda is one of my favorites - we did one with him years ago where we asked a bunch of really stupid questions rapid-fire and he didn’t skip a beat. So anyway, I’m happy to see he’s keeping busy making weird cool games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 12th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> hits everything but Xbox One. Yakuza 3 was originally released for the PS3 back in 2009, and though it was included with the remastered collection in 2019, that version didn't get any major graphical or gameplay improvements. Kiwami 3, on the other hand, is a full modern overhaul, so this’ll play as great as it looks - and the Dark Ties expansion is a whole new side story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still that day on Switch 2 is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, which may sound like a fun casual sports game, but it’s also a very serious medical condition that can be deadly if not treated immediately. If you develop symptoms of Mario Tennis Fever while playing this game, please consult a Dr. Mario.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 13th we’re getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a>, the follow-up to the excellent 2022 first-person metroidvania - and between the first game, its High on Knife DLC, and now this, I gotta give the team at Squanch Games credit for shipping two and a half Metroid Prime-likes in half the time it took Retro to get Metroid Prime 4 out the door. Also, High on Life 2 is the only way you can legally purchase the classic 1991 Wisdom Tree platformer Bible Adventures for current consoles.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/residentthumb-1765504800570.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Everyone's favourite Leon is back for Resident Evil: Requiem, out February 27.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 20, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> is the latest Japanese action RPG rooted in Scandinavian folklore - and it’s actually an enhanced re-release of 2023’s Ys X: Nordics, but with enough added abilities, bosses and levels that it’s apparently very proud of itself. That’s coming to PS5, PC, and Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 24th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides of Tomorrow</a> hits PS5, Xbox Series and PC, which is set in a vibrant post-apocalyptic ocean world that’s riddled with microplastics, and where the choices made by other players in their game will affect how the narrative in yours unfolds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 27, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> - or the ninth mainline entry, if you’re keeping count - hits Xbox Series, PS5, PC, and Switch 2. I’m fairly late to the Resident Evil party, but as someone who liked 7, loved 8, and adored the remakes, I’m fairly lukewarm on what I’ve seen of this one so fair - but I’m also willing to give it a shot, since that team has been knocking it out the park with this series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any Switch 2 owners looking to play catchup, Resident Evil 7 and 8 - AKA Biohazard and Village - are also coming to the hybrid handheld that day as well.

At this point we’ve been waiting so long for this game that it’s just stopped seeming like something I’ll ever get to play - but someday, I’ll get to actually play it, I think, and I hope it’s this year!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, that takes us to the very end of games that currently have release dates - but there a whole lot more that just have vague 2026 releases planned, so here’s what we’ve got right now:</p><p id="sometime-in-2026"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sometime in 2026">Sometime in 2026</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a> is expected sometime in the first quarter of 2026, which lets you strategically square off with Cylons on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point in 2026, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> is supposedly coming to PS5, and while Bethesda's dropped a handful of updates post-launch, I feel like players weren’t quite over the moon for this one - but who knows, maybe it’ll get some more tweaks and content alongside its eventual PlayStation version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-meat-boy-3d">Super Meat Boy 3D</a> adds a whole extra dimension to Team Meat’s beloved indie platformer, and that’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/zero-parades-for-dead-spies">Zero Parades: For Dead Spies</a> is the latest offbeat and extremely cerebral CRPG from the developers of Disco Elysium. This is clearly a spiritual successor, but rather than take cues from detective fiction, Zero Parades is all about the world of espionage - specifically, the nerve-racking deception-based kind, not the sexy hollywood kind. That’s coming to PC and PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a game that takes place inside books, but involves a lot less reading, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chronoscript-the-endless-end">Chronoscript: The Endless End</a> is an exploration based action-adventure sidescroller - or maybe more accurately, page turner.

If you’d rather feel utterly powerless, you can get punched so hard your soul flies out of your body in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-shell-ii">Mortal Shell 2</a>. Those are both on the big consoles and PC.

And then there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a> on PS5 and PC, a fighting game from Arc System Works that looks like it could be a proper spiritual successor to Marvel Vs Capcom - just, without the Capcom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve">Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</a> is the latest entry in the long running jet pilot sim to try to tempt me into playing it with sequences of stuff happening outside of a jet that are so impressively realistic it makes me forget that I don’t actually enjoy the part where you fly the jet. Don’t get me wrong, I think jets are the coolest thing ever invented and this game looks gorgeous, but aerial dogfighting in video games just never clicks for me. Can I just play the parts where you eat hamburgers and drink beer with your friends on an aircraft carrier? Anyway, that’s on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remedy’s David Lynchian interconnected universe gets a bit bigger with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-resonant">Control: Resonant</a>, which is a continuation of IGN’s 2019 game of the year, but also connects with Alan Wake 2 and FBC Firebreak - and even if you’re not keeping track of what’s going on, this looks like it’ll still be a good time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always wondered why nobody’s made any first-person soulslikes, and the trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/decrepit">Decrepit</a> answered that question very loudly: because they’d be too fucking scary. Get this shit outta here. Too scary! Just awful! No thank you! That’s on PC for now, so if you play on console, you’re safe from its horrors for the time being. Did you see that spider? Fuck off!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Less scary looking, but from a studio with some major horror chops is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ontos">Ontos</a>, which is from the folks behind Amnesia and SOMA and takes place in a hotel where a lot of weird stuff is happening, which is to be expected from a hotel that’s <em>on the moon</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want something nice and cute in space, there’s the two-player co-op adventure <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/orbitals">Oribitals</a> on Switch 2 which looks just gorgeous. Lots of games look like anime, but this one specifically looks like a bubble era OVA, which has not just a specific aesthetic, but a certain VHS graininess and poppy sound quality as well, and that’s such a pretentious delineation but as a reformed weeaboo whose formative years were filled with badly dubbed “Japanimation” from Manga Video, I applaud this attention to detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another co-op adventure coming this year is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/out-of-words">Out of Words</a>, which is all stop-motion featuring handcrafted puppets. I have this theory that Geoff Keighley really loves puppets, and if you make a game with puppets in it, he’s more likely to feature it prominently in one of his shows - Out of Words was one of two puppet-centric games that debuted at Summer Game Fest, the other being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/felt-that-boxing">Felt That: Boxing</a>, and it showed up again at The Game Awards in between Miss Piggy appearances. Anyway that’s coming to the new consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> is hitting PS5, Xbox Series, and PC at some point in 2026, and I am <em>stoked</em> - like 10 years ago, when it was announced that EA had the Star Wars license, I was like, "Get the people who do Burnout and Need for Speed to do a podracing game." -And well, it took a minute, but we’re getting something even better: a studio founded by a bunch of ex-Criterion devs is making a game like that and EA has nothing to do with it! Also, this isn’t straight podcasting - it’s got a bunch of other speeders and stuff, which reminds me of the criminally underrated 2000 vehicular combat game Star Wars Demolition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you thought that was a stupid joke, well, bad news because <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stupid-never-dies">Stupid Never Dies</a> - which is the name of a video game that’s coming out at some point on PC and PS5. This is a dungeon crawler action game that has some major Lollipop Chainsaw vibes, but it’s actually from a new studio founded by Hiroyuki Kobayashi, who, among other things, worked on Devil May Cry, Resident Evil, and Dragon’s Dogma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tankrat">Tankrat</a> is a game where you drive a cool tank around and shoot stuff while also exploring and finding new stuff to make your tank even cooler - and it reminds me of modern version of Blaster Master. You guys remember Blaster Master? No? Well it sort of looked like this except really old. Tankrat is coming to PS5 and PC. </p><p id="to-be-announced"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="To Be Announced">To Be Announced</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">A whole lot of games just have a vague “TBA” release window, which means that they’ll probably come out someday. And while 2026 seems like a safe bet for most of these, some might even be further down the road, while others might never come out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ever wished they’d do a Star Wars XCOM... well, they’re doing it! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-zero-company">Zero Company</a>, or ZCOM for short, is from a studio of ex-Firaxis devs, and looks like a turn-based tactical good time. That’s coming to Xbox, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cinder-city">Cinder City</a> is an open-world MMO tactical shooter that looks like it has literally everything in it, and that’s coming to PC at some point - though looking at this game in action, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a 2027 game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> is the sequel to the 2023 soulslike, which was itself the reboot of a game already titled Lords of the Fallen, so this is technically the third Lords of the Fallen game, but who’s keeping track? That’s on the newer non-Nintendo consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All we’ve seen of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/road-kings">Road Kings</a> is a cinematic trailer where a dude drives his 18 wheeler straight toward a tornado, but that seems like it was enough to get people hyped. And it’s from Saber, the studio that gave us Mudrunner and Snowrunner and the recent Road Craft, and as a very casual truck game enjoyer, I’m curious to see what their spin on a long-haul trucking sim is like. That’s on PC, Xbox Series, and PS5.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/dow-1759142668541.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Loads of Space Marines are going to be vaporised by Necrons in Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War 4.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a> is the first installment in the fan-fave RTS series in almost a decade, and while it’s not from Relic, the studio that made the first three games, it is from the team behind another well-received RTS, Iron Harvest. That’s coming to PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomodachi Life might not have quite the same name-brand recognition as Animal Crossing, but the original mii-centric social game released in 2014 was the 11th best-selling 3DS game of all time, so it’s a surprise it’s taken Nintendo this long to make another one. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> will be on Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Somebody put <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> on our list of upcoming game releases, and while that’ll probably come out someday, I would be shocked if it dropped in 2026. However, if you’re after a big pretty fantasy RPG from Xbox Game Studios, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a> seems a lot more likely for a fall release. This one is from Playground Games, the studio that gave us Forza Horizon, so I’m stoked to see how they tackle wizard stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Forza Horizon, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">the sixth entry</a> is expected sometime in 2026, and though there have been rumblings it might launch in the first half of the year, nothing official on that front aside from the fact that it’s set in Japan this time around. Fable and Forza Horizon are both hitting Xbox Series and PC, with PS5 versions probably arriving later on, if recent Xbox release strategy is anything to go on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War turns 20 in 2026, and to mark the occasion we’re hopefully getting a brand new installment with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">E-Day</a>. This is a prequel set 14 years before the first game and will follow Marcus Fenix during the events of Emergence Day, when the big scary guys you’ve been shooting at and chainsawing into pieces in all the other installments first started coming out of holes in the ground. That’ll be on Xbox and PC for sure, and again, maybe PS5 at some point too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another major franchise celebrating a big anniversary is Tomb Raider, which turns 30 - To celebrate, we’re getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis">Legacy of Atlantis</a>, a full ground-up Unreal Engine 5 remake of the original Tomb Raider.

But also, and I always say this and very few people pay attention - tell us what the games we left out are about! Why should people care? Sharing a cool recommendation is one of the best feelings in the world, so if there’s a game you’re stoked on, tell us about it!</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-games-coming-in-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: Forget GTA 6, 2026 is All About The Life-Sim Genre]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-forget-gta-6-2026-is-all-about-the-life-sim-genre/</link>
            <guid>1395505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s easy to look at 2026 as a year that will be dominated by the release of Grand Theft Auto 6, assuming there isn’t another delay from Rockstar, but while that stands as the biggest overall release of the year, 2026 itself could be defined by the life-sim genre.</p>



<p>Games like The Sims and Stardew Valley have achieved vast success over the years, with the genre now being extremely popular and attracting huge franchises into the scene, as seen with Disney Dreamlight Valley, but 2026 is going to be bigger than ever before.</p>



<p>Several big players are entering the scene with fresh games in the genre, the indie environment continues to grow, and fans are poised for news from arguably the biggest franchise in the entire genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-big-players-enter-the-scene">Big Players Enter The Scene</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Transforming the game. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The mammoth year for life-sim gamers kicks off on January 15 with the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which adds new content for all players, regardless of system, alongside Switch 2 exclusive features like gamechat and multiplayer with up to 12 players.</p>



<p>Gamers will be hoping that this isn’t the only piece of big Animal Crossing news in 2026, with all eyes cast towards Nintendo for details on the next entry in the series following the launch of Switch 2, which could certainly come next year. Even if a release of a new Animal Crossing isn’t on the 2026 calendar, it’s still set to be a huge year on Nintendo.</p>



<p>In March, Pokémon enters the genre with the release of Pokopia, where players take control of a humanoid Ditto, bringing life back to a depleted region. Fans believe this is a post-apocalyptic version of Kanto, where players attract new Pokémon into the environment, learn new skills, and build a complete Pokémon village.</p>



<p>Pokémon’s entry into the genre makes a lot of sense, particularly with the franchise branching out into new experiences, and Pokopia could be one of the biggest hits of the year. However, The Pokémon Company isn’t the one big player set to make moves into the life-sim genre.</p>



<p>HoYoverse, the developers behind hit games including Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero, and Honkai: Star Rail, is expected to launch Petit Planet in 2026, following the start of the closed beta in November 2025. While a precise release date has not been shared, it’s anticipated to land in the next 12 months, and, with the power of HoYoverse behind it, Petit Planet could be a huge hit.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-host-of-options">A Host of Options</h2>



<p>While the likes of Nintendo, Pokémon, and HoYoverse are set to make waves in the life-sim genre in 2026, they’re far from the only developers looking to make a splash, and there’s set to be an embarrassment of riches for those looking for their fix in the genre.</p>



<p>Starsand Island is due to release on multiple platforms on February 1, having raised over $300,000 in a Kickstarter campaign, presenting players with a new world to experience and various career paths to choose from, including an angler, explorer, farmer, or rancher. While the game is a new player on the scene, excitement levels are rising, and the success of games developed in China in recent years shows this isn’t a title to ignore.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Neverway, from Coldblood Inc, is also due to release in 2026, and has strong Stardew Valley aesthitics with the art style and lore, though there’s a fresh approach as the player-character, Fionna, becomes indebted to a dead god, becoming its immortal herald—which makes Tom Nook from Animal Crossing look extremely tame.</p>



<p>Both of those titles merely scratch the surface of what’s to come; however, with other releases to keep an eye on, including Moonlight Peaks, Sunkissed City, and Fields of Mistria, the latter of which has been in early access since 2024 and is poised for a full 1.0 release in 2026.</p>



<p>With so many titles to choose from in 2026, life-sim gamers will be spoilt for choice, so much so that the eventual release of GTA 6 could go unnoticed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Biggest Fortnite Collaborations We’d Love to See in 2026]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite is the undisputed king of collabs, regularly featuring huge crossovers with major franchises in the world of movies, TV, and gaming, but there’s still plenty of routes of collaborations to go down and skins that would be great additions in 2026.</p>



<p>From the world of movies to the major gaming franchises, Insider Gaming has selected the biggest Fortnite collaborations that would set 2026 alight.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-fortnite-collabs-we-d-love-to-see-in-2026">Biggest Fortnite Collabs We’d Love to See in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-avengers-doomsday">Avengers: Doomsday</h3>



<figure><figcaption>New era. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admittedly, this one is probably a guarantee for the back-end of next year, but Avengers: Doomsday is arguably the biggest movie release in decades, marking a huge shift in direction for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a Fortnite crossover in 2026 would be perfect.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s approach in Chapter 6 to deliver themed mini-seasons could be perfect for Avengers: Doomsday, which releases in December 2026, as Epic Games could introduce a Battleworld-themed map to star as the closing part of Chapter 7, featuring callbacks to various iconic moments and locations from MCU history.</p>



<p>There has already been a major Marvel collab with Doctor Doom as the main villain, however, so perhaps the best route for the collab would be to look back over MCU history, rather than solely tying into the film, but still having hints of what fans can expect from the huge movie.</p>



<h3 id="h-shrek">Shrek</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Swamp. Image via Dreamworks</figcaption></figure>



<p>Shrek returns to the big screens in 2025 with the release of Shrek 5, and it’s about time everyone’s favorite Ogre appeared in Fortnite, as it stands as one of the biggest animated movie franchises yet to be given an Epic Games’ makeover.</p>



<p>While skins and accessories would be a big hit, tying into the game directly and having a POI for Shrek’s swamp on the map would be excellent, especially if it came alongside the iconic voiceline of Shrek screaming ‘what are you doing in my swamp!?’ at any player who approaches.</p>



<p>The introduction of Sidekicks also opens the door for other characters like Donkey and the Gingerbread Man to feature, though I’d personally love to see Lord Farquad as a Sidekick, just for fun.</p>



<h3 id="h-toy-story">Toy Story</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve got a friend in me. Image via Disney</figcaption></figure>



<p>Disney’s close relationship with Epic Games has brought a ton of major franchises and animated stars into Fortnite already but, so far, Toy Story hasn’t been touched, and 2026 is the perfect time to change that with yet another film in the franchise due to hit the big screens.</p>



<p>Toy Story is another great contender to feature in a larger collab with Fortnite in a full-island takeover, particularly if other Pixar titles are involved, but Disney, understandably, may be reluctant to allow Woody and Buzz Lightyear to run around with rifles, pistols, and other weapons.</p>



<p>Again, this is where Sidekicks could come in, as smaller versions of fan-favorite characters would be immensely popular, especially if they flopped to the floor when you stood still. Andy’s coming!</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon">Pokémon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The very best. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>We can dream, right? Nintendo is famously extremely protective of its IPs, and previous attempts to bring the likes of Samus from Metroid into Fortnite have failed due to Nintendo’s apparent desire to keep the franchise as platform-exclusive, but it’s Nintendo whoi really misses out from this.</p>



<p>If Nintendo was to relent and ease their restrictions, Pokémon would admittedly be much further down the list of obvious franchises to feature, as it’s highly unlikely we’d see Ash Ketchum running around with a rocket launcher anytime soon, but, again, this is where Sidekicks could come in.</p>



<p>Having popular Pokémon like Pikachu, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander available as Sidekicks would be a huge boost, and, as the characters wouldn’t be directly involved in combat, it would save face for Nintendo.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-boys">The Boys</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Needed. Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p>Superhero collabs are a dime a dozen in Fortnite, with pretty much all of the biggest faces making appearances over the years, but, so far, The Boys is yet to star. With the final season of the popular series due to air in 2026, there’s no better time for the franchise to make a Fortnite debut.</p>



<p>Skins for the likes of Homelander, Starlight, Billy Butcher, Queen Maeve, and Hughie Campbell would definitely be big sellers in the Item Shop, and having Mythic weapons spawning on the map during a collab would be iconic, though I doubt there’s the potential of being able to pick up a baby and using it’s laser vision.</p>



<p>Regardless, it’s staggering that The Boys is yet to feature in Fortnite, and that needs to change in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-super-mario">Super Mario</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s-a-me. Image via Universal</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ok, we’re back to the Nintendo problem again, and there would be a lot of logistics to sort out with a collab, but if Nintendo and Epic Games were to get on the same page, surely Super Mario would be near the top of the list.</p>



<p>There are some obvious issues surrounding the heights of characters like Mario and Luigi, but others, like Bowser, could instantly be made into a skin, and there’s a potential for the collab to include Mario-inspired skins for Fortnite characters, rather than direct copies. Princess Peach Hope anyone?</p>



<p>The potential in-game is also great, with yellow question mark blocks replacing chests, Goomba’s to stomp on to receive loot, and a Mario Kart POI would be iconic.</p>



<h3 id="h-wwe">WWE</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More needed. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>WWE and Fortnite partnered for a small collab in 2025, bringing The Undertaker and Cody Rhodes into the game, but they were sub par. Frankly, how could you have Cody’s ‘WOAH’ Emote without the actual song lyrics? Rather than a brief collab, Fortnite should go all in.</p>



<p>The Fortnite x WWE roster includes the aforementioned duo along with The Rock, John Cena, Bianca Belair, and Becky Lynch, but there’s much, much more that could be done. Imagine the potential, with the likes of Rey Mysterio with various mask styles, Roman Reigns’ imposing figure, and R-Truth being hilarious.</p>



<p>If WWE and Fortnite were to really put their heads together, there are endless opportunities, even going as far as a full-on Fortnite Festival collab with a heap of entrance music made available.</p>



<h3 id="h-minecraft">Minecraft</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Block party. Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It does feel like that if we haven’t had a Minecraft collab in Fortnite yet, we’re never going to get one, particularly as LEGO Fortnite made the games a direct competitor, and the obvious opportunity for a collab with the release of the Minecraft movie in 2025 has passed.</p>



<p>Still, there are endless opportunities, and the chance for both iconic franchises to benefit. Skins for Minecraft characters would be a big win, though I can’t shake the feeling of how good a full-on Minecraft-inspired Battle Royale island would look like, featuring all the beloved biomes.</p>



<p>The likelihood of a Minecraft collab in Fortnite does seem extremely slim, but we’ll hold out hope anyway.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Please Look Forward to Final Fantasy XIV on Nintendo Switch’, Says Yoshida]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/please-look-forward-to-final-fantasy-xiv-on-nintendo-switch-says-yoshida/</link>
            <guid>1395454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida</strong>, known as the producer of <strong>Final Fantasy XVI</strong> and the director and producer of <strong>Final Fantasy XIV</strong>, has teased a port of the popular <strong>MMORPG</strong> to <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> platforms during an in-game New Year celebration on Japanese servers. As <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/umadori0726/archives/62900051.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by the blog Livedoor, when asked about it, he replied 'Please look forward to it.' It's not quite a confirmation, but fans are taking it as a definite sign that progress is being made on that front. </p>



<p>Yoshida previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-xiv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed the possibility</a> back in June 2024, when he opened the door to the port, but also suggested that it might not happen for quite some time. Now we're into 2026, though, so we might be closer to an announcement.</p>



<p>The Final Fantasy XIV director then returned to the topic in a Gamescom 2025 interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, when he mused on the benefits of such a port for existing players and newcomers.</p>



<p><em>For existing Final Fantasy XIV players, if hypothetically a Nintendo Switch 2 version was released, they would have the chance, for example, going through the main story—they could play that on the PC and do raiding on the PC. But when it comes to other types of content, they could sit back, relax on the sofa with the Switch 2 in hand, and they could do their gatherer and crafter content, and I'm super excited about that sort of possibility for our players.</em></p>



<p><em>For those who have never played Final Fantasy XIV, the younger generation, if they started playing on Switch 2, being an MMO, it could be a genre new to them, and I would be really happy to introduce these new players to the genre and let them have fun with the game. It's precisely because of this that we have started discussions with Nintendo, and so far they have been positive, so I really hope that players can expect good news in the future.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, though, in the New Year message, Yoshida appears to have referenced Switch in general, rather than specifically the Switch 2. Final Fantasy XIV was originally released on the PlayStation 3, so it could certainly run on the Switch, although that platform has long since been abandoned and the latest expansions are a bit more taxing than the base game. The safest bet is to assume that the game will only launch on the Switch 2. Meanwhile, the game recently received patch 7.4, which introduced new Main Scenario Quests,​ a new dungeon, a new Trial,​ the Heavyweight Raid Tier for the Arcadion series,​ an overhaul of the Glamour System Overhaul, and a new​ Frontline map.</p>



<p>Chinese players already have a taste of playing the MMORPG on the go <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-gets-official-announcement-playtesting-begins-soon-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through the mobile version</a>, <strong>Final Fantasy XIV: Crystal World</strong>, which was developed by Tencent's LightSpeed Studios and released in China on June 19, 2025. A global launch date has not been confirmed yet.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-kicks-off-2026-14-new-games-added-throughout-january/</link>
            <guid>1395439</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> sent the first <strong>GeForce NOW Thursday</strong> blast of the year, revealing the PC games that have entered the library this week and also those scheduled to be added throughout the whole month.</p>



<p>Let's begin with the former list. There's a new indie game that just launched, <strong>My Winter Car</strong>, and four games that have been out for some time but are now being supported by GeForce NOW. Eternights was not at all available on NVIDIA's cloud gaming platform, while the others could be streamed but only if you owned them via Steam; now, they can also be streamed if you own them via the Xbox or Epic Games stores.</p>



<ul>
<li>My Winter Car (New release on Steam, Dec. 29)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a> (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/eternights-is-an-action-game-with-dating-sim-elements-set-during-the-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eternights</a> (Epic Games Store)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> (Epic Games Store, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I continue to be a strong advocate for Don't Nod's <strong>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden</strong>. If you enjoy the latest God of War games, this is one you don't want to miss. It's a little less polished, sure, but its overall quality is not that far removed from Santa Monica's acclaimed masterpieces, and it also offers a much greater degree of player agency. <strong>The Casting of Frank Stone</strong> and <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong> are also two great titles in their respective genres.</p>



<p>As for the rest of January 2026, GeForce NOW users can expect the following titles to populate their library in the coming weeks:</p>



<ul>
<li>StarRupture (New release on Steam, Jan. 6)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pathologic 3</a> (New release on Steam, Jan. 9)</li>



<li>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check (New release on Steam, Jan. 12)</li>



<li>MIO: Memories in Orbit (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on Game Pass, Jan. 20)</li>



<li>Nova Roma (New release Steam, Jan. 22)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-reforged-out-december-3-controller-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars: Reforged</a> (Steam)</li>



<li>Mon Bazou (Steam)</li>



<li>Supermarket Simulator (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li>Tavern Keeper (Steam)</li>
</ul>



<p>Admittedly, when comparing this list with the official game release schedule, several notable titles are missing, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2XKO</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arknights-endfield-beta-test-ii-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a></strong>, <strong>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein II</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/front-mission-1st-remake-to-release-this-november-front-mission-3-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Front Mission 3 Remake</a></strong>. That said, it is still possible NVIDIA will add them to GeForce NOW at a later time; the initial list announced at the beginning of each month is usually bolstered by several late additions.</p>

            <guid>1395436</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="620">As the new year begins, it’s a natural time to think about fresh starts, new routines, and treating yourself to something that actually adds value to your daily life. This is the perfect moment to invest in a piece of tech that supports your health, productivity, and lifestyle moving forward. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/">Apple’s latest release, the Apple Watch Series 11, launched earlier this year and is already seeing impressive discounts of up to 25%, making it a smart and timely upgrade to kick off the year.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1323" data-end="1927">What’s New in the Series 11</h2>
<p data-start="1323" data-end="1927">The Apple Watch Series 11 represents Apple’s most advanced mainstream smartwatch to date. Compared to earlier generations, it brings noticeable improvements in health tracking, durability, connectivity, and overall software experience. The redesigned Liquid Glass interface gives the display a cleaner, more modern look. Enhanced Smart Stack widgets make it easier to access relevant information throughout the day, while new gesture-based controls—like a one-handed wrist flick to dismiss notifications—add convenience to everyday use.</p>
<p data-start="1929" data-end="2460">Health and fitness remain at the core of the Apple Watch experience. The Series 11 supports a wide range of biometric tracking features, including heart rate monitoring, ECG readings, blood oxygen levels, cycle tracking, and sleep analysis. A new hypertension notification feature can alert users to trends that may suggest elevated blood pressure, helping them stay informed about potential health concerns. The watch has a sleep score system, making it easy to understand sleep patterns and work toward better rest.</p>
<p data-start="2462" data-end="2810">On the software side, features like Workout Buddy provide personalized fitness insights and encouragement, helping you stay motivated and consistent with your goals. And of course, the Series 11 still includes all the familiar Apple Watch integrations, such as seamless syncing with an iPhone for calls, messages, notifications, Apple Pay, and more.</p>


<p data-start="2812" data-end="3404">From a design perspective, the Series 11 stays true to Apple’s signature sleek look. It’s available in 42mm and 46mm sizes, with a choice between aluminum or premium titanium cases. The aluminum models feature upgraded Ion-X glass, which Apple claims is roughly twice as scratch-resistant as before. With water resistance up to 50 meters and added dust protection, the watch is well suited for workouts, outdoor activities, and everyday wear. Cellular models also support 5G connectivity, allowing for faster data speeds and improved performance when your iPhone isn’t nearby.</p>
<p data-start="3740" data-end="3990" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/">If you’re looking for a meaningful way to start the new year with something that supports healthier habits, the Apple Watch Series 11 is a compelling choice.</a> The smaller 42mm model originally debuted at $399, but it’s currently available for just $299 thanks to a 25% discount. That’s a $100 savings. If you prefer a larger display, the 46mm version is also discounted. It launched at $429 and is now priced at $329, reflecting a 23% price drop. No matter which size you choose, you’re saving the same $100 for a limited time. Apple also offers a wide range of customization options, including case finishes like jet black, rose gold, and silver, along with bands in colors such as black, light blush, and purple fog, allowing you to tailor the watch to your personal style.</p>

<section><p>Avowed doesn't allow slain enemies to respawn and is all the better for it.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Obsidian's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a> is one of the better action-RPGs released in 2025. While it doesn't reinvent any particular wheel, it benefits from an engaging campaign, fun combat systems, and charming characters. Aside from the occasional bug--a common element of Obsidian's open-world games--and an overabundance of homicidal bears, I liked nearly everything about the game. That includes Avowed's most controversial game mechanic: enemy respawns, or the lack thereof.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to RPGs, players often think of a few key elements. Some sort of leveling system, quest-granting NPCs, obtainable loot that bolsters certain "builds" or playstyles--you know, the basics. One feature that's common but maybe not as notable, considering its use in other genres, is respawning enemies. Players often expect areas to repopulate with baddies whenever they return to a given location. Avowed isn't about that life though--at least, not entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed is designed to respond to your actions in meaningful ways, and not just during key moments, where certain decisions can change the direction of the game's story. This also applies to Avowed's enemies. Essentially, most of the outlaws, walking mushrooms, and crazed bears you'll run into during your journey, won't return after being killed. Laid waste to a group of Xaurips while wandering through the forest? Don't worry. They'll still be dead on return trips. Slain a few dozen Spiderlings in an underground lair? They won't be resurrected anytime soon, either. Rinse and repeat--or rather, don't repeat.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, this aspect of Avowed's gameplay didn't sit well with everyone. Some didn't like how empty areas felt after a while. Others hated that they couldn't farm enemies for experience points or random loot--a shortcoming that exacerbated the irritating grind of upgrading gear before Avowed's day-one patch. In most cases, the complaints about this feature are reasonable. That said, I liked the idea of never having to face the same enemy twice. Not having to worry about battling the same group of skeletons on return trips to their camp was great, especially during those times when I needed to collect something I missed; returning for a chest that could only be opened with a specific key (or several lock picks) was a breeze.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626294-8719650200-ss_8a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626294" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626294-8719650200-ss_8a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626294"></a><figcaption>Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626294-8719650200-ss_8a.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>I also liked how my actions had consequences. If I made a place relatively safe for travelers to explore, it stayed that way. And conversations with NPCs would reflect how I was able to put down a group of bandits that threatened their town. Again, this sort of thing is common when dealing with story-based missions or important side quests. It's easier to role-play when everything you do matters, though. Even on a small scale, it's nice to feel like you're a meaningful part of Avowed's world.</span></p><p dir="ltr">The most notable reason this novel feature is a good thing has to do with farmable enemies. There aren't any, which in turn means that grinding for XP isn't a thing. Obsidian has created multiple combat systems that, when combined, offset the need to constantly hit certain levels. Yeah, there are places that are initially off-limits to new players. And seeing multiple enemies with skulls over their heads (indicating their threat level) could mean trouble. But thanks to the ability to upgrade weapons/gear, flexible build-crafting, competent AI companions, and a generous helping of XP whenever a quest is completed, I never felt under-leveled when trying to complete a story-based mission.</p><p dir="ltr">I've played enough video games over the years to know that grinding, while being a respected method of controlling the pace of certain activities, isn't always needed. I've also gotten to a point where I can better appreciate a developer's efforts to respect my time as a player; this is less "old person yelling at the clouds" and more "I no longer have all of the time in the world to play games." That's not to say that I didn't partake in side quests, bounties, and more--just that I was never made to feel like I had to do those things to progress.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed offered me a balanced experience throughout my entire playthrough. And part of that appeal came from Obsidian's deliberate efforts to allow players to play at their own pace. You could go through the game clearing all the camps, caves, and abandoned mines in hopes of min/maxing your character. You can also, for the most part, just stick to the main questline and still have a good time. Creating a game that doesn't allow for enemy respawns--which requires changes to the normal RPG grind-fest formula--works in Avowed's favor.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[8 Biggest Xbox Games Coming in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1395424</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is set to be a huge year for gaming, and Xbox players have plenty to be excited for with a host of first-party titles landing on the platform as part of a Game Pass subscription, alongside major multi-platform releases.</p>



<p>The past year was a bit of a mixed bag for Xbox, with several major delays hitting the platform hard, and, overall, 2025 felt a lot like a transitional year for gaming as a whole. Still, it’s certainly laid down the groundwork for 2026 to be huge, with more releases to enjoy than you can count.</p>



<p>With so many big releases coming in 2026, Insider Gaming has selected the biggest games in the next 12 months that Xbox players can’t miss.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2026">8 Biggest Xbox Games Coming in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Japan awaits. Credit to Playground Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though Forza Horizon 5 still stands as the best racing game available on the platform, the open-world adventure turns five in 2026, and a successor is overdue. Step forward Forza Horizon 6, with the setting of the game already announced to be in Japan, something that players have wanted for a long time.</p>



<p>Although the Horizon franchise is no longer Xbox exclusive, with the fifth game released on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Xbox remains the best place to play the title due to the Game Pass release. Additionally, a release on other platforms, including PlayStation, could come after an initial Xbox release.</p>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Delayed. Image via Rockstar</figcaption></figure>



<p>The long, long wait for the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 is finally coming next year, assuming there are no further delays from Rockstar, and, with anticipation for GTA 6 being so high and the wait being so long, the eventual release will spread further than the usual sphere of gaming and will make a significant impact in media as a whole.</p>



<p>There are still many unanswered questions surrounding GTA 6, and we should start to see more about the game revealed, edging closer to a release, but expect Fall 2026 to be dominated by GTA 6 entirely, with other developers frantically moving things about so their release doesn’t clash with the titan.</p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Long wait. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Initially slated for a release in 2025, Playground Games’ Fable relaunch was delayed until 2026 back in February 2025, and there are still some questions on whether that release window will be met. Regardless, the relaunch of the franchise is a big deal for Xbox in a period where its big in-house projects have fallen short of expectations on many cases.</p>



<p>It’s been an extremely long wait for Fable to emerge, and the stakes are high as the initial games have such a high amount of popularity, so reaching the high bars that have been set may be tricky. Either way, Fable will go down as one of the must-play games on Xbox in 2026, assuming it isn’t delayed again.</p>



<h3 id="h-subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Splashdown. Image via Unknown Worlds Entertainment </figcaption></figure>



<p>Another title that was initially due to release into early access in 2025, a delay pushed that period for Subnautica 2 back into 2026, and eyes are cast towards Krafton following a messy situation that has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unknown Worlds suing its former leadership</a> and co-founders with claims of sabotage and abandonment.</p>



<p>While all that rumbles on in the background, excitement for the next entry in the Subnautica franchise continues to rise. Both the initial game and Below Zero made a big impression in the open-world survival action-adventure genre, setting high expectations for the third game in the franchise.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Prequel. Image via The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Set 14 years before the events of the original Gears of War, which was re-released as Gears of War: Reloaded in August 2025, a move that brought the franchise onto PlayStation for the first time, E-Day is set on the events of Emergence Day when the Locust first reared their ugly heads.</p>



<p>It’s fair to say the more recent entries in the Gears of War franchise were not quick as impactful as the first three, but the prequel provides the opportunity to detail more background into the original trilogy, as well as bringing characters that were killed off in later games back into the fray.</p>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Beginning. Image via Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Similar to the Gears of War franchise, the last few Halo games released were not quite as big as hits as the initial games in the franchise, which is now going back to the beginning with Halo: Campaign Evolved. While another remake has attracted criticism in some corners, it does provide the platform to build the next generation of the franchise.</p>



<p>Focusing on the campaign only has been controversial, but the up-to-date tools used will bring the original Halo game to life once again in different ways from before, and will surely help development of future games. Even if you still play the Masterchief Collection regularly, Campaign Evolved is worth some effort.</p>



<h3 id="h-high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sequel. Image via Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Squanch Games’ sequel to the original game of the same name, High on Life 2 is set for release on February 13, and will be available day one for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. With the early months of next year looking slightly barren in places, it’s a great opportunity for High on Life 2 to shine.</p>



<p>The comedic shooter is definitely a can’t-miss game of 2026 for Xbox players and, if you never played the first game, there’s still time to rectify that before the release date.</p>



<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-2026">Call of Duty 2026</h3>



<figure><figcaption>New start? Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another year, another Call of Duty title, surely it’s the same old thing? Perhaps not, as a big update was provided in December that confirmed back-to-back releases of titles in the franchise will be scrapped, after two years of Black Ops titles drew criticism and fatigue.</p>



<p>Not much is known about 2026 yet, and it remains to be seen whether it will bring a new Modern Warfare title or a new direction entirely, but the confirmation of a change in direction shows Activision is listening to the community, which should raise hopes for the 2026 Call of Duty title.</p>

              <p>Sometimes you need some extra power to get you through emergency situations. Or maybe you want to spend some time off the grid and need power to facilitate that. The Anker SOLIX F3000 Portable Power Station is a heavy-duty, portable power solution to provide you with the energy needed to power your devices, appliances, and equipment anywhere you need them. And best of all, it can last and last as long as you need it.</p>
<p>It’s not budget-priced normally by any means, but it’s on sale right now, so buying it might be a little less painful. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6634/">Anker SOLIX F3000 Portable Power Station is available on Amazon for just $2,199; this is significantly lower than its original price of $5,397 (a reduction of $3,198) and represents a savings of approximately 59% of the retail price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6634/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power to fuel you through emergencies, off-grid excursions, and more</h2>
<p>The SOLIX F3000 was created for serious users and is capable of supplying the power to support the needs of larger electronics, tools and appliances for hours on end. This lets you use your power station for camping/RV trips as well as an emergency backup during a power outage.

The availability of solar charging means you can use the power station for longer periods of time while away from a typical electrical power source. Additionally, the fact that you can recharge the SOLIX F3000 using multiple methods decreases the likelihood of you running low on power when you need it the most.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/think-monster-hunter-wilds-on-nintendo-switch-2-will-be-an-impossible-port-new-screenshot-and-information-suggest-otherwise/</link>
            <guid>1395391</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the past few days, dedicated <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> fans started taking an in-depth look at the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Title Update 4</strong> files,<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/potato-mode-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-the-communitys-reaction-doesnt-disappoint/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> discovering mention of a Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong></a> and some of its potential features, including a dedicated <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS profile</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">local multiplayer support</strong> with multiple consoles.</p>



<p>The idea of seeing a game that still runs poorly on many PC configuartions and other consoles was obvioulsy met with skepticism, but if you shared the community sentiment of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> being an <strong>impossible Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong>, you'd better think again, as newly discovered information and a screenshot simulating the graphics settings of the Switch 2 version suggest that a lot of thought is going into this new release.</p>



<p>As reported on the <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q0zjcp/more_datamined_info_regarding_the_switch_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a></strong>, a Chinese group specializing in datamining the latest entry in the <strong>CAPCOM</strong> series discovered a lot more information on the game's <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong>, starting with the graphics presets, which target <strong>30 FPS gameplay using NVIDIA DLSS</strong>, outputting at <strong>1080p resolution in docked mode</strong>.</p>



<p>While this is hardly surprising, considering the system's specifications, these settings won't turn the Nintendo Switch 2 version into a <strong>"Potato Mode"</strong> game. The datamining group applied these graphics settings and shared a screenshot captured from the PC version of the game, simulating how the Switch 2 version will look.</p>



<p>And the results are <strong>definitely promising</strong>, especially if similar care is given to the handheld mode profile. This version of the game would also finally provide a <strong>proper on-the-go option</strong> for many, as <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> doesn't run well on <strong>Steam Deck</strong>, which can't leverage <strong>NVIDIA DLSS</strong> as the Nintendo system can.</p>

<p>In addition to the information above, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Monster Hunter Wilds </em>datamining group also discovered strings detailing the Switch 2 version's local multiplayer feature - <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Bring Nintendo Switch 2 consoles together to create or join a lobby using local wireless communication,"</strong></em> and "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Search for lobbies using local wireless communication. </strong></em><span><em><strong>Bring Nintendo Switch 2 consoles together to allow up to four players to participate,"</strong></em>&nbsp;- and mention of&nbsp;<strong>Tempered Gogmazios</strong>, whose </span><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/"><span>base variant </span>was added to the game with Title Update 4.</a></strong></p>



<p>This <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2 port of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong>, which now essentially only requires an official confirmation with all this information discovered inside the game's files, is likely part of an effort to bring more players to the latest entry in the series, as CAPCOM thinks that <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/"><strong>the high price of the PlayStation 5 system impacted the game's sales in Japan.</strong></a></p>



<p>Hopefully, this effort will bear fruit and indeed bring both newcomers and <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>lapsed players back to the game</strong></a> as director <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yuya Tokuda</strong> wished.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-restocks-the-soundlink-revolve-series-ii-speaker-at-all-time-low-to-start-2026-after-year-end-clearance-2000654996</link>
            <guid>1395388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose makes some of our favorite audio solutions around, from soundbars to headphones, speakers, and more. Those on the hunt for a portable Bluetooth speaker that keeps you entertained with your favorite songs for hours on the go should consider <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/">the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Series 2 speaker, which is currently going for a 33% discount at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>This brings the total down to just $199 from $299, saving you a total of $100. The deal applies to the black color option. The stunning silver is discounted, too, sitting at $179 right now. Note that the retailer has marked both the discounts as limited-time offers, so we’re not expecting them to last long. Grab them before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keeps the Party Going</h2>
<p>The 10W speaker looks like an adorable mini lantern. It comes with a built-in handle for portability, plus features all the essential controls right at the top for easier management. Small size doesn’t mean a compromise on performance, though. You’ll enjoy stable, rich sound for all your favorite tracks, whether you’re jamming to the latest Post Malone song or just want to have some calm music playing in the background as you wrap up those last-minute Christmas gifts.</p>
<p>Audio connection options include Bluetooth and a 3.5 mm stereo audio cable, whichever you prefer. A wireless range of up to 9 m (30 ft.) lets you move around with ease when you have your device connected to the speaker wirelessly. Pairing couldn’t be simpler. The dedicated app offers a drag-and-drop interface where you can switch between Bluetooth devices within seconds. For reference, Revolve 2 Plus can keep track of the last eight connected devices at the same time. There’s a built-in microphone, too, which lets you take calls directly from the speaker without going through the hassle of disconnecting your phone first. This also makes it easy to communicate with your voice assistant to get other things done, such as checking the schedule, creating a playlist, adjusting volume, etc.</p>



<p>Reliability comes from the speaker’s IP55 water-resistant rating. This protects it from everyday water splashes (by the pool, in the shower), plus light drizzle, ensuring the party goes on in all weather conditions. As for the battery life, a single charge gets you up to 17 hours of playtime, meaning you can go at least a couple of days without plugging it in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/">It usually goes for around $300, but the current 33% discount lets you pick it up for less than $200 today.</a> Both the silver and black versions are discounted, so there are options to choose from. But again, the discount is only around for a short time, so it’s best to grab the speaker quickly. We also suggest taking a look at the delivery timeline during checkout to know if you’ll receive it before Christmas or after New Year’s. That said, we’re spotting plenty of other audio solutions going for less at Amazon, too. The retailer’s own devices are currently available at up to 60% off, which makes now a great time to stock up on some essentials, plus high-ticket items, without blowing your budget.</p>

<p>PlayStation surely wants a massive 2026 as the PS5 generation starts to wind down, and the key to the PS5 being a success is having another long list of incredible PlayStation games launching in 2025. Insider Gaming has picked out the biggest and best PlayStation games.</p>



<p>PS5’s exclusive games are becoming even fewer and farther between as we get scarily close to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS6</a> era. It’s not helped by the fact that the age-old ‘exclusive’ is dying as the world’s biggest gaming brands are intent on making the most money possible, and this requires a game to launch on all major platforms. Still, Sony has some bona fide PlayStation weapons up its luxurious 2026-tailored sleeves.</p>







<p>If you’re looking to fill your gaming calendar with the hottest exclusives and releases, this article has everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-ps5-exclusives-coming-in-2026">Biggest PS5 Exclusives Coming In 2026</h2>



<p>One entry on this list stands out as being a bit ‘sus,’ but for the most part, these are the biggest PS5 games coming out for PlayStation in 2026. Obviously, between Summer Game Fest, Sony State of Play showcases, and special announcements, we could always see more PS5 exclusives revealed throughout the year. Stay tuned for more.</p>



<h3 id="h-saros">Saros</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Housemarque</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s always a good day when Hosuemarque is working on a new game. It’s the company that literally never misses, and is responsible for legendary PlayStation games such as Super Stardust, Resogun, and 2021’s incredible Returnal. From Dead Nation to Alienation and Nex Machina, the developer only deals in premium, polished packages.</p>







<p>Saros is a spiritual successor to Returnal and looks like an evolution in every aspect. From the bright and beaming balls and bullets boomed at you by elusive foes in true bullet-hell fashion, to the incredible attention to detail in the visuals and sound design. It’s hard to see Saros being anything but a system-selling, Game of the Year contender come the end of 2026.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Saros | Gameplay Trailer | State of Play" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T4MEo0YYoW8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you thought Insomniac was going to hold back on Wolverine’s violence, then you can tuck your adamantium tail between your legs and go and find something a bit more casual. Wolverine is Logan in his most primal and animalistic form. Insomniac kept a cloak over him for quite a while after the initial reveal, but now we’ve seen that this beast has claws.</p>



<p>The combat-centric action that the studio has mastered with the Marvel’s Spider-Man series plays a part here. But expect a deeper, darker, and more disturbing array of moves for the massacre-making mutant. It’s destined for 2026 and will likely be Sony’s <em>big </em>exclusive of the year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Marvel's Wolverine | Game Overview Trailer | State of Play" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIVVHM3xORY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>Team Ninja took a brief hiatus from Nioh to work on new IPs: Wo Long Fallen Dynasty and Rise of the Ronin. It also resurrected long-time fan favorite Ninja Gaiden, with the fourth mainline release in 2025. Now, it’s time for another dose of Soulslike samurai action with Nioh 3. </p>



<p>While FromSoftware rightfully gets the credit and acclaim for its Souls games, the Nioh games are incredibly deep, which is to be expected from the sick geniuses at Team Ninja. Nioh 3 is a slight outlier here as it’s technically releasing on PC as well as PS5, but not Xbox or Nintendo, so it can be given a pass.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Nioh 3 | Reveal Trailer | State of Play 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CayQOZV602M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-biggest-2025-ps5-games">Biggest 2025 PS5 Games</h2>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>This could easily be the shortest entry of any on this list. What else needs to be said about Grand Theft Auto 6? Depending on how you count Tetris, GTA 5 is the second or third best-selling game in history. GTA 6 is expected to go one better, and it’s probably the biggest and most important video game that will ever be made.</p>



<p>Who knows, it could be the final GTA game. Considering how long it takes Rockstar to make new games now, and with a Red Dead Redemption 3, or another new or revived IP hovering around, who knows how long it’ll be until a potential GTA 7—if ever.</p>



<p>This is <em>the </em>game of 2026…unless it’s delayed AGAIN.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom’s Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the franchise. You return to a bombed-out Raccoon City, following its devastation at the hands of a planned missile strike at the end of Resident Evil 3. Grace Ashcroft (daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft) is the unfortunate character in the hot seat this time around—although the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Keneddy rumors</a> are growing.</p>



<p>You’ll be chased by another Tyrant-like monster, and there will be a big emphasis on running and survival. This should be music to the ears of you old-school Resident Evil fans. You can’t go wrong with a new Resi game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-shown-exclusively-in-japan-reveals-new-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Requiem gameplay</a> shows that a real biohazard awaits you.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Resident Evil Requiem | 'Road to Requiem' Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xRj7vocpCyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-007-first-light">007 First Light</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels weird to see IO Interactive’s name attached to something not Hitman-related. The Danish studio has been given the unenviable task of offering the world a new portrayal of James Bond and has a fully fledged license to thrill. The story focuses on Bond’s formative years as an agent, meaning we’re getting to see the youngest, most unpolished, and easily inexperienced version of the world’s most coveted and acclaimed secret agent.</p>



<p>Gameplay footage suggests that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-lights-combat-and-physicality-is-inspired-by-the-daniel-craig-era-of-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">007 First Light</a> won’t be a complete departure from Hitman, and there are clearly some nuances and stylish licks politely borrowed for good measure.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="007 First Light | Gameplay Trailer State of Play 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBv4hzotS_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to 343 Industries</figcaption></figure>



<p>The day Forza Horizon 5 became available on PlayStation 5 was a very strange one; it felt like a noticeable shift in the industry. Gears of War: Reloaded plunged us further into the rabbit hole of incredulity, and now Halo is coming to PlayStation 5—the console wars are <em>officially </em>over.</p>



<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved marks the near-25-year franchise’s first appearance on a PlayStation console. It’s only the campaign, but for lifelong Sony fans (such as myself), this is a chance to start from the ground up. PS5 owners can see what the fuss is all about and see why Xbox dominated the shooter scene for years.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-iv-black-flag-remake">Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has been reporting on the long-rumored Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake for years. While early AC games—such as Assassin’s Creed 2—get a lot of love, there’s something undeniably special (daresay perfect) about Black Flag. Ubisoft has done its best to conceal details and go as far as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening to sue an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag actor over a Remake slip-up</a>.</p>



<p>As per our exclusive story, we believe the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is set to launch before March 31</a>. Once it happens (not if), then it will be one of the biggest games of 2025, and one you need to own on PS5.</p>

No need to bother with all that GOTY rigmarole next year, as it's already wrapped and bagged. Commiserations to the losers, and congratulations to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a>! Catch you all again in '27...</p>
<p>Okay, okay. That's a <em>little</em> premature, but the fact that we're getting a brand new Rhythm Heaven/Paradise game puts 2026 ahead of every year since 2016 (which brought us <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/rhythm_heaven_megamix">Megamix</a> on 3DS), so anything else on the calendar is just gravy, really.</p>
<p>Jokes-not-jokes aside, with Switch 2 now off to the races, there's loads to look forward to in the coming 12 months. Capcom's going hard with not just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, but also Gold Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">RE7</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">8</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, and new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>.

<p>FromSoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> will make a long-awaited appearance on Switch 2, and we'll find out more about system-exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> this year.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Player Count Doubts Debated as ARC Raiders Hits Huge Numbers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-arc-raiders-player-count-debate/</link>
            <guid>1395364</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There’s a new player-count-related debate spreading like wildfire throughout the gaming space, and it concerns the success of ARC Raiders compared to the relative failure of Battlefield 6. In recent days, fans of both titles have been actively engaging in a debate to determine why one is soaring while the other can’t seem to do anything right.</p>



<p>This stems from Steam player counts (where else?), which paint a telling tale. Two months after release, ARC Raiders has managed to retain 91% of its peak player count on Steam, while Battlefield 6 has witnessed an 85% <strong>plummeting drop</strong> in the numbers.</p>



<p>Where do you stand on the debate?</p>







<h2 id="h-steam-isn-t-the-ultimate-litmus-test-for-gaming-numbers">Steam Isn’t the Ultimate Litmus Test for Gaming Numbers</h2>



<p>Too many people are still reliant on Steam’s figures for the picture of health for a game, but extrapolation is king. It could be considered woefully unfair to use <strong>a single platform </strong>to determine the overall health of a game like Battlefield 6, given that on PC, that’s arguably not even the most popular launcher for the game.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter much, as the debate rages, and Steam data is all we have to go on when it comes to facts and figures.</p>



<p>In the most recent news, it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/12/31/arc-raiders-has-kept-91-of-its-playerbase-battlefield-6-has-lost-85/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> that drew attention to the numbers, pointing out that ARC Raiders has retained 91% of its player base after two months. On the other hand, Battlefield 6, which was released in proximity to Embark Studios’ new extraction shooter, has plummeted by more than 85%.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a fractured debate for many reasons.</p>



<p>First, the live-service model for ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 is quite different. The former operates on delivering new missions, progression paths, unlocks, boss characters, maps, and events, which represent much more <strong>meat </strong>than what Battlefield offers. EA’s new first-person shooter is focused more on new maps, modes, and battle pass bundles than anything else.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders, being an extraction shooter, has a ‘reset loop’ that ensures players can come back every few weeks and restart their playthrough, which isn’t a thing in Battlefield 6, a typical multiplayer shooter. There’s point two in the argument against this debate.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders also represents something new and exciting in the gaming space: a truly accessible extraction shooter. At the same time, Battlefield 6 is just a first-person shooter with a boots-on-the-ground military setting, and they’re a dime a dozen. Folks came, saw, enjoyed the game, and departed for greener pastures when things started going south.</p>



<p>That’s <strong>the third point</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The <strong>fourth point </strong>against the argument is that ARC Raiders has simply been doing things better where Battlefield 6 is failing. In recent weeks, some of the new maps, modes, and bundles released in the Battlefield 6 space have left players disappointed, and controversies have surfaced regarding gen-AI art that have gone unexplained by Electronic Arts.</p>



<p>It’s simple, really. While Battlefield has a peak of 747,440 on Steam, it’s mostly comprised of players edging with curiosity into a game that marked a potential resurgence for a failing franchise. They dipped their toes in the water, and many of them decided to ultimately move on.</p>



<p>Conversely, ARC Raiders operates on a concept that many hadn’t ever experienced before it dropped. They’ve tried it, liked what’s on offer, and more have decided to hang around. It also helps that you can invest in ARC Raiders for as little as $30, and everything after that point, bar cosmetics, is free.</p>



<p>So, it’s safe to say we can cap this debate and move on. It’s a non-starter, apples and oranges, chalk and cheese, and something barely worth addressing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Shroud Predicts ARC Raiders Will Be ‘Bigger Than Fortnite’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-arc-raiders-fortnite-hot-take/</link>
            <guid>1395358</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a statement that some have dubbed a hot take, popular streamer and former esports pro, Shroud, has suggested that ARC Raiders is <strong>bigger </strong>than Fortnite. He suggested that, going forward, Embark Studios’ extraction shooter will be <strong>bigger than </strong>the likes of Fortnite, VALORANT, and Apex Legends, prompting many to doubt his knowledge of ball.</p>



<p>Shroud has found plenty of success streaming ARC Raiders since the game dropped on October 30, but this latest comment is a tricky one, and it has fans debating how serious the content creator was.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-arc-raiders-be-bigger-than-fortnite">Will ARC Raiders Be Bigger Than Fortnite?</h2>



<p>During <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/2006425120722792795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent stream</a>, Shroud plainly stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game is definitely the biggest game since Fortnite for sure. The only other game I can think of along the way is maybe like VALORANT and Apex. But I think this game is bigger than both those games and will be bigger as time goes on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was a hot take, and it has since been met with some ridicule, even from fans of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The extraction adventure title, which was released by Embark Studios on October 30, has proven to be one of the biggest hits of 2025. It’s one of the most popular extraction games ever made, and two months after release, it is effortlessly retaining enormous player counts across all platforms where other, similar games have faltered and fallen.</p>



<p>To say it’s bigger than Fortnite is a stretch, though. It’s no big secret that Fortnite is the most successful live-service shooter of all time, and the most popular battle royale title ever created. It has peaked at more than 40 million concurrent players, while ARC Raiders has managed a peak concurrent user count of 481,000 on Steam. </p>



<p>Embark Studios remains committed to expanding and evolving ARC Raiders and has already pushed out some engaging events and updates since the game dropped. Before ARC Raiders dropped, Embark Studios pledged <strong>years </strong>of support, and it’s easy to see that happening given what we already know about the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/harada-tekken-dead-veteran-dev-final-message/</link>
            <guid>1395349</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Katsuhiro Harada has bid farewell to more than thirty years of working under the Bandai Namco banner, moving on from Tekken after decades of developing the series. In a new social media post, Harada ushered in 2026 by stressing that he’s ‘no longer a developer/creator of the TEKKEN series’.</p>



<p>At the start of December 2025, Harada and the Bandai Namco team shared the news that the legendary developer would be parting ways with the firm after 31 years.</p>







<h2 id="h-katsuhiro-harada-has-moved-on">Katsuhiro Harada Has Moved On</h2>



<p>In a new post on social media, Katsuhiro Harada shared the following message:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m no longer a developer / creator of the TEKKEN series.</p><p>Harada_TEKKEN is completely dead.</p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/2006390358859809229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The iconic developer was quick to update his bio, writing, ‘Former Game Director and Chief Producer of action and fighting games.’</p>



<p>On December 8, Harada shared the revelation with fans worldwide that he would be stepping down from his tenured spot at Bandai Namco:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans shared their sentiments in the comments under Harada’s post. One drew comparisons to the series that Harada was pivotal in creating, saying, ‘Heihachi ‘died’ like 4 times. Kazuya came back from a volcano. We know how this works in the Tekken universe. See you in the next patch notes, boss.’</p>



<p>Others offered more simple, heartfelt messages: ‘We will always think of you, Harada-san, thank you for everything.’</p>



<p>Harada worked in production and direction roles on the Tekken series since Tekken 3 debuted in 1997, and was a driving force in the space ever since. He’s set to appear one last time in the Tekken space at some upcoming esports events, but then the world afterwards is his oyster.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#935)—Clues and Answers for Thursday, January 1]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-1-935/</link>
            <guid>1395343</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I haven’t seen you since last year! It’s 2026, and it’s time to keep moving forward with stacks of NYT Connections hints, solutions, and tips. If you’ve burst into 2026 with a desire to keep your NYT Connections streak running, I’m here to help you achieve that resolution. Below, you’ll find the solutions for today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments below what your resolutions are for 2026 and how you plan to hold yourself to them!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #935:</p>



<ul>
<li>SHUCK</li>



<li>SCOTCH</li>



<li>HEAD</li>



<li>RAT</li>



<li>CURSE</li>



<li>SKIN</li>



<li>NUT</li>



<li>FLY</li>



<li>HOUND</li>



<li>FINGERS</li>



<li>SPELL</li>



<li>SHELL</li>



<li>CHARM</li>



<li>BUFF</li>



<li>PEEL</li>



<li>HEX</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about the small, concentrated forms of supernatural influence — the kind of mystical actions that show up in fairy tales, fantasy novels, or folklore.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Imagine you’re prepping food in a kitchen — or working with anything that has a natural outer layer</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are the words you attach to someone who is REALLY into a topic — the kind of person who knows every detail, every fact, every obscure bit of trivia.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Picture the word “butter” followed by another word to form a familiar phrase or compound.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 1:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-january-1-935">NYT Connections Answers for Today, January 1 (#935)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHARM, CURSE, HEX, SPELL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – PEEL, SHELL, SHUCK, SKIN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BUFF, HEAD, HOUND, RAT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FINGERS, FLY, NUT, SCOTCH</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

If you've yet to catch up on the series, now is the best time to do so. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Beyond the standard mainline games</a>, Persona has seen spin-offs here and there, but Persona 5, in particular, has seen a suite of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 Strikers from Omega Force is actually set after the events of Persona 5, and the recently released Persona 5: The Phantom X brings many new characters into the fold. However, the most interesting spin-off is arguably <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, a strategy-based spin-off that is similar to XCOM. If you've yet to check out this game, Best Buy has a great deal to pick up a copy for only $10.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Persona 5 Tactica for $9.99</h2><div catalogid="f81d571e-8633-4fda-abf5-4691903d0249" id="233992"><div id="233992" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Persona 5 Tactica - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 Tactica falls in line with the story of Persona 5, with the game actually taking place during the base game. One day, the party is transported away to an alternate reality called a Kingdom, and these worlds are where Tactica takes place. DLC was also made available for Persona 5 Tactica, in the form of Repaint Your Heart, which brought back familiar faces Goro Akechi and Kasumi Yoshizawa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In each Kingdom, you control up to three characters and move them around a grid-based map to take down enemies. Many of Persona 5's unique combat mechanics are implemented here in familiar ways, such as the 1 More mechanic when attacking an enemy and knocking them to the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
