		<p>Fury Studios has unveiled the next major DLC for Kingdom Two Crowns, entitled Call of Olympus. This new content will offer a unique interpretation on Ancient Greek mythology, featuring the series’ adversary, The Greed. In Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus, players will engage in&nbsp; battle against The Greed to discover the mysteries hidden atop Mount Olympus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus | Announcement Trailer | Wishlist Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BfYKaobPkgs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Greed is not the sole obstacle in the player’s journey to discover what lies atop Mount Olympus. Securing the favor of various gods is also essential, requiring island-hopping across the Greek archipelago. These quests will be taking place during the day, rewarding various artifacts that can be used in battle when The Greed emerges at night.</p>

<p>In our Kingdom Two Crowns review, Thomas said, <em>“Kingdom Two Crowns feels more like an extensive update than a new entry to the series, but the base game is still so immensely enjoyable that it doesn’t really matter. This is the perfect starting point for new players, and those who are returning might still be surprised by some of the secrets to be found.”</em></p>

<p>Kingdom Two Crowns is currently 75% off on Steam as part of Raw Fury’s publisher sale, and it will remain 75% off until June 3rd. Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus will be available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, iOS, and Android. The release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-fabulous-exploration-and-combat">excellent</a> side-scrolling revival of Ubisoft's beloved platform series, has just received the second of three previously announced free post-launch content updates, this one adding a new Boss Rush mode and more.
</p>
<p>
Once today's update is installed, two new boss-based challenges can be access via Artaban in The Haven. There's Boss Revenge, giving players a way to take on previously defeated bosses again - and at any difficult - with a "statistics" board recording their best attempts.
</p>
<p>
While Boss Revenge is all about individual encounters, there's also the aforementioned Boss Rush mode - which, in time-honoured tradition, challenges players to defeat all eight of the games bosses in a row. To aid in the challenge, equipped amulets and Athra surges can be changed between each boss enounter.

<p>
Alongside the boss-themed stuff, today's The Lost Crown update adds a new fast-travel system utilising wak-wak trees, plus two new costumes, both unlock through Boss Rush mode. One is based on the Prince's outfit in Ubisoft's 2008 reboot and the other, according to the supplied render, is the Prince with most of his clothes fallen off.

<p>
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's Boss Attack update (as it's official known) launches today on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-roadmap-includes-boss-rush-permadeath-story-dlc">previously announced free updates</a>, following on from March's Warrior's Path update, which added a Speedrun and Permadeath mode.
</p>
<p>
Next up is Divine Trials, this one promising to introduce new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges, alongside new amulets, when it launches some time this "summer". It'll be followed by a paid story expansion "later" this year.

            <p>The next part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale </a>creator Toby Fox’s current project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> is actually two parts, as chapters 3 and 4 plan to release together. It sounds like that release is still a ways off, according to a recent update from Fox, even as the latest chapter seemingly makes “great progress” and the team eye up work on Chapter 5.</p>

<p>Deltarune, you may remember, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deltarune-chapter-1-undertale-sequel">arrived fairly suddenly</a> back in late 2018 as a surprisingly free, surprisingly deep and surprisingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deltarune-is-not-in-the-world-of-undertale">sort-of-but-sort-of-not</a> sequel to the beloved comedy-RPG. It took another three years for Chapter 2 to follow on from the roughly three-hour opening section, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deltarune-chapter-2-continues-the-undertale-follow-up-tomorrow">arriving with similar surprise</a> towards the end of 2021. At the time, Fox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deltarune-chapter-2-launched-for-free-because-the-world-is-tough-enough">confirmed</a> that there would be more Deltarune to come, but he had opted to drop things in episodic fashion rather than as one complete story as originally planned.</p>
<p>That’s probably a good thing for those awaiting Deltarune, as we’re now almost three years on from Chapter 2 - and six from part one, good lord - and chapters 3 and 4 are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deltarune-isnt-coming-out-this-year-but-heres-some-more-toby-fox-bangers">yet to be seen</a>. Part of that is likely due to the decision to bundle the next two sections together, as Fox announced last year, with Chapter 3 said to be “content complete” back in October.</p>
<p>Since then the team have brought on some new developers to help out, with a latest <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/spring24/">Spring newsletter update</a> from Fox (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/undertale-developer-toby-fox-assures-fans-that-deltarune-chapter-4-is-underway-i-dont-want-anyone-to-burn-out-waiting-for-this/">PC Gamer</a>) saying that “Chapter 4 development is going better than ever” as a result and is on track against the team’s own deadlines. “I feel really good about this, champ,” Fox added.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/deltarune-combat.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While that may give hope of Chapter 3 and 4 arriving soon, Fox is quick to steady expectations. While around 10 maps, a few cutscenes and a gimmick - similar to the teacup ride in Chapter 2 - are pretty much all that’s left, the team then plan to spend “an unknown amount of time” smoothing out the chapters’ pacing and overall experience.</p>
<p>As such, Fox says that there’s no release date on the cards yet: “Even if Chapter 4 is completed smoothly, there may be surprise factors, so we're not at the point where we can make a solid promise.”</p>
<p>But it all sounds positive, to the point that Fox hopes that by the time of the next update in a few months’ time, some of the team will have already moved over to working on Chapter 5. That was originally meant to join parts 3 and 4 in this combined release, but Fox’s assessment at the time that “I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything” seems to have been prudent.</p>
<p>So expect a release date maybe sometime soon, but not <em>soon</em>. Given how the previous parts of Deltarune arrived with sudden fanfare, there’s a good chance the next you hear of Chapters 3 and 4 is when they’re out and ready to play.</p>
<p>“In other words, the release is still quite far... but also a very real thing that is weighing on us more and more with each passing month,” Fox said, feeling the anticipation more than perhaps anyone: “I can't wait for you guys to see more of the moments and characters I've had in my head for the past 8 years…”</p>

See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="U9rbOS">There’s a dim light at the end of the blockbuster-output tunnel. With smaller and medium-sized movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134076/trap-trailer-thriller-release-date-m-night-shyamalan-pop-star"><em>Trap</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23374118/smile-ending-meaning-director-interview"><em>Smile 2</em></a>, <em>Nosferatu</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23495327/mickey-17-teaser-bong-joon-ho-robert-pattinson"><em>Mickey 17</em></a> dominating conversations and studio presentations at this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24128842/new-movies-2024-cinemacon-best-trailers-clips">CinemaCon</a>, the expo for all things theatrical release, and similarly budgeted films <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/2024/">continuing to show impressive gains at the box office</a>, a question is in the air: Could the mid-budget movie make a comeback?</p>
<p id="8joEcS">Hollywood’s current obsession with movies that cost <a href="https://entertainment.ie/movies/movie-news/the-marvel-cinematic-universe-in-numbers-227156/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20the%20production%20budget,counting%20'Avengers%3A%20Endgame'.">north of $150 million</a> and take up half the screens at multiplexes has a few different causes, but the easiest ones to point to all wear capes. After the breakout success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, studios focused on chasing Marvel’s formula, with big, expensive movies that aimed to earn a billion dollars or more at the box office. Blockbuster movies have been a critical part of the theatrical landscape <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-history-of-the-blockbuster-movie/">since the term was coined in the 1950s</a>, but the age of the billion-dollar box-office hit spawned a new blockbuster mania for studios, and particularly for ambitious studio executives. As tentpole movies increased in size, scope, and budget, they quickly started to squeeze out smaller projects.</p>

</p>
<p id="aRWC8H">Hollywood’s older model relied on a steady mix of blockbuster blowouts (“See <em>Ben-Hur</em> in glorious Cinemascope!”) and mid-sized movies, both to keep audiences interested and to keep budgets and profits sensible. Studios would build out their calendars with a few big blockbusters each year, plus a couple of smaller movies that might take big chances. But they stacked the majority of their calendars with projects in the mid-budget realm, movies that cost around $10 to $90 million to make (with a little wiggle room on either side), and usually involved at least one or two stars to get viewers in the door.</p>
<p id="BlZ1V8">In the 2000s, those mid-budget slates included everything from rom-coms like <em>50 First Dates</em> or <em>Fever Pitch</em> to prestige dramas like <em>Michael Clayton, </em>or dark dramas like <em>No Country for Old Men</em>. Mid-budget movies gave filmmakers and studios room to experiment with interesting concepts, without the need to necessarily please every possible audience quadrant, or even — in the case of smaller prestige movies, aimed at winning awards and boosting brands — to earn their money back. </p>
<p id="zyvwzP">But as blockbuster box-office returns soared, mid-budget movies that could triple their budgets and make $60 million at the box office seemed like chump change for studios. Instead, they started consolidating those budgets into blockbusters that had the chance to really hit it big. That mode means fewer movies and bigger risks. Without the sturdy middle-ground films that used to keep production companies afloat, every single movie became exponentially more important to each studio’s bottom line. Suddenly, every single blockbuster had to be a massive hit, making <a href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/can-hollywood-stop-making-films-that-need-to-make-half-a-billion-dollars-in-three-months-just-to-break-even/">at least $500 million at the box office</a>, just to break even. And if <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/indiana-jones-5-mission-impossible-7-box-office-flops-explained-1235690262/">one missed that mark</a>, the <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/paramount-sale-hollywood-studio-takeover-history-lessons-1235910245/">consequences could be devastating</a>; no longer were there smaller over-performing movies on the ledger to cushion the financial blow. </p>

<p id="fMh73A">This kind of cycle is nothing new for Hollywood.

<p id="85sFv4">But as Manohla Dargis put it in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/movies/14dargis.html">2010 piece for the New York Times</a>, “Alas, that power went to their heads, and filmmakers indulged themselves into a creative dead ends (<em>At Long Last Love</em>) and financial calamities (<em>One From the Heart</em>). The Age of Aquarius and the auteurs gave way to high-concept hits driven by the corporate bottom line and toy tie-ins.”</p>
<p id="fna2PW">Suddenly, an emphasis on <a href="https://nofilmschool.com/independent-movies-90s-dominate">sequels and blockbusters soared in the 1980s</a>, but when the floor fell out, it eventually gave way to the Sundance and Miramax-led indie movie boom of the 1990s, which Biskind again chronicled, this time in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Down-Dirty-Pictures-Sundance-Independent/dp/0684862581?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Down-Dirty-Pictures-Sundance-Independent/dp/0684862581?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23917987__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23917987__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film</em></a> <em>— </em>a fascinating book that has taken on <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24144453/harvey-weinstein-overturned-conviction-explained-eliza-orlins-molineaux-rule-sandoval">new dimension over the years</a>.</p>
<p id="UqRmMc">Each time the cycle repeats, a few massive bombs and overall diminishing ticket sales helped studios understand that audiences wanted them to reset the market and move from bigger movies back to smaller ones. Dargis described this cycle, and the studio heads’ relationship to it best in that same Times piece, saying: </p>
<blockquote><p id="55agMW">A familiar take on New Hollywood is that the inmates took over the asylum. But the truth is that the wardens were also smart enough to hand over the keys, at least as long as it made dollars and sense. The history of Hollywood is one of perpetual crisis and retrenchment and the extraordinary resilience of an industry that continually co-opts potential threats (television, video, independent filmmakers) and exploits them to its benefit.</p></blockquote>
<p id="XBCPZs">In other words, the studios have always moved where their audiences were, as long as they had the data to find them.</p>
<p id="JZOMQP">Steven Spielberg has been predicting the end of this cycle, and decrying the increasingly massive budgets of blockbusters, since <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/steven-spielberg-predicts-implosion-film-567604">a 2013 speech at USC</a> in which he said, “there’s eventually going to be an implosion — or a big meltdown. There’s going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe even a half-dozen mega-budget movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that’s going to change the paradigm.” And while he may have been early in his prediction, the dual disruption of streaming services, which tempted studios with a seemingly lucrative new business model, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which cratered theatrical attendance, upended Hollywood’s usual rhythms, and didn’t let this round of blockbusters die a natural death. </p>
<p id="qcVrA6">Rather than shifting away from mega-movies after <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/box-office/black-adam-box-office-100-million-loss-1235449487/">high-profile box-office bombs</a>, companies continued to invest in the biggest movies they could make. While plenty of blockbusters failed due to the box-office depression that followed COVID’s arrival, each one that made a significant splash at the box office was seen as a new sign of overall theatrical recovery from the pandemic, even if they <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/doctor-strange-2-mcu-history-box-office">weren’t making nearly what studios had hoped</a>. At the same time, studios started throwing hundreds of millions into developing streaming services, using <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/17/hollywood-streaming-profits-struggles.html">extremely iffy business models</a>. Those services were where they parked their small and mid-budget movies, <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/peacock-lost-651-million-dollars-comcast-q2-earnings-1234887557/">to disappointing returns</a>. </p>

<p id="Wzp05P">But it seems the studios are finally starting to feel the tides turn. With the box office slowly on the mend from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24144727/2024-movie-release-schedule-blockbusters-2025-box-office">down years after COVID</a>, blockbuster disappointments like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23779999/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-review-part-1-tom-cruise-never-boring"><em>Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23725992/fast-x-review-fast-furious-10"><em>Fast X</em></a><em>,</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23952209/the-marvels-review-kamala-khan-captain-marvel"><em>The Marvels</em></a> — all movies that would have made respectable money if their budgets hadn’t ballooned to massive, unsustainable numbers — all look like victims of the shifting preferences of audiences, rather than those crowds simply not showing up to theaters. Even <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/disney-fewer-marvel-movie-releases-why-rcna151016">Disney CEO Bob Iger</a> has acknowledged some of this stagnation, saying that Marvel will stick with releasing just three movies a year. At the same time, mid-budget movies have started to dominate that box-office conversation more and more often, with movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099490/civil-war-review-2024-alex-garland"><em>Civil War</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24137377/anyone-but-you-netflix-funny-rom-com-supporting-cast"><em>Anyone but You</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23180048/elvis-review-baz-luhrmann-tom-hanks-austin-butler"><em>Elvis</em></a>,<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23180515/the-black-phone-review-joe-hill"><em>The Black Phone</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24118982/bob-marley-movie-director-interview-reinaldo-marcus-green-one-love"><em>Bob Marley: One Love</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23934016/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-review-horror-streamers"><em>Five Nights at Freddy</em>’s</a> turning into bona fide hits. </p>
<p id="xkgGqR">Life after blockbusters was a topic of conversation for nearly every studio and theater-owner at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24128842/new-movies-2024-cinemacon-best-trailers-clips">CinemaCon 2024</a>, the annual trade show for theatrical distribution, where leaders from the industry meet to discuss the state of movie-going. More than once, presenters from studios or theater owners mentioned the speech given at last year’s Academy Awards by <em>American Fiction</em> writer Cord Jefferson, who won Best Adapted Screenplay. Accepting the award, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEZz2dSXS0c&amp;ab_channel=Oscars&amp;t=2m24s">he implored studios</a>,  “instead of making one $200 million movie, try making 20 $10 million movies, or 50 $4 million movies.”</p>

<p id="VxSSU2">While blockbusters were also key talking points for the studios at CinemaCon 2024, nearly all of them had an impressive slate of mid-budget movies on their calendars for both 2024 and 2025, including M. Night Shyamalan’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134076/trap-trailer-thriller-release-date-m-night-shyamalan-pop-star"><em>Trap</em></a>, Jeff Nichols’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23906339/austin-butler-the-bikeriders-so-pretty-so-cool"><em>The Bikeriders</em></a>, Ti West’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23357046/pearl-horror-movie-ending-explained-mia-goth-ti-west"><em>MaXXXine</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24055798/longlegs-horror-movie-trailer-teaser-release"><em>Longlegs</em></a>, <em>Speak No Evil</em>, <em>Smile 2</em>, Bong Joon-ho’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23495327/mickey-17-teaser-bong-joon-ho-robert-pattinson"><em>Mickey 17</em></a>, <em>The Black Phone 2</em>, and <em>The Bride</em>, just to name a few.</p>
<p id="Xpofjz">The most heavily discussed movie of the convention also happened to be a mid-budget hit. Angel Studios’ <em>Sound of Freedom</em>, a movie with a budget reportedly just under $15 million, made more than $184 million at the domestic box office, blowing away everyone’s expectations, and proving to studios that creative marketing can help turn even the most modest movies into massive hits. (The movie ends with a direct address from its lead actor asking those who enjoyed the movie to buy tickets for their friends.) On top of that, <em>Sound of Freedom</em>’s faith-based angle revived another principle of mid-budget films: Sometimes aiming for a specialty audience and making sure everyone in that group sees your film can be more profitable than trying to make a four-quadrant movie that ends up seeming bland to everyone. </p>
<p id="QaJ0NG">It’s not that blockbusters are going away completely. There’s still a Mission Impossible movie on the board for 2025, along with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153564/fantastic-four-2025-cast-ralph-ineson-galactus"><em>Fantastic Four</em></a>, James Gunn’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24150323/superman-costume-james-gunn-david-corenswet-underwear"><em>Superman</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23511762/avatar-3-4-5-release-cast-plot-about">another Avatar movie</a>. But the pendulum seems to be swinging back toward the center for the first time in more than a decade. Studios are finally starting to fill the middle of the yearly line-ups again. With the success of movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23288981/bullet-train-review-brad-pitt-john-wick"><em>Bullet Train</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23368190/smile-review-horror-movie"><em>Smile</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23342834/barbarian-review-horror-twists"><em>Barbarian</em></a>, and even this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24031441/beekeeper-review-jason-statham-movie"><em>The Beekeeper</em></a>, it’s getting more and more evident that audiences are eager for smaller, more interesting movies. </p>

  <p id="RWDjW5"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24106896/disney-lorcana-ursulas-return-encanto-illumineers-quest"><em>Ursula’s Return</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-lorcana"><em>Disney Lorcana's</em></a> next expansion, is already available from your <a href="https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/locator">local games store</a>, but you can also pre-order products from the new set from several retailers ahead of the May 31 launch. And it appears that, unlike the previous expansions, retailers — including Amazon and Best Buy — have done away with the virtual queue. It’s first come, first served for one of the hottest releases of the summer.</p>
<p id="sDzBdD">We’ve provided links to where you can pre-order all the new products in <em>Ursula’s Return</em> below, along with details of their contents.</p>
<hr id="EsYeef">
<h3 id="AyaqSt"><strong>Ursula’s Return Starter Decks</strong></h3>
<p id="pq96cV">Just like previous expansions, <em>Ursula’s Return</em> is launching with a pair of new starter decks, perfect for getting introduced to the game. Both the Amber &amp; Amethyst and Sapphire &amp; Steel Starter Decks for <em>Ursula’s Return</em> are priced at $16.99 and available to pre-order from Amazon and Best Buy. </p>
<p id="NYSWrH">Both decks are reconstructed decks of 60 cards that include a pair of foil cards featuring the characters pictured on the front of the box. Each deck also includes 11 tokens, a quick start rulebook and a single Booster Pack from the new expansion.</p>

<h3 id="vgDsaM"><strong>Ursula’s Return: Deep Trouble Illumineer’s Quest Box</strong></h3>
<p id="Vevl1S">A new item being introduced with this <em>Disney Lorcana</em> expansion is Illumineer’s Quest - Deep Trouble, a standalone single-player or cooperative experience that supports up to four players. It retails for $59.99. Be sure to read <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153056/disney-lorcana-illumineers-quest-deep-trouble-co-op-solo-preview">our spoiler-free review</a>.</p>
<p id="NvKAyO">The box contains a 50-card scenario deck, along with a pair of pre-built <em>Lorcana</em> decks for you and a friend. You’ll also find an oversized Ursula card along with two double-sided battleground cards, in addition to a <em>Deep Trouble</em> playmat and a bunch of tokens. Just note that while the box includes the rules you’ll need to play the new cooperative game mode, the rules for the PvP version of <em>Lorcana</em> aren’t included, although Ravenburger provides a <a href="https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/how-to-play-tcg">number of free tutorials</a> on the <em>Disney Lorcana</em> site. </p>

It’s a grayish-blue short-sleeved number with a big piece of art emblazoned across the front. The art, done by Zee, is a rendering of protagonist Red on a motorcycle atop a beautifully simplistic line drawing of the game’s setting, Cloudbank. It all combines to form a shape evoking the titular <em>Transistor</em>, a cyberpunk sword. The simple line work and the use of only white and light blue make it stand out in a sea of boring, derivative video game merch. It doesn’t have the game’s title or main character ostentatiously and lazily slapped on a shirt, which is why I bought this merch in the first place—it evoked the game’s world and style while not exactly rehashing the in-game art. It was, dare I say, cool?<br></p><p>In writing this article I discovered/was reminded of something interesting: The <em>Transistor</em> T-shirt didn’t drop right when the game launched. It was first revealed in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/new-transistor-merch-at-pax-prime/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/new-transistor-merch-at-pax-prime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 2014 blog post</a></span> as part of a line of merch for the game (including a <em>Transistor</em> USB I still regret not buying), nearly four months after the game’s release. This meant that, despite finishing the game in only two sittings,) I continued to obsess over <em>Transistor</em> for months, so much so that I bought a T-shirt for it that I still proudly wear today. Of course, I hadn’t stopped playing the game after rolling credits for the first time— I played <em>Transistor</em> nearly every day for weeks, beating it over and over again and collecting as many trophies as I could. </p><figure id="" data-id="9823641e5fe46e582f25827662e80da4" data-recommend-id="image://9823641e5fe46e582f25827662e80da4" data-format="jpg" data-width="484" data-height="738" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bathroom selfie of a woman with blue hair wearing a gray suit and a transitor t-shirt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bathroom selfie of a woman with blue hair wearing a gray suit and a transitor t-shirt" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Willa Rowe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9823641e5fe46e582f25827662e80da4" data-recommend-id="image://9823641e5fe46e582f25827662e80da4" data-format="jpg" data-width="484" data-height="738" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bathroom selfie of a woman with blue hair wearing a gray suit and a transitor t-shirt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I finally got the shirt and wore it out it was mostly mistaken as <em>TRON</em> merch— Like a lot. And as the years passed, I held on to it. It went with me to college and I even kept it around when I began my transition and threw out the majority of my boy clothes. <em>Transistor</em> stayed! While locked inside my apartment during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, I would pull on the cozy shirt and sit on the couch replaying Supergiant’s best game (in my opinion). I had yet to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/it-took-12-years-but-i-finally-got-a-platinum-playstat-1844926819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/it-took-12-years-but-i-finally-got-a-platinum-playstat-1844926819">platinum</a></span> the game, mostly because I got stuck on the Performance Tests (special challenge rooms with progressively higher difficulty). So on April 7, 2020, I hunkered down and cleared the last hurdle between me and that platinum trophy.

I’ve kept it in pretty good condition but it’s worn enough that my fiancée has come to hate it, making it an “inside the apartment only” shirt. She has played <em>Transistor</em> now, and while she remains a bigger fan of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803"><em>Hades</em></a></span>, she sees its merits. Still, I do think she would be happier if I threw it out altogether, which is never gonna happen as this is now officially a collectible (Supergiant doesn’t sell the shirt anymore).</p><hr><p>In honor of my fiancée’s wishes, I don’t wear the shirt out anymore—except today. Happy anniversary to <em>Transistor</em>, a one-of-a-kind game, and happy anniversary to my T-shirt. Here’s to another decade.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With XDefiant launching on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, we have questions about filling a lobby in the competitive arena shooter. Does XDefiant have crossplay? It’ll certainly make it easier to play a game against human opponents, so let’s find out!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xdefiant-crossplay">Is XDefiant Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Yes, XDefiant does offer crossplay support between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you can’t find a packed lobby while playing on your chosen system, the game automatically fills it with players from other systems. It’s on by default, so far as we can tell, but whether that’s good or bad remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Typically, when you have a competitive shooter on PC, those players perform exceptionally well. On the other hand, console players tend to lag. A mouse and keyboard are generally more accurate and responsive than a controller in a fast-paced FPS. It’ll be interesting to see how Ubisoft balances the game from the get-go with all three systems in mind!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-xdefiant">What is XDefiant?</h2>



<p>XDefiant is Ubisoft’s competitive arena-based shooter with hero abilities and their usual gunplay, but it’s frantic and fun. It’s similar in style to Overwatch but with Ubisoft’s usual flair. By that, we mean they’ve borrowed some of the combat mechanics and feel from other open-world titles in their roster, such as Ghost Recon and The Division.</p>



<p>Once you’re in XDefiant for the first time, you’ll likely find the 6×6 gameplay familiar and, dare I say, even enticing. From what we saw in the beta, it’s a fun time all around.</p>



<hr>



<p>Alongside XDefiant, Insider Gaming keeps track of countless other upcoming games; we’re excited about most of them. Check it out:</p>

<p>If you’re one of the many eager for a new competitive shooter to play, then XDefiant is likely on your radar. Thankfully, it’s on the horizon, too. So, when does XDefiant come out? Here’s the release date and times for Ubisoft’s arena shooter!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-xdefiant-releasing">When is XDefiant Releasing?</h2>



<p>Good news! You can start playing XDefiant on Tuesday, May 21, at the following times:</p>



<ul>
<li>6 pm BST</li>



<li>1pm EDT</li>



<li>10 am PST</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, with the XDefiant release date looming, you can pre-load the game right now via your favorite current-gen console or on PC via Ubisoft Connect. Thankfully, it’s not a massive download, weighing in at approximately 30 GB in total.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, XDefiant won’t launch on Steam—at least not yet. Ubisoft typically brings their titles to the Valve-owned platform in time, but it can take many months or even a full year before that happens.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-xdefiant-come-out-on-xbox">Will XDefiant Come Out on Xbox?</h2>



<p>Yes! XDefiant will launch on Xbox, alongside PC and PlayStation 5. On PC, you can only download and play XDefiant via Ubisoft Connect. The Ubisoft launcher certainly isn’t the worst out there, but we wish the game would launch on Steam.</p>



<p>As for on console, you can download the competitive shooter completely free from your chosen console’s store. On Xbox, simply search for XDefiant on May 21, then download. The same goes for PlayStation 5!</p>

<p>There are games for which I have great admiration, pleasant memories, and an entirely dreadful set of skills and outcomes. <em>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic III </em>(or <em>HoMM 3</em>) has long been one of those games.</p>
<p>I have played it on just about every PC I've owned, ever since it chipped away at my college GPA. I love being tasked with managing not only heroes, armies, resources, villages, and battlefield positioning but also time itself. If you run around the map clicking to discover every single power-up and resource pile, using up turn after turn, you will almost certainly let your enemy grow strong enough to conquer you. But I do this, without fail. I get halfway into a campaign and the (horse cart) wheels fall off, so I set the game aside until the click-to-move-the-horsey impulse comes back.</p>
<p>With the release of <em>Songs of Conquest</em> in 1.0 form on PC today (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/867210/Songs_of_Conquest/?utm_source=Landing_page">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/songs_of_conquest">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/songs-of-conquest">Epic</a>), I feel freed from this loop of recurrent humbling. This title from Lavapotion and Coffee Stain Publishing very much hits the same pleasure points of discovery and choice as <em>HoMM 3</em>. But&nbsp;<em>Songs of Conquest</em> has much easier onboarding, modern resolutions, interfaces that aren't too taxing (to the point of being Verified on Steam Deck), and <a href="https://www.gamespace.com/all-articles/news/songs-of-conquest-ai-update/">granular difficulty customization</a>. More importantly for most, it has its own stories and ideas. If you love fiddling with stuff turn by turn, it's hard to imagine you won't find something in <em>Songs of Conquest</em> to hook you.</p>

<p><em>Songs of Conquest</em> has you move your horse-riding Casters (the Heroes of its inspiration) and their armies around a world map, using each limited movement point to liberate a new resource, pick up some treasure, get a temporary power-up, or engage in battle. When it's battle time, you switch to a hexagonal grid, where your troops trade blows and you choose spells so your Caster can help. Win the battle (either manually or with an automatic "quick" decision), unlock a new area, harvest new resources, recruit more troops, and repeat until the map is clear or some other condition is met. You'll get multiple Casters, new kinds of troops, and tons of new spells and artifacts as you progress, and you'll follow a very swords-and-dragons story.</p>

                    The game's campaigns have short cinematics and evocative stills.                  </p>

<p>The art is a mixture of intentionally granular (and pleasant) pixel art, throwback scroll-and-stone interface elements, and cutscenes and dramatic stills with a deliberate hand-painted look to them. Even if each element looks nice, I'm glad the game mixes it up, and you get a break from each. The properly medieval music seems well done, although it's at a disadvantage, as my brain is making 45 decisions per minute and tends to block out brass, strings, and choirs.</p>
<p>There are four campaigns in the game, each with its own lands, enemy casters and units, spells, and lots of other new things to uncover and throw into your mental strategy RAM. It's a good variety, especially combined with the difficulty and other campaign options you can set. Coming to this game from <em>HoMM 3 </em>memories, I've found the variety of map items, town/castle building, and Caster types new and engaging. My biggest quibble with the game is that managing the spells and upgrades of the Casters is too rich a field for me, somehow just one rich system over the line. Deciding which type of magic a Caster should specialize in and remembering the huge variety of spells available to put into their quickbar overwhelmed me.</p>
<p>As I noted up top, however, I'm not actually good at these games, I just enjoy the spell they put on me. <em>Songs of Conquest</em> is a rich new chapter for <em>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</em> fans, but it's also a good jumping-in point if you've never been tempted before by the series with the unwieldy title and harsh difficulty ramp. Unlike your Casters, you can roam about its thousand little things at whatever pace you like.</p>

His comments in the video feel important in the years since his passing and downright prescient amid current industry turmoil.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dating back to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5CgnTYm-ew">E3 2004</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the interview from Kikizo has been fully remastered with Japanese and English subtitles. At the time, Iwata had only been global president of Nintendo for two years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the interview, Iwata was asked about the then-upcoming Nintendo DS. To him, the handheld needed to feel like something audiences had never experienced before.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The DS can tell you how serious we are about changing the way games are played," said Iwata. "If we said we beefed up the technology of the Game Boy Advance, and the processing power and graphic capabilities, that's something people are expecting. There's no surprise at all."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a similar note, Iwata expressed a belief that the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 wouldn't have much of a future. Cheekily, he noted that if the two consoles </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>did </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">have a bright future ahead, the Nintendo Wii (née Revolution) would go down a similar path.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sony and Microsoft's more recent consoles have largely been sold in terms of graphical and technical power. To Iwata, that focus just results in more work than needed, and is ultimately worthless since audiences may not see a clear difference.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Iwata reflects on the DS and what game consoles need to provide">Iwata reflects on the DS and what game consoles need to provide</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though he passed away in 2015, Iwata's words feel especially resonant now. Last week, Sony revealed half of PlayStation Network's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-4-5-sales-network-psn-users-ps5-ps4-sony-1851481409">install base</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are still using their PlayStation 4s, and have yet to upgrade to PlayStation 5.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's a lot of reasons for that, like the pandemic eating into the momentum of the current generation. The PS5's still being aroundn $500, and much of the current games being </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-i-is-deploying-to-last-gen-consoles-too">cross-gen titles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, also factor into this as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Without a completely new UI or way to play," he said, "I don't think the majority of customers will want to buy a new hardware just to play games."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Iwata viewed the DS as an expansion of the Game Boy family of handhelds, and the GBA had a then-install base of 60 million units. Nintendo's handhelds were (and still are) iconic, which made Sony's PlayStation Portable look like an underdog.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Throughout the interview, he's very intentional with calling the DS its own thing that'll spawn its own devoted base, similar to the Game Boy. He ended up being right, as the DS spawned a redesign and the equally big 3DS as a successor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to the PSP, Iwata noted Sony had a "tough" challenge of going up against both the DS and GBA base. As far as he was concerned, the DS was in a league all its own, since it didn't exist at that point as a Game Boy replacement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not all of Nintendo's hardware bets paid off: the Nintendo WiiU in a rough financial spot, throughout its five-year lifespan.

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> has a surprising amount of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-use-ghost-of-tsushima-photo-mode/">quality-of-life features</a> for whenever you might need them. You can fast travel to any landmark you’ve visited on the map, you can pick up resources while on horseback, and unlike every other <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-playstations-biggest-single-player-launch-on-pc-yet/">open-world game</a>, you aren’t faster or slower than the person you’re trailing. </p> <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">One common feature however is only present in a limited capacity. Here’s whether you can change the time of day in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-can-you-change-from-day-to-night-in-ghost-of-tsushima" data-injectable="false">Can you change from day to night in Ghost of Tsushima?</h2> <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">It’s sadly impossible to pass the time in the conventional way in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. There’s no Skip Time button or key, and you can’t go to a location to sleep and wait. That being said, there are other ways you can do it depending on your use case. Fast traveling to a location will pass some time, though the amount isn’t predetermined. If you want it to be a specific time of day or night, you’ll have to keep fast traveling until it is.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="797" data-injectable="false">Alternatively, there’s an easy way to change the time if you’re trying to set up the perfect photograph. Activate Photo Mode, then scroll down until you reach the Time of Day setting. Here you can use a slider to select the exact time of day you want for your photo. It’ll go back to the time it was when you left Photo Mode, but it’s enough to get the picture just right. You can change a host of other settings here too, like Jin’s emotion, the contrast, and so on.</p>

            <p>Flashy action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> looks like it could be the next PlayStation 5 exclusive to find its way over to PC, as developers Shift Up say they’re pondering a PC release. They’re also thinking about a sequel - probably not much of a surprise given the first game has sold well on just the one platform, by all accounts - while working on a new game that should also be headed to PC, codenamed Project Witches.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>All of this comes from Shift Up’s <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20240520000263">latest financial report</a>, as shared by <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1792567131374031009">KAMI</a> on TwiXer, where the South Korean studio note that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/action-rpg-stellar-blade-has-respectable-devil-may-cry-energy-in-latest-trailer">futuristic Nier X Sekiro action game</a> is “exceeding expectations” in terms of sales. Bringing the current PS5 exclusive to more platforms means the chance of more sales, the report duly notes, comparing the game to both clear inspiration <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata">Nier Automata</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war">Final Fantasy</a>: “By releasing on various platforms, we are expanding the user base and thereby increasing the number of game users.” (Chalk any iffy wording here up to my Google translation of the Korean documents.)</p>
<p>The report goes on to state that “based on our experience with titles such as Destiny Child, Victory: Nikke, and Stellar Blade, we plan to create successful multi-platform solutions for future games”. It’s worth noting that both Destiny Child - Shift Up’s debut, a mobile gacha game about collecting souls to create an army of devil ladies (mostly), which was shut down last year - and Stellar Blade are yet to come to PC, whereas their - ahem - maiden-recruiting third-person shooter Goddess of Victory: Nikke released on PC last February. They certainly have an MO.</p>
<p>In the case of Stellar Blade’s multi-platform future, things look bright for PC as Shift Up say they are “considering producing a PC version”, along with a sequel, comparing the game’s “great potential” as a franchise to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war">God of War</a> and Final Fantasy. That could even include multiple Stellar Blade follow-ups, as the report points at the ambition of “a long-term revenue base through a series of high-quality sequels”.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/stellar-blade-boss.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Shift Up</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The developers won’t just be working on a new Stellar Blade, either. Shift Up say they’ll also invest in other original IP as they head into 2025, including a new “subculture IP” currently codenamed Project Witches that will come to PC as well as console and mobile. Before you get your hopes too high for another technically polished action-RPG in the vein of Stellar Blade, though, the indication is that Project Witches will be a multi-platform gacha game more like Nikke.</p>
<p>“We have very high expectations for Project Witches as the next-generation mega subculture IP that will surpass Goddess of Victory: Nikke,” the studio wrote. Can’t win ‘em all, I suppose.</p>
<p>Anyway, divorced of the unpleasant stench that’s clung to the game from certain parts of the internet, I’ve been very impressed by my time with Stellar Blade as a tight action game that’s not quite experimental or ambitious as Nier in its existential sci-fi storytelling or a complete <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> in its exploration and combat, but a very solid and enjoyable meeting in the middle of both. That said, I can only pray for the content moderation teams working on mod sites if it does indeed find its way over to PC, who will no doubt have their work cut out for them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24160740/star-wars-phantom-menace-4k-trailer-remaster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="61SpqR">At this point, 25 years after its release, there’s no reason to debate the quality of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24141905/star-wars-phantom-menace-lightsaber-duel-fates-fight-choreography"><em>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</em></a>. A catastrophe for boomers and Gen Xers forever entranced by the spell of the original trilogy; a defining tentpole moment for millennials who rode the high of the 1997 Special Edition rereleases only to hit the turbulence of George Lucas’ bubbly new vision; a bedrock of a new era of storytelling for Gen Zers who have more love in their hearts for <em>The Clone Wars</em> TV show than anything in live action — it’s a film that means something different to everyone and, almost objectively, an inflection point for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23613852/marvel-movies-star-wars-influences-ant-man-quantumania">blockbuster moviemaking</a>. Or, to put it another way: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/6t1g8n/what_does_darkseid_is_mean/"><em>The Phantom Menace</em> is</a>.</p>

<p id="tuFk2G">But <em>The Phantom Menace</em> trailer… a masterpiece. And Lucasfilm is rightfully treating 1998’s biggest two-minute hype video, a preview that helped the notorious bomb <em>Meet Joe Black</em> make what little money it made back in the day, as an equally important part of the Star Wars legacy: With the movie back in theaters for a 25th anniversary rerelease, the studio has remastered its original trailer, which was produced and released so early that it was simply called “<em>Episode I</em>” instead of <em>The Phantom Menace</em>. LeAndre Thomas, project manager for video &amp; digital assets at Lucasfilm, <a href="https://x.com/LeAndreThomas/status/1792226121804870002">said on X</a> that he and his team rescanned an original 35mm print of the trailer in order to remaster it in 4K. The new version was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3kyYFHdRsM">posted to YouTube</a> on Sunday night, and was immediately watched by people who enjoy a good nostalgia trip.</p>
<p id="OXi4il">In honor of a pristine new version of the <em>Phantom Menace</em> trailer arriving online, here are the top five moments that still make me think, <em>Hot damn, this movie is going to be absolutely sick, Star Wars is so back, baby, hell yeah!!!!</em>, despite knowing that it is not exactly a perfect movie.</p>

<p id="pwfJiR">I will never age as long as the <em>Phantom Menace</em> trailer is watchable with the click of a button. When the 20th Century Fox logo pops up in silence at the beginning of the trailer, I am a child in a dark movie theater, barely breathing. That logo <em>is</em> Star Wars to my brain, with an additional hit of dopamine arriving when Lucasfilm’s logo sparkles onto the screen a second later. Ah, to be young and alive at a time when getting fired up over a corporate logo was not only acceptable, but welcome! I still hold a grudge against Disney for acquiring Fox and opening <em>The Force Awakens</em> with just the Lucasfilm logo — at the end of the day, I am now a grumbly adult.</p>

<p id="UsqmI3">There’s no reason to debate the quality of <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, but… the podracing sequence is unimpeachable. The first taste we get of the No. 1 best action sequence in all of the Star Wars movies (fight me) is from Anakin’s POV — a complete adrenaline rush as John Williams’ theme kicks in. The other images race by like scenery witnessed out the side window. Truly, I had no memory of how many times we see Jar Jar doing Jar Jar shit in the trailer, because it’s cut like the podrace. Spectacular. </p>

Retro enthusiasts also have a bigger selection of sleek emulation machines to choose from, including a handful of new devices with impressive specs and beautiful designs. </p><p>First-up is the Odin 2 Mini. Announced last week by Chinese manufacturer Ayn, it’s the more compact version of the company’s popular Android handheld. It sports a Snapdragon 8 Gen2 Processor and mini-LED touch display, perfect for streaming games and comfortably emulating up through the PlayStation 2 and Wii-ears.  The battery is smaller, but that might be worth it for fans of the PlayStation Vita-style handheld that still mourn Sony turning its back on portable gaming. The white version looks especially crisp. The price is steep at $340 but the first run has already sold-out. </p><p>Then there’s the AYANEO Pocket Micro, an homage to the tiny Nintendo handheld of the same name. In addition to the D-pad and face buttons, there are also two analog sticks. Slightly bigger than its spiritual predecessor, AYANEO is promising resolution that’s four times better than the Game Boy Advance with a screen that won’t make retro games look stretched. I love the minimalist design and horizontal form factor. There’s no price or release date, but more information is set to be announced later this year.</p><p>Finally, we have the AYANEO Pocket DMG, a clear competitor to the popular <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/analogue-pocket-the-kotaku-review-1848204961&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/analogue-pocket-the-kotaku-review-1848204961">Analogue Pocket</a></span> which plays original Game Boy and Game Boy Advance cartridges directly rather than emulating them. The Pocket DMG will feature a 1240 x 1080-pixel OLED screen and an analog stick near the bottom that’s mounted on a touch pad. The more jumbled layout isn’t as aesthetically pleasing as its Analogue counter-part but it should give the Pocket DMG more flexibility for the kinds of games players can emulate on it. AYANEO hasn’t yet confirmed if it will also be running Android. </p><p>Nobody needs any of these handhelds but I still want them all. It’s great to see manufacturers exploring the more luxury end of the market the same way certain boutique firms have been putting together prettier and pricier Kindle competitors over the years. When it comes to emulation, handhelds like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-4-handheld&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-4-handheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retroid Pocket 4</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-4-handheld&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-4-handheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mechdiy.com/products/miyoo-mini-plus-retro-handheld-game-console&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mechdiy.com/products/miyoo-mini-plus-retro-handheld-game-console" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIYOO Mini Plus Portable</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://anbernic.com/products/rg405m&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg405m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ANBERNIC RG405M</a></span> each offer a different mix of specs, firmware, and form factor for retro nerds to experiment and fall in love with. </p><p>None of them can compete pound-for-pound with the power and flexibility of a Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally, but then that’s not the point of spending $300 to play esoteric RPGs from the early 2000s like <em>Riviera: The Promised Land </em>on a mega-powered Game Boy from an alternate future. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > SHIFT UP [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/shift-up">SHIFT UP</a> is exploring the possibility of both a <a title="Platforms > PC [20,103 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> version of <em><a title="Games > Stellar Blade [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a></em> and a sequel, in addition to its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/04/shift-up-hiring-for-aaa-urban-sci-fi-action-rpg-for-console-pc-and-mobile">previously confirmed</a> cross-platform project newly code-named <em>Project Witches</em>, the studio revealed in its <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20240520000263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial public offering filing</a> on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index. <span id="more-883615"></span></p><p>According to the filing, <em>Project Witches</em> is currently in the early stages of development with plans to launch globally across console, PC, and mobile with cross-play in 2027 or later. It is described as SHIFT UP’s “next-generation mega subculture [intellectual property] that will surpass <em>Goddess of Victory: NIKKE</em>,” with examples of “subculture [intellectual property]” being games like <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [114 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, and <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, and <em><a title="Series > Fate [59 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>/Grand Order</em>. SHIFT UP hopes to ramp up development in 2024 by attracting new hires.</p><p>As for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, plans for a PC version and a sequel are listed as under consideration, with a release date not yet determined.</p><p>“Beyond <em>Stellar Blade</em>, we are developing a new [intellectual property]-based game, <em>Project Witches</em>, for release in 2027 or later, and are considering a PC version of <em>Stellar Blade</em> and a sequel,” reads the document (translated from Korean via DeepL). “We believe that our ability to develop new [intellectual properties] that can be successful without relying on existing [intellectual properties] will enable us to grow sustainably compared to other game companies that are locked into existing [intellectual properties].”</p><p>Elsewhere in the document, the potential PC release is mentioned once again, as well as plans for post-launch updates and downloadable content.</p><p>The document reads, “For <em>Stellar Blade</em>, we have plans to introduce new gameplay elements, including downloadable content releases, a PC version, and new [intellectual property] collaborations. Meanwhile, the company’s global one-build approach allows for simultaneous global updates to ensure a consistent game experience for users and rapid deployment of content at a low cost.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Later on it reads, “AAA console titles such as <em><a title="Games > God of War (2018) [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a></em> and <em><a title="Series > Final Fantasy [130 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> have shown tremendous potential, selling over [66 million copies and 185 million] respectively. There are many precedents for AAA titles to evolve into [intellectual property] franchises by extending their lifespan through a series of high-quality sequels and maintaining a long-term monetization base. As a result, we are exploring the possibility of a PC version of <em>Stellar Blade</em> and a sequel.”</p><p><em>Stellar Blade</em> launched for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,035 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> on April 26, and is published by <a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [4,837 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - Official Season 4 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Season 4 artwork also includes the tagline: "A harrowing discovery can change everything," and there's a DNA emoji that follows it. This could mean that Soap did in fact die in the campaign, but there could be a really creepy cloning storyline for this postseason content.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also the possibility of this artwork being related to Zombies, as Soap is alive in Modern Warfare 3's Zombies storyline. Soap is currently working alongside Kate Laswell and other members of a CIA strike team for Operation Deadbolt, which aims to stop the zombie outbreak in Urzikstan. The newly released <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1792585919867781277" rel="nofollow ">Season 4 teaser trailer</a> shown above does reveal that the story is about stopping the contamination of a new global threat, but it's uncertain if the weaponized device is using something related to Zombies or just a deadly gas.</p><p dir="ltr">The operators featured on Call of Duty's promotional art are usually the characters featured in the seasonal battle pass, so players can likely expect to unlock this new version of Soap when Season 4 arrives.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on what to expect, here are all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-4-release-date-and-details/1100-6523547/">big rumors and announcements for Season 4</a> of MW3 and Warzone, including a Gundam crossover and the return of the Kar98k rifle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indie-games-pc-2024-may-hades-2-little-kitty-1000xresist-manor-lords<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My last couple of weeks have probably been much the same as yours: a succession of people asking you "hey, did you play [game], it's a surprise GOTY contender!", to which I have to say "no, sorry bud, I was too busy playing [other game], which has also come out of nowhere to be a potential GOTY candidate". There are only so many hours in the day a human being can be doing stuff!</p><p>This unexpectedly bumper spring has (so far) blessed us with<a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-early-access-impressions-review-supergiant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Hades 2</em></a>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/little-kitty-big-city-cat-game-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Little Kitty Big City</em></a>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/crow-country-review-indie-survival-horror-game-lowfi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Crow Country</em></a>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Manor Lords</em></a>, <em>1000xRESIST</em>, <em>Animal Well</em> and <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-tips-steam-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a></em>. All these games rule, all of them dropped within a few weeks of each other, and I'm going to be honest here and say I hadn't even <em>heard </em>of half these before they came out, let alone got excited enough to look forward to them.</p><p>But they're here, and we're suffering. In May 2024 there are simply too many good video games to play and talk about. Which is a little frustrating for <em>me</em>, someone who has spent almost 20 years working thousands of miles away from colleagues in his own home! One thing I love about online communities--and "things I love about online communities" is a very short list--is when we can all come together to passionately talk about how much we love one very specific thing. Some of my fondest memories as a remote writer at Kotaku were when everyone on staff was playing <em>Persona 5</em>, or <em>The Witcher 3</em>, or <em>Zelda </em>at the same time. Sharing those experiences was the closest I ever got to talking around a water cooler!</p><p>There's no way in hell that's happening any time soon, because most of us can't find the time to play even half these games, let alone all settle on the same one. All of us haven't even caught up on 2024's previous must-plays, from <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Infinite Wealth</em></a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/balatro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Balatro</em></a><em> </em>to <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/dragons-dogma-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon's Dogma II</em></a> to<a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-psn-login-steam-review-bomb-arrowhead-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>. And it's only May, what the fuck! I honestly don't remember a time in video games quite like this, where we've been so swamped with so many excellent video games, each worthy of our time and discussion, and so many of them have just come out of <em>nowhere</em>.</p><p>(If you're reading some of these game names and thinking "huh you guys haven't even written about some of these yet", yes, that's my point!)</p><p>Of course it's not <em>actually </em>a problem. This is an exciting time for video games in terms of the games we're playing. It's also a glimmer of hope for what the future of the medium could look like.<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The last couple of years have felt like nothing but doom and gloom</a>, a never-ending procession of layoffs, depraved AAA budgets,<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-sony-helldivers-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> idiotic platform holders and greedy publishers</a>. If that kind of bad news is the only video game news you read, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the sky was slowly falling, that we might even be in for some kind of repeat of the great<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Video Game Crash Of '83</a>.</p><p>You'd be wrong, of course. You can't kill<em> video games</em>. Parts of it may die off, but other parts will evolve and endure. The industry might be struggling, but the medium is going strong. The last month has felt like a glimpse of what a possible (I'm sorry) aftermath to a second great video game crisis might look like. Most of the games I've mentioned above are small in comparison to their bloated AAA counterparts. They're mostly available on PC, mostly insulated from the whims of large publishers and platform holders.</p><p>Most importantly, though, all these games we've been getting excited about are just video games. The people making them wanted to make a game, release it to the world, hope people enjoyed (and paid) for it and...that was that. None of these are live-service games, they're not chasing online trends or in-game economies, they're not trying to attract esports investment. They're all just cool and interesting video games that have come from the heart.</p><p>The fact there have been so many of them this month--and so many people loving them to the point so many of them are front-and-centre in their discussions--is <em>wonderful</em>. If there's one thing I'm going to cling to for the rest of the year as a bright spot for video games, it's going to be this.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/20/galacticare-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You know Theme Hospital and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/30/two-point-hospital-review/">Two Point Hospital</a>? Well, what if you made a hospital management game a lot like those management sim classics, but shot it up into the one place that hasn’t been corrupted by capitalism? Space! That’s Galacticare in a (space) nutshell.</p>
<p><iframe title="Galacticare Release Trailer | Launching May 23" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M09LcfXv7XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, space healthcare is really just a vast expanse for capitalism to exploit and your goal as the administrator of a series of Galacticare space stations is to build them up into effective and profitable healthcare institutions. There’s a decently lengthy campaign to progress through, with a sequence of story missions to beat and some pure sandbox maps alongside. It starts off in Earth’s orbit, takes you to provide for Burning Moon music festival, has you tend to a gigantic space farm, a space prison full of clones, and more.</p>


<p>As you’d expect from this corner of the management sim genre, there’s all manner of weird and wonderful diseases that you’ll encounter, including ones that turn people into star fields, give them metal craniums, a bit of jellification, and on and on. Treating them? Well, the Boning Chamber is there to use an industrial robot dog to gobble up and recombine patient with new bones, there’s lasers, giant guns, skin generating tanks, and on and on.</p>
<p>It’s all laced with a pleasing sense of humour, very much in keeping with its inspirations, and that’s aided by the narrative and characters. From the computer’s put downs of the janitor bot, to the quirky alien inflections, and the Matt Berry-adjacent rival CEO, each scenario is given a lot of flavour by these characters. That, and the wonderful evolving space backdrops that you should absolutely keep an eye on as you work through a stage.</p>


<p>The fundamentals of hospital management will be immediately familiar, as you put reception by the entrance, then fill the rest of the space with a growing range of treatment rooms, seating and items to fulfil patient wants and needs. And there’s a lot of wants and needs, as each race has particular desires.</p>
<p>The Tenki want to see high-tech upgraded rooms, the Dyonai want flora and fauna, the Vizarj desire windows and toilets – so I put toilets right next to windows looking into rooms – while us plain old humans want to see… cupboards, lockers, trolleys and posters. In general, you need to keep the place tidy, make sure there’s enough seating, doctor break rooms, vending machines and so on.</p>

<p>It might seem like that’s a lot to juggle, but really all of these demands are complimentary with one another, so you can very quickly rattle through and comply with all of these demands in a slap dash fashion or with your own room templates – it could have been interesting for human patients to be a little grossed out by alien decorations, for example, but letting you have a clumsy hodgepodge of decorations ensures it’s fast and accessible.&nbsp;It’s the room upgrades that take a while to acquire, as they rely on crafting holograms with a special currency, or buying them from the space whale trader called Baz.</p>
<p>There’s also not a huge amount of depth to the doctors you employ. Each has two perks and one con, which might shape your hiring when one is much more likely to kill a patient and blow up a room, but aside from that, there’s a simple room-based specialisation to choose and then basic levelling up after that point. Training rooms can be used to accelerate their levelling, but it’s really just about matching doctors to their specialism to ensure they’re working as efficiently as possible. There’s more nuance to the named consultant characters, unlocked through the story and with perk trees that boost their influence to your hospital.</p>
<p>There’s some neat touches to the care that each condition needs in Galacticare. While some will have a straight path from diagnosis room to a relevant treatment room, others (and particularly those that feature as mission objectives) have chains of treatment that put more demands on your hospital layout, waiting areas and capacity. It’s a somewhat more straightforward take on Two Point Hospital bouncing patients between different diagnosis rooms. It also helps to make all of the treatment rooms more multi-purpose, beyond the illness they were first introduced for.</p>

<p>You can funnel your treatment path through more than just canny room placement. Rooms can have be set with illnesses to prioritise, patients can be marked as priority, and through this you can optimise your hospital performance quite handily. At the same time, you can kind of just go with the flow, do the fundamentals decently well, and get past the tipping point of profitability to enable you to quickly open up a whole new wing, adding capacity at the cost of an influx of less specialised doctors.</p>
<p>It all adds up to a hospital management sim that’s a shade easier to grasp the depths of, that’s a little more accessible. You can happily set the game to fast forward as your cash pools fill up for the next big expansion, dipping in to squish space bugs for rewards and to avoid mess, or to grab freebies from Baz when he appears like a curious whale off the side of your station. Perhaps the biggest difficulty I’ve run into is keeping corridor congestion down – something the Kouber Baly desire – needing to have enough diagnostics rooms to keep up, and emphasising the mission critical treatment rooms a level needs.</p>

<p>Beginning May 21st, the collaborative event between Moonstone Island and Cassette Beasts will commence, introducing new content to both games. Cassette Beasts will feature Moonstone Island-inspired costumes, while Moonstone Island will habe the addition of Cassette Beasts’ Pombomb to its Spirit roster.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/26/cassette-beasts-review/">Cassette Beasts Review</a></h2>
<p>For our Cassette Beasts review, Nic said, <em>“Cassette Beasts is simply one of the best Pokémon-like games I’ve come across, and I’m looking forward to earning a 100% completion. With a massive end-game and modder support built in at release though, I feel like I’m going to get very sidetracked on the way there.”</em></p>

		<p>Please pray for me. The weather is beginning to turn a little warm here, so I turned on the AC for the first time, and it's making a loud noise. A loud noise might not be a big deal! A loud noise <em>could</em> be a big deal! I just looked up how much it costs for the most catastrophic scenario of an AC unit replacement, and I want to scream into a pillow. Here's hoping it's just a minor fix, and we're all on our (cold) way.</p><p>-pk, who's hoping yearly maintenance of the damn thing pays off</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY:</strong> You can here me chatting with Deconstructeam's Jordi de Paco, which was a wonderful chat that first premiered at this year's LudoNarraCon. All of our LudoNarraCon collaborations will be part of the podcast feed in the weeks ahead on the public feed. In a few hours, there will also be a YouTube VOD of our LudoNarraCon demo showcase. </li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>Janet, Rob, and Cado get back together for a third (and likely final?) Manor Lords stream. They'll remember to think about food this time, right? RIGHT?</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>Rob and Patrick were both smitten with the <em>Fallout </em>TV show, so while it does not involve samurai, sadly, we're going to record a podcast about one of the most successful video game adaptations yet. That'll drop next week.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>Remap Radio returns, and I can talk about <em>Hellblade II</em>.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Remap Radio is published, and Cado and I will tackle another wave of tricky sphinx riddles.</li><li><strong>ALL WEEK: </strong>We'll be publishing a few articles this week, including a new banger from Duncan Fyfe, but we're still working out the publishing schedule. I suspect Cado will be streaming some more <em>Balatro</em>, too.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em>support@remapradio.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Medieval Iceland awaits Senua in Hellblade 2. The new launch trailer for the sequel showcases the striking vistas that will be explored in the game, as well as bloody battles with swords and even a tornado ripping across the land.</p><p dir="ltr">The video--seen below--features "Animal Soul" by Norwegian songwriter Aurora, giving the launch trailer the vibes of a music video. The song also does a good job conveying the horrors and beauty players will likely encounter in Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2. We see the earth literally being ripped up from the ground at one point. Then, later, a serene landscape is spotlighted, with snow-covered mountains, a waterfall, and the ocean.</p>

That's where strategic media and influencer partnerships come in. They can be your megaphone, amplifying your game's unique voice and reaching players who are genuinely excited about what you've created.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team here at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reverbinc.com/">Reverb Communications</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has put together a few guidelines to help maximize your outreach efforts.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Identify what makes your game special.">Identify what makes your game special.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before you start pitching, it's crucial to understand where your game fits in the market. Knowing your game's niche will help you target the right media and influencers. Every game has something – a hook, a twist, or a unique feature set. Otherwise it wouldn’t exist! Identifying these Unique Selling Points (USPs) is foundational to your outreach strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Think about what sets your game apart. Is it the art, gameplay mechanics, story, characters, late 90s aesthetic, or something else entirely? Look at successful games in your genre and see how they positioned themselves. Once you've pinpointed your USPs, craft clear, concise messages that highlight them. Bigfry Media does a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124100/Transience/">fantastic job</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> outlining the key features of Transience, the studio’s upcoming indie FPS title.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Create a media kit.">Create a media kit.</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/embrace-the-chaos-how-indie-devs-can-thrive-in-a-changing-and-challenging-market" target="_self">Embrace the Chaos: How Indie Devs Can Thrive in a Changing and Challenging Market</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Think of your media kit as a trusty pocket knife. It's a one-stop shop for everything a journalist or influencer needs to write a story or create content. Typically hosted on file sharing sites like Dropbox or Google Drive, a media kit at minimum should include:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>One-pager:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> A brief overview of the game, hitting the key points and USPs.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Key Art and Screenshots:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Visually showcase your game's style and personality.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Developer Background Info:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This is your opportunity to showcase your bonafides.

A great example is the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://rogueco.com/kits/">press kit site</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from Rogue Games where you’ll find complete asset sets for each of their titles.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Research your targets.">Research your targets.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Make a list of media outlets and creators that cover your game's genre and cater to your target audience. This includes big names like IGN and Gamespot, as well as smaller, niche sites or blogs. Once you have your list, get to know the journalists who write for those outlets. Read their articles, watch their videos, and check out their social media. This will help you tailor your pitches and make genuine connections. Say you’re developing an MMO, here’s how your spreadsheet might look:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Identify the right influencers.">Identify the right influencers.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Influencers are like the cool kids in school – they have a following and people listen to them. Look for influencers who create content relevant to your game's genre and have an engaged audience. Check their average viewership on Twitch or YouTube, and make sure they're consistently posting new content. Tools like Social Blade and Lurkit can help you find potential influencers, but there's no substitute for good old-fashioned research. Watch streams, browse channels, and see who's talking about games like yours.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Build actual relationships.">Build actual relationships.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't just spam targets with generic pitches. Take the time to build real relationships. Follow them on social media, interact with their content, and show genuine interest in their work. When you finally reach out, personalize your pitch and reference something specific they've worked on. Remember, this is the start of a relationship, not a one-off transaction. Be flexible, offer value, and be patient.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Write a good (aka short) pitch.">Write a good (aka short) pitch.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Keep your pitches short, sweet, and to the point. Highlight your game's USPs and explain why it's a good fit for their audience. Reference something specific they've done that made you think of them. And don't be afraid to show your personality – a little humor or a personal touch can go a long way. Here’s an example of an organic pitch that worked for Reverb’s influencer team recently (names have been changed):</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hey NAME,</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We are working on a game called Legendary Hero which is a survival game where players must survive, craft, create and fight to achieve glory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We know you promote chill vibes and good times so we think the next time you want to try a survival title you would enjoy playing Legendary Hero. It’s set to launch onto Steam on March 21st.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We will have keys available closer to launch. The game will have Twitch drops activated at release, and we also want to offer you 48-hour early access with no embargo so you can be one of the first people to get into the full game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you were interested in more information on Legendary Hero, I've included a link to the YouTube trailer below. Thanks for your time and let me know if you are interested in Legendary Hero.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Consider all options.">Consider all options.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Reach out to influencers on various platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Twitter. Coordinate your messaging across these platforms for a consistent brand voice, but tailor the content to each platform's strengths. For example, a Twitch stream might focus on beta gameplay, while a Twitter thread could highlight behind-the-scenes development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A no is actually a yes.">A no is actually a yes.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Success isn't just about getting a "yes" – it's about learning and improving. Track your pitch responses, analyze which ones worked best, and adapt your strategy accordingly. If you're not getting the results you want, don't be discouraged. Use feedback from media and influencers to refine your pitch, messaging, or even your game itself. Happy Hunting!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="366" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the most important things in <em>Attack on Titan Revolution</em> is your Family, which chooses what family-specific perks you receive. The Family you get is completely random, and you must use a spin to randomly roll a new one any time you want to change. Here are all of the <em>Attack on Titan Revolution</em> Family Perks so you know which families are worth trying to roll.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-all-attack-on-titan-revolution-family-perks" data-injectable="false">All <em>Attack on Titan</em> <em>Revolution </em>Family Perks</h2> <p data-characters="702" data-current-count="1002" data-injectable="true">Also known as <em>Attack on Titan Revolution</em> Clan Perks, these perks offer buffs and even skills and abilities to your character based on the Family you are in. There are four Family rarities at the moment: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Unfortunately, Common families don’t offer any sort of perks, while Rare families will grant you a small buff or two as well as potentially a skill. Epic families are guaranteed one skill and 3-5 larger buffs. Finally, the ever-elusive Legendary families provide you with up to three skills, lots of useful buffs, and even some added passives and abilities depending on the family. Here are all <em>Attack on Titan Revolution</em> Family Perks currently in the game:</p>

<p>The seven-year wait for&nbsp;<em>Hellbade 2&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-global-launch-timings">almost over</a>, and in a <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792571130651312154" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Ninja Theory details the game's accessibility settings across audio, gameplay, graphics, and various other areas of the game.</p>

			<p>The popular vampire-themed survival-RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/v-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V Rising</a> had its full release (following a lengthy early access period) on PC earlier this month, and thankfully, console players won’t have to wait soon to sink their teeth into the game. Today it was announced that V Rising will be launching on PS5 (this one isn’t coming to Xbox for now) in June. You can check out a new PS5 trailer for V Rising, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="V Rising - Date Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IjEw901V7JE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007965/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders for the PS5 version of V Rising are open now</a>, with the standard edition of the game costing $40. You can also grab the $60 Castlevania Edition, which includes the recently-released Castlevania DLC, or the $100 Complete Edition which includes all DLC and cosmetics released to date. Those who pre-order any version of the game will get a 10 percent discount.</p>
<p>Haven’t been keeping up with V Rising? Wccftech’s Francesco De Meo found the full version of the game to be a bloody good time <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/v-rising-bloody-yet-fun-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his review</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Enriched by many additions, including endgame activities that promise to challenge even veteran players' knowledge of the mechanics and fighting skills, the 1.0 version of V Rising is the culmination of two years of hard work. The number of options and activities the game offers to those willing to delve deep into its complex yet satisfying mechanics make for a survival game like few others on the market.</em></p>
<p><em>V Rising may not have the deepest survival game mechanics around, but that is hardly a problem. The experience crafted by Stunlock Studios manages to masterfully weave together mechanics from very different genres to provide an experience like any other on the market. While solo players may find the experience becomes a little stale over time, everyone else will find plenty of reasons to remain in this world, whether it's to perfect their characters or build the most haunting vampire castle ever seen.”</em></p>
<p>V Rising can be played on PC. The game launches on PS5 on June 11. Castlevania and Complete Edition buyers will be able to access the game five days early on June 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Stories 2 Preview: Hands-on With the PlayStation 4 Port]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-2-preview-hands-on-with-playstation-4-port</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-stories-2-preview-hands-on-with-the-playstation-4-port.876234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-2-preview-hands-on-with-playstation-4-port<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following its success on Nintendo Switch and PC a few years ago, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin</em> is at last making itself known on PlayStation platforms. Releasing for PlayStation 4 on June 14 alongside a remastered version of the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-preview-exploring-ps4-remaster"><em>Monster Hunter Stories</em></a>, Capcom is ready to bring the JRPG series to a whole new audience with both games in the series hitting at once.</p>

<p>As we did with the remastered <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>, we had some time to sit down with the PlayStation release of <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> and see just how it ended up working out on Sony’s machine. As this was also my chance to experience the game for the first time, having missed it before its original release, I wanted to take my time and dig into this fairly recent sequel.</p>

<p>From the outset<em>, Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> provides a massive jump across the board from its predecessor. From the opening cutscene, it’s obvious that unshackled from the constraints of a handheld platform, the game is being allowed to flourish.</p>

<p>The visuals are a huge step up – offering high-quality models, environments, and effects that showcase the anime <em>Monster Hunter</em> style taken to modern heights. The cel-shaded style is clean, and the overall direction gave me the impression that this RPG was going to be something big.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518224406_0.jpg?itok=5eDzlgG2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518224406_0.jpg?itok=8s2lWKlB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
As with <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>, <em>Stories 2</em> opens its narrative with the disappearance of the Rathalos, but this time on a much bigger scale. Right away, several characters come into view as you’re tasked with creating one of your own who happens to be descended from a legendary Rider known as Red.</p>

<p>Without diving too much into spoiler territory (and because we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-stories-2-review">original release</a> a few years ago), the story seems to be a lot more mature – focusing on characters that are more mature, and the grand adventures framed by the opening hours keep at an exciting pace.</p>

<p>Character creation goes further in-depth compared to the previous game, with added options for each feature of whichever body type you choose. One thing in particular I liked was the ability to add two different hair tones depending on the style I picked. It’s a small detail, but it goes a long way towards adding some personal customizations.</p>

<p>From there, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> eases you into its systems. Your character, who is basically the protagonist and a newly minted Rider, then gets shown the ropes by a girl named Kayna who acts as a teacher of sorts. Said ropes include showing off the Velocidrome monsties, as well as basic tutorials to ease you into the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518223837.jpg?itok=zNw4DXJ_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518223837.jpg?itok=XJ6emBZW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
After playing through a bit of <em>Stories</em>, I was glad to see <em>Stories 2</em> puts you into the action a lot quicker. There’s far less exposition and more – here’s the world, get on your mount and get going attitude going on.</p>

<p>Outside of the village, the world opens up with larger zones, and plenty of enemies on the field and it’s there you can gather items or fight your way through to more experience.</p>

<p>The turn-based battle system from <em>Stories</em> is largely back in play here as well, although it adds a few mix-ups of its own to keep things fresh in its Rock Paper Scissors-inspired encounters whilst using Power, Strength, and Technical type attacks selected through the command menu.</p>

<p>This time you can attack different parts of the monsters, and battles are more engaging with the ability to swap out weapons mid-battle using the Skill change option. <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> also adds a Kinship Gauge that fills up so you can perform fancy attacks with your companions.</p>

<p>It’s definitely a more fleshed-out experience, and on PlayStation, runs plenty smooth throughout even when there’s a lot going on on-screen in battles or exploring the colorful world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518231708.jpg?itok=V9DCm9Od 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518231708.jpg?itok=uIcjJXCb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
I played the preview on PlayStation 5 since it’s compatible and didn’t run into any overt issues. The framerate seems solid, the colors are vibrant, and the upscaling to 4K works fine enough given this isn’t a native PS5 release. My only complaint is there is some aliasing present on the edges of the characters – mostly noticeable in hair and things like that, but it’s not a deal breaker.</p>

<p>Similar to the other platforms, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> on PS4 has maintained its multiplayer elements. That means you can play co-op or multiplayer versus battle with other people on the PlayStation Network.</p>

<p>Co-op quests are of note because there are areas only accessible via multiplayer, and it’s here you’ll be able to encounter exclusive monsters and collect monster eggs – which is a key component of the gameplay loop and monstie customization.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> on PlayStation feels like a solid effort. It’s a clean port with everything present in the original releases and does well to run smoothly on the current generation platform. Having come from playing the original <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> back-to-back, the upgrade here is immense, and the effort in direction and crafting a bigger world can’t be understated.</p>

<p>What’s more, you could probably pick up <em>Stories 2</em> and get into it just fine on its own, so it does have strength as a standalone title despite its sequel status. Either way, it wouldn’t exactly be a bad jumping-in point if you’re new to the series like me, or if you just want to check out a traditional JRPG you can do just that when it launches on June 14.</p>

  <p id="wkMe26">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/multiversus-guides"><em>MultiVersus</em></a> roster is expanding again, this time with two big bad guys: Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th horror franchise and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22842967/agent-smith-matrix-resurrections-trilogy-sequels-casting-mission">Agent Smith</a> from the Matrix films. Those two villains will join a pair of recently confirmed additions to <em>MultiVersus</em>: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155348/multiversus-joker-gameplay-mark-hamill-powerpuff-girls">the Joker</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT1zXiYqcfA"><em>Adventure Time</em>’s Banana Guard</a>. </p>
<p id="rXHsm9">Developer Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games confirmed Jason and Agent Smith in a new cinematic trailer hyping up the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23933735/multiversus-announcement-relaunch-release-date-warner-bros">impending relaunch of <em>MultiVersus</em></a>. And if you comb through Monday’s new <em>MultiVersus</em> trailer, you might spot teases for a few more unannounced characters. At one point (about 50 seconds in), we see Bugs Bunny crack open the Warner Bros. water tower, from which a few props escape. Those items appear to be Aquaman’s trident, Samurai Jack’s katana, and Octi, the beloved plush octopus of Bubbles from <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em>. There’s also a broomstick, which could belong to the Wicked Witch of the West from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> or someone from the Harry Potter franchise.</p>
<p id="Cr70Yk">There are also background references to DC superheroes Green Lantern, Robin in his <em>Teen Titans Go!</em> form, and Raven, though it’s unclear if those are teases or simply stage dressing.</p>

<p>It was recently revealed that Stellar Blade’s developer, ShiftUp, is considering a PC version of the game – as well as a sequel. In a report published on a South Korean website (and shared <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1792567131374031009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by KAMI on Twitter</a>), it’s detailed that ShiftUp will continue to expand and plans to release a new game every two or three years. Currently, the studio is working on a new IP called Project Witches which will be a cross-platform game spread between mobile, PC, and console platforms. </p>

<h2 id="h-stellar-delivery">Stellar Delivery</h2>



<p>It has been reported that Stellar Blade is ‘exceeding expectations’ where sales are concerned. In certain regions, the game has sat at the top of the charts since being released exclusively on PlayStation 5 on April 26. This at-times controversial post-apocalyptic slasher has enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame in recent weeks, something that has really put ShiftUp on the map.</p>



<p>Like other PlayStation-exclusive games, fans have been requesting that Stellar Blade makes its way onto PC – and ShiftUp is at least considering that concept. Most recently, Ghost of Tsushima hit Steam and racked up big numbers despite having some niggling issues.</p>



<p>There’s a drive at ShiftUp to bolster the team and hire more developers as the fresh projects surface over time. It isn’t just new games, though – ShiftUp reportedly wants to secure existing IP and buy out some brands. It just hasn’t been confirmed <strong>what</strong>.</p>
