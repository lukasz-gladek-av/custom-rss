            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its financial report for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the company is doing very well indeed, bolstered by the major success of the latest entry in one of its biggest franchises.</p>

<p>Last year, Capcom celebrated its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-financials-2024-record-profits" rel="nofollow">seventh straight year of record profits</a>, and according to the studio's latest results <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250513b.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">summary</a>, it can now roll that figure over to eight, as both profits and net sales hit record highs this year.</p>

<p>According to Capcom, net sales jumped by 11.3% compared to last year, while operating income is up by 15.2%. As you'd probably expect if you've been following Capcom's progress this year, it's mainly&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>the studio has to thank for that success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/capcom-monster-hunter-wilds-mizutsune.jpg?itok=9SNbtu18 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/capcom-monster-hunter-wilds-mizutsune.jpg?itok=qv1tz4S- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has given Capcom its eighth straight year of record profits.</figcaption></figure><p>Released in February,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">broke Steam player records</a> for Capcom at launch, hitting 1.2 million players within just a few hours of its release. The game went on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">eight million copies</a>&nbsp;within three days, hitting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">ten million mark</a> by the end of March.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>, Capcom says its performance this year was also helped by "strong catalog title sales" in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series across the board, suggesting that <em>Wilds</em><em>&nbsp;</em>also bolstered the sales for past entries like&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>.</p>

<p>Although Capcom doesn't specifically mention it in the report, it's also important not to forget&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>; latest entry <i>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">broke the ten million sales mark last month</a>, and other entries in the franchise aren't doing too badly for Capcom either.</p>

<p>The company also credits its booming pachislo business, including units based on&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, with this aspect of the Japanese studio's operations enjoying "increasing unit sales volume".</p>

This is a vast game of exploring planets, combined with a solid sci-fi storyline told to you as you progress, all presented in super-lo-fi graphics that allow everything to feel significantly more organic.</p><p>Much of the story of <em>Miro</em>—who you are, why you’re there—is told to you as you get deeper in, so to offer a pithy summary would actually be quite a spoiler. But it’s safe to say that the MIRO is a scientific space vessel dedicated, at least at one time, to exploring distant worlds. Now you find yourself alone on board, most of the doors locked, being given instructions by an unidentified voice and equipped with the ability to take a shuttle down to the surface of a range of different planets.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195189" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="212" data-playlist="195189,196742,195579" data-current="195189"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20647.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Each planet is procedurally generated, including–it seems–the core storyline planets, populated by the most bizarre mixes of flora and fauna. Plants can often seem alien, but at other times look like Earthly deciduous trees. The animals, meanwhile, are all instantly recognisable, given they’re a bemusing mix of all manner of dinosaurs, rhinos, alligators, deer, bears, butterflies, komodo dragons, and many more. Why are so many Earth animals here? Why are so many of them from so many different points in history? And why are you stumbling upon abandoned buildings, long-broken satellite dishes, fallen-down bridges, and even ruined cities?</p><figure id="" data-id="48c60514813f9665eee88e244bc8b438" data-recommend-id="image://48c60514813f9665eee88e244bc8b438" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A long-necked dino sands near a satellite dish." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A long-necked dino sands near a satellite dish." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lost Saved Data_ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="48c60514813f9665eee88e244bc8b438" data-recommend-id="image://48c60514813f9665eee88e244bc8b438" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A long-necked dino sands near a satellite dish." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, figuring all that out is the story, and it’s a neat one! Actually playing the game, however, is far more about exploration and the gathering of resources. Here, imagine a space-bound <em>Subnautica</em>, or given the cube-like nature of most resources, that replicator in <em>Prey</em>, where all the items you gather can be taken back to the MIRO, and then used by a machine to replicate new items, bandages, and most importantly, improvements to your suit and tools.</p><div><h4><strong>Buried Treasure Indie Game Reviews</strong></h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

Exploration on planets by foot is pretty slow work, especially given the enormous size of each explorable area, so getting a hoverbike working is pretty essential. That requires gathering enough of the right resources, and then figuring out combinations of them all in the Science Terminal to tweak everything to perfection. (Forget double-jump, I currently have sextuple-jump.) After a good few hours, I’m now flinging myself around the surfaces of planets with my bike, my jumping abilities, and my splendid grapple.</p><figure id="" data-id="46fec639a7b690b8c824487a2485a1e9" data-recommend-id="image://46fec639a7b690b8c824487a2485a1e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The landing shuttle, next to some purple trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The landing shuttle, next to some purple trees." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lost Saved Data_ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46fec639a7b690b8c824487a2485a1e9" data-recommend-id="image://46fec639a7b690b8c824487a2485a1e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The landing shuttle, next to some purple trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What works so well here is that despite <em>MIRO </em>telling in many ways a narrative-led linear story, the way you play it is so extraordinarily open. I’ve often found myself deliberately landing on a new planet just so I can spend an hour roaming around, finding many of the key locations, hoovering up resources, and staring in astonishment at the size of a new species of dino, even though I had no core goals in mind. It’s relaxing, in the way that <em>NMS</em> used to be, plus I’m always grateful for the extra piles of useful stuff I return with. There is an ending, and it’s a satisfying conclusion to a good story, but don’t feel compelled to rush toward it.</p><p>I should say, I’ve had a fair few glitches. However, rather crucially, when I’ve reported progression-impeding bugs to developer Lost Saved Data_, it’s had a patched version up within hours.</p><figure id="" data-id="0abf60e1d4f5bae5e713167a418011be" data-recommend-id="image://0abf60e1d4f5bae5e713167a418011be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Riding the bike, looking down at a ruined city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Riding the bike, looking down at a ruined city." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lost Saved Data_ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0abf60e1d4f5bae5e713167a418011be" data-recommend-id="image://0abf60e1d4f5bae5e713167a418011be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Riding the bike, looking down at a ruined city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>An open-world <em>Proteus</em> is quite the selling point on its own, but <em>Miro</em> is so much more with its story, crafting, and ever-more powerful means of perambulation. This is the work of three people, and it’s unquestionably crude around the edges. But I’ve had such a splendid time playing it, merrily wiling away hours just poking around on planets, even if it’s to meticulously open every cargo container in a large, abandoned storage facility out of sheer completism. With its proc-gen planets, every location looks different, and while the creatures are all pre-made, there’s so much variety that even by the end I was seeing animals I’d not encountered before.</p><p>Keep things in perspective: this obviously <em>isn’t</em>&nbsp;<em>No Man’s Sky</em>. It’s a small indie game with a far more limited scope, and a far greater desire to tell you an interesting tale. (There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2804940/MIRO/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2804940/MIRO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a very generous demo</a></span>, too.) But it’s such a massive achievement, with a wonderful aesthetic (including excellent music), and it entirely entwined me in its compelling loops. I loved it.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2804940/MIRO/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2804940/MIRO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miro <em>is out now on PC via Steam</em></a></span><em> for $15</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To have fully kept up with the best of the best on TV, the outside world would need to be an afterthought. But at least you’d be able to see Wilson Fisk  (Vincent D’Onofrio) break a man’s skull with his hands.</p><p>With so many great TV shows out in 2025, it can be tough to know where to start.

This year, the dystopian anthology drama series explores the terrifying concepts of subscription services for consciousness, having your consciousness trapped in a video game, and more unsettling collisions of humanity and technology. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/issa-rae-black-mirror-hotel-reverie-bad-acting-1851776365&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/issa-rae-black-mirror-hotel-reverie-bad-acting-1851776365">Issa Rae</a></span> delivers an all-time great performance as A-list actress Brandy Friday in the episode “Hotel Reverie,” in which she digitally enters black-and-white movie <em>Hotel Reverie</em> to recreate it with AI programming, only to develop a sentimental connection with her unreal co-star Dorothy (Emma Corrin) that rivals the fan-favorite romance of past <em>Black Mirror </em>episode “San Junipero.” Even though the world’s madness is starting to be stranger than what the show can produce, <em>Black Mirror</em> is still in a class of its own.</p></div><div><p>The most criminally underrated series of the last five years is Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker’s 1960s drama <em>Godfather of Harlem</em>. As drug kingpin and unofficial mayor of Harlem Bumpy Johnson, Whitaker delivers steely stoicism whether staring at a man shot dead or helping his daughter recover from heroin addiction. His captivating performance gives the show the type of verisimilitude that helps transport you to a time when street justice reigned supreme. In the fourth season, Whitaker’s attempt at legitimization hits a snag when the money flow can’t match his ambition for bettering Harlem, and his struggles between doing what’s right and doing what’s effective are a point of compelling tension. Outside of Bumpy Johnson, the show has a constellation of characters that could be the leads of their own  shows. Stella Gigante (Lucy Fry) is surreptitiously developing her own prowess in the criminal underworld, Elise Johnson (Antoinette Crowe-Legacy) gets involved with the Black Panther Party, and Vincent ‘Chin’ Gigante (Vincent D’Onofrio) is trying to maintain his place within the mob. <em>Godfather of Harlem</em> routinely delivers an all-star lineup of incredible actors, and season 4 is one of its best showings. </p></div><div><p><em>Hacks </em>always feels like that one friend you go to when you want to be smacked with the truth and then stunned by the  strangest joke you’ve ever heard right afterwards so the sting feels like a warm embrace. After three award-winning seasons of putting larger-than-life and colder-than-corpses comedian Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) and woke prodigy Ava Daniels (Hannah Einbinder) in an odd couple relationship, the fourth season has them as enemies who must maintain a working relationship or face mutually assured destruction in the form of losing their opportunity at a late-night talk show. The genius of <em>Hacks </em>is in the way the show digs into a joke, seemingly to generate more laughs, only for you to realize it’s peeling back layers you didn’t know were there. For example, Ava engaging in a throuple creates humorous moments like her answering a work call during sex while the other two tend to each other, and being the butt of Deborah’s barrage of “three-way” jokes at dinner. Before you know it, the couple tells her she’s masking her emotionally unavailability as hypersexuality due to unresolved issues with her last breakup. From ageism battles to trauma bonds, <em>Hacks</em> is an incredible series.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-the-penguin-disney-marvel-1851749356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-the-penguin-disney-marvel-1851749356"><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em></a></span> had a lot to live up to. As the first series about Matt Murdock’s costumed crimefighter since Netflix’s series <em>Daredevil </em>ended over six years ago, the Disney+ revival needed to either match or exceed the gritty realism and character depth of the original series. After nine episodes, <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>more than lives up to the hype. Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) is now the mayor of New York City while Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) struggles with his vigilante impulses that have sometimes had lethal consequences. The season started with the sudden and heartbreaking death of Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) and ended with Fisk crushing the police commissioner’s skull with his bare hands in front of his rogue team of cops to establish he was taking over the city by force. At no point did <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> allow you to get comfortable with any sense of normalcy. Matt even jumps in front of a bullet to save Fisk’s life. It’s unquestionably one of the best first seasons in Disney+’s history.</p></div><div><p><em>Common Side Effects</em> is an animated series follows two former lab partners, Marshall Cuso (Dave King) and Frances Applewhite (Emily Pendergast), who discover a mushroom that can cure all diseases, so you can imagine the government cover-ups and Big Pharma conspiracies that  follow. In one scene, the show delves into medical suppression with a surreal “mushroom trip” in which Hildy (Sue Rose) consumes the blue angel mushroom to test its healing powers, only to have a vivid and disturbing vision of her head rapidly aging before exploding into bacteria repeatedly, symbolizing the mushroom’s overwhelming power to reverse death and decay. Through graphic surrealism like this, <em>Common Side Effects</em> unflinchingly explores the tension between the potential benefits of alternative medicine and the profit-centric healthcare. No show on TV in 2025 has been as daring with its messaging or delivery than <em>Common Side Effects</em>.</p></div><div><p>Season 1 of <em>Mo</em>, which focused on Mohammed “Mo” Najjar and his family, was the rare dramedy to tackle a Palestinian family’s displacement trauma, their experiences with cultural and religious differences in relationships, and the hustle of the American dream, all through the lens of strip club panic attacks and treating gunshot wounds with olive oil. The second season takes Mo’s experience as an undocumented immigrant and expands it without losing the homegrown humor. The show takes you inside the inhumane conditions of an ICE detention center where Mo hilariously shows resilience by singing a karaoke rendition of Hank Williams’ “Your Cheatin’ Heart” and, on top of everything else, must put up with a cellmate who inexplicably meows like a cat. The second season doesn’t sugarcoat the truth, especially the history of conflict between Israel and Palestine. But it does expertly show how true resistance involves not letting tragedy define you, and it does so with some of the best comedy writing of the year. </p></div><div><p>Death and sex normally don’t go together on television, but the FX dramedy miniseries finds a liberating place where they collide. After Molly Kochan (Michelle Williams) is diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer, she leaves her sexless marriage in search of exploring her sexuality and finding lost parts of herself. As Molly has hilarious sex romps in hospital beds and encounters requests for a kick in the dick while she confronts sexual trauma from her childhood, her best friend Nikki Boyer (Jenny Slate) deals with the guilt of feeling overburdened by taking care of her dying friend. The show is grounded in a true story and presents a remarkably honest look at how the end can be a gateway to a new beginning, even if that includes dildo shopping and orgasms.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501"><em> Andor</em> Season 2</a></span> is a satisfying slow burn that frequently erupts into some of the best television viewing around. At times it rivals HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em> in its Machiavellian scheming and gripping character portraits, while also leaning into the best parts of <em>Star Wars</em> lore and fan service without over indulging. Its set-piece peaks are even higher than the best action moments of season 1 while still managing to tunnel deeper into the compelling human dramas that imbue the formation of the Rebel Alliance with meaning and emotion. You could strip away all of the red blaster fire and Wookiepedia name-dropping and <em>Andor</em> would still be a world-class TV thriller worthy of everyone’s time. —Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>If you’d told me last year that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/invincible-season-3-gillian-jacobs-eve-interview-1851756259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/invincible-season-3-gillian-jacobs-eve-interview-1851756259"><em>Invincible </em></a></span>would deliver some of the most emotionally complex character developments of any TV show so far in 2025, I would’ve thought you were one of those brainwashed ReAnimen. But it’s true. After a subpar second season that largely felt like a setup for this third one, Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun) wrestles with the morality of murder, his half-brother Oliver (Lincoln Bodin) exhibits the same homicidal pragmatism as their exiled father Omni-Man (J.K. Simmons), and Cecil (Walton Goggins) blurs the lines of right and wrong by enlisting rehabilitated criminals as protectors of society. And that’s only scratching the surface. Let’s not forget that the last two episodes of the season feature an epic war between evil Invincibles from across the multiverse, as well as the good Invincible and Conquest (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) engaging in a staggeringly brutal fight. Through it all, Conquest drops shockingly profound quips like “I don’t even get a real name, only a purpose” and says “there is no greater pleasure than feeling the warmth of my fists drenched in blood,” making him the villain who most effectively combines wit and bloodshed since Thanos.</p></div><div><p><em>Paradise </em>turned Sterling K. Brown from America’s dad on <em>This Is Us </em>into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682">Hollywood’s latest badass</a></span> as Secret Service agent Xavier Collins by having him lead a paramilitary coup against the fascist government of a city built inside of a Colorado mountain. Brown’s ability to go from doting father to fierce protector to disgruntled employee while exhibiting the same dutiful passion for doing what he feels is right helps the series transcend some of the one-dimensional pitfalls of most post-apocalyptic shows. But it also helps that <em>Paradise </em>intricately examines how the titular city is formed, from the hierarchical selection of its residents to the artificial ways they recreate normal life, all so well-developed and thought through that they make this world feel lived-in and fun to explore. </p><p>Brown isn’t alone. Julianne Nicholson plays Samantha “Sinatra” Redmond, chief decision-maker and mastermind of the mountainous bunker, as a woman who funnels her grief over her son dying  into her efforts to exert total control over the world around her in order to prevent ever having to experience anything like that again. Such character nuances are pervasive throughout the show. Also the penultimate episode, in which Collins has to forcibly get the President of the United States out of the White House through a mob of governmental officials who just found out the world is ending, is not only one of the best TV episodes of 2025. It’s one of the best episodes in Hulu’s history. </p></div><div><p>At this point, if you see Noah Wyle in a Chicago emergency room, either hand him lidocaine or hand him an Emmy. The <em>ER</em> legend is leading a fresh group of doctors and nurses through an eventful and exhausting 15-hour shift during which disgruntled patients assault nurses, a mass shooting happens at a music festival, there’s a car chase involving a stolen ambulance vehicle, and Dr. Trinity Santos (Isa Briones) dishes enough dry humor  to rub anyone the wrong way. What makes <em>The Pitt </em>special is that nothing happens yet everything happens. Since each episode is one hour of the 15-hour shift, there is no central plot point that is wrapped up by the end of each episode. That, paired with the type of immersive camera work that made <em>ER </em>great, makes each episode an unflinching look at the many different human experiences that can fit into one hour in an emergency room.</p><p><em>The Pitt</em> eschews distracting medical drama tropes. There are no make-out sessions in Exam Room 1, or jokes that last beyond a chuckle. There’s no holiday-themed episode in which Christmas cheer makes the doctors forget there’s a terminally ill patient wasting away in triage. <em>The Pitt</em> is a beautifully self-contained drama that can break your heart more times in one hour than the best shows can in an entire season. </p></div><div><p>Honestly, <em>The Studio </em>shouldn’t work this well. A comedy series about the hijinks and chaos of running a movie studio should only be appealing to industry insiders and those who have read one too many <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> op-eds. Seth Rogen plays Matt Remick, the new head of Continental Studios, and transforms this show into the best comedy of 2025 so far by satirizing annoying industry trends and the ways in which famous people can be obsessive  about made-up stories. In the real world, someone turned Winnie the Pooh into the star of a bloody slasher film, hoping to capitalize on our collective fixation with legacy IP; <em>The Studio </em>spoofs such things by having Remick try to convince Martin Scorsese to turn a film about the Jonestown cult mass murder of 1978 into one about the Kool-Aid brand. Elsewhere, Olivia Wilde shows up, spoofing the real-life scandal about her directorial work on <em>Don’t Worry Darling </em>by playing a manic version of herself who would steel reels of scenes she wants to reshoot. And those are just a few episodes.</p><p>The supporting cast of Kathryn Hahn, Bryan Cranston, Ike Barinholtz, Catherine O’Hara, and Chase Sui Wonders (in what could be her breakout role) are sensational. But it’s Remick’s earnest love of cinema that adds a level of profundity to the comedy. In one episode, he becomes enraged when a group of doctors dismiss his career as less important than theirs because Remick honestly believes movies can improve people’s lives. In that way, <em>The Studio </em>is a love letter to films during a time when the medium’s importance outside of cell phones and TVs is being questioned. </p></div><div><p>After its second season, Apple TV+’s cultural phenomenon <em>Severance</em> has reached a point where its so inseparable from the world (and mystery) it has created that you either love the show or never want to watch another episode again. The sci-fi workplace drama about the consequences of compartmentalizing the human experience took the first season’s look at the machinations behind splitting people’s consciousnesses in two and expanded it outwards to truly look at the issues raised by its core concept on a macro scale. The first season made us believe the Innies and the Outies were two halves of the same person. The second season beautifully illustrates how we’ve been falling in love with people who are diametrically opposed to parts of themselves as a means of survival.</p><p>That’s the brilliance of <em>Severance</em>. On the surface it’s a never-ending search for clues about what exactly Lumon is doing with these severed workers, and why the hell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787?_gl=1*ikj6tm*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcwNzQzNjIkbzkwJGcxJHQxNzQ3MDc0NTMyJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787?_gl=1*ikj6tm*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcwNzQzNjIkbzkwJGcxJHQxNzQ3MDc0NTMyJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..">there’s a fucking child working there</a></span>. But, it’s through this extreme and fantastical lens that we’re able to explore how identity is as important as air, and love transcends all even in the most improbable circumstances. Britt Lower conveys more emotions in slight facial twitches as Helly R/Helena Eagan than some of the best actresses can do in full scenes. Tramell Tillman is the runaway pick for every Best Supporting Actor award for his scene-stealing realism (and unmatched dance moves) as Lumon shill Seth Milchick. And this might truly be the best role of Adam Scott’s career. </p><p>Don’t try to figure out <em>Severance</em>. Just enjoy the ride. </p></div><div><p>It wasn’t until midway through the first episode, when shock-riddled 13-year-old Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper) goes through the emotionless procedure of being arrested after having his world rocked, that I realized the entire episode has been one long, continuous shot. The delay in my recognition of this fact wasn’t due to viewing passively as I lazily scrolled on a second screen. It was because, at its best, <em>Adolescence </em>gets a stranglehold on your attention with its drama, to the point that you’re only focused on what happens next rather than how it’s being presented. The Netflix drama focuses on a troubled teenage boy accused of killing his classmate Katie Leonard (Emilia Holliday), and the multi-layered ramifications that has on a family, a police force, and a school. That’s where the one-shot approach becomes essential.</p><p>Most shows take a fragmented approach to offering up the perspectives of different characters on the inciting incident that puts the season in motion. In one episode of such a show, you may get 10 different perspectives that all come into focus by the end of the season. On <em>Adolescence</em>, you spend an entire episode with Jamie and his psychologist Briony Ariston (Erin Doherty), from her entering the facility to the two of them playing a game of chess to them having a session to her sitting in the shocked aftermath of seeing a young boy riddled with volatile self-hate. All of that, without the camera blinking or allowing you to divert from the drama that was unfolding. Also, that episode is on the shortlist of best episodes in Netflix’s history. </p><p>When all is said and done, no TV show so far this year has been nearly as impressive or emotionally arresting as <em>Adolescence</em>. And I’m not sure one will be. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake is unlikely to feature a 60 FPS mode, despite indications found in recent footage.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of their weekly podcast</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at the new game footage that was featured in a recent Creator's Voice video, comparing it to footage captured on PlayStation 5 in Performance Mode, highlighting the differences between the two versions of the game. Despite a blurrier image, heavier dithering on hair, and shallower depth of field, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game holds up quite well.</p>
<p>What Final Fantasy VII Remake is unlikely to offer on Nintendo Switch 2, as opposed to PlayStation 5, is a 60 FPS mode. In the Creator's Voice video, the iconic scene with Cloud jumping off the train right before beginning the mission to destroy Reactor No.1 runs at 60 FPS, which suggested the Nintendo Switch 2 version would offer a 60 FPS option, but in their analysis, Digital Foundry highlighted how the quality of Cloud's hair in the shot is even higher than in the same sequence on PlayStation 5 in Performance Mode, so the footage was not taken from the Switch 2 version, but likely from the PC version.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned Creator's Voice video, Final Fantasy VII Remake director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-hints-the-entire-remake-trilogy-could-be-coming-to-switch-2/">hinted</a> that the entire remake trilogy could be coming to Nintendo Switch 2. According to Digital Foundry, this intention could suggest that the yet-to-be-announced third part of the trilogy may not make the jump to <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-sequel-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> as, while the engine could solve some of the visual issues we have seen in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, we currently have no indication that the engine can run well on the system, or that visuals could be cut down significantly to make the game run on the system and still look reasonably good.&nbsp; With the developer's desire to have part 3 out as soon as possible, which would be difficult to accomplish with an engine change, this statement could have provided an indication of the next game's technical direction.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-update-brings-new-enemies-weapon-customization-and-more.1187883/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-illuminate-weapon-customization<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony have released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing new Illuminate for you and your squad to take on, plus new weapon customization systems and more.</p>

<p>First up, you can expect "larger, more powerful enemies" joining the Illuminate armies, including the Stingray jetfighter, which targets your squad to line up "devastating strafing runs".</p>

<p>These airborne menaces are joined by the Crescent Overseer, which "has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover", and the Fleshmob, a "terrifying" new enemy that serves as a "brute battlefield force" constructed of Voteless parts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-weapon-customization.jpg?itok=zoDiYmz7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-weapon-customization.jpg?itok=q5IoabLj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>now lets you customize your weapons.</figcaption></figure><p>Arrowhead also says there are "sightings of other, even larger ships", although it doesn't go into detail regarding what those ships are or what they can do. Suffice it to say you'd better watch out for more than just what's been revealed in this update briefing.</p>

<p>As well as new Illuminate enemies, the latest&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update also brings with it a new weapon customization system, which allows you to unlock new weapon attachments and patterns to make your armaments truly your own.</p>

<p>You can complete missions in order to level up "most" primary weapons, and doing so will allow you to spend Requisition on new attachments. It sounds like a good way to spend a resource that has a tendency to pile up once you've bought all the good stratagems.</p>

<p>Other additions include new patterns for the FRV based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond" rel="nofollow">several</a> of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond" rel="nofollow">existing</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, which will unlock at the same time the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond" rel="nofollow">Masters of Ceremony Warbond</a> is made available (that's May 15th).</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, a board game adaptation based on the popular shooter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">recently fully crowdfunded in just 12 minutes</a>, demonstrating there's still a clear appetite for bringing managed democracy to Super Earth's enemies.</p>

<p>Despite that, the game's creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">revealed back in January</a>&nbsp;that he's taking an extended break from working on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, and that when he returns, he'll be devoting his attention to Arrowhead's next game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-release-seemingly-leaked-for-june.1187880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like that mooted&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>PC release is about to be announced, if a recent trailer uploaded to the PlayStation YouTube channel is anything to go by.</p>

<p>As spotted by Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alekstra</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/stellar-blade-for-pc-launches-june-11-alongside-complete-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), a trailer was uploaded, then hastily deleted, to the official YouTube channel for PlayStation. The trailer confirms that&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is set to hit PC on June 11th.</p>

<p>According to said trailer, when&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>does arrive on PC, it'll bring a lot of the features you'd expect from a release on the platform, including support for DLSS 4 and FSR 3 (but not FSR 4, unfortunately), an unlocked frame rate, and ultrawide display support.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-release-leak-june.jpg?itok=oOLEr5F6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-release-leak-june.jpg?itok=rWycVjeP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cheer up, Eve. It looks like you'll be coming to PC soon after all.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as new technical features, the PC version will also add an extra boss fight against Sentinel leader Mann, plus 25 new outfits to try on. Hey, at least Shift Up knows its audience, I suppose.</p>

<p>Of course, the game will also be compatible with the DualSense controller on PC, and the PC version will support haptic feedback and trigger effects too. You won't have to use a DualSense, though.</p>

<p>There's no word on whether these extra features will be added to the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>as well, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be, so you should be able to enjoy the new outfits and boss fight even if you're still on PS5.</p>

<p>Technically, this hasn't been announced officially yet, but given that the trailer was uploaded to the PlayStation YouTube channel before being removed, it's fairly safe to assume the June 11th release date is legit.</p>




<p>A PC version of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has been talked about for some time now. Back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">in June last year</a>, developer Shift Up said it was actively considering releasing the game on PC, and it made comments to the same effect in its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=203&amp;category=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Q3 2024 financial report</a> as well.</p>

<p>It's likely the&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>PC port will be officially revealed soon. For now, though, you can check the game out on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read our Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>

However, during that trip, she encounters a murder incident and is subsequently arrested as a suspect. While being transported in a police vehicle, it suddenly overturns in an accident, freeing Mika along with six other criminals and they all become fugitives.</p><p><a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>erious attackers appear, targeting the unique “power” that Mika possesses, and the group finds themselves pursued by both the police and the attackers. The secret hidden within Mika’s power, the identity of the attackers, and the truth behind the murder incident that started it all…</p><p>Can they unravel these mysteries and reclaim a normal life?</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Choices</strong> – During your escape, you will be forced to make various choices. Your choices will affect the “likability” of the other character and the protagonist’s own “criminality,” which will affect the development of the story and the ending.</li><li><strong>Sidecar Part</strong> – During the escape, you can choose who will drive the motorcycle on which the main character rides in the sidecar. By choosing your partner, you can discover an unexpected side of them and deepen your bond.</li><li><strong>Mission Mode</strong> – During the story, you may encounter mission modes that require cooperation from all your allies, such as stealing important items or escaping from a building. In mission mode, you will watch footage from six separate security cameras and give appropriate instructions to your allies according to the situation to lead the mission to success.</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ash Meyer</strong> (voiced by Ryota Suzuki) – A young man who abandoned his hometown, and is always on the move from place to place. He prefers to be alone, and does his best to avoid speaking to others. The quiet lone wolf. Due to his surly appearance, he’s constantly getting involved in fights, leading a life of never ending violence. He likes to drive vehicles, and has a particularly strong attachment to motorcycles. He has amazing driving technique, but with how wild his driving is, it’s a miracle he hasn’t been in an accident.</li><li><strong>Hamiel Luis</strong> (voiced by Kazuki Kato) – A con man with the air of a playboy. Although he’s good with people, and excels at manipulating people’s minds with his eloquent words, his sarcasm and sharp words often bleed into his speech. Due to his strong self assertion, he often gets himself into trouble with other people. He also excels at disguising himself, and cheating when gambling.</li><li><strong>Gib Baltzer</strong> (voiced by Ryota Takeuchi) – A former police officer who’s on the run as a suspect for the murder of a colleague. As a member of the special force in his time as a police officer, he was a sniper who excels at handling firearms. Always calm and collected, he fills the role of leader of the group. He can make decisions from an objective point of view, but due to his serious personality, he often can’t relate to younger people. He was married once, but is now a widower.</li><li><strong>Ramie Carriere</strong> (voiced by Yuto Uemura) – The self proclaimed, “Ramie, the Great Phantom Thief of the Century,” he’s a thief who mainly targets the wealthy. Excels at both picking pockets and picking locks with his dexterous fingers. He also makes great use of his acrobatic skills, using his cat-like agility to get over walls. He’s friendly, always looking to brighten up the mood, but hates being touched by other people.</li><li><strong>Camu Einhard</strong> (voiced by Shinnosuke Tachibana) – Calling himself “The Earth Warrior of Love,” he’s a revolutionist who fights for the preservation of the environment. An engineering student who loves Japanese comics, he has a strong interest in Japanese culture and anime. In addition to always being immersed in his own world, due to his social anxiety, he doesn’t have any friends his age. He is pure of heart, and he generally doesn’t like arguments.</li><li><strong><a title="Games > Sally [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sally">Sally</a> Del Testa</strong> (voiced by Kanae Ito) – A genius hacker who loves Japan’s Harajuku fashion. Gaining illegal access to information through the net, she has committed numerous cyber crimes, but having no sense of the wrongness of her <a title="Genres > Action [2,722 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, she doesn’t like to be called a cracker. Because of an incident in her past, she avoids elevators.</li><li><strong>Mika Amamine</strong> (default name) (voiced by Mika Okamoto) – <em>Despera Drop</em>‘s protagonist. She’s a Japanese student studying abroad at an Italian University. She gets involved in a murder incident in Rome, and is framed as the murderer and arrested. A good person at heart, who doesn’t forgive bad deeds, she is reluctant to live on the run as a fugitive. Having the power to read people’s strong emotions and memories when she touches them with her hands from birth, she always wears gloves to avoid reading people’s hearts inadvertently.</li></ul><p><em>*Only the name of the main character can be changed. (If you use the default name, the character will call you by your name with a voice.)</em><br><em>*Character voicing is in Japanese only.</em></p><p><strong>Steam Version Contents</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Supports Switching Between Japanese and English</strong> – You can switch between Japanese and English at any time from the settings screen. The language will only change in the scenario, user interface, and on-screen effects; the audio will remain in Japanese.</li><li><strong>Postscript Episodes Included as Extra Content</strong> – The Nintendo Switch version (Japanese version) includes seven additional episodes that were previously sold as downloadable content as extra content. These episodes take place after the happy endings of each character route, so please enjoy them after completing the game.</li><li><strong>Supports Keyboard, Mouse, and Controller Operation</strong> – Players can choose their preferred input devices—keyboard, mouse, or controller—to suit their playing environment (multiple combinations are also possible). Additionally, to make mouse—only operation easier, shortcut buttons corresponding to click operations can be displayed at the bottom of the screen.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A week after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair removed the ability for players to glide using Pals in response to Nintendo's ongoing lawsuit, a modder has restored the feature on PC. That's as Pocketpair confirms Palworld's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> collaboration will launch this "summer".
</p>
<p>
Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">confirmed it had removed Pal-based gliding from Palworld</a> earlier this month, saying it had been forced to make "yet another compromise" due to Nintendo's ongoing patent infringement claim. Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched legal action against the studio last September</a>, saying it was seeking "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld... infringes multiple patent rights".
</p>
<p>
Several patents - which Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exceedingly-plausible-nintendo-crafted-patent-claims-to-specifically-target-palworld-says-ip-expert">seemingly filed onto pre-existing "parent" patents</a> <em>after</em> the release of Palworld - lie at the heart of the case, all relating to specific gameplay mechanics. These include the ability to capture digital creatures by throwing a catching item and the ability to subsequently ride on them.
</p>
<p>
First signs Pocketpair might be forced to capitulate to Nintendo arrived last December, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">axed the ability to catch Pals by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a> in a small update. Then, the ability to glide using Pals was removed earlier this month, with the studio saying the changes - which instead added gliders as a useable inventory item - were "necessary in order to prevent further disruptions" to development.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, one modder has moved to reinstate the gliding feature on PC. As spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/palworld/palworld-mod-brings-back-gliding-feature-removed-by-nintendo-lawsuit-3194320/">Dexerto</a>, Primarinabee's Glider Restoration mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/2454?tab=description">now available via Nexus Mods</a> and specifically designed "for those of you who love flying with your pals." Primarinabee says the mod "uses sleight of hand to reverse the sleight-of-hand 'removal' of gliding pals," but notes player will still  need a glider in their inventory to make it work. "It's not <em>quite</em> perfect," they add, "but it basically reverses Patch 0.5.5 without requiring you to forego future game updates".
</p>
<p>
Despite Nintendo's lawsuit, early access development of Palworld continues, and Pocketpair has now revealed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">previously announced Terraria collaboration</a> will launch for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC this "summer". Dubbed Tides of Terraria, it'll enable players to "catch, train, fight, and work" monsters from developer Re-Logic's hugely popular sandbox action-adventure "just like Pals". Pocketpair is also promising non-Terraria-themed additions in the update, including new Pals and new islands, with more to be shared "over the next few weeks".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-director-is-working-really-hard-to-make-it-great-game-could-be-compatible-with-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Quest XII has been missing in action for a long time. Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-development-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the new installment in the revered Japanese roleplaying game series in early 2020. In May 2021, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-is-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-story-is-already-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology would power it and that the story was already finished. A few months later, it was discovered that Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate would be co-developed by Orca, which made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, however, there have been no further news or even leaks about this game. At Comic-Con Napoli, franchise creator Yuji Horii finally broke the silence <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yujii-horii-still-working-really-hard-on-dragon-quest-xii-series-could-be-compatible-with-switch-2-1541753/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Gamereactor</a>, revealing that he and the team are 'working really hard' to make the game great.</p>
<p><em>Yes, indeed, I can't say anything, I apologise. I am making it, putting lots of work into it. I can only say that the next work will be great too, working really hard. Please look forward to it, is the only thing I can say.</em></p>
<p>He also appeared to hint that Dragon Quest XII could be coming to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Nintendo console</a>.</p>
<p><em>Yes, I believe it could be compatible with Switch 2 as well.</em></p>
<p>However, we shouldn't take that as an actual announcement, not only because it would come from Square Enix, but also because Horii has already kind of fallen into a bit of a translation issue at Comic-Con Napoli where it was reported that he had practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a Chrono Trigger remake. In contrast, he had only <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed interest</a> in such a project.</p>
<p>In the same interview, the creator of Dragon Quest also expressed his thoughts on the genre as a whole, although he did not comment on the recent success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p><em>The characteristic of an RPG is its story, I believe, not an open world, but you can enjoy its story. In a way, RPGs are for hardcore players. Depending on how you make the story, it makes it easy to play. While enjoying the story, you also become stronger. So I think RPGs enable you to enjoy these two elements.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona-5-the-phantom-x-western-release-teased-by-atlus.1187838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like free-to-play mobile game&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is about to break free of its China-exclusive moorings and make its way West, if a new teaser image is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Over on social media platform X, Atlus <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1922064435763438012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> a single image of artwork for&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>&nbsp;earlier today, together with the captions "Think you dropped this..." and "Stay tuned!".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the announcement wasn't accompanied by any kind of release window, nor do we know exactly when we can expect more news about the Western release of the game. Still, it looks like the mobile RPG is definitely making its way to Western shores, at the very least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-atlus-city.jpg?itok=mcrrblmE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-atlus-city.jpg?itok=2Y8zCD9U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>hasn't been released outside of China yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Many <a href="https://x.com/clevercolt64/status/1922070053752656266" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">people</a> in the replies to Atlus' post (including <a href="https://x.com/discord/status/1922081428956664148" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>, perhaps semi-jokingly) are <a href="https://x.com/Soyskay96/status/1922067835708215359" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a> that the announcement could refer to&nbsp;<em>Persona 6</em>, or at least to a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Persona 5&nbsp;</em>series, but the artwork in question is for&nbsp;<em>The Phantom X</em>, so you'll want to adjust your expectations accordingly.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-announced-for-mobile-platforms-in-china" rel="nofollow">free-to-play mobile-focused RPG</a> that follows a new group of characters who find themselves able to use Personas.</p>

<p>Like mainline&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>games, <i>The Phantom X&nbsp;</i>is split between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-looks-too-good-to-be-confined-to-mobile-in-new-trailer" rel="nofollow">dungeon-crawling and social simulation gameplay</a>, but since this is a free-to-play mobile game, it uses energy-style mechanics to regulate timing for the social sim side rather than a standard calendar system.</p>

<p>It's one of a number of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5&nbsp;</em>spinoffs, alongside tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Tactica</em>, dancing game&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</em>, and the more action-heavy&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Strikers</em>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Becoming A Parry Master In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 In 13 Minutes</p>
      </div>
<p>After Expedition 33's investors encouraged developer Sandfall Interactive to think bigger, this led to the game being rebooted entirely. The studio had been working on Expedition 33 for six months at this point, and the new direction was inspired by a painting that game director Guillaume Broche liked and a short story with artistic themes that Svedberg-Yen had written.</p><p>The final spark for Expedition 33's new direction was Guillaume's mother, who helped provide the "catalyst" for the story. From there, all the pieces fell into place as Expedition 33's crew polished the story and recruited an all-star cast of actors to voice the game's characters. While the game does leave some room open for a potential sequel, Svedberg-Yen added that Sandfall Interactive is now focused on fine-tuning Expedition 33 and addressing any bugs. That doesn't mean that the studio isn't thinking about producing new content, but "it's probably not going to be for a while" Svedberg-Yen said.</p><p>Sandfall Interactive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-new-patch-nerfs-the-strongest-party-member/1100-6531420/">recently dropped a patch that addresses several issues in the game</a>. The patch has also drastically reduced the power of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-patch-will-fix-one-of-the-most-broken-builds-in-the-game/1100-6531392/">popular Stendhal build</a>, but savvy players can still use it to inflict absurd amounts of damage on tough enemies. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-numbers-keep-climbing-as-more-players-jump-into-the-rpg/1100-6531328/">Expedition 33 has so far sold over 2 million copies since launch</a>, and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-reaches-another-impressive-achievement/1100-6531372/">official soundtrack is also doing quite well</a> on the streaming charts.</p>

            <p>Atlus has teased the next game in its Persona series due for global release, ahead of a livestream later this week.</p>
<p>"Think you dropped this," reads an official social post, with an emoji of an owl.</p>
<p>While some have jumped to the conclusion of a Persona 6 announcement, this is actually news of a full release for mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a>, following its open beta.</p>

<p>A livestream will take place on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXGxXcR6ftg">YouTube</a> this week on 15th May at 3pm UK time (11pm JST), where the game's release date will be revealed</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-persona-5-spin-off-game-revealed">The Phantom X was revealed back in 2023</a> and comes courtesy of Chinese developer Perfect World.

<p>The game will feature familiar elements from the base game, but with gacha gameplay.</p>
<p>It follows two previous spin-off games from Persona 5 - hack and slash follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-strikers-review-an-impressive-sequel-that-inherits-some-of-the-originals-flaws">Persona 5 Strikers</a> and strategy game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-tactica-review-a-welcoming-spin-off-aimed-at-strategy-newcomers">Persona 5 Tactica</a>.</p>
<p>Last year saw the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a>, a remake of the genre-defining RPG from which Persona 5 grew the series' fanbase.</p>
<p>Little is known about Persona 6 yet, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-6-will-be-coming-to-multiple-platforms-leak-suggests">leaks suggest it will be coming to multiple platforms</a> and it's expected to have a green colour scheme.</p>

			<p>Some of the issues found in the PC version of DOOM: The Dark Ages will require a driver fix, and thus won't be fixed with any patch that may launch once the game releases to the public later this week.</p>
<p>Following the game's early access release for all who pre-ordered it, developer id Software shared a new FAQ, including a list of known issues on all platforms. The list of PC issues is rather substantial, and includes issues like crashing issues when playing on an RTX 50 series GPU with G-Sync or V-Sync enabled and Multi Frame Generation, game locking issues when resizing the window manually while using AMD FSR frame generation, game launching in the background if alt-tabbing on an NVIDIA GPU, OBS capturing issues and others. Some of these issues, as mentioned above, require some driver fixes and may take some more time to get fixed.</p>
<p>You can find the full list of DOOM: The Dark Ages known PC issues and their fixes or workarounds below.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If you are playing on an RTX 50 series GPU and enable G-Sync (supported display required) or V-Sync plus Multi Frame Generation through NVIDIA Control Panel you can crash the game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: Until a driver fix is available, the workaround for this issue is to either disable one of these options in the NVIDIA control panel or if you want both enabled, set them in-game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If you are playing on an RTX 40 or 50 series GPU and enable Multi Frame Generation or FrameGen, V-Sync still shows as enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: This is a minor cosmetic issue – the game disables V-Sync under the hood in these cases.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users with NVIDIA GPUs may find that Alt-Tabbing while launching the game can cause the game to launch in the background and not be accessible.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: This is a known driver issue. Until a fix is available in a driver update, to avert this issue, avoid Alt-Tabbing during game launch. If encountered, it can be resolved by restarting your PC.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users with NVIDIA 50 series GPUs may experience TDRs or system hangs when starting gameplay recording using Shadowplay with MultiFrameGen set to 3x or 4x.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, either do not use the noted MFG settings or record gameplay with a different application.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If capturing with OBS, game visuals may freeze when Alt-tabbing from Fullscreen</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: Until there is an update from OBS, the workaround for the issue is to capture in Windowed or Borderless mode.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: The game can lock up when manually resizing the game window with FSR FrameGen enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not manually resize the game window with FSR FrameGen enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users who unplug a 2nd monitor during gameplay may notice that the game has frozen.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not unplug any monitors while playing the game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Players running the game with the MSI Afterburner or RivaTuner overlays enabled may experience stability issues.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not run the game with either application running in the background.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: In rare cases, players running DOOM: The Dark Ages on a supported PC spec at appropriate settings, who have the latest GPU drivers installed and also have an intel CPU model number that starts with the number 13 or 14 can run into persistent crashing.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: In such cases, you may have a corrupted CPU. Please contact intel Customer Support at&nbsp;<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsupport%2Fcontact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/contact.html</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages also has some known issues on consoles as well. Some of these issues are already being investigated and will potentially be fixed in future updates. You can find the full list <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3017860/view/509579946274851061">here</a>.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S for all those who pre-ordered the game. It will become available for everyone else on May 15th.
