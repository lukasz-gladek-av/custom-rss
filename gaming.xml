" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It feels like only yesterday we were in the thick of the fall release calendar being bombarded every other day by a new blockbuster or sleeper indie hit. November is slowing things down a bit, but it’s not quite backlog month just yet. A new <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em>, <em>Flight Simulator</em>, and Lego game headline a month of stuff hitting just before the holiday rush. </p><p>We were originally getting <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> in November, one last big RPG for fans to sink into before the end-of-year slump. Instead, Ubisoft pushed that to the February gauntlet, giving <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em>, and people who somehow still haven’t finished <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em> (that’s me!) a much needed reprieve. </p><p>Instead, this month is shifting gears firmly into family game mode. In addition to a light <em>Mario Bros. </em>adventure and Microsoft’s “sorry, dad’s in the middle of a transatlantic flight out in the garage” simulator, we’re also getting a <em>Lego Horizon</em> <em>Zero Dawn </em>adaptation and<em> TMNT </em>brawler just in time to occupy all those cousins after the Thanksgiving buffet. Here are 19 games we’re paying attention to this November. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Creature collector RPG</p><p>  <em>Farmagia</em> is a monster farming action RPG revealed back during the June Nintendo showcase. It’s from the company behind <em>Story of Seasons</em>, <em>Rune Factory</em>, and other RPG sims, though this one looks more anime-flavored with <em>Pikmin</em>-sized armies helping you defeat bosses. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Mystery deduction </p><p>An online social deduction game that channels <em>Death Note</em>? Time will tell if <em>Death Note: Killer Within</em> can translate <em>Among Us</em>-like murder mystery into the mood and language of the hit anime. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC</p><p>  <strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based tactics </p><p><em>Metal Slug</em> is back and trading its iconic side-scrolling run-and-gun action for <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> gameplay in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. The slick pixel art is a nice sweetener on-top of a solid genre mashup. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Construction sim<br></p><p>Managed roller coaster chaos is back with <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>. The sequel is adding new systems, including an entire water park section. The developers promise more robust tools will let you craft more complex theme parks than ever before. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre: </strong>Action roguelike</p><p>For a time there were no <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>. Now there’s a new one every year. <em>Splintered Fate</em> technically came out last year, but the Apple Arcade exclusive is just now arriving on every other platform in case you’ve already exhausted <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em> and are hungry for more Foot Clan butt kicking. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Strategy role-playing game</p><p>Tactical RPG <em>Phantom Brave</em> began life as a PS2 game in 2004. It’s first remake was for Wii in 2009. Even more content was added in the PSP version a year later. Now it’s getting an HD remaster ahead of the full-blown sequel, <em>The Lost Hero</em>, due out next year. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Animal sim</p><p>2014 is officially retro now. That year’s comedic open-world chaos simulator is now getting updated 10 year later. <em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em> includes updated graphics, all previous DLC, and other updates including quality-of-life improvements. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Role-playing game</p><p>Long resigned to Nintendo’s secondary handhelds, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> brings the RPG-lite formula to the company’s home console hybrid. The Switch may be almost eight years old at this point, but the<em> Brothership</em> glow-up is still the best this spiritual spin-off to <em>Paper Mario</em> has looked yet, even if early reviews <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609">are more divided</a></span> on the depth and fun of the underlying gameplay. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Horror action-adventure </p><p><em>Silent Hill </em>creator Keiichiro Toyama has returned with a mashup of his lesser-known survival horror classic,<em> Siren</em>, and the breezy, colorful action game <em>Gravity Rush</em>. It sounds bold, if maybe a little under-polished for his new studio’s debut project. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC, mobile</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Word clue adventure </p><p><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em> takes the acclaimed first game’s devilishly clever investigative adventure game formula to the 1970s for an exploration of the criminal underworld and human depravity. I can’t wait. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based strategy </p><p>Already out on PC, Songs of Conquest is getting a surprise console port this month. Channeling <em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em>, you explore an overworld like a strategy sim while unleashing your armies in turn-based combat across tile-based battlefields. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Puzzle</p><p><em>Tetris Forever</em> is the latest in Digital Eclipse’s high-quality anthology of interactive documentaries. It includes the original game and several iterations of it across platforms and creators, as well as the brand-new four-player <em>Tetris Time Warp </em>that lets you compete across the game’s history in real-time. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS4, Xbox One, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sci-fi open world crafting sim</p><p><em>Astroneer: Glitchwalkers</em> is a paid expansion, but it’s a big one. The eight-year-old planetary colony sim is getting a new map to explore, more story, and plenty of additional things to craft. Players will use new gear and tech trees to protect themselves against the titular glitched storms that threaten to hack them. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Bullet hell action-RPG roguelike </p><p><em>Temtem</em> is a Pokémon style MMO, and <em>Temtem: Swarm</em> takes the creatures from that multiplayer RPG and turns them into fodder for a <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style bullet hell adventure. I’m not sure how many more <em>Survivors</em>-likes we can have at this point, but <em>Swarm </em>sure looks pretty. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre: </strong>Role-playing game</p><p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> looks like the overhaul every Square Enix fan wishes their favorite old-school RPG could get. The old systems and designs remain, down to the pixel art sprites, but the rest of the world has a HD2D update that looks gorgeous. We’ll see if the rest of the decades-old game holds up. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Co-op brawler </p><p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> is the first Lego gaming adaptation of another video game. It’s more of a kids’ abridged version of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em>than a one-to-one, brick-by-brick remake of sci-fi dino hunting game. It does sport couch co-op and that familiar Lego charm. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sim</p><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> returns with a sequel four years after the current-gen reboot. It includes a ton of new missions, vehicles, and terrain details. The company has promised that almost all of the previous game’s add-ons will work with and carry over to <em>Flight Sim 2024</em>. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Survival horror shooter</p><p>It’s hard to believe <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> is actually coming out. The first Stalker game in 15 years, announced back in 2018 and developed through an invasion of GSC Game World’s home country of Ukraine, the survival shooter takes players back to the open-world Exclusion Zone for more harrowing ammo scavenging and surreal mysteries. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch</p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Metroidvania soulslike</p><p>  Red Candle Games’ horror adventure game <em>Devotion </em>was a 2019 GOTY contender. The studio decided to follow it up with a cute platformer that combines metroidvania exploration with punishing soulslike combat. <em>Nine Sols</em> came to PC in May and is tough as nails. This month, players can finally take on that challenge on console.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-asg-89-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-and-equipment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has some great close-range options for smaller maps like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-24-7-playlist-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown</a> and Stakeout, but none are quite as powerful as Shotguns. The ASG-89 is the fastest-firing Shotgun in the game, but you’ll need the best attachments for it to experience its true power.</p>



<p>With that said, here’s the best loadout for the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-asg-89-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-asg-89">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-asg-89">Best Secondary for ASG-89</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock ASG-89</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-asg-89-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the ASG-89 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-asg-89-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best ASG-89 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: CQB Grip</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Kicking off our best ASG-89 loadout in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> is the <strong>Long Barrel</strong>, which improves the Shotgun’s damage range, which is pretty poor otherwise. Then, the <strong>Fast Mag I</strong> provides a quicker reload at the expense of some bullets, while the <strong>CQB Grip</strong> gives you some dive, slide, and sprint to fire speed to get your shots off faster while being mobile.</p>



<p>The <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> further boosts mobility, improving strafing, hipfire, movement, and aim walking movement speeds. Lastly, to ensure you’re finishing enemies as quickly as possible, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> attachment is essential for increasing the Shotgun’s fire rate.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-asg-89">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for ASG-89</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>We’re focussing on mobility with the ASG-89 so that you can get up close and personal effortlessly and put enemies to bed. <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> improves movement speed while reloading and using Equipment, while <strong>Assassin</strong> lets you track enemies on a KIllstreak for more intel on the opposition’s position. </p>



<p><strong>Double Time </strong>boosts Tac-Sprint so you can reach top speed for longer, and thanks to the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> Wild Card, we’ve gone with <strong>Dexterity</strong> for our fourth Perk, which reduces weapon motion when jumping, sliding, and diving, as well as decreasing fall damage.</p>



<p>As for Equipment, we like a <strong>Semtex</strong> for the quick throw and detention time, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> keeps you topped up on health to stay in the fight. Finally, the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> is a top choice for a Shotgun loadout, as you’ll want to protect your flank while behind enemy lines.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-asg-89">Best Secondary for ASG-89</h2>



<p>The <strong>Grekhova</strong> is the best Secondary for the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6, as it’s fully automatic, so when you need to hit the target and finish a kill off, the fast fire rate gives you plenty of leeway to do so.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock ASG-89 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>To unlock the ASG-89 you’ll need to hit <strong>Level 31</strong> in Black Ops 6. This can be done in Multiplayer or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-guided-zombies-come-out-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a>, and using our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best tips to level up fast</a>, you should make it there fairly quickly.</p>



<p>Be sure to take advantage of Double XP weekends and playlists like Nuketown 24/7, as those will help net you a load of XP.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-asg-89-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the ASG-89 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The ASG-89 is <strong>very good for small maps</strong>, but it isn’t so great outside of close quarters. So, we recommend either running it as a secondary with an Overkill class or only using it when you play a small map like the ones found on Face Off Moshpit.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>As the only other Shotgun in Black Ops 6, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-marine-sp-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marine SP</a> is a great alternative to use while you wait to unlock the ASG-89. Another great close-range weapon is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-kompakt-92-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kompakt 92</a>, an extremely fast-firing SMG that can shred enemies with a rapid TTK.</p>

                <p>Nintendo's newly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-new-alarmo-clock-already-has-a-day-one-update/1100-6527097/" data-ref-id="1100-6527097">released Alarmo</a> is only intended to be an expensive digital alarm clock with themes and graphics taken from popular Nintendo Switch titles. But some very talented hackers seem very determined to turn the Alarmo into something that can do other things, too. Now, just under a month since its release, someone has put a playable version of Doom on Alarmo, along with video proof of the accomplishment.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IOVYvSMAoU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5IOVYvSMAoU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The hacker in question is GaryOderNichts, who previously worked out a way to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-alarmo-has-already-been-hacked-to-include-cat-pictures/1100-6527509/" data-ref-id="1100-6527509">put cat pictures on Alarmo</a>. GaryOderNichts also laid out <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how to remove the firmware file from Alarmo</a>, which allows users to get it to accept customized code via a USB. For the new hack, he credited X user <a href="https://twitter.com/_spinda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinda</a> for "figuring out the Alarmo SWD pads," before adding that Spinda was also "the first to dump the eMMC contents."</p><p>Although Doom is now playable through the latest hack, there are drawbacks. Alarmo's clock buttons aren't designed to be an easily used game controller, nor is there any sound support from the current Doom hack. Regardless, it's now been proven that the Alarmo can be made to play games, and that could open the floodgates for similar hacks unless Nintendo finds a way to prevent this from happening.</p><p>Alarmo is currently available through Nintendo stores and for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. A wide release of Alarmo won't arrive until some time in 2025.</p>

                <p>Just over a month ago, Konami and developer Bloober Team released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2</a>, a remake of the classic survival-horror title that debuted in 2001. One of the new touches included by Bloober Team was a series of enigmatic photographs that can be found throughout the remake. Now, a player has come forward with the solution to the photo puzzle, and it's a callback to the history of the game itself.</p><p>Dale Robinson unveiled his findings on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gine5k/comment/lvcy9t2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, and he appears to be the first player to figure it out. There are 26 of these photos that can be found within the game, and they all include a short phrase. For example, the first photograph is captioned "So many people here." Robinson examined the photos and realized that the visual clue for the code was the amount of certain objects in each image.</p><p>After identifying and counting those objects, Robinson noted the corresponding letter in each message. When the letters are placed in chronological order, the message to players reads "You've been here for two decades."</p><p>"I thought I was gonna get something cool, but instead the game reminded me that I am an old man now," wrote Robinson on <a href="https://twitter.com/dale_robinson/status/1853167390013493723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1853167390013493723%7Ctwgr%5E9d40cf2f10ad4654695e723f873ce7ce54d81fd3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Ffan-cracks-mysterious-silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-revealing-secret-message-hidden-by-bloober-team" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>.

                <p>Nintendo has reconfirmed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch successor</a> will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">revealed by the end of March 2025</a>, when its current financial year concludes. Company president Shuntaro Furukawa made the announcement during an online press conference on Tuesday following the publication of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/events/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earning results</a>, saying that announcement plans for the Switch successor have not changed.</p><p>Analysts are predicting that Nintendo won't make an announcement this year, as doing so could have an impact on sales leading into the 2024 holiday season. "Making an announcement this year has gotten quite difficult," Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>.

"For a platform that is in its eighth year in the market, both hardware and software enjoy stable demand and brisk sales," Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-president-says-no-change-to-switch-2-announce-plan/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>).</p><p>Overall, Nintendo has reported a 34% decrease in net sales, while hardware and software sales have fallen by 31% and 27.6%, respectively. It's worth noting that Nintendo had a strong 2023, as last year the company released The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Illumination's The Super Mario Bros Movie was a blockbuster hit that helped push Nintendo's stock higher.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4394608-switch-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394608" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4394608-switch-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394608"></a><figcaption>The Switch continues to cement its legacy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4394608-switch-2.jpg"></figure><p>September's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/reuters-world/" data-ref-id="5000-13910">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> sold 2.58 million copies, while other recent releases like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-2004/" data-ref-id="5000-20445">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> sold 1.94 million copies and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review/2300-6464477/" data-ref-id="2300-6464477">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> sold 1.57 million units.</p><p>Lifetime sales for Switch hardware--OLED, standard, and Lite models--have now passed 146 million units in total, while Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-switch-games-of-all-time/2900-5070/" data-ref-id="2900-5070">Nintendo's best-selling game of all time</a>, as it has reached 64.27 million lifetime sales.</p>

			<p>More early PlayStation 5 Pro footage was shared online, showing how the new system runs Final Fantasy VII Rebirth like a dream.</p>
<p>The second entry in the remake trilogy, released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">earlier this year</a>, has recently been updated with its PS5 Pro patch. This patch introduces a Versatility Mode that vastly improves the game's image quality over the base model's Performance Mode, as shown in the video below shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@The21Master" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gabriel Master</a>. Needless to say, this looks like the best way to enjoy the game before the PC version arrives sometime in the future.</p>

<p>Gabriel Master also shared footage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a> running on PlayStation 5 Pro, which seems to sport slightly better image quality and more stable performance even without a dedicated patch. The same user also tested Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on the new system, which runs at a more stable framerate in 120 FPS mode. Any other improvement for the latest entry in the series will come on November 7th, when the game's PS5 Pro patch will go live.</p>

<p>These three games aren't the only ones the PlayStation 5 Pro improves. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-significantly-performance-improvements-game-boost/">Yesterday</a>, Gabriel Master shared footage of other titles, which highlighted how some of them benefit greatly from the console's increased power and features over the base model, such as Dragon's Dogma 2. PlayStation 4 games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 and Bloodborne also look somewhat better on the new system thanks to the Game Boost feature.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

            <p>
Review aggregation site Metacritic has spoken out in response to the ongoing review bombing of Dragon Age: The Veilguard by online commenters upset at the game's inclusive characters and themes.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's latest Dragon Age epic holds a "generally favourable" review average of 84 on Metacritic, based on a consensus of 54 critics' scores. 
</p>
<p>
But the game's Metacritic user score is listed as just 3.8 out of 10, with a majority of user opinions falling in the starkly negative range. Looking at some of the most recent reviews at the time of writing, these include numerous scores of zero out of 10 for content in the game repeatedly described as "woke".

</figure>
<p>
"Awful dialogue and obviously some woke agenda psyop," reads a zero out of 10 review from one user. "This is censorship at its worst."
</p>
<p>
"Woke kill the game," wrote another user who rated the game with a zero. "But gameplay is nice."
</p>
<p>
"This is what happens when you try to force push DEI [Diversity, equity, and inclusion] and sexual ideology in a fantasy game," wrote a third, who also scored the game with a zero. 
</p>
<p>
Countless other examples are also visible, some of which include slurs and abuse we won't reproduce here. A number of commenters note they are leaving repeat responses as their earlier ratings have been deleted, presumably by Metacritic moderators.

In a statement to Eurogamer acknowledging the backlash to Dragon Age: The Veilguard on its site, a spokesperson for Metacritic parent company Fandom said its site was a "place of belonging for all fans".
</p>
<p>
"We take online trust and safety very seriously across all our sites including Metacritic," the spokesperson said. "Metacritic has a moderation system in place to track violations of our terms of use. Our team reviews each and every report of abuse (including but not limited to racist, sexist, homophobic, insults to other users, etc) and if violations occur, the reviews are removed."
</p>
<p>Last year, Fandom confirmed to Eurogamer it was "evolving [its] processes and tools to introduce stricter moderation" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metacritic-improving-moderation-after-abusive-disrespectful-horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-reviews">similar reactions to Horizon Forbidden West's DLC</a>, Burning Shores.</p>

"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. "The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back."

			<p>The latest version of the ShadPS4 emulator continues to improve Bloodborne's performance on PC, fixing a critical issue and more.</p>
<p>As showcased by GAMESMARK in a new video, version 0.4.1 of the emulator, which is not yet available to the public, runs the game with full audio and no longer requires a mod workaround to work properly. Performance seems to be extremely solid as well, as the game runs at 4K resolution and around 100 FPS on a system powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, an RTX 4070 GPU, and 32 GB of DDR5 RAM.</p>

<p>The latest public version of the ShadPS4 emulator, which is finally making it possible to enjoy Bloodborne on PC after it has been stuck on PlayStation 4 since its release, was released <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-version-0-4-0-download/">last week.</a> The 0.4.0 version of the emulator packs tons of improvements and fixes, including shader recompiler fixes, emulated support for CPUs that don't have SSE4.2a, an auto-update feature, swap chain recreation and window resizing, improved keyboard navigation in the game list, working touchpad support, multiple install folders, improved Vulkan support and more. This version of the emulator also runs Gravity Rush Remastered, another game that is not currently available on PC, without any workaround.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

Under normal circumstances it lets each player who does well enough to appear on the podium perform an emote, most of which are either toxic or hilarious depending on your point of view.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 isn’t the first Call of Duty to feature The Winner’s Circle mechanic, as it’s appeared in the likes of Black Ops 3, Infinite Warfare, and WWII. But it’s impact feels particularly pronounced this year, and the debate around it was only exacerbated by the recent release of fan-favorite map Nuketown, which in addition to the Play of the Game and the Winner’s Circle, shows a short cutscene of the map getting nuked before players return to the lobby.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/05/call-of-duty-20241105104414-1730804227350.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Winner's Circle has proved divisive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of issues players have brought up with Black Ops 6’s Winner’s Circle. The main one is the time it takes to view: players have to sit through the Winner’s Circle whether they make the cut or not, and the handful of seconds it lasts can feel like an age when all you want to do is get into another match or check your loadout. Because of this, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1f61rz0/the_winners_circle_is_so_fucking_goofy_please_let/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some players have called on Treyarch to add a skip button or even pull the Winner's Circle from the game entirely</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the issue of toxicity, with some saying the ability to taunt your opponent after a victory discourages them from continuing to play having just lost a game. The slow camera zoom into the top player's face doesn't help matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-all-the-changes-coming-to-multiplayer-for-launch-based-on-feedback-to-the-beta">Treyarch actually nerfed the Winner’s Circle following feedback from the Black Ops 6 beta</a> so it had a shorter overall duration and “mitigated emote spam” for launch. During those preview weekends, players were able to spam emotes in the Winner’s Circle, which was certainly more frustrating to watch. Currently, you’re only able to trigger one emote. Or at least, you’re only supposed to be able to trigger one emote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have worked out that they can still spam emotes here by quickly pausing and unpausing the game. Doing this, they’re able to fit in a few emotes into the Winner’s Circle before it closes, which, yeah, is pretty annoying to watch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But! If you’re sick of watching the shenanigans that go on in the Winner’s Circle, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1gj6dx2/pro_tip_you_can_close_the_winners_circle_by_going/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players have worked out they can make the player avatars disappear by heading to the in-game social tab</a>. This doesn’t make the Winner’s Circle go away any quicker, but it does get rid of the emotes, if you’re feeling particularly put out by them. It’s a bizarre glitch that Treyarch will probably patch out at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been interesting to see how players have reacted to the Winner’s Circle since Black Ops 6’s explosive launch. Some have said they don’t mind it, given <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1gj6dx2/comment/lvb0lmr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it provides them with a bit of time to check their phone</a> before being thrust into the next match (modern gaming!). Others really, <em>really</em> hate it, and want to skip it at all costs. “Goofy” is a word I’ve seen tossed about by many in response to these emotes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the ongoing debate about Black Ops 6’s Winner’s Circle, it seems unlikely that Treyarch will strip it out of the game or even let players skip it. It provides an opportunity to show off players’ elaborate and often costly cosmetics, including premium emotes, to all players still in the lobby — and we all know how crucial cosmetics sales are to Activision’s bottom line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re jumping into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Essential Multiplayer Tips and Tricks</a> to help you get started.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-end-of-the-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-is-unlikely-to-be-revealed-before-the-end-of-the-year.1027716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-end-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is unlikely to be revealed before the end of the year, as the official announcement of the system during a critical season could significantly impact the company.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/">Reuters</a>, Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda commented on the yet-to-be-revealed system, saying that making an announcement before the end of the year has gotten quite difficult, as Nintendo would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical end-of-year shopping season.</p>
<p>Given how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/">last quarter has been pretty underwhelming for Nintendo</a>, the statement from Yasuda-san makes quite a lot of sense, as the Japanese company will want a much better quarter to close out the fiscal year before going all-in with the Nintendo Switch 2. A reveal in the first few months of 2025 also suggests that the console will indeed not launch anytime before April 2025, something that was also suggested by a report from August, which revealed that multiple developers were told not to expect the console to launch in early 2025.</p>
<p>Not much is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2 other than that it has been in the works for a while. According to leaks, the console <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">shouldn't look too different</a> from its predecessor and should support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/">NVIDIA DLSS</a> and Ray Reconstruction, which would let it deliver solid performance and possibly better ray tracing than other current-generation systems.</p>

            <p>Much the same as anyone with a soul, I find ants deeply fascinating and, much the same as anyone who occasionally drops small pieces of sandwich on the floor, I will continue to uphold my respect for them as long as they come nowhere near my feet. Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.</p>
<p>Fortunately, real time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empire-of-the-ants">Empire Of The Ants</a> understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.</p>

<p>It is gorgeous, isn’t it? Like a Big Dave doc, minus Big Dave himself, which doesn’t sound that amazing now I type it. I’m especially into the bit where the ant says he’ll “assemble the legions immediately”, which feels a disastrously silly interpretation of how ant communication actually works, but is too much fun for me to get upset about. Also, worth pointing out that Empire Of The Ants is not to be confused with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empires-of-the-undergrowth">Empires Of The Undergrowth</a>. One has a big frog in it, and the other has a big football. Easy. Also, this one has pvp. Any other notable features? Let’s ask the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287330/Empire_of_the_Ants/">Steam page</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p>Experience an immersive journey and defend your lands through tactical and strategic battles in an epic, microscopic world. Play as 103,683rd, an ant of the warrior caste with an inquisitive mind: explore the Federation and fight for it, conquering new territories. Exploring, strategizing, and forging alliances with the local wildlife will be crucial to emerge victorious from the many challenges lying ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here are a few features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Shape your strategy by choosing your roster wisely: starting, support, and super-predator legions.</li>
<li>Upgrade your nest’s tier to access new and stronger legions. Will you opt for the defensive Snail or the mobility of the Rhino Beetles?</li>
<li>Adapt your strategy by building the right chambers: build your economy, manage your legions, gather Information on the battlefield, gain new Powers, or strengthen your Defense.</li>
<li>Not enough space? Conquer other nests to expand your territory and get stronger.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>You’ll be doing all this in a “20 hour campaign”, based on Bernard Werber’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Ants_(novel)">novel of the same name</a>. When you’re done with that, there’s 1v1 matchmaking and three-way free-for-alls. If you’re undecided about this one, it releases in just a few days on the 7th of November, and I guarantee you there will be several let’s players doing the worst David Attenborough you’ve ever heard, alongside at least one doing a really good one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> update, released last night, accidentally introduces a few new issues - including chickens that mysteriously disappear.</p>
<p>The 1.6.9 update - which was released alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-version-16-console-release-date">1.6 for consoles</a> - adds a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">new friend to retrieve lost items and more</a>. However, there have been some cases of players losing their chickens when they start a new farm on the Meadowlands farm and open the door to the coop on the first day.</p>
<p>Stardew Valley creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has said that a fix for this, for the time being at least, is to make sure players leave the door to the coop "closed for one day". Then - not that he needed to but I love that he has - <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853521395080368514">Barone</a> blamed the chickens' disappearance on a "wild coyote" nosing about the farm on day one. What a cheeky blighter (the coyote, not Barone).</p>
<p>Barone has already released a patch - known as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/413150/view/4445708897933590775?l=english">Update 1.6.10</a> - on Steam and GOG that addresses the rogue chickens, as well as some crashes. This update will arrive on other platforms "as soon as possible", Barone said.</p>

<p>So, after all this is sorted, what is next for Barone? Earlier this year, the creator admitted he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-developer-has-not-touched-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-due-to-ongoing-update-work">hadn't actually touched his next game - Haunted Chocolatier - "in a long time"</a>, because his focus had been on Stardew Valley.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was first announced back in 2021</a>, with a cute trailer showing off its spooky chocolate-making, monster-stabbing, small town-living role-playing gameplay. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone previously said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, saying, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>

			<p>It's been a year and a half since PureDark <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-mod-for-elden-ring-is-out-now-delivering-substantial-performance-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> his Elden Ring NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation mod. The paid mod allowed GeForce RTX 40 Series owners a significant performance boost in the notoriously badly optimized game developed by FromSoftware.</p>
<p>However, everyone else without an RTX 40 Series GPU has been out of luck so far. That changes with the recently released free <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/6794?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR Frame Generation and Temporal Super Resolution (ERSS-FG) mod</a> by Nexus Mods user huutaiii.</p>
<p>This mod supports AMD FSR 3 Super Resolution and Frame Generation, NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA, and even Intel XeSS. The modder shared a few caveats: this is mutually exclusive with their previous ERSS2 mod (which did not support Frame Generation); the Frame Generation feature is not compatible with ReShade; and, most importantly, you can't play online on official servers with this mod enabled.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Here's the recommended installation method for this Elden Ring AMD FSR 3 mod:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Extract the attached file's content into the ELDEN RING\Game\ directory (including ERSS-FG.dll, dxgi.dll and the folder ERSS2; the file ERSSReShadeStub.addon can be removed).</em></li>
<li><em>Disable Easy Anti-Cheat, either by putting cmd /c start eldenring.exe &amp; rem %command% in launch options in Steam or by using some other tool.</em></li>
<li><em>For Steam Deck (Linux) users: cmd=(%command%); cmd[-1]="eldenring.exe"; WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b;dxgi=n,b" "${cmd[@]}"</em></li>
<li><em>Set Resolution in the game's Graphics menu to <span>.</span>r target resolution (i.e. your monitor's resolution)</em></li>
<li><em>Open the mod's configuration overlay with the Home key, set Frame Generation method to AMD FSR then restart, and set Super Sampling setting to the upscaling technology of your choice</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several known issues with the current release of this Elden Ring AMD FSR 3 mod, though:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Flickering global illumination, most visible in shaded areas</em><br>
<em><strong>Workarounds</strong>:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Restarting the game may make it go away temporarily</em></li>
<li><em>Using the GI Glitch Mitigation options in Advanced Settings -&gt; Frame Generation (which may reduce frame rate slightly depending on which option you select)</em></li>
<li><em>Rolling back NVIDIA GPU drivers to version 552.12</em></li>
<li><em>Using DXVK + VKD3D (doesn't support DLSS on Windows)</em></li>
<li><em>Setting Global Illumination to Low can reduce the intensity</em></li>
<li><em>Some reported that turning on Ray tracing can make the issue go away.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Game UI color is slightly off &amp; requires manual configuration in HDR</em></li>
<li><em>There may be some glitches on non-16:9 resolutions outside of the main 16:9 screen area</em></li>
<li><em>Conflicts with other overlay mods (using standalone installation method)</em></li>
<li><em>Cannot be loaded by adding to Special K plug-ins. It can run alongside SK with the included DXGI.dll loader albeit with some issues</em></li>
<li><em>FSR FG + Special K: if Elden Ring's screen mode is set to Full-screen, the game will constantly try to reset it's output swap chain causing flashes</em></li>
<li><em>The Special K overlay is invisible</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Even with these caveats and issues, this might still be useful for those who have been waiting for the right time to dive back into Elden Ring and play the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a>.</p>

            <p>
Early reactions to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> multiplayer range from frothing dislike through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-ops-6-leak-gives-naughty-players-get-access-to-the-max-payne-ish-omnimovement-system-for-the-first-time">omnimovement hype</a> to our own Ed Thorn's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review">dead-eyed appraisal</a> that it's "a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this." I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that "Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too." The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The fix for players spawning right after joining matches in progress, without the courtesy of a loadout selection screen, sits alongside "general spawn logic tuning across several maps for improved spawning". In the latest <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/10/bo6-preseason-patch-notes#nov4">Blopsblog</a>, the developers caution readers that "spawn tuning will be an ongoing process of taking in data, reviewing gameplay and making measured adjustments in the live environment", adding that "our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes." 
</p>
<p>
How safe can a spawn point be, before it starts to confer an unfair advantage? I'm interested to read more about how spawn systems work. I picture the Black Ops 6 spawn system as a genetically engineered octopus, floating in a tank over model of each map. The octopus has been specially trained to place spawn points on demand by touching the map with each tentacle, but being an octopus, it sometimes loses interest or decides to chew on a small model of an AC-130 gunship instead. They keep the octopi in the same room as the thousands of monkeys they've got trained to typewriters, striving to write the perfect Call Of Duty campaign. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_elVGGgW8">It was the blurst of times indeed</a>.
</p><p>
In the room along from the octopi/monkey chamber, there's a room full of budgerigars who dynamically alter the game's weapon balancing by screeching "assault rifle", "submachine gun" and "shotgun" at different volumes. The new patch makes some "early, general changes" to the effective ranges of assault rifles and SMGs. "For ARs, we are pulling in minimum damage ranges and lessening the impact of headshots at close range," it reads. "SMGs are receiving damage range increases to improve their mid-range effectiveness."
</p>
<p>
As for shotguns, shotgun slugs to the body will no longer cause one-hit kills for the foreseeable. The developers say that this particular shotgun attachment "performs better in hip fire than intended" - it's supposed "to offer an alternate playstyle for shotguns that trades close quarters effectiveness for improved range and precision".
</p>
<p>
As noted, the patch also temporarily donates a set portion of safehouse funds to campaign players affected by a glitch that causes "extreme positive or negative currency values". I do like Black Ops 6's safehouse. Wish there were more to it, really. I want to be able to play actual tunes on that piano. But I'll leave it to Brendy to deliver the final verdict, there - he's been working on our Black Ops 6 campaign review while Ed tackles the multiplayer.

            <p>
Nintendo has lowered its sales projections for Switch hardware and software, as the company faces one final Christmas focused on its current, aging platform.
</p>
<p>
Switch hardware sales were down 31 percent year-on-year for the three months ending 30th September. The company has now cut its total Switch sales forecast for the financial year to 12.5m, down from the 13.5m it expected previously.
</p>
<p>
After more than seven years on sale, the Switch stands at 146.04m units sold, just 8m shy of the Nintendo DS, the company's best-selling gaming device.

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, released just before the end of September, shifted 2.58m copies before the end of that month. 
</p>
<p>
Other recent releases to sell over a million copies include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario-2-thousand-year-door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> (1.94m) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> (1.57m).
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, the Switch's evergreen bestseller, sold another 2.31m copies, and remains by some margin the console's best-selling game. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's final sales update of 2024 paints a picture of a company on the cusp of announcing much-needed new hardware - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-year-fiscal-year">provided no new word on when that announcement might arrive</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, or whatever Nintendo eventually ends up calling it, is expected to finally launch in 2025 and will be announced before the end of March.

			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has witnessed a fantastic launch, probably the franchise's most successful entry, as it captured the attention of over half of the US Xbox Series S/X players.</p>
<p>Well, it won't be wrong to say that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has managed to put behind all the woes we had with Activision and partners in terms of their take on the franchise since the newest entry has managed to break all previous records, in terms of the anticipation and hype. During Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-fy25-q1-total-gaming-revenue-up-by-43-all-from-activision/">recent earnings call</a>, CEO Satya Nadella verified that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/">established new franchise records</a> and has been described as the "biggest" release of the Call of Duty series.</p>
<p>Based on an analysis by Circana CEO and analyst Mat Piscatella (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7suuurekr2l">via Bluesky</a>), it is now revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has managed to grasp the attention of "one out of every two Xbox Series S/X players," which is indeed a massive achievement for the franchise, given that the Game Pass inclusion has surely worked out for Activision and partners.</p>
<p><em>According to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, on Oct 23rd, 19% of US active Xbox Series players and 18% of US active PlayStation 5 players launched Call of Duty HQ. </em></p>
<p><em>On October 28th, 52% of active XBS players and 34% of active PS5 players did so. Both were all-time highs for Call of Duty HQ.</em></p>
<p>Despite Xbox users having an edge with Game Pass access, PlayStation users weren't left behind at all in the hype, as one-third of the active PS5 consumer base were involved in checking the title out, showing that Activision is getting love from all gaming platforms. Not just the US, but the title did manage to draw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/">largest traffic ever for a game in the UK</a>, and while we haven't seen any metrics surface, the indicators clearly show that the cumulative player count is going to be a phenomenal one.</p>
<p>It is surely exciting to see the Call of Duty franchise making a massive comeback, and the Xbox-Activision partnership has definitely catalyzed the increase in player count due to the ease of accessing the title through Game Pass.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 is Still Planned to be Announced Before April 2025, Says Nintendo]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-is-still-planned-to-be-announced-before-april-2025-says-nintendo.1027677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nintendo has announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 is still scheduled to be announced during this fiscal year.</p>



<p>The news came following Nintendo’s latest earnings call. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa announced that the company will “make an announcement about the successor of the Nintendo Switch this fiscal year.” This means that the company still currently intends to make the announcement by March 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Signs of fatigue over the original Nintendo Switch are beginning to show, too. During the same <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investor call</a>, Nintendo announced that the company is lowering its hardware forecast after sales declined in Q1-Q2 year-on-year by 31%. Nintendo now expects the Nintendo Switch to sell 12.5 million units in its fiscal year, down from its initial 13.5 forecast; a 10% reduction.</p>



<p>As for exactly when the Nintendo Switch 2 will be released remains to be seen, but earlier this year, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had already announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will not be released until Nintendo’s next fiscal year</a>, which starts April 1, 2025.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-prototype-designs-seemingly-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prototype designs of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> leaked online, including specifications for the new console, which will feature 12GB of RAM, HDMI 2.1 support, and even 256GB of internal storage. The latest rumors on the system claim that it will&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be backwards compatible and support 4K</a>&nbsp;resolution.</p>

That’s a 17% revenue drop and a whopping 69% profit drop versus the same quarter last financial year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that last year was a big one for Nintendo, with the release of the Super Mario Bros.

This year, however, has been notably lighter for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo sold 4.72 million Switch units in the six months ending September 30, down from the 6.84 million sold during the same period last year. That’s a drop of 31%.

Paper Mario Thousand-Year Door, released in May, sold 1.94 million units, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, released in June, sold 1.57 million units, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, released in September, “got off to a good start,” Nintendo said, with sales of 2.58 million units. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell incredibly well, with another 2.31 million units. It’s now up to an eye-watering 64.27 million sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, Nintendo failed to say anything about the Switch 2, but did say it plans to continue to push the Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By continuing to convey the appeal of Nintendo Switch, we try to not only put one system in every home, but several in every home, or even one for every person,” Nintendo said. “Another objective is to continually release new offerings so more consumers keep playing Nintendo Switch even longer and we can maximize hardware sales.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming Switch games include Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership later this week, and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD in January 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Anusak Laowilas/NurPhoto via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>If you were expecting to hear more about Nintendo's next console, which has been dubbed '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>', during today's latest financial report from the company, I am sorry I am going to have to disappoint you. The company has made no new announcements regarding its Switch successor.</p>
<p>It does still plan to share more on its next console before the end of this fiscal year, however. That all remains the same.</p>
<p>Following the release of the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241105_5e.pdf">latest earnings report</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa affirmed the next console will be announced by the end of March, 2025.</p>

<p>It seems unlikely that this announcement will happen before the end of the calendar year, however. According to Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda, making a new console announcement before January "has gotten quite difficult" for Nintendo, he told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/">Reuters</a>. "You would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical year-end shopping season," Yasuda reasoned.</p><p>We got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">official confirmation of Switch 2's existence back in May</a>, when Furukawa first said the company planned on sharing more on the upcoming console "this fiscal year". At this time, Furukawa tempered expectations, adding we would not be hearing any more about the Switch successor during its then scheduled summer Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>But, while we don't have an official look at the console, we know developers are now openly working on games for it. Meanwhile, several announcements recently have suggested games are coming to Nintendo's future hardware, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-laylee-remaster-headed-to-ps5-xbox-and-nintendo-platforms-so-switch-2">Yooka-Replaylee</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-gets-first-confirmed-release-in-my-time-at-portia-sequel">My Time At Evershine</a>.</p>
<p>It was once said Nintendo wanted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-successor-reportedly-due-late-2024">launch Switch 2 in late 2024</a>. Plans have, evidently, now shifted, and a report in August suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Nintendo's next console won't launch before April 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during last night's financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-cuts-switch-sales-forecast-as-the-wait-for-new-hardware-continues">Nintendo revised down its expectations for total Switch console and game sales</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>A new sole drop event has now started in Pokemon TCG Pocket, with players able to take part in the Lapras ex Drop Event. This event is focused on the solo battles portion of the game, where players face off against the AI in order to complete challenges. Much like other solo events, the Lapras ex Drop event has four tiers to it, which are beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16duP6ga_Q8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For the first two levels, beginner and intermediate, it seems the only rewards you get are tokens and shinedust. However, on the advanced and expert battles you get access to winning a Promo Pack A Series Vol.1 pack, which contains one of five promo cards. These are Butterfree, Pikachu, Mankey, Clefairy, or Lapras ex. You will only get one card out of these packs and I, unfortunately, got two Mankeys. Your luck may be better. This event is running until the 18th of November.</p>
<p>The Lapras ex drop event is running alongside the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/01/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-event-part-1-has-started/">Pokemon TCG Pocket Wonder Pick Event Part 1</a>, in which players have the opportunity to pick promo A Chansey and promo A Meowth from Wonder Picks. There is no other way to obtain either of these promo cards, so a lot of this will be on your luck at selecting the correct option when using a Wonder Pick. For those unfamiliar with Wonder Picks, this is an option where you can pick one of five overturned cards to add to your collection. You are limited to how many times you can do this in a day. For this Chansey and Meowth event, there are special Wonder Pick options where instead of five Pokemon cards, you have one of the promo cards with the other four options being accessories such as shop tickets.</p>

            <p>Beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> traumatic-childhood-em-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth">The Binding Of Issac: Rebirth</a> turned 10 yesterday, and it’s half off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/">Steam </a>to celebrate. What’s more, maker Edmund McMillen has announced that the foretold online co-op update is due on the 18th of this month, alongside a “considerable” balance update. Consider me considering the considerability of said considerable update!</p>

<p>“Isaac online will feature a full online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> mode (with completion markers) alongside a considerable balance update that heavily focuses on buffing items you guys believe are lackluster/bad,” <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303">Ximbled McMillen</a>. The game has had local mate mode for a while now, but BinHeads have been anticipating this online update since McMillen said it was coming “soon” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-binding-of-isaac-is-getting-online-multiplayer-soon">last year</a>.</p>
<p>“[Y]ou will be able to play with random matches or friends” - four of them - confirmed executive producer Tyrone Rodriguez <a href="https://x.com/tyronerodriguez/status/1707522206358761705">at the time</a>. Also confirmed were tracked winstreaks, the ability to load up specific seeds, and one item per player for boss rooms and treasure chests.</p><p>McMillen’s Xeet also features a load of concept art, boss designs, and storyboards, so worth having a looksie if you’re a real BumHead. “TBOI takes over people's lives, despite being a short and entirely beatable game, because every new combination of random enemies and random items manages to feel like a brand new adventure, infinitely more important than any you've had so far,” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review">wrote</a> Alec Meer (RPS in peace) back in 2014.</p>
<p>McMillen is currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> - a game I’ve been waiting for since it was announced over a decade ago. The last we saw of the turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> feline fuse ‘em up was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shaky-cam-footage-emerges-of-edmund-mcmillens-turn-based-cat-tics-mewgenics">this here shaky cam footage</a> last year. The creator has previously described the game as "like a bunch of things, but not like anything else. It really feels like Final Fantasy Tactics meets Pokémon meets some sort of D&amp;D-type adventure game, with an Animal Crossing hub". Stop. You had me at cats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
