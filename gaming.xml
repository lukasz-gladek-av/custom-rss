<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159846/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Imagine, if you will, an alternate timeline where 3D graphics never happened.</p>
<p>Instead, Sega's 'Super Scaler' concept — popularised in games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_super_hang-on">Hang-On</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_space_harrier">Space Harrier</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_out_run">Out Run</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_after_burner_ii">After Burner</a> — evolves to the point where 2D sprites can not only be scaled without any degradation in visual fidelity, but are capable of filling the entire screen. That future is basically what you're looking at when you play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/night_striker_gear">Night Striker Gear</a>, a sequel to Taito's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/operation_night_strikers">1989 coin-op</a>, which has been developed by M2 and its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Am2-shottriggers">ShotTriggers</a> team.</p>
<p>Directed by the legendary Hiroshi Iuchi (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/radiant_silvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ikaruga">Ikaruga</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/sin_and_punishment">Sin &amp; Punishment</a>), Night Striker Gear is conceptually the same as its forerunner; you control the INTER-GRAY, a flying car which dashes through a series of levels destroying enemies and taking down bosses before selecting a branching pathway to the next stage.</p>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159842/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The most obvious evolution here is the visuals, which are quite simply staggering. Everything is composed of 2D sprites, but they're of such high quality that even when viewed up close, the pixelation is barely noticeable. However, they scale and move with insane smoothness and speed, all of which delivers an experience which feels like a late '80s coin-op on steroids.</p>
<p>Factor in some excellent lighting, explosion and particle effects, and you've got a true visual feast (and one which sounds great, too – it has some fantastic music). Yet it's one that is curiously at odds with modern gaming's obsession with hyper-real 3D graphics.</p>
<p>M2 hasn't merely taken Night Striker's gameplay and spruced up the presentation; it has introduced plenty of additional features to make this sequel feel fresh and new.</p>
<p>You can now transform your INTER-GRAY craft into a robot (known as 'GEAR') which comes equipped with powerful homing shots. This state is only active for as long as your 'GEAR' gauge lasts; this is built up over time as you take down enemies or collect special power-ups.</p>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159847/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a risk-and-reward element at play here, as, when your GEAR gauge is full, it improves the firepower of your craft in its standard form. Transforming into robot mode makes boss encounters (of which there are two per stage) easier, but you'll lose the benefit of homing shots when you return to INTER-GRAY mode – so deployment of the GEAR is paramount to success.</p>
<p>Enemies attack in waves, and many of these include a red 'captain' – take them out, and the entire wave is destroyed, lending things a welcome sense of tactical depth. Your shield is capable of taking five hits by default, but you'll gain additional levels (or replenish spent shields) if you take down a particular enemy and when you complete each stage.</p>
<p>As well as the standard mode (which offers three difficulty settings), you have 'Pacifist Mode', where your offensive capabilities are removed and the goal is simply to avoid incoming fire. This might sound pointless, but this mode is, in reality, the perfect way to hone your evasive skills for the 'main' mode. Much of the challenge in Night Striker Gear revolves around avoiding enemy shots, and there's no better way of perfecting those skills than in Pacifist Mode.</p>
<figure><a title="Night Striker Gear Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159841/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are multiple endings to encounter depending on which route through the game you take, and accessing the final 'G' zone requires you to fulfil specific objectives (as far as I can gather, getting a 'Wipe Out' bonus on any level – killing every single enemy – unlocks it). Add in unlockable modes and there's a lot of longevity on offer here – much more than the seemingly simple premise might suggest.</p>
<p>It's also an incredibly challenging experience, especially on 'Normal' and 'Hard' settings – so much so that Iuchi has taken a leaf out of his Radiant Silvergun playbook by increasing your available stock of continues (three to begin with) the longer you play. This not only encourages repeat runs but also serves to make things a little easier as time goes on. Online leaderboards further enhance the game's long-term appeal.</p>
<p>While Night Striker Gear's twitch gameplay is quite straightforward — which should come as no surprise, given its arcade heritage — the stern challenge, multiple routes (and endings), online rankings and unlockable content make it a surprisingly deep package, especially when you take the low price into account.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Space Harrier-style gameplay might not be to everyone's tastes, but the visuals are absolutely jaw-dropping, and it's almost worth the asking price alone in order to experience them. While Night Striker Gear's appeal won't last forever, it's such an incredible audio-sensory thrill ride that you can easily forgive it for any shortcomings relating to its longevity.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of this style of game and love chasing high scores, then this is a near-essential purchase. Like so many of Sega and Taito's 'Super Scaler' efforts from the '80s and '90s, Night Striker Gear is one of those games you simply <em>have</em> to experience at least once, even if the ride doesn't last forever.</p></section>

			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is finally here, and before you jump into Obsidian Entertainment's new space-faring adventure in its dystopian world, this guide will help give you a leg-up with some tips and tricks to survive and thrive in The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<p>It should go without saying that I won't be delving into any story spoilers, but incase it needed to be said, there it is. If you want to check out more about The Outer Worlds 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/">then go look at my full review for the game.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-tips-and-tricks-guide">The Outer Worlds 2 Tips and Tricks Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-abl-always-be-looting">ABL: Always Be Looting</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There's no such thing as carrying too much or your bag being too heavy and making you move slower in The Outer Worlds 2, so it's in your best interest to pick up everything that's not nailed down. Loot it all! Show no remorse! Plunder every corpse, unlocked box, locked box, safe, anything you can get your hands on.</p>



<p>But be aware when you're trying to grab something that'll be marked as 'Stolen.' You can steal without repercussions so long as there's no one nearby to see you do it. If there's a witness, however, you'll lose standing with whichever faction you've just stolen from. Not much at first, but keeping it up will make it all the more difficult to go into towns and settlements safely and without being attacked. </p>



<h3 id="h-preach-speech">Preach Speech</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Realistically, you can build your character however you like, putting all your points into a few, multiple, or even just one skill on your journey to the level cap at level 30. Each time you level up you get to two Skill Points to spend however you like, and making those choices are all part of the RPG side of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<p>But if I could make one recommendation, it would be to level up your Speech skill. Talking to people is arguably half of the whole gameplay experience in The Outer Worlds 2, and while different skills can give you different conversation options, Speech is the skill to level to solve most problems without violence, convince others of your point of view, and, frankly, the one that gives you more interesting conversation options.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-underestimate-the-power-of-shock-and-plasma">Don't Underestimate the Power of Shock and Plasma</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With how many different weapons there are in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll practically be tripping over them and the weapon modifications you can make. Tweaking and adjusting your loadout is key to ensuring that you can survive any encounter you have.</p>



<p>But don't put too much stock into the overall damage output number that appears with each weapon. Pay much more attention to the kinds of elemental damage you can do with different elemental modifications, specifically Plasma and Shock.</p>



<p>A weapon with Plasma damage that technically has a lower overall damage number compared to a weapon without Plasma damage will do more damage overall, with how Plasma effects can stack, and with how Plasma does damage to enemies over time. The same goes for Shock damage, which is especially effective against the automechanical enemies you'll face.</p>



<p>You're essentially always better off going with elemental damage for your weapons over base damage stats.</p>



<h3 id="h-some-companions-are-more-useful-than-others">Some Companions are More Useful Than Others</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Niles in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Over the course of your journey in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll recruit six companions who join you on your adventures, with two of them coming outside of the ship with you. Each of them can help you in different ways, with some being more useful in combat while others are better to have around when you're exploring. </p>



<p>Again, picking which companions join you when you get out of your ship is part of the role-playing you'll do in The Outer Worlds 2, but one of the first two companions you get in the game is arguably the most useful to keep around in your party at all times, and that's Niles.</p>



<p>He's great for taking heat off you in combat, but where his usefulness really lies is outside of it, because you'll always be able to turn to him and craft ammo, weapon mods, armor mods, updates for your companions; pretty much anything you can do at a Workbench, Niles can do for you on the go.</p>



<p>Yes, you'll be able to find Workbenches at different spots in The Outer Worlds 2, but when you're in the middle of trekking across one of the planets you explore in the Arcadia system, particularly early on in the game, it's easy to find yourself low on ammo and health. Having Niles with you means you can use the resources you've collected to keep yourself going, without having to fast-travel back to a town to restock and make the trek back out to where you were, which you'll have to do on foot because running across the map is the only way to get from place to place until you've unlocked fast travel points.</p>



<h3 id="h-do-drugs-keep-your-health-up">Do Drugs, Keep Your Health Up</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To clarify, I'm not actually advocating you do drugs in real life. But within The Outer Worlds 2, your inhaler, which is essentially a toxic drug that refills your health bar and can kill you if you overdose on it, is an important element to keep an eye on.</p>



<p>Specifically, you'll want to keep an eye on how many Inhaler Charges you have at any given time. Running out means you can't heal while in combat, even if you know you have food resources in your inventory, ready for you to eat. You can eat them outside of combat, but not during. Your Inhaler is the only way to stay alive in the middle of a fight, and you'll always want to make sure you have enough charges to get you through any situation.</p>



<p>Basically, you'll want to craft as many charges as possible and/or purchase and collect as many resources as possible to give you additional charges. Right from the beginning of the game, you can have as many charges as you have the resources for, so stocking up on as many as possible ensures you'll be able to get through any fight, so long as you give yourself the time and space to let the charge heal you, and let your toxicity drain. </p>



<p>Speaking of toxicity drain, another point is to find armour that drains your toxicity faster as soon as possible. Draining your toxicity level faster means you can use your Inhaler sooner and more often in combat, to help you get through any situation. </p>

              <p><span>Ever since </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>stopped including every monster in every game with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fans-i-need-yall-to-shut-up-about-dexit-1839949110"><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i></a><span>, someone’s favorite probably gets left behind in each new release. Sure, they might show up in the next game or two, but there are over 1000 of these guys now, and everyone’s bound to get benched now and then. Up until last week, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/only-three-pokemon-are-catchable-in-every-game-but-not-1850461272"><span>only three Pokémon could claim to be catchable in every single RPG</span></a><span>.

This means without trades, hacks, or anything outside the scope of the game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-will-not-mandate-the-use-of-ai-confirms-phil-spencer.1334269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Phil Spencer has revealed that there is no top-down mandate to use AI for Xbox.</p>



<p>Some new details about Xbox have surfaced recently through an interview with the president, Sarah Bond. Bond recently stated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-says-console-exclusives-are-antiquated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idea of exclusive games is now antiquated</a>. She also confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-confirms-series-x-s-successors-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Series X/S successors</a> are in development. Now, a new interview with Phil Spencer talks about Xbox’s approach to AI. </p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-lets-creative-teams-choose-whether-they-want-to-use-ai">Xbox Lets Creative Teams Choose Whether They Want to Use AI</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://in.ign.com/xbox-series-s/245018/news/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-on-ai-use-much-more-operational-than-it-is-in-the-creative-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, during a panel at the Paley International Council Summit in Palo Alto, California (moderated by Double Fine Studio Head Tim Schafer), Phil Spencer spoke about the use of AI at Xbox. Spencer first spoke about how most use is focused on the “security and protection” of their networks. He added that the scale has grown so much that people alone cannot ensure safety. </p>



<p>Which is why they use AI to keep a check on the conversation and topics, protect child accounts, see who gets to talk to those people, and whether the account is locked down by parents or guardians who are setting those controls. </p>



<p>On the creative side of things at Xbox, AI use is left to the teams. Spencer explains that he has&nbsp;“found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier, and any top-down mandate that ‘Thou must use a certain tool’…is not really a path to success.” The process is to make tools available for the teams and let things “organically percolate”. </p>

<p>It seems that 2023’s Game of the Year, Baldur’s Gate 3, could make its way to the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>The Switch 2 is set to receive a whole bunch of new titles in the coming days, with Metroid Prime 4 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows </a>arriving in December 2025, followed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-nintendo-switch-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 anniversary edition in 2026</a>. It seems that the next title Nintendo could be looking to add to its third-party collection is Larian Studios’ critically acclaimed hit. </p>

<p>The talk about Baldur’s Gate 3 coming to the Switch 2 originates from NateTheHate’s recent reply on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980357667035181154" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). In one of his recent replies, the insider was asked whether he had any updates for Red Dead Redemption 2’s launch for the platform. To which he replied, stating he doesn’t have anything new on RDR2, but he has “heard something on BG3 for SW2”. However, he needs “more verification” before he can share anything. In a later reply, Nate stated that he will update on this topic soon. </p>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 is a solid choice for Nintendo Switch 2 as it’s one of the most decorated titles out there. In April 2024, the title became the first game to win Game of the Year at all five major award ceremonies, including the Golden Joystick Awards, the Game Developers’ Choice Awards, the DICE Awards, the BAFTAs, and The Game Awards. The game has also received a lot of post-launch love from the developers, including loads of new content and enhancements to improve the gameplay experience. </p>

Given EA and Battlefield Studios are yet to make any announcements about this so close to that date, a shadowdrop is expected.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While EA is yet to comment on this particular leak, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-highlights-multiplayer-combat-in-latest-bf-labs-leak">it’s seen various gameplay clips emerge from playtests of the battle royale</a>. And today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-community-update-reveals-long-list-of-gameplay-changes-ahead-of-season-1-and-battle-royale-launch">it outlined gameplay changes coming to battle royale ahead of its release</a>, based on feedback to those playtests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s what BF Studios said today:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a quick look at what changes you may notice the next time you play:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Close-range TTK</strong>: We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li><li><strong>Armor Changes</strong>: Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li><li><strong>World Improvements</strong>: We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li><li><strong>Vehicle Balance</strong>: We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">We have also been working on providing smoother performance overall. We have identified and addressed a range of issues that affected performance that we simply couldn’t have done without our players’ involvement in the tests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait, it’s worth checking out the Battlefield 6 update 1.1.1.0 patch notes, below, which go into detail on the changes coming to the game with Season 1. Finally, be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/All_Multiplayer_Maps"><u>full list of all currently available Battlefield 6 multiplayer maps</u></a>.

<p>Some of the improvements revolve around "core movement and animations," which include smoothing landings, speeding up stance transitions, and reducing "bouncing" issues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Silver Pines is a Twin Peaks-inspired 2D survival horror metroidvania game (how often does one of those come along) that'll arrive on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 sometime in 2026 from developer Wych Elm Games and publisher Team17. </p>



<p>The game follows Red Walker, a private investigator who has been hired to find Eddie Velvet, a musician who has mysteriously vanished, though, as you might already suspect, while looking for Velvet, Walker begins to uncover a deeper plot and darker mystery behind Velvet's disappearance.</p>



<p>Its art style and survival horror gameplay make it seem like a truly unique debut title from this new indie team. Silver Pines was first announced during the Galaxies Showcase yesterday, and is an easy addition for indie games to look out for as we inch closer to 2026.</p>

<iframe title="Silver Pines | Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_PVwrQivKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You'll be fighting off shadows while solving puzzles to try and get to the bottom of Velvet's disappearance, which could also lead to Walker's own redemption, as he struggles to deal with a dark history of his own.</p>



<p>We get a lot of horror games, but few of them look like this. Silver Pines seems to be dripping with atmosphere and narrative potential, and it'll be particularly interesting to see how its metroidvania navigational focus plays into the story it's trying to tell.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we will hear more about this game soon and will be able to jump into Silver Pines in time for Halloween 2026. It's always exciting when a new indie studio puts out a trailer like this with a game looking like it could just be the dark horse hit yet for next year.</p>



<p>If you're looking for more horror games, and ones that you don't have to wait until next year to play, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/lovecraftian-survival-horror-shooter-beneath-release-date-pc-consoles/">you should check out Beneath</a>, a new Lovecraftian horror shooter that's out on PC and consoles in just a few days from the time of this writing on October 27. There's also of course Bloober Team's latest release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Cronos: The New Dawn, which you can read Wccftech's full review of by Francesco De Meo, here.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has hit a major download milestone since launching almost a year ago, and that there are some big bonuses in the offing for players to celebrate the game's impending first birthday.</p>

<p>As announced in an <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Trading-Card-Game-Pocket-Celebrates-Its-First-Anniversary-and-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has been downloaded over 150 million times across Android and iOS since its launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date" rel="nofollow">on October 23rd last year</a>.</p>

<p>While it's certainly true that not everyone who downloaded the game will still be playing it (and still fewer may have spent actual money on anything within the app), it was reported back in December that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">a real moneyspinner for developer DeNA</a>.</p>

<p>New missions and promo reissue events will also be arriving alongside these packs, and you can look forward to new in-app updates landing soon as well, including the new Share feature, an expanded range of cards to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow">traded</a>, and more.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's a digital version of the popular&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>trading card game in which you can open digital booster packs, trade cards with your friends, and battle using custom-built (or pre-built!) decks.</p>

<p>Since launch, various expansions have been released for the game, including the likes of the Gen 2-themed&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em></a>, the Eevee-centric&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow"><em>Eevee Grove</em></a>, and the cosmic&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>set, among many others.</p>




<p>The game has also been the subject of controversy and criticism; when the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>launched, an immersive art card was pulled from&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>over <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">accusations of plagiarism</a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the trading feature was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens" rel="nofollow">met with widespread criticism</a> when it was first added to the game, prompting DeNA and The Pokemon Company to award players free trade tokens by way of an apology.</p>

              <p>What do you expect from a sequel? That’s a question I’ve been asking myself ever since <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-sim-2-trailer-release-campaign-splitscreen-1851769691">the first trailer</a> for the follow-up to 2022’s glorious&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, which showed off a lot more of what has come before, but with slightly prettier graphics. Now that I’ve spent a good six hours playing the released version of <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, and having a thoroughly good time doing so, I’m still pondering the same question. Because while I’m delighted to have a whole load of new dirty buildings and vehicles to spray, I really don’t feel like I’m playing a whole new game.</p> <p>To describe 2022’s original is to describe 2025’s&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>. It’s a game about jet-washing enormous structures that are covered in dirt and mud, with a growing variety of jets, nozzles and sprays. Your job is to remove every last speck of dirt, at which point you get paid, can buy more gear, and then move on to the next project. It should be the dumbest thing, and yet it proves outstandingly soothing, even cathartic, as you methodically make a gross thing get shiny and clean. And while I’m delighted to report <em>PW2</em> improves on the original in a bunch of different ways, what this amounts to is tweaks, streamlining the more fussy and less enjoyable aspects, and fixing the weirdness of how the first game handled soap. All very welcome, but none of it revolutionary. This is a refinement, not a step forward, and that leaves me in the peculiar position of being very happy playing the game, while still fundamentally disappointed to not have something <em>new</em>.</p>

  <p>Given that I don’t have any big new concepts to introduce, let’s get right on to talking about those improvements. First up, while the menus are still ludicrously convoluted, the very worst aspect of the first game’s store is gone: soap. In <em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, you needed to buy refills for all manner of different types of detergent for different dirty surfaces—costly refills that lasted literally seconds, and I still suspect made little to no difference at all. You could sort of convince yourself it made a brick wall clean a bit faster, but it could just as easily have been a placebo effect. Now that’s all gone, and soap is just a thing you always have. In fact, it’s a single button press to swap between your washer and your soap-sprayer, with suds collecting on dirty surfaces in a very satisfying way. It’s something that the first game should have done.</p>

 <p>Oh, and it now makes a difference. You’ll occasionally find bits of stubborn dirt, especially on glass, that won’t just spray off with water. So click, soap, click, spray, and now it’ll go. It adds a tiny extra element, and its unfussy and rewarding to do. It’s something the first game should have done.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638868" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638868"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638868">© FuturLab / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Next up is a more rational use of your home base. In the first game you’d occasionally wash people’s vehicles in your own garage, and the game made play of the fact that you owned this business and building, but in the end it was only scenery. While it honestly doesn’t add anything significant, your business’s offices are really nicely used in <em>PW2</em>. They’re explorable, and you can spend your money on furniture and trinkets to decorate the space—completely pointless, but with the lovely bonus of everything you buy being utterly filthy (where are you shopping?!), and needing you to powerwash them clean first. Upstairs are your offices, including shelves covered in trinkets based on each completed job that let you return to play them again outside of story mode, and then a large map of the area from which you can choose story and bonus missions. Or you can eschew this entirely and just access the jobs from the menu as before. (But if you did, you’d miss out on playing with your three pet cats.) It’s something the first game should have done.</p>

 <p>Beyond this…um. Come on, there has to be something else…Oh! You can move the ladders and frames around more easily, and while it still seems to be using the same broken tech that has them refuse to be put down in completely legitimate places but happy to be placed so they’re clipped through walls, it’s all better to use. Those huge frames with all the steps now have ladders on the outside so you can rapidly reach the top, and there are also mechanical cherry pickers for reaching far higher. It’s all stuff the first game should have done.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638865" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638865"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638865">© FuturLab / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, it’s also a prettier game. Not only is everything more detailed and better lit, but there are nice effects such as little animations of splattered dirt as you clean, and both water and soap effects that make them look as though they’re flowing. They’re not though, and that’s such a damned shame, because some actual physics was my number one wish for this sequel. It’s aesthetically pleasing, but you still have nothing like water trickling down surfaces, or mud puddling at the bottom to be washed away, or any of the seemingly obvious features to add to a sequel.</p>

 <p>That was, in fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-2-dlc-clean-dirt-futurlab-1851773438">one of two elements I suggested a <em>PowerWash</em> sequel would definitely have to add</a>. The other, and it’s far more damning that this hasn’t improved, is the way the game either has a still very dirty surface suddenly PING! clean before you’re done washing it, or has you hunting down the single pixel of dirt on a railing before it’ll let you move on. My theory on this in the first game was that it must be based on the percentage of dirt remaining on any section—perhaps deciding a surface is clean if you’ve cleared maybe 98 percent of the dirt. So if you have a huge flat area of wall, that remaining two percent is incredibly visible and annoying when you’re not allowed to clear it, while on a tiny feature it’s a microscopic speck that’s infuriating to find. And, maddeningly, it’s exactly the same here. I don’t know how to make video games, but I still believe that changing the math from “percentage of total surface” to “percentage of total surface relative to size” cannot be an insurmountable problem.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000638866" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638866"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638866">© FuturLab / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’m incredibly aware of just how ridiculous I sound, picking apart these elements in a lighthearted game about washing playgrounds, with a storyline about some gems being stolen from a giant merman statue whose magic beam had been preventing a volcano from erupting. Not least considering that I’m thoroughly enjoying the game! But then, I’m still mostly at a loss as to how this isn’t just a giant DLC pack for the first game with some necessary UI improvements. Or as we used to say in the olden days, an expansion pack.</p> <p>So yes, please, if you were for some reason waiting for my blessing to spend your $25 on&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> (or to download it from Game Pass I guess), then yes, go right ahead! Heck, $25 would be a great price for an expansion pack of this enormous size! This is very much <em>PowerWash Simulator But Slightly Better</em>, and that’s a good thing to have. It’s not a sequel though, really, is it? Is it? I don’t bloody know.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> Season 1 is just a few days away, but Battlefield Studios is already looking to make changes ahead of time while laying out a path for future updates. Towards that end, the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-changes-detailed-before-it-even-launches/1100-6535682/" data-ref-id="1100-6535682">shared the improvements</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode</a> before it even launched. Now, the rest of the upcoming improvement plans have been released.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981707319550341305" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Studios</a>, its current focus is on improving the game's overall performance and enhancing the combat experience. The following updates are now active:</p><h3>Live Now</h3><ul><li><strong>Custom Search:</strong> We’ve made some adjustments to improve how accurately matchmaking aligns with your selected map and mode preferences. The system still maintains flexibility to support reasonable queue times, so players with more specific selections may notice slightly longer waits. We’ll keep monitoring Custom Search performance and continue fine-tuning as needed.</li><li><strong>Vehicle Spawn Bug:</strong> We recently deployed a targeted backend change to address an issue where vehicles could sometimes fail to spawn as expected across certain maps and modes. The current results have shown that it has greatly reduced the number of occurrences and started to improve the balance issues on some map/mode combinations. We are aware of a few outliers that this fix did not address, and we’re working on a fix to resolve these outstanding issues. We also saw that this backend change had a slightly positive impact on Breakthrough win rates, but we are working on further balancing changes that are meant to be more impactful and bring the win rates into a better state.</li><li><strong>Portal Server Availability:</strong> Earlier this week, we made XP adjustments for Community Experiences. In case you missed it, check out the details</li></ul><p>The dev team went on to say that upcoming changes are planned for refining player movement and enhancing the sight stability during certain character animations. Battlefield Studios also acknowledged that earning XP in Escalation and King of the Hill isn't always working and the team is looking into that issue. The devs went on to share a number of updates and adjustments that are currently being considered:</p><ul><li><strong>Class Assignment - Assault 1</strong>: Get kills while using the Adrenaline Injector - 30 to 3</li><li><strong>Class Assignment - Engineer Expert 3</strong>: Repair Vehicles in a Match - From 6000 to 1000</li><li><strong>Weapon Assignment - Deadeye 2</strong>: Get headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles - from 150 to 5</li></ul><p>A later update will reduce the 200m distance. Player complaints about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-biggest-enemy-may-be-the-in-game-sun/1100-6535525/" data-ref-id="1100-6535525">the blinding light in Battlefield 6</a> are being considered for fixes that will reduce the effect when looking outdoors. That issue and other visibility problems are in line for wider fixes later in Season 1's life cycle.</p><p>Season 1 Update 1 is going to arrive on October 28, which will include changes to the game's weapon dispersion. This is meant to ensure that every weapon is accurate within its intended performance range. The team also fixed bugs that negatively affected dispersion when coming out of movement.</p><p>Battlefield Studios went on to explain its rationale behind closing the XP farm servers in Server Browser and Community Experiences. The team believed they were detracting from the rest of the Portal experiences, but promised to keep adding updates "to support healthier matchmaking and better overall experiences in Portal.".</p><p>The following updates were made today:</p><ul><li>Verified Experiences with “Bot Backfill” disabled continue to grant Full Progression and XP.</li><li>Custom Experiences will continue earning reduced progression, regardless of whether bots are active. This keeps creative freedom and allows you to express yourself within Portal while maintaining progression balance.</li></ul><p>Finally, Battlefield Studios noted that Battlefield Labs is going on hiatus as it focuses on releasing Season 1. Battlefield Labs will return at some point in the future, and the studio added that "it was invaluable in how much it helped us prepare for the launch of Battlefield 6."</p><p>So far, Battlefield 6 has been massive financial success, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">more than 7 million copies sold</a>. The game recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-most-popular-steam-games-of-all-time/2900-6301/">hit a peak concurrent-player record</a> of more than 747,000 players.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-has-hit-5-8-million-sales-and-half-of-them-are-on-switch-2.1334206/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_pressreleases_20251023_2.pdf">announced</a> that Pokémon Legends: Z-A has quickly reached 5.8 million copies sold through its first week, making it the fifth fastest-selling Pokémon game of all time. Perhaps more interesting is that around half of those sales have come from Nintendo Switch 2 owners, showing just how strong the initial sales of the console have been.</p>
<p>Of the games that Legends: Z-A is lagging behind – as noted by <a href="https://xcancel.com/pierre485_/status/1981599907262714267">games sales tracker Pierre485</a> – all of them are Nintendo Switch games – Scarlet &amp; Violet leads the bunch at 10 million in 3 days, Arceus had 6.5 million in 3 days, Sword &amp; Shield had 6 million in 3 days, matched by&nbsp;Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl.</p>


<p>The Switch 2 has been the best-selling console of all time through its opening months, and with such strong early adoption, it’s natural that some of the keenest Pokémon gamers are also then making the jump, leading to that rough 50:50 player split.</p>
<p>You do have to wonder if some of the issues that plagued Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet hampered some of the interest for Z-A, with that game having significant performance issues on the original Switch, or perhaps being a “Legends” branded spin-off make this feel less essential than a traditional dual game release.</p>
<p>But, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is one of the biggest, most impactful gameplay shakeups to the series to date. Taking place entirely within Lumiose City from Pokémon X &amp; Y, the big shift comes with the battle system, which has been transformed with real time battles. There’s also now a day-night cycle with tougher battles at night.</p>

<p>Nic was effusive with his praise of the game, saying in our review, “Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a game that really holds your attention. The spiritual successor to Legends Arceus, it’s learned from the mistakes of the distant past and beautifully shows what city life is like in the Pokémon universe. I can see myself playing this for another hundred hours as I finish my Pokédex, shiny hunt and generally have a great time. This is easily the best Pokémon game on the market.”</p>

			<p>Improvisational theatre can be a bit hit and miss, depending on the direction the actors decide to take a story in the moment. At its best theatre can be a place that tells excellent stories across genres, while at its worst things can make no sense leading to disappointment. I was only half aware what to expect when lifting the curtain on Once Upon a Jester, and I was surprised from start to finish with the heart it has.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Upon a Jester - PS5 &amp; XBSX|S Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-nag8ey1qQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once Upon a Jester follows Jester &amp; Sok, a couple of thieves from Dorp Town who come up with a plan to enter a theatre competition in an attempt to steal a diamond from the royal palace. To get into the palace, the duo first need to perform shows in three different towns and gain fifteen flower bouquets from each location. To get the bouquets, though, Jester &amp; Sok need to perform plays that will appeal to the crowd, picking up clues on how to do so by exploring the towns each day.</p>


<p>Each town is rather small and only has a couple of people to interact with per day, but speaking to them and looking around the environment gives you clues on what the people want to and don’t want to see. One day, they may be in the mood for drama but absolutely do not want music, while another day they will want a love story or action. Once you have worked out what the town wants, Jester can put together a poster with stickers, of which more are unlocked through the game, and then start the show with Sok.</p>


<p>There are only a few shows to unlock, but you can take them down different routes, picking options which correspond to the different genres. You might put on a play about a prince facing off against a dragon, but if the audience is looking for romance, then Jester will have to flirt with the Sok’s dragon instead of fighting him. There are some genuinely funny moments both on and off stage in Once Upon a Jester, and the whole game just brought a smile with its absurdity.</p>
<p>While the plays are the main focus, the moments off stage can be just as funny and it is almost like you are watching another play as minor characters get introduced. The story is pretty predictable but the journey is so earnest, warm, and humorous that that is not a big takeaway.</p>

<p>Once Upon a Jester looks a bit like a 2D cartoon show with all characters having different styles to them, and environments that look bright and colourful. Music also plays a huge role in Once Upon a Jester, with a number of catchy songs throughout that can lift your spirits. In some of the plays you will play music by having to press and hold a button for period of time. There are other actions in the plays too that are essentially quick time events, but these can be a bit hit and miss. However, the misses are also weaved into the narrative so if you mess up Jester will mess up on stage which can bring shows to a premature end.</p>

		Once Upon a Jester is surprising game for me and I do recommend it, especially if you are looking for something comedic and that is only a few hours long. It might be over rather quickly, but will stay with you for quite a while.	</p></div>

              <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have some good news. Soon, you won’t have to inject yourself over and over with magic soldier juice and kill over two dozen people to unlock a spawn beacon in the recently released online FPS <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">Battlefield 6</a>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>In <em>Battlefield 6,</em> there are numerous <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Battlefield_6_Assignments">in-game challenges</a> to complete that provide various rewards. Some of these aren’t much to write home about, like a camo skin or some extra XP. However, other rewards are extremely useful and offer powerful gadgets or gear. For example, to unlock the Assault’s spawn beacon, a device that lets others spawn in at that spot, you have to complete one of these in-game challenges. And some of these, like the aforementioned spawn beacon challenge, are a real pain in the ass. Thankfully, EA has confirmed that big changes are coming soon to alleviate some of these annoying grinds.</p>

 <p>On October 24, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981707319550341305">the <em>Battlefield</em> devs published a blog post</a> announcing some minor changes that have been recently made to the game and teased some bigger tweaks coming over the course of the online shooter’s first season. Among the updates is the news that many challenges will be made easier to complete starting in season one. Here are the challenges EA specifically revealed will be tweaked in the post:</p>

 <ul data-offset-key="7itjf-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="ck3kq" data-offset-key="a1edv-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="a1edv-0-0">Class Assignment – Assault 1 – Get 30 kills while using the Adrenaline Injector – Changing to 3 kills</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="ck3kq" data-offset-key="98fhh-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="98fhh-0-0">Class Assignment – Engineer Expert 3 – Repair Vehicles for 6,000 health in a match – Changing to 1,000 health</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="ck3kq" data-offset-key="92rjp-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="92rjp-0-0">Weapon Assignment – Deadeye 2 – Get 150 headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles – Changing to 5 kills and distance requirement will be reduced, too</span></p> </li> </ul> <p>These are just the ones EA revealed. Others are being tweaked, too. And that’s great, as some of these challenges were incredibly annoying. I recently completed the Assault challenge involving the injector, and it was like pulling teeth. The injector currently sucks in <em>Battlefield 6,</em> as it doesn’t last long and takes forever to use. But the spawn beacon is a very valuable tool, so I spent time grinding for it and hated the experience. Talking to friends who play <em>BF6</em>, they have had similar issues with the challenges sucking the fun out of the game, so I think these tweaks are smart. Also, maybe EA could make the injector actually good one day in a future update? Just a thought.</p>

 <p>Beyond the challenge tweaks, the devs are also planning some changes for player movement in an effort to make the game feel more consistent, but without changing the “pace” and “core feel” of how <em>BF6</em> plays now. “These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel,” explained the devs in the update post.</p> <p>You can also expect some more fixes for weapon bloom issues, an ongoing problem in the game, and changes to lighting and brightness, which will hopefully help players who keep being blinded by the sun when stepping outside. There are also some notes in here about <em>BF6</em>‘s battle royale mode, which doesn’t officially have a release date, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-datamine/">rumors are swirling</a> that it will <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">drop on October 28, alongside season one.</a> We’ll see if that happens. For now, I’m just happy people won’t have to grind for that damn spawn beacon when these <em>BF6</em> season one changes start rolling out across consoles and PC later this month.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-new-battle-royale-mode.1334191/</guid>

<p>A fresh story has revealed that Battlefield: RedSec is the name for the rebranded battle royale game mode coming in Battlefield 6. ‘Firestorm’ is now a thing of the past, and BF 6 is gearing up for its strongly rumored October 28 battle royale shadow drop.</p>



<p>We’ve known for weeks that Battlefield 6 is getting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> mode. It features an innovative insta-death circle mechanic, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datamine revealed that the Battle Royale is to release on October 28</a>. Now, we’ve learned the new game mode’s full title. </p>

<figure><figcaption>It will be war. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Get ready to enter Battlefield: RedSec! </p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>‘s exclusive story, we’ve learned that this is the new name for EA’s rebranded, free-to-play battle royale mode in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Here’s what they’ve said about the news:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“EXCLUSIVE: The F2P Battlefield 6 battle royale is officially named “Battlefield: RedSec”. Releasing October 28th as previously reported, however, it looks like there won’t be any trailers or official announcements until the 28th itself, instead of a day before. Full on shadowdrop.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This doesn’t alter the gameplay in any way, but it is a cool name. It’s unclear if this is a way to get clear of Firestorm and start anew, or if Battlefield Studios is simply looking for a fresh relaunch.</p>



<p>Either way, the shadow drop is looking less like a shadow drop and more like a surprise birthday party where everyone knows it’s happening. Still, EA will be looking to right the wrongs of Firestorm and hope Battlefield: RedSec is the start of something special.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Shoot, loot, and level up with these codes.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pixel Quest is a brand new 2D bullet hell RPG, where you'll face an onslaught of foes across biomes that range from the beach to the desert. The Third Dimension has been destroyed by 1x1x1x1, and now the Robloxians will need to work together to protect the pixelated 2D land of Robloxia. There are over 70 quests to complete, and legendary loot to obtain that will make it far easier to eviscerate hordes of enemies. With so much to do, you'll want some codes to make use of.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Working Pixel Quest Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are all the currently active Pixel Quest codes. Be sure to redeem them before they expire!</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>LUCKYDAY</strong> - 1x Gold Clover, 2x EXP Booster, 1x Medium Dungeon Key, 3x Defense Infusion</li><li><strong>PQDISCORD2025</strong> - Wumpus Skin</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Use Pixel Quest Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Redeeming Pixel Quest codes is a straightforward process. Launch the experience and complete the tutorial if you haven't already done so. When you're in the main hub, here are the steps you need to follow:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Locate the chat box on the bottom left of the screen. It says "To chat click here or press / key".</li><li>Click or press the / key and then press / again. This will bring up a list of commands.</li><li>Type code, so it now says /code in your text box.</li><li>Copy and paste the code from the article and enter it into the box, <strong>e.g. /code PQDISCORD2025</strong></li><li>Hit enter.</li><li>You'll then see a message in the chat that tells you if the code has been redeemed successfully, and what the reward is.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Claim Gifts from You Gift Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Some codes will give you rewards that you need to claim from your Giftbox. On the righthand side of the screen, you'll see a yellow and red gift box. Click on this and you'll be automatically transported to the southeast corner of the main hub. The Gift Box menu will also automatically open, so you can drag them into your inventory.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Find Skins</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you receive a skin via a code, then you'll want to find the icon on the left side of the screen that shows a person and says Wardrobe. When you open the Wardrobe, you'll see three sub-menus: Skins, Badges, and Titles. You can then scroll through and see any Skins, you've unlocked.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Pixel Quest Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You're in luck! There are currently no expired Pixel Quest codes, but don't let the above ones slip away before you use them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Pixel Quest Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Codes for Roblox experiences are usually case-sensitive, so the best way to ensure you've got a working code is to directly copy it from this article. We check all codes before we upload them, so you can guarantee they're working. Just double-check that you haven't copied over an extra space!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is the Next Pixel Quest Update?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Pixel Quest is currently in Alpha release, but that doesn't mean that the Pixel Quest! group isn't already working hard to bring new content to the RPG. The next update is planned for Sunday, 26th October. This mini update will introduce a new dungeon and new Legendary items.

<p>"The creativity of the teams is, in my mind, the most important thing and the thing that we need to protect and foster," Spencer said.</p><p>Not long after saying this, Spencer noted that Xbox hasn't always safeguarded the creative talent behind its biggest and best games. The sentiment was expressed in the context of internet criticism, but Spencer still admitted that Xbox--and maybe the whole media industry--doesn't protect its workers when it should.</p><p>"I think it's the most brave thing a team can do, whether you're making a movie or a television show, to go and put something out for the internet to evaluate, judge and comment on," Spencer said. "Sometimes I scratch my head on why anybody wants to go do that, because the internet's not always a nice place for the discourse around things that have been created, but nurturing and protecting creative teams that want to go take risks. We don't always succeed at that, but I think it is kind of the root of any media industry, the creative nugget."</p><p>This is true if you look at the recent evidence. In January 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">Microsoft eliminated about 1,900 jobs</a> following the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Over a year later, in May 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-7000-people-in-latest-round-of-massive-cuts/1100-6531500/" data-ref-id="1100-6531500">the company laid off roughly 7,000 people</a> in response to the "dynamic marketplace." And in July 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">Xbox cut some 9,000 people</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">canceling a slew of games and closing an assortment of studios</a>. Despite these slashes to its workforce, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">the company still reached a $4 trillion valuation</a> at the end of July. An October 2025 Bloomberg report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">the mountainous profit goals Microsoft has for itself are doing far more harm than good</a>, and I suppose that makes sense when you cut nearly 18,000 of your workers within the year.</p><p>Still, Schafer explained that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-xbox-game-studios-acquires-psychonauts-2-d/1100-6467547/" data-ref-id="1100-6467547">after Xbox bought Double Fine in 2019</a>, the California studio has maintained its creative independence because of that Xbox money.</p><p>"When we talked about becoming acquired, it was a big thing for me, like, 'How do we keep our culture intact?'" Schafer said. "And everyone was like, 'No, we really want you to stay who you are.' And that's been true all these years … You know, creatively, we can be like, 'Hey, we want to make this game about a walking lighthouse,' and [Xbox is] like, 'Cool. Sounds cool.'"</p><p>That game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-681590">Keeper</a>, is doing pretty well critically for both Double Fine and Xbox. We awarded it a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/keeper-review-this-ones-a-keeper/1900-6418424/" data-ref-id="1900-6418424">our Keeper review</a>, with critic Steve Watts calling it "a visual feast, a tone poem, an exploration of movement mechanics, [and] a fable about the world and what we owe to it."</p>
