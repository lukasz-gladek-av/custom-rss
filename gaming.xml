			<p>Shortly after their slew of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 announcements</a>, NVIDIA also shared brief new clips for a trio of highly anticipated upcoming action games: Lost Soul Aside, Stellar Blade, and Tides of Annihilation. All of them are made by Asian developers, and they will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to guarantee exceedingly high frame rates, up to over 500 FPS in Lost Soul Aside.</p>
<p>The latter game has been in development for a long time. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-amazing-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered it</a> nearly seven years ago, when it was being developed for the PlayStation 4 Pro. Unlike other long-delayed games, though, there's a very good reason - it all started as a one-man project of Yang Bing before it gained a lot of attention and support. At long last, Lost Soul Aside will launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-may-30th-on-pc-and-playstation-5-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on May 30</a> for PC and PlayStation 5, making it the first single player game published by Sony Interactive Entertainment to release day and date on the two platforms. The action title, which still runs on Unreal Engine 4, also supports ray tracing; you can find detailed system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-pc-system-requirements-rtx-5070-ti-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Soul Aside | Launching with DLSS 4 and Ray Tracing" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7qedRQM-bY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Strictly in order of release, the next game is Stellar Blade from Korean developer Shift Up. This one (also published by Sony Interactive Entertainment like Lost Soul Aside) launched a year ago on the PlayStation 5 to excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-over-one-million-units-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviews</a>, though developer and publisher have both since been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-and-stellar-blade-developer-gets-sued-for-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> for trademark infringement.</p>
<p>As seen in the brief footage, Stellar Blade, which is also powered by Unreal Engine 4, runs at up to 371 frames per second with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.&nbsp;The PC release is <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> at some point in June. We don't have the official system requirements yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade | 4K NVIDIA DLSS Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6rVjbzIwc8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, we have the most recently announced game: <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tides of Annihilation</a>. This action/adventure title inspired by Arthurian myths is in development at Eclipse Glow Games with the Unreal Engine 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tentatively slated for a 2026 launch</a>. In the trailer, we see it running at up to 359 frames per second with the aid of NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Annihilation | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHuUw_UyyRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Needless to say, all these trailers were captured on the new NVIDIA flagship GPU, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>. Moreover, they will have selected Performance Mode at 4K resolution to maximize frame rates. Still, even with these small caveats, they are impressive frame rate figures. We'll still have to wait to actually play the games before judging their smoothness, though, as stuttering could nonetheless mar even a high frame rate experience.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-map-streak-kenny-lowest-kd/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-texas-hits-0-18-map-streak-as-kenny-lands-lowest-kd-in-cod-esports-history.1135365/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-map-streak-kenny-lowest-kd/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Last night, OpTic Gaming’s Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez published a lengthy video exploring the ‘curse’ that lingers over OpTic Texas in the Call of Duty League. Hours later, the team suffered another loss, hitting a map record of 0-18, which is one of the worst records in the history of Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>Not only that, but in the series against the LA Theives, the most dominant team in the CDL right now, OpTic’s Kenny secured the lowest KD in competitive COD history. Curse or not, something has to change for OpTic Texas, which is on an unrivalled bad luck run.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-to-bottom">Top to Bottom</h2>



<p>Last year, OpTic Texas claimed the Call of Duty League Championship, the most prestigious award in the ecosystem. The team netted the first world title for OpTic in Call of Duty in several years, and everyone lauded this incredibly talented team.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and the fans are rebelling against the same roster, which has put up one of the worst records in competitive history. In the last batch of matches played, OpTic Texas has gone 0-18, failing to secure a single map in six fixtures.</p>



<p>It was noticed shortly after the recent match finished that Kenny had dropped a 0.3 KD ratio, which is, according to statistics aggregation platforms, the lowest kill-death ratio in Call of Duty esports history. That’s a record set by a two-time world champion, which just seems bizarre at this point.</p>



<p>In the round of Hardpoint against LA Thieves, Kenny set a woeful record, pulling just <strong>11 kills </strong>in what was a complete thrashing from the Thieves.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/">recent video published by HECZ</a>, the OpTic Texas team was all smiles as they pondered what could be wrong, with the entire office believing that a curse was upon the squad. Fans worldwide are pleading for a change, but nobody has a solid grip on what needs to be altered to get OpTic Texas winning maps.</p>



<p>What’s worse is that in just a few days, Major II will unravel in Texas, backed by OpTic. The team will start in the worst position at its home event and will have just <strong>one chance </strong>to stay in the running.</p>



<p>What do you think needs to change at OpTic Texas?</p>

But exploration is a tricky business and you can be mistaken: other players can overwrite your placements with their own until someone takes an extra action to confirm that tile, fixing it in place.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-suikoden-series-is-as-relevant-as-ever.1135287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-suikoden-book-boss-fight<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Few series continue to influence entire industries three decades down the line – fewer still if we’re talking about relatively obscure Japanese role-playing games. <em>Suikoden</em>, however, fits that bill. The recently-remastered JRPGs in which you’re able to recruit 108 characters to your cause are about far more than collecting ‘em all. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, Aidan Moher, freelance writer and author of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanis.fun/post/3ljpuq32vqc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming book <em>Suikoden 1 &amp; 2</em></a>, takes us to class.</p><p>We begin by discussing the many reasons why Moher felt these games in particular were worthy of an entire book, including their pre-9/11 historical context and the specific team-based nature of their development. Then we discuss news from the eye of the pre-GDC storm: Next week, thousands of game developers will convene in San Francisco to network and exchange knowledge, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a growing number of non-US-based devs are dropping out</a> due to Trump’s hostile policies and erratic governance.&nbsp;</p><p>After that we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/playstation-ai-aloy-horizon-talk-character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a> both introducing new unwanted AI features in the same week. Whose is worse? We’ll let you decide. Lastly, we design the one product that should include generative AI: a fucked-up private jet for rich people that definitely works just fine.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can eventually hire exactly 108 writers, reporters, and heck, maybe even some kind of battle chef to work at Aftermath.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Aidan:</strong> [The book talks about] how these things were important in the mid-90s as we were entering into a period of geo-political turmoil. We were only a few years away from 9/11 and everything that entailed. And so looking at the series contextually, we were able to have that conversation with the context of being adults who understand all of that better than we did when we first played it.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>As somebody who hasn’t really played these games, I know them as the series where you can collect 108 potential party members. How does that tie into what you’ve been talking about so far: these themes of war and how it impacts people?</p><p><strong>Aidan:</strong> I think there’s two interesting angles on that: The first is that <em>Suikoden </em>bucked the trend of so many RPGs that look at exceptional people doing exceptional things. You’ll go in, and it’ll be princesses or brilliant scientists or knights who get turned into frogs; I’m describing <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. I think <em>Suikoden </em>is so remarkable because it does something the original <em>Star Wars</em> movies did really well, which is showing normal people doing exceptional things.</p><p>With a huge cast of 108 recruitable characters, not all of them have a big impact on the story. Not all of them are usable in combat. But they all fill a role in this community that you build. And so you have people who are rising up. They’re sort of powerless. There’s one woman you recruit sorta late into the game, and she’s in a poor town. She just washes clothes. She’s a washer woman. But she joins your party because she recognizes she can bring something to the community that does not exist. So she’s there with former generals of the enemy, powerful magic users – everybody across that gamut.&nbsp;</p><p>That is what war is, that is what conflict is in societies: Everybody has a role to play, everybody can bring something to that. You couldn’t do that with just a cast of nine people. You’d have to give them each a defined role in the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think what the Final Fantasies of the world do is, they get you really invested in your main character. You have this sunk cost fallacy of “Well, if my main character’s in there, he’s the important one. He’s where I put all my gear, all my stuff, all my things.” It gets in the way of storytelling, I find. In <em>Live A Live</em>, you get a completely different perspective because they don’t give you enough time to have that sense of possession over your character. <em>Saga Frontier</em> is like a bunch of little eight-hour RPGs that all intersect with each other. Oh, <em>Chrono Cross</em>! That has 49 characters in it. It’s not the same [as <em>Suikoden</em>], but you get a lot of perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there’s something powerful about this thing that really limits a lot of RPG storytelling, which is “You’re the special boy.” It makes the investment in a character hurt more, like with Aerith [from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>], but it also means you can’t have characters really die or live. <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, in the second act, whether or not you get those characters [after the world ends] is one of the reasons why it’s one of my favorites. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> – all these things. There’s a malleability to RPGs that you don’t usually see. <em>Suikoden </em>is weird, and I like a weird game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aidan: </strong>It is a weird game, and it allows you to have that sort of agency within that experience, because it’s weird. It allows you to explore war in the way that you want to or what makes sense to you. That’s how you construct your party. A lot of people nowadays get caught up in the idea that there’s 108 characters, and you’ve gotta get all of them, and the only correct way to play the game is to collect every character.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The Pokemon mentality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aidan:</strong> Exactly. And you get a special ending if you collect all 108 characters; there’s incentive for it. But [creator] Yoshitaka Murayama’s intent was always for people to go through the game and miss characters. So Nathan, you, Chris, and me would all end up with a different assortment of community – a different community we built up around ourselves. That was always the intent. Conflict and community is what you build up around yourself.</p><p>Secondarily to that, and kind of getting back to what Chris was talking about with scope, Jason [Schreier] likes to liken <em>Suikoden </em>to <em>Game of Thrones</em>, the <em>Game of Thrones</em> of JRPGs. But <em>Suikoden</em> actually predates the first <em>Game of Thrones</em> book, which I think is really remarkable. And I think it speaks to a lot of what was going on not just in video games, but epic fantasy at the time – that we were seeing this big explosion of scope where bringing in many, many viewpoints and looking at conflict through many eyes became important to fantasy. </p><p>In the ‘80s we saw a lot of sword and sorcery-style adventure fantasy. Raymond Feist, Terry Brooks. And then in the ‘90s we started to get the <em>Wheel of Times</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> that tried to do the same thing <em>Suikoden </em>was doing, which was [to] show that this is complex. There are many, many different sides and motivations. Sometimes they’re at odds. Sometimes they cross over. Sometimes they cross over for a little bit, and then they get pulled apart. I think that holds up really well in these games – even now, even though they’re 30 years old.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms"><h3>Log Off, Tim Sweeney</h3></a><p>Again, if I had $5 billion you would never see or hear from me ever again</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/14/people-can-fly-is-developing-project-delta-based-on-a-sony-owned-ip/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer People Can Fly has confirmed that they have entered into an agreement with Sony Interactive Entertainment, producing a prototype of a new video game codenamed Project Delta that is based on an IP owned by Sony.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of unknowns here, of course, and while the wording seems to imply that PCF is creating a new game based on established IP – and this is also described as ‘work for hire’ contract – it can also be read to mean that Sony will own the IP of whatever PCF create. At this point, Project Delta is just a prototype project, though Sony is funding the production at this stage – as is typical for this kind of work – and it’s obviously hoped that they will get the greenlight at each stage of development to continue.</p>


<p>Given the codename of Project Delta, though, why not rampantly speculate that this is a SOCOM reboot? Delta would obviously be an allusion to Delta Force, which is a unit of SOCOM.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as part of an investor report, with People Can Fly a publicly listed company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It’s similar to why we have such detailed disclosures and roadmaps from independent studios like CD Projekt Red and Remedy Entertainment.</p>
<p>The company has numerous codenamed projects in development though recently had to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">step back from self-publishing efforts with Project Victoria and Bifrost, leading to layoffs</a>. However, they are working on Project Gemini with Square Enix, Project Echo with Krafton and has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/">confirmed as co-developed on Gears of War E-Day</a> (formerly Project Maverick).</p>

<p>Here’s a translation of <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-raport-biezacy-nr-4-2025-zawarcie-pda-z-sony-delta-final.pdf">PCF’s investor report</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Management Board of PCF Group S.A. with its registered office in Warsaw (the “Company”) hereby informs that on March 13, 2025, the Company entered into a production agreement (Prototype Development Agreement) (the “Production Agreement”) with Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC, with its registered office in San Mateo, California, United States of America (the “Publisher”), regarding cooperation in the production of a prototype of a new video game codenamed Project Delta (the “Product”), based on intellectual property rights belonging to Publisher.</em></p>
<p><em>The Production Agreement provides that work on the Product will be carried out in the so-called work-for-hire model, i.e. work performed by the Company as a developer on behalf of and for the Publisher, in return for which the Company will receive an agreed remuneration from the Publisher.</em></p>
<p><em>In accordance with the Production Agreement, work on the Product will be divided into stages (milestones). Detailed terms of cooperation between the parties regarding the implementation and payment for subsequent stages (milestones) have been specified in the annex to the Production Agreement (milestone schedule).</em></p>
<p><em>The scope and provisions of the Production Agreement do not differ substantially from the provisions of production agreements typically concluded for such projects.</em></p>
<p><em>The conclusion of the Production Agreement is in line with the update of the Company’s Strategy and the People Can Fly capital group announced by the Company on 31 January 2023, according to which if attractive opportunities for cooperation with renowned partners in the work-for-hire model arise, the Company will take advantage of them.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/630176/ashly-burch-sony-ai-horizon-aloy-tech-demo-sag-aftra-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Ashly Burch, the award-winning voice and performance actor behind <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>’s Aloy — one of the most prominent characters on PlayStation today — has some news and some very strong thoughts about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype">the leaked Sony experiment that saw her character voiced and performed by AI technology</a> instead of her or any other human being.</p></div><p>The video, originally shared with <em>The Verge</em> by a tipster and later pulled off YouTube by a copyright enforcement company that counts Sony PlayStation as a client, was of an internal prototype — not necessarily something that’s in production for actual games. Burch says <em>Horizon</em> developer Guerilla proactively confirmed to her that it is <em>not</em> actively in development. Nor did it use her voice or facial data, Guerilla claimed. </p><p>But Burch says having seen the demo, she is worried, and not just about her own career. “I feel worried about this art form,” she says. You can watch her video immediately below, or scroll down for a transcript. </p><p>The transcript:</p><div><blockquote><p>Hi. Let’s talk about AI Aloy. I saw the tech demo earlier this week. Guerilla reached out to me to let me know that the demo didn’t reflect anything that was actively in development. They didn’t use any of my performance for the demo, so none of my facial or voice data. And Guerilla owns Aloy as a character.</p><p>So all that said, I feel worried. And not worried about Guerilla specifically or <em>Horizon</em> or my performance or my career specifically, even. I feel worried about this art form. Game performance as an art form.</p><p>We are currently on strike. SAG-AFTRA is on strike against video games because of AI. Because this technology exists, because we know that game companies want to use it, we’re asking for protections.</p><p>So currently what we’re fighting for is that you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form. You have to compensate us fairly and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double.</p><p>And I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Because of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements.</p><p>I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it. That does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse.</p><p>They wouldn’t have any protections. Any way to fight back. And that possibility… it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me.</p><p>I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances.</p><p>I want to be able to continue, to do this job, and if we don’t win, then that future is really compromised.</p></blockquote></div><p>In a slightly longer TikTok version of the video, which we’ve embedded above to replace the original Instagram copy, Burch adds that “I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast, certainly not Guerilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology is not the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike, and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.”</p><p>It’s unusual for performers who have such a close relationship with game companies to speak out like this, but we’re also in an unusual moment: as she points out, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">video game actors are on strike right now, specifically because of AI</a><em>, </em>and the very idea that a company like Sony is explicitly building and demonstrating ways to potentially replace actors like Burch is exactly what the striking workers fear.</p><p>In addition to starring in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, Burch has had minor roles in other Sony games including <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>, but is otherwise best known for playing Chloe Price in the <em>Life Is Strange</em> games, Tiny Tina in <em>Borderlands</em>, and from the live-action D&amp;D roleplaying series <em>Critical Role</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21177373/ashly-burch-interview-mythic-quest">Apple TV Plus’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a>, where she also serves as a writer.</p><p><em><strong>Update, March 14th:</strong></em> <em>Swapped Instagram video for Burch’s longer uncut TikTok video and added its additional context.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo Power was a popular staple of '90s gaming culture, offering not just insight into upcoming Nintendo video games, but also various comics based on many of the Big N's franchises. One of its most popular comics was Super Mario Adventures, which ran in the magazine from 1992 through 1993. The comic strip followed Mario and Luigi as they attempt to rescue Princess Toadstool from the clutches of Bowser. If you've ever wanted to revisit the comic, the full Super Mario Adventures series is available as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura/dp/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standalone graphic novel</a>, and right now, it's on sale for <strong>one of the best prices we've seen in years</strong>.</p><div title="6530137 - Super Mario Adventures Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3258" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6530137 - Super Mario Adventures Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura/dp/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura\/dp\/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura/dp/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Super Mario Adventures (Paperback)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura/dp/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura\/dp\/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura/dp/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$10.55 (was $17)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Super Mario Adventures is a full-color graphic novel inspired by the video game series.

            <p>
Fireproof Games - the studio behind eerie puzzle box adventure The Room and its equally stellar sequels - has announced a launch date for its paranormal VR mystery Ghost Town. It's coming to Meta Quest on 24th April, with a PCVR/PSVR2 release due later this year.
</p>
<p>
Ghost Town, if you're unfamiliar, whisks players back to 1983, where they'll take on the role of ghost hunter Edith Penrose. Edith runs a successful paranormal detective agency in London with her flatmate and, as Fireproof puts it, "she's almost up-to-date with her rent and the ghosts in her bathroom mirror have been less demanding than usual."
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Edith's world is turned upside down when her brother goes missing - and so begins a quest to locate his whereabouts, first taking her to a remote Scottish island in search of a gifted clairvoyant, and later through the supernatural underbelly of London.

<p>
All this unfolds across "large navigable environments" where players will interact with fully motion-captured characters, both alive and dead. "Explore a variety of atmospheric locations with a controller in each hand and a torch to light your way," Fireproof explains. "Use the dexterity of your hands to overcome tactile puzzles, cast spells and even summon troubled spirits to move them on to the next world."
</p>
<p>
Fireproof's The Room series was an absolute pleasure, blending cleverly tactile head scratchers with some deliciously sinister atmospherics - and the studio's most recent game, 2020's The Room VR: A Dark Matter, was a particular highlight. So I'm genuinely excited to see how Ghost Town plays out. And with a <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/ghost-town/9531494193591052/">24th April release on Meta Quest</a> now confirmed (and PSVR2/<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/">PCVR</a> to follow), there isn't much longer to wait.

            <p>
It's been almost a year since Saber Interactive last shared an update on its long-in-the-works and reportedly troubled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> remake. But despite the ensuing radio silence, it's now insisting, "Everything that we have talked about is still in development."
</p>
<p>
A Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-announced-for-ps5">first announced for PlayStation 5 and PC</a> back in 2021, with developer Aspyr at the helm. Since then, however, the project has been dogged by rumours of difficulties behind-the-scenes, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-in-serious-trouble-and-delayed-indefinitely">report in 2022 claiming it was "in serious trouble"</a> and "delayed indefinitely".
</p>
<p>
Shortly after that report, it was confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-confirms-aaa-project-has-switched-studios-following-report-of-kotor-trouble">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine developer Saber Interactive had taken over development duties</a>, but still nothing has been seen of the project since its initial unveiling. More <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-reportedly-not-in-active-development">reports of its apparent demise</a> surfaced in 2023 - although those were quickly rebuffed - and the project's future was called into question again last year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-to-sell-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-developer-saber">Saber Interactive split with parent company Embracer Group</a>.

<figcaption>Here's how the KOTOR remake was announced back in 2021.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p82vauAdgv8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Saber's most recent comments on KOTOR came last April, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kotor-remake-alive-and-well-says-saber-interactive-ceo">company boss Matthew Karch insisted the remake was "alive and well"</a> - but with almost a year of radio silence now past since then, doubts have begun spreading through the fan community again. All of which brings us to the present, and Saber's latest tacit assurances the KOTOR remake remains in development.
</p>
<p>
Following this week's news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-already-in-the-works-and-its-promising-an-even-more-immersive-experience">Saber is now starting up development on Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 3</a>, studio chief creative officer Tim Willits <a href="https://x.com/TimWillits/status/1900374508113961250">took to social media to reassure fans</a> that it's other announced games remain unaffected. "Saber Interactive is one of the largest independent developers in the world," Willits wrote. "We are working on numerous games across many different genres. Everything that we have talked about is still in development. We will share information on upcoming games when we have something cool to share."
</p>
<p>
That, then, bodes well for the ever-elusive KOTOR remake, but it's far from the only game previously confirmed to be in development at Saber. The studio is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-is-a-co-op-fps-with-80s-vibes-action-humour-and-horror">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-park-survival-will-revisit-locations-from-1993-film-but-also-introduce-new-ones">Jurassic Park Survival</a>, both scheduled to launch this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-turok-game">new Turok</a> and Avatar: The Last Airbender games also on the way.
</p>
<p>
And as for the newly announced Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 3, that sounds like it's still some considerable way out. The studio has said it still plans to support Space Marine 2 "in the coming years" while it continues work on its "even more immersive" sequel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As far as statements of intent go, it’s hard to make a more definitive one than what the Trump administration has done to Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-protester-mahmoud-khalil-immigration-arrest-5ae6eeb3ac95f190a505abebc4ee0944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snatching a legal US resident</a> away from his family, stripping him of his rights, and detaining him with intent to deport, all for the non-crime of exercising his First Amendment rights by helping lead protests against Israel’s genocide of Palestinians. This follows previous weeks in which the Trump administration passed down <a href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous anti-trans edicts</a>, made moves to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-quest-conquer-canada-confusing-everyone-rcna195657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annex Canada</a>, imposed tariffs that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/investing/stocks-trump-wall-street-tariffs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threaten to crash the US economy</a>, and began an ongoing project to <a href="https://aftermath.site/elon-musk-treasury-protest-diablo-path-of-exile-cheating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismantle the federal government</a>. You can understand, then, why some game developers would be hesitant to enter the United States, even if it means missing out on career-defining opportunities.</p><p>The annual Game Developers Conference takes place next week in San Francisco, and while the event has received <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23679081/gdc-2023-price-affordability-game-developers-conference" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ample criticism for prohibitively high prices</a> and other accessibility issues over the years, it remains an important event for developers from all over the world to gather, network, and share knowledge. But as of the past few weeks, some developers are canceling their plans to attend.</p><p>"I had flight tickets, hotel, and pass all lined up and decided to cancel last week due to the possibility of being turned around at the border for being trans – which according to a recent <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5189226-texas-bill-transgender-rights-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo</a> can be considered fraud," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/loa-gunnars.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lóa Gunnars</a>, an independent game designer and educator based out of Reykjavík, Iceland told Aftermath. "I’ve been planning [to attend GDC] for about four months, and [it] would have been my 10th year there. ... GDC is incredibly valuable to me. I studied game design [at] NYU, and GDC is my main way of staying connected to the North American game industry, a place where I meet old friends and make new connections."</p><figure><blockquote><p>In the Republican US, they could grab me and make me go away, and nobody would be able to do shit even if they tried.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In other cases, more specific headlines generated by the Trump administration’s smash-and-grab tactics have developers un-packing their bags. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ramiismail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rami Ismail</a>, an indie developer, speaker, and consultant formerly of Vlambeer, told Aftermath that immigration agents' abduction of pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil solidified his decision to keep his distance from a conference he's been critical of in the past.</p><p>"I can barely get into the US under the Democrats," Ismail said. "The Republicans are straight up disappearing people, mate. I'm Egyptian. I know what disappearing is: Little van shows up, gone you are. In the Republican US, they could grab me and make me go away, and nobody would be able to do shit even if they tried. I think if anyone with Western privilege would be worried about going to Egypt, they should now be equally worried about going to the US. These things are random, unfair, and without recourse."</p><p>Others, like <em>Subnautica Below Zero</em>, <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, and <em>Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry</em> writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jillmurray.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jill Murray</a>, who is based in Montreal, are maintaining a healthy distance from the increasingly bad ol’ US of A out of senses of both solidarity and self-preservation.</p><p>"[The breaking point] was seeing how afraid trans and BIPOC friends were of crossing the border. I take it seriously and don’t really want to go where they can’t go," Murray told Aftermath. "My biggest personal factor is that I’ve been self employed for a very long time, and that can make me face more questioning. With a trade war on, it doesn’t feel like the risk is warranted – even if I’m facing mounting pressures to network, given the overall situation of the industry."&nbsp;</p><p>Vivid Foundry founder Tanya Kan and game trailer maker Gary J Kings, two developers who are residents of Canada, kicked off a discussion of the difficult choice many international developers face in regard to GDC <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/garyjkings.bsky.social/post/3lk6w64e4os2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bluesky</a>. Both cancelled their plans this week after hearing the story of Becky Burke, a British tourist who’s been <a href="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article301877574.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detained in an ICE facility for two weeks</a> due to visa issues, unable to voluntarily return home. Burke’s father has called the situation <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/03/11/british-tourist-detained-us-canada/82267160007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“a nightmare.”</a></p><p>"[Burke's] case highlights the system's cruelty by detaining her in inhumane conditions,” Kan told Aftermath. “From there we looked at other factors and came to the conclusion that the political climate was devolving too rapidly for us to not feel anxious whilst needing to be in our top form at GDC."</p><figure><blockquote><p>It doesn’t feel like the risk is warranted – even if I’m facing mounting pressures to network, given the overall situation of the industry.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Trump’s escalating trade war with Canada – the goal of which sure seems to be annexation of a sovereign nation – has many Canadians bunkering down on their side of the border.</p><p>"The straw that broke the camel's back was the President's constant and repeated economic and military threats to Canada, including tariffs and especially annexation," BancyCo co-founder <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminrivers.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benjamin Rivers</a> told Aftermath. "Since a vast swath of Canadian businesses have decided to remove American products and pivot to non-American services, and citizens are increasingly opting out of travelling to the US, we thought it was only prudent to do the same. So instead of attending events like GDC or PAX, we've opted to spend our marketing budget on events in Canada, Europe, and Asia."</p><p>Rivers by no means relishes having to steer clear of a country where many friends reside, but in times of political upheaval, safe is far preferable to sorry.</p><p>"We know that American friends and colleagues don't support what the government is doing, and we'll dearly miss meeting them at events like GDC,” he said. “But it seems insane to travel to a country that has all but declared you its enemy, and in which random innocent travelers are already being detained, so we've opted to not cross that border for the foreseeable future."</p><p>Conditions, unfortunately, do not look to be improving, even in supposed liberal strongholds like California, which finds itself under the shaky stewardship of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/14/gavin-newsom-steve-bannon-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right-wing-guest-hosting</a> podcaster-in-chief Gavin Newsom. What, if anything, can GDC and other, similar events do? Most developers believe the obvious answer is the best, fraught with logistical concerns though it might be: move.</p><p>"It might help a bit if the GDC talks were live [streamed] so at least it’s possible to follow along online conversations. But even when they did for covid it just [wasn't] the same; active participation during talks and the mingling between events are the important bits," said Gunnars. "A more central Europe conference [might be GDC's best bet]? I’m not sure why GDC Europe never held the same appeal."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I don’t think the industry in the US has had to grapple with the possibility of becoming less central before, but I think it’s a real possibility now.</p></blockquote></figure><p>“It would be nice to see the industry decide to convene elsewhere on a rotating basis,” said Murray. “I hope there’s an opportunity here for other conferences to grow, and for international organizers to reach out to each other and combine resources and ideas to capture some of that magnetic mass attraction GDC has always had. I don’t think the industry in the US has had to grapple with the possibility of becoming less central before, but I think it’s a real possibility now.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite how quickly things are accelerating, the fact is that the current climate in the US didn’t come out of nowhere. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chhopsky.tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina Pollock</a>, a developer who's worked on series like <em>Call of Duty</em> and has, at various points, resided in Brisbane, San Francisco, and Vancouver, told Aftermath that she’s faced visa issues when it comes to entering the US since 2020. She’s not alone.&nbsp;</p><p>"Every year we hear the same story from developers from all around the world that two things hold them back from GDC: the cost of visiting SF and difficulty with US visas,” Pollock said. “Plenty of other North American industry conventions successfully rotate through cities and venues. SIGGRAPH, NANOG et al have had successful events in Canada. … If GDC is willing to break away from its home venue and look towards Toronto or Vancouver, I think they'll find that organizing events internationally isn't nearly as difficult as people might think. The game industry is already a global community; our premiere conference should reflect that."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-suikoden-book-boss-fight"><h3>The Suikoden Series Is As Relevant As Ever</h3></a><p>"It does something the original Star Wars movies did really well, which is showing normal people doing exceptional things"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms"><h3>Log Off, Tim Sweeney</h3></a><p>Again, if I had $5 billion you would never see or hear from me ever again</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Polish developer People Can Fly <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-raport-biezacy-nr-4-2025-zawarcie-pda-z-sony-delta-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today a new agreement with Sony to develop a prototype based on one of the PlayStation company's franchises. The game's codename is Project Delta, which really doesn't give away much.</p>
<p><em>The Production Agreement provides that work on the Product will be carried out in the so-called ‘work-for-hire model’., i.e. work performed by the Company as a developer on commissioned by and on behalf of the Publisher, in return for which the Company will receive from the Publisher an agreed remuneration.</em></p>
<p><em>In accordance with the Production Agreement, work on the Product will be divided into stages (milestones). The detailed terms and conditions of cooperation between the parties regarding the implementation of and payments for milestones are set out in an appendix to the Production Agreement (milestone schedule). The scope and provisions of the Production Agreement do not deviate from the provisions of the Production Agreement.</em></p>
<p>People Can Fly is far from new to this kind of collaboration. In June 2023, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-project-possibly-in-development-at-people-can-fly-with-30-50-million-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that they had partnered with Microsoft to create a game based on one of their IPs. Given their past (they worked with Epic on the original Gears of War trilogy and even led the development of the 2013 spin-off Gears of War: Judgment), it was a safe bet that it would be another Gears title. Indeed, in late January, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game is Gears of War: E-Day, co-developed with The Coalition.</p>
<p>There's no mention of the project's budget here, though, unlike with the Microsoft collaboration. Anyway, the studio's pedigree sits squarely in the shooter genre, with games like Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/outriders-great-fun-while-it-lasts-despite-some-flaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outriders</a> in their development history. As such, PlayStation fans are already hoping that Sony has provided the green light for a new Resistance or Killzone game since Insomniac and Guerrilla Games are now busy with other work. Both sci-fi franchises have languished for over a decade despite having very interesting settings.</p>
<p>In other People Can Fly news, the Polish studio recently <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1900143444686754187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1900143444686754187%7Ctwgr%5E995914a35dfa617a5376732855cd9431d9ff1720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmultiplayer.it%2Fnotizie%2Fpeople-can-fly-abbandona-realta-virtuale-project-bison-sara-suo-ultimo-gioco-vr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will phase out its publishing business of Virtual Reality games, citing the lack of investments in the area even from the VR platform holders. The developer will now focus on traditional triple-A development, whether with self-publishing, work-for-hire, or co-development models.</p>

Dark Odyssey is the real headline here, as it includes a war chest of cosmetic treats for all God of War Ragnarök owners across PlayStation 5 and PC. It’ll arrive as a free update March 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything included in Dark Odyssey features a clean, black-and-gold look that will no doubt have Kratos and co looking better than ever as they tear their way through Norse mythology. Atreus and Freya both receive their own cosmetic sets as part of the patch, too, as do a variety of the player’s shields and weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The show-stealer, though, is a Dark Odyssey appearance and armor set for Kratos that hearkens back to a skin originally only rewarded to players who managed to beat God of War 2 on God Mode difficulty. Players can claim the content in any Lost Items chest in the base game or immediately in God of War Ragnarök’s roguelike Valhalla mode after the update drops. The patch will also finally introduce the option to customize the appearance of Kratos’ weapons without sacrificing each weapon’s respective ability.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">God of War Ragnarok Dark Odyssey Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Armor &amp; Appearance for Kratos</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Kratos Appearance</li><li>Dark Odyssey Armor Set for Kratos (Dark Odyssey Breastplate, Dark Odyssey Bracers, Dark Odyssey Belt) </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Companion Armor  </strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Vestment for Atreus</li><li>Dark Odyssey Witch Frock for Freya </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Weapon Appearances &amp; Attachments</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Leviathan Axe [Appearance] &amp; Dark Odyssey Knob [Attachment] </li><li>Dark Odyssey Blades of Chaos [Appearance] &amp; Dark Odyssey Handles [Attachment]  </li><li>Dark Odyssey Draupnir Spear [Appearance] &amp; Dark Odyssey Hind [Attachment]  </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Shield Appearances &amp; Rönd</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Guardian Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Dauntless Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Stone Wall Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Shatter Start Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Onslaught Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Spartan Aspis Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Rönd</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">God of War Ragnarök released in late 2022, so one simple update was never going to do the series’ 20-year history justice. Also included in Sony’s plans to celebrate God of War is a long list of other activities and offers for those who have stuck with Kratos’ story since the beginning.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-are-looking-for-hidden-messages-amid-black-hole-disaster<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Easter eggs and secret messages are old hat for many ongoing games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> is no stranger to them either. So it's little surprise that amid an ongoing, calamitous conflict with the Illuminate, players are poring over the messages for hidden details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not caught up with the running narrative in Helldivers 2, here's a quick catch-up: developer Arrowhead has the Illuminate back and pushing the lines of galactic warfare as the latest threat to Super Earth. The eerie foe is using a massive black hole to slowly consume entire planets, pushing it to <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1890025104643678643" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angel's Venture</a> and, now, <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1900413203336560904" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moradesh</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironically, the black hole was initially created on Meridian <em>by </em>Super Earth, in an effort to wipe out a Terminid Super Colony. Arrowhead's got a particular penchant for "yes, and"-ing the outcomes of the galactic campaigns. The slow build to right now, with the Illuminate pretty much pushing a black hole slowly towards Super Earth, is the latest in a long line of dominoes.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING<br>EVACUATE PLANET<br>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING</p><p>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING<br>EVACUATE PLANET<br>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING</p><p>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING<br>EVACUATE PLANET<br>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING <a href="https://t.co/G4vpaIgLpz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/G4vpaIgLpz</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1900413203336560904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So, now we're here: Moradesh is evacuating, and Helldivers are anticipating the next step of this cataclysmic campaign. Yet some are digging into the evacuation orders, trying to suss out a hidden meaning from the messages Arrowhead is broadcasting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit user Pinglyadya shared an image of what looks like an egg, hidden in the Moradesh videos. In the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jayjpb/comment/mhpnxc5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comments</a>, they go further, breaking down the potential morse code strings into dots and dashes, surmising that it all results in a few different codes: "045a5, 06efbc, e1b5f0 then 21232. We don't know what this is the code to but have fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The "06EFBC" code caught attention <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jawqur/comment/mhpoqeq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in another thread</a>, as it could correspond with the hex code for a shade of teal called Last Straw. Sounds ominous! Nothing concrete has surfaced beyond that, but at least a few fans are convinced there's something hidden in these messages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn't be the first time players have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-01000202-addresses-general-game-stability-and-crashes-but-players-are-wondering-what-secrets-it-holds">gone diving for secrets in Arrowhead's updates</a>. With the Meridian Singularity slowly approaching Super Earth, though, I do wonder whether Helldivers have time to spare for this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead has, since the destruction of Moradesh, issued a new Major Order for players, tasking them with defending planets so Super Earth can construct a Penrose Energy Siphon and effect a "one-time reduction" in Dark Energy Accumulation.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">MAJOR ORDER: Following days of diligent resource collection and repurposing of enemy combatants, the Helldivers have enabled the construction of a partial blockade of the Meridian Singularity. The blockade is porous, but still moderately effective, and has slightly reduced the… <a href="https://t.co/ye33V6VKa6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ye33V6VKa6</a></p>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1900587754729140583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully, this can put a stop to the giant tear in space that's slowly encroaching on everything the Helldivers hold dear. And, possibly, put a few more secret messages out into the ether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all part of Helldivers 2's ongoing, community driven Galactic War, which has captured the attention of the game's community for over a year now. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">The Illuminate invaded in December</a> with an initial alien force that added new enemies to fight against as well as brand new Super Earth colonies to fight on. These colonies introduced Helldivers 2’s first urban environments, with city streets packed with innocent civilians mind-controlled by the Illuminate. The Voteless, as they’re called by Super Earth, are little more than zombies who want nothing more than to team players limb from limb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket/" data-ref-id="5000-649113">Pokemon TCG Pocket</a> has been extremely successful since its debut last year, not everything in the game is popular with players. Case in point, the trade tokens introduced in late January were met with an extremely negative response, in part because players had to destroy their duplicate cards to earn them. Now, the game's developers, Creatures Inc. and DeNA, have revealed that they will be getting rid of the trading tokens and replacing them with another in-game currency.</p><p>As shared on <a href="https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon's official site</a>, trade tokens will be completely removed from the game by this fall. In their place, shinedust will now be the currency used to trade cards. Any trade tokens that remain in players' collections after the switchover will be converted to shinedust.</p><p>Shinedust will only be required for trades involving cards with three-diamond, four-diamond, or one-star rarity. However, the exact breakdown of the cost in shinedust wasn't disclosed. Shinedust is automatically earned when players get a card they already have registered in their Card Dex. Since Shinedust will be used for trades, the developers are looking into increasing the amounts that are given to players.</p><p>The in-game trading function will also receive an update in the future that lets players share the cards they want to trade for, which should make the trading process go more smoothly. The devs also stated that they are investigating how they can let players swap cards that aren't currently able to be traded, including promo cards and two-star rarity cards.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reveals-triumphant-light-expansion-as-it-surpasses-100-million-downloads/1100-6529756/" data-ref-id="1100-6529756">Triumphant Light</a> expansion for Pokemon TCG Pocket launched at the end of February, as the game passed 100 million downloads.

            <p>
God of War's Kratos has had a busy life: he's birthed a teenager, slain the gods, and grown the kind of luscious beard that would make a lumberjack fume - all that and he's only 20 years old! And to celebrate Kratos and the God of War series' big two-oh, Sony is releasing a free update for 2022's Ragnarök that'll include some classic-inspired skins.
</p>
<p>
Starting next Wednesday, 20th March, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> players on PC and PlayStation can download a free update adding, among other things, the Dark Odyssey armour and appearance for Kratos - both inspired by the classic black-and-gold skin players could unlock after beating 2007's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-war-2">God of War 2</a> on God Mode difficulty. There's the swirly shoulder sheen and glowing white eyes of the anniversary skin itself, plus the Dark Odyssey Breastplate, Dark Odyssey Bracers, and Dark Odyssey Belt - all of which can be accessed from any Lost Items chest in the base game or automatically while in Valhalla.
</p>
<p>
Players can also apply Dark Odyssey appearances to the Guardian Shield, Dauntless Shield, Stone Wall Shield, Shatter Start Shield, Onslaught Shield, Spartan Aspis Shield, and Rönd. And over in the weapon corner, there are Dark odyssey appearances for the fully upgraded versions of the Leviathan Axe, Blades of Chaos, and Draupnir Spear. All these come with their own Dark Odyssey attachments, so if you fancy giving Kratos a Dark Odyssey Knob, have at it. Sony notes all the above will gain the 'Edit Appearance' feature in next week's patch.

<p>
And as for companions, the black and gold aesthetic carries over to two bits of Dark Odyssey armour for Freya and Atreus. There's the Dark Odyssey Witch Frock for Freya, which comes with some fetching golden tassels, and the largely leather-based Dark Odyssey Vestment for Atreus.
</p>
<p>
That's everything in God of War Ragnarök's free update, but the 20th anniversary celebrations are set to continue in other realms - most specifically, the actual Earthly one. As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/14/celebrate-god-of-wars-20th-anniversary-with-god-of-war-ragnarok-dark-odyssey-collection/">detailed in Sony's announcement</a>, there's a two-volume God of War retrospective book on the way, alongside art prints, t-shirts, an exhibition at California's Gallery Nucleus, and 67 inches of World Serpent to enjoy. The latter comes in the form of a Jörmungandr plushie that's also a hand puppet and even includes a little magnetised Leviathan Axe crammed into its mouth.
</p>
<p>

"Back in 2005 when the first God of War released, no one at Santa Monica Studio anticipated the success this series would have," adds Sony. "Every creative endeavour carries the hopes of those who shaped it that they might be able to carve a legacy in the industry. What makes those hopes a reality has always been the support of players who chose to pick up the game and go on a journey with us." Here's to another 20 years Kratos; may your beard never retract inward.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mezen-board-game-inspired-by-siberian-artisans-announced-by-arcane-wonders<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arcane Wonders has announced the launch of the <em>Mezen</em> board game. This puzzle tile-based tabletop game is based on the art style developed by traditional Siberian artisans, providing players a hands-on learning experience of this part of the world.</p>

<h2>The Mezen Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Mezen</em> board game is inspired by the meze style of painting, which emerged in the mid-eighteenth century. This style is characterized by distinct shades of red and white and imagery centered on fire, water, creatures and plants found in nature, the sun, the moon, and protective symbols.</p>

Players will take turns flipping tiles and earning points. Whoever earns the most points by the end of the final round is declared the winner.</p>

<p>These tiles are maneuvered over a 5x5 board. Each round starts with the active player choosing one of the animals on the tiles. All players then choose a group of one or more tiles with that animal to remove from their grid and flip over. Next, they slide the tiles above the open spaces down and place the newly flipped tiles back in the open spaces at the top.</p>

<p>Once this is done, everyone will score the current round's scoring objective. These objectives include revealing symbols or completing the image of an animal. These objectives are dealt to players through a deck of cards. Once five rounds are done, players get one point per black tile shown on their board. After the 10th and final round, players score one point per white tile&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Mezen</em> board game was created by Nikita Sorokin and Maria Stahkevich and developed by Hobby World. It is the latest board game to join Arcane Wonders' diverse tabletop catalog which includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/arcane-wonders-announces-onstage-trick-taking-game-about-theater-troupe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Onstage</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/video-game-champion-brings-retro-game-collecting-fun-to-gaming-tables" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Video Game Champion</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ito-card-game-getting-western-localization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ito</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/629949/star-wars-hunters-offline-october<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>So soon after <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">Specter Divide</a></em>, a multiplayer shooter developed by Mountaintop Studios, announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down">its pending shut down</a> which will take its studio with it, is yet another live-service game going offline. Today, <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em> developer Zynga announced <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/">the game will be sunset on October 1st</a>.</p><p><em>Hunters</em> is a class-based arena shooter featuring original characters (or at least they <em>seem</em> original, who knows with folks named Babu Frik running around) from throughout the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. It had a soft launch in select countries in 2021, but didn’t get a global launch on mobile and the Nintendo Switch until June 2024. This means that the game officially lived a scant 16 months before it inevitably goes offline. That short time though is downright luxurious considering <em>Specter Divide</em> lasted roughly six months before it will shut down sometime in the next 30 days.</p><p>The developers do have some parting gifts for players before the galaxy winks out on <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em>, though. The current season will be extended an additional three weeks and the game will still release a new hero April 15th. Then the developers will keep the ranked leaderboards running until the game shuts down in October.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
