            <p>
Shenmue fans have rented out a billboard in New York's Time Square to campaign for a fourth game and give creator Yu Suzuki a chance to "complete his life's work".
</p>
<p>
The campaign has been spearheaded by fansite Shenmue Dojo, who shared a livestream clip of the #LetsGetShenmue4 billboard on social media.
</p>
<p>
The advertisement itself features artwork of key characters from the game with the hashtag, stating "join us the 4th of every month".

"Shenmue fans do some insane things to try and get recognised... are you watching Sega?" reads the social post from Shenmue Dojo. Plenty of other fan accounts have also shared images of the billboard as part of the campaign.

It's no surprise that fans are passionate enough for another sequel. The first two games, originally released on Sega's Dreamcast, were cult favourites that underperformed commercially. Creator Yu Suzuki turned to crowdfunding for the third game, raising a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-dev-declares-usd7-1m-crowdfunding-total">total of $7.1m from 81,087 backers</a>. On Kickstarter, it raised $6.3m to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-breaks-kickstarter-funding-record">the platform's highest-funded video game project</a>.
</p>
<p>
Shenmue 3 ends on yet another cliffhanger, but there's no indication another game will be on the way, leaving fans frustrated.
</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Shenmue Dojo co-owners James Brown and Matt Oliver has discussed why this campaign is so important to fans, and why game is so special.</p>
<p>"What Shenmue did was not only change the perception of what could be done with video games back in 1999, it created a world and story that resonated deeply with us and the community but was a victim of circumstance (and other factors) with the discontinuation of the Dreamcast," they said.</p>
<p>"Shenmue is currently an unfinished story with Shenmue 3 ending on a cliffhanger following its 2019 release. Yu Suzuki has an overarching 11 chapter storyline which is currently around 40 percent completed. He feels that he could condense the next remaining chapters/story into two games to give a fulfilling conclusion. </p>
<p>"So our goal is to push for the fourth game in the series to be one step closer to the finished vision. For us it is not only important to be able to have Ryo's journey finally completed or to get ourselves lost in a new Shenmue game but to also support Yu Suzuki, who has given so much to gaming as a whole, a chance to finish his life's work."</p>
<p>The billboard idea originated from a stream a few months back, and is designed to be a statement to "really announce to the world that we're still here and will continue to unite and fight for Shenmue to be finished", the pair continued. The hope is it will resonate with Sega or other companies, and show the "crazy gestures" the series' community is still capable of. </p>
<p>The campaign cost just $40 for 15 seconds, with a timeslot suitable for the game's worldwide community. "However none of us could have predicted the huge reaction this has generated," they said, "and we thank each and every person who has posted this, talked about this and come out in force to support Shenmue". </p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-creator-has-considered-yakuza-0-style-prequel-to-continue-series">Suzuki has discussed the possibility of a fourth game</a>, stating in an interview: "I want Shenmue 4 to be enjoyable for newcomers... To make that possible, the most important thing is to make it enjoyable without knowing previous events in the story. I don't think that a new player wants to know 100 percent of the story. 20 or 30 percent could be enough."

</p>
<p>
One consideration would be a prequel, as with Yakuza 0. "Making an even more detailed Dobuita than the original Shenmue is an interesting idea, especially if it's not a remake but a prequel with a new story," Suzuki said.
</p>
<p>
There's no indication that Shenmue 4 is even in development, but that hasn't stopped the desire from fans.
</p>
<p>
Shenmue 3 is "a faithful follow-up to an all-time classic," Martin Robinson wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Eurogamer's Shenmue 3 review</a>. The game continues the story of teen martial artist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father, which began in the first game that impressed with its open world gameplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172776/hunger-games-new-book-movie-haymitch-prequel<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="JeqZ44"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/20/21264857/the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-hunger-games-prequel-suzanne-collins-review">Suzanne Collins</a> is writing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23632809/hunger-games-books-movies-tesserae-reaping-explained">a new Hunger Games book</a> — and congrats everyone, it’s the Haymitch prequel story many (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24025446/polygons-best-ships-2023-fanfic-legend-of-zelda-genshin-impact-baldurs-gate-3">myself included</a>) have been clamoring for. And in a surprise to no one, it’s becoming a movie, too.</p>
<p id="8NXU5E">Everyone say thank you to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23952899/hunger-games-ballad-songbirds-snakes-review"><em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em></a> star <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23971450/hunger-games-the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-casting-rachel-zegler-tom-blyth">Rachel Zegler</a> for manifesting this back in 2021. </p>

<p id="TVRYMb">Titled <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>, Collins’ new book takes place 24 years before the first Hunger Games book — on the dawn of the Second Quarter Quell. If you’re not super plugged into the Hunger Games timeline, that’s the game that Katniss and Peeta’s grumpy mentor Haymitch Abernathy (played by Woody Harrelson in the movies) won, by outsmarting the Gamemakers. </p>
<p id="Z53BYJ">A new Hunger Games book right after the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23987856/hunger-games-new-movie-ballad-songbirds-snakes-box-office-marvel-sequels-delay">box office success</a> of Hunger Games prequel movie might seem like a cash grab, but as longtime Hunger Games movie producer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23848083/hunger-games-ballad-songbirds-snakes-release-cast-preview">Nina Jacobson told Polygon</a> last year, Collins is selective about when she <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23959046/hunger-games-new-movie-fandom-songbirds-snakes">returns to this world</a>. </p>
<p id="bIlGNz">“Suzanne, the originator and North Star of everything that we try to do with these books, she doesn’t write just to make money,” Jacobson said. “She writes when she has something to say.”</p>
<p id="cxLVgf">And boy, does <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23632809/hunger-games-books-movies-tesserae-reaping-explained">Collins have something to say</a> this time! </p>
<p id="T8HCC6"><em>“</em>With <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>, I was inspired by David Hume’s idea of implicit submission and, in his words, ‘the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,’” Collins said in a press release from Scholastic. “The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question ‘Real or not real?’ seems more pressing to me every day.”</p>
<p id="vSckjR">Jacobson promised that the only way she would make another Hunger Games movie is if Collins delivered new source material — and she is standing by her word. On the heels of the novel announcement, Lionsgate announced that it was already in the works on a movie version of <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>. Francis Lawrence, who directed several Hunger Games films including <em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>, is in talks to direct. Haymitch’s backstory was cut from the main Hunger Games films in order to streamline them, so this should be a perfect chance to finally showcase the whole story.</p>
<p id="SazaeW"><em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> arrives to bookstores on March 18, 2025. <em>The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</em> will hit theaters on Nov. 20, 2026.</p>
<p id="LPi5dU"><strong>Update: </strong>After publication of this article, Lionsgate announced plans for a feature adaptation. We’ve updated the story to reflect both announcements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170271/commander-zavala-final-shape-keith-david-lance-reddick<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="lccEVt">Commander Zavala has always been my favorite Destiny character. He’s a dogmatic Paladin whose fervent devotion to his beliefs makes him a rock for his allies — my favorite archetype. And, most importantly, he was voiced by Lance Reddick, an actor I’ve loved since I first saw <em>The Wire</em> in college. </p>
<p id="TMj2kK">When Reddick unexpectedly passed away last year, Guardians like myself <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23645175/destiny-fans-lance-reddick-bungie-tributes-tower">set up a kind of vigil by Zavala in the Tower</a>, standing watch in memory of our fallen commander. I cried then, and I’ve cried multiple times writing this piece. It was a devastating loss for the entire Destiny community, not only because Lance was an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22929725/lance-reddick-destiny-2-witch-queen-commander-zavala-interview-bungie">avid enjoyer</a> of the game, but because Zavala’s story wasn’t finished yet. With this first Destiny saga so close to the end, how could Bungie ever hope to resolve Zavala’s arc without the man behind the voice?</p>
<p id="6fS0YH">Thankfully, it’s a challenge Destiny’s writers seem to have taken in stride, and one his replacement — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23827367/bungie-destiny-2-zavala-voice-actor-keith-david-lance-reddick">the legendary Keith David</a> — took to heart. The narrative team could’ve just written Zavala out of the story and left his decade-long arc in the dust, but instead, they did what they could given the situation and used our collective loss as a storytelling device.</p>

</p>
<p id="ZtVxgp">Since Guardians started toying with the Darkness in <em>Beyond Light</em>, Bungie has slowly been moving Commander Zavala down what I’d call a “crisis of faith” storyline, which is often a critical fork in the road for dogmatic characters in fiction. As Guardians began to move toward the Darkness, Zavala pushed back, diving further into his belief in the Light. He ultimately grew cynical over The Traveler’s silence.</p>
<p id="Ddn2OS">Every step Zavala has taken over the past four years has eroded him. And while he’s spent this entire time standing tall like he always does, he’s weaker on the inside than he seems. So when Zavala finally gets the chance to venture into The Traveler itself and evict The Witness alongside Ikora, Cayde, and the Guardian in <em>The Final Shape</em>, he begins to crumble when The Witness strikes at that weakness.</p>
<p id="5OgWJe">This shift is acted brilliantly by Keith David, who starts the expansion by emulating Reddick before fully taking hold of the character and twisting it into his own. Reddick had a stern kindness to his voice that has served Zavala perfectly for a decade. David has a similarly deep and calming voice, but he is also using his abilities as an actor to add in a sense of hidden malice, which he starts to draw out as the expansion goes on.</p>
<p id="CJOQrz">This change really starts to come into focus when Zavala sends you on a Strike mission in The Pale Heart to hunt down a Tormentor in a cave full of Ahamkara skulls. The commander starts off sounding frustrated, and he pushes you to enact vengeance on the creature. Beyond that, he suggests you take risks by harnessing the magic of these long-dead wish-dragons for your benefit. When it works, he acts as if there was never a chance that it wouldn’t.</p>

<p id="2LKJnD">In other words, Zavala begins to behave recklessly here, and Ikora calls him out for not only endangering the Guardian needlessly, but acting unlike himself. Instead of what would typically be a measured response from Zavala, he sasses Ikora for lecturing him. And when she pushes back again, he yells at her over the comms with a speech along the lines of, “Isn’t this what you always wanted from me?”</p>
<p id="oacmWW">These moments feel antithetical to Zavala as we’ve known him, and if the writing or performance were bad, it would probably feel like the character had just changed for no reason. But Bungie’s writers and Reddick had already been putting in the work toward a broken Zavala for years, so David is able to take that history and sell these moments. I didn’t feel like a new voice actor was changing my favorite character, I felt like I was watching a friend who had gone through an immense amount of trauma finally unraveling before my eyes — something I’ve unfortunately witnessed in my own life.</p>
<p id="ndzc7p">There’s a clear separation between the Zavala we’ve known and the Zavala we’re getting in <em>The Final Shape</em>. I realized for the first time during the Strike how truly different David and Reddick sound from one another, and it’s intentionally unsettling. It made me yearn for the old Zavala and Reddick — something I’ll never have again — and that hurt, in the way that the best kinds of art can hurt.</p>

<p id="AwLxsL">For Zavala, <em>The Final Shape</em>’s campaign acts as a kind of chrysalis and metamorphosis. Bungie’s writers deftly maneuver between Zavala experiencing rapid character growth and acting <em>out </em>of character. David enhances that writing beyond itself — as only great actors can do — with a masterful performance, offering us a Zavala who’s drowning without ever letting the man we know dip beneath the waves for too long. </p>
<p id="oj0hFw">It’s a risky move from both parties that I’m willing to bet won’t work for everyone. But as someone who originally couldn’t imagine anyone else stepping into Zavala’s shoes, I was blown away by how David and the writing team at Bungie were able to honor Reddick and his original performance.</p>
<p id="DuJBjA">Even so, it’s impossible not to feel deep sadness that Lance Reddick wasn’t able to be part of <em>The Final Shape</em> after years of being one of Destiny’s most famous characters and beloved community members. And there’s no doubt in my mind that he would’ve crushed this performance, just as he crushed all the others. But I think it’s beautiful how the writers and Keith David were able to make the most out of a terrible situation, and to give Zavala some of the best story moments in the series during <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p>
<p id="WMy2VL">Rest in peace, commander — Zavala is in good hands. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The next Dragon Age is set to get its first big gameplay reveal on June 11, and when it does, it will be with a new name. IGN can exclusively reveal that the latest entry in the Dragon Age franchise, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-title-logo-revealed">previously known as Dragon Age Dreadwolf</a>, is being renamed Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p><p>The news comes with a host of details that shed new light on BioWare’s anticipated RPG, which up until this point has been kept heavily under wraps. Among other things, BioWare confirmed that The Veilguard will feature seven playable party members, and that it will feature “fun and fluid, moment-to-moment combat” while continuing to center strategy via the unique powers of each companion.</p><p>But it’s the name change that will do the most to raise eyebrows among the fandom. Ever since the conclusion of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/10/dragon-age-inquisition-trespasser-review">Dragon Age: Inquisition’s Trespasser DLC</a>, fans have expected a story focused on Solas, the  former companion who was revealed to be the Elven god Fen’Harel, also known as the Dread Wolf. BioWare general manager Gary McKay explains that while Solas is “still very much a part of the story of Dragon Age: The Veilguard,” the team wanted a title that reflected a “really deep and compelling group of companions.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/12/04/dreadwolfignthumb-1670174168362.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Dragon Age's new name will seek to center its party members rather than Solas, one of the story's villains.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“One thing that’s important to remind fans is that every Dragon Age game is a new and different experience and this game, more so than ever, is about you and your companions – a group that you must rally to fight by your side,” McKay tells IGN. “We can’t wait for players to meet, connect and form their own personal relationships with the unique companions that make up The Veilguard. That’s the spirit of this game…of this story. Choosing who will join you on your adventure, fight alongside you, and be there by your side in the end.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate blog post</a>, McKay elaborated, “Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them – as well as their lives. You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience.”</p><p>McKay claims that the name change wasn’t a matter of focus testing, which commonly informs decisions like these. He even goes so far as to admit that sticking with Dreadwolf might have been easier.</p><p>“We actually think sticking with Dreadolf would have been the safer choice – ‘Dread Wolf’ is a cool name after all!” McKay says. “In the end, it was most important for us to have a title that was authentic to the companions that are the heart of this adventure we’ve created. We’ve worked throughout development to create really incredible backstories for each companion that intersect with the main narrative in meaningful ways.”</p><p>As for why it’s not simply named “Dragon Age IV,” McKay says it’s for the same reason that Dragon Age Inquisition wasn’t called “Dragon Age III: Inquisition.”</p><p>“Every game in the series tells its own unique story and the title is an important element to help set the stage for the next standalone adventure inclusive of its own hero, companions, narrative arc, villain, setting, etc,” he says.</p><h2><strong>The highest-stakes release in BioWare’s history?</strong></h2><p>The name change is the beginning of what is shaping up to be possibly the highest-stakes release in BioWare’s history. It’s been a full decade since Dragon Age: Inquisition – <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-age-inquisition-is-igns-game-of-the-year-2014"><u>which we we named our Game of the Year in 2014</u></a> – and since then the storied RPG studio has been battered by the disastrous release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">Anthem</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">layoffs</a>, and other setbacks, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-part-1-mass-effect">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> being one of its few bright spots. The Veilguard has been in various stages of development during this time, even reportedly being canceled at one point, though McKay frames it as a period of exploration in his blog post.</p><p>“After Dragon Age: Inquisition launched, the studio was given an incredible opportunity to explore, test, and validate a variety of gameplay concepts as we worked to determine what the next Dragon Age could look like,” McKay writes. “We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a multiplayer concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - Official Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>Asked what it means for BioWare to finally be able to show The Veilguard to the world, McKay said, “As the studio head and executive producer, it’s been incredible to see the journey, resilience and passion that this team continues to bring every day. We have an incredible group of both BioWare and Dragon Age veterans who have been with us for years, as well as new faces and voices that love the series who have helped to create an unforgettable experience we feel will be worthy of the Dragon Age name.”</p><p>So who exactly are the Veilguard? In the lore, the Veil is a barrier between the physical world and Fade, which is Dragon Age’s spirit realm. Solas, who helped create the Veil, now wants to destroy it. Hence, as McKay puts it, “the Veil needs guarding.”</p><p>While acknowledging that the why and the how is definitely spoiler territory, McKay says, “The biggest clue I can share is that you and your companions – that make up The Veilguard – are central to taking down a new evil threat unleashed upon Thedas. It might not just be Solas.”</p><p>McKay isn’t quite ready to reveal the party members quite yet, but does provide some hints on what to expect, including some initial info on romances.</p><p>“We spent a lot of time making our companions feel authentic based on their own unique experiences within this larger fantasy world, which in turn makes the relationships you form with them feel even more meaningful. We’ve tapped into Dragon Age’s deep lore and explored its most iconic factions to bring each of the seven companions and their stories to life,” he says. </p><p>“I won’t spoil next week’s reveal but I can say we’ve created a story where you can impact the world and the companions that surround you. Player agency is important to the Dragon Age: The Veilguard experience and allows each player to form unique personal connections with their companions of choice. And, yes, you can romance the companions you want!”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[Y]ou and your companions...are central to taking down a new evil threat unleashed upon Thedas. It might not just be Solas</p></div><p>McKay says the decision to pare the number of companions from nine to seven is mostly down to it being the “right number for the story we’re telling.” Each one is intended to represent a unique faction or element from Thedas, and will feature their own arc with “stories of love and loss, each with meaningful choices and emotional moments.”</p><p>He continues, “As you accompany your companions to unravel their backstory and earn their loyalty and friendship, you’ll visit more regions of Thedas across a deeper variety of biomes than any Dragon Age before it.”</p><p>McKay mostly sidesteps questions of how Inquisition’s characters might fit into The Veilguard’s story, though he does confirm that it will once again feature an original protagonist similar to The Warden, Hawke, and The Inquisitor, noting that each Dragon Game has its own standalone story with its own thread and conflict.</p><p>“Games across the Dragon Age franchise are never designed as a game-over-game continuous storyline. There are familiar arcs, factions and heroes important to the overarching Dragon Age universe that weave through the new story we’re telling,” he explains. “The previous games, characters and events aren’t the anchor of Dragon Age: The Veilguard it’s about your adventure with a brand new cast of companions that you must rally to fight against a powerful force.” </p><p>He once again teases another villain beyond Solas: “I don’t want to get too deep into spoiler territory but I can say that the Dread Wolf is not the only god players need to be worried about.”</p><h2><strong>BioWare hints at what to expect from The Veilguard’s gameplay</strong></h2><p>When The Veilguard is finally revealed on June 11, BioWare’s presentation will include 15 minutes of gameplay from the opening moments of the game, which will help set up the story. On the gameplay front, McKay says that The Veilguard’s combat was a “big area of focus” and something the team wanted to push forward. Among other things, McKay says that The Veilguard will feature an ability wheel designed to give players more direct control over their characters.</p><p>“As an RPG, strategy in combat is important as you bring two companions to every fight. Each companion brings unique powers and abilities that have a direct impact on how you choose to take down the enemies at hand,” he says. “To add another layer to that strategic element, we’re introducing a new ability wheel where you can pause the action and set up your next move – whether it’s your companions’ abilities or your own. </p><p>“The ability wheel opens up a huge amount of strategic possibilities, giving players the ability to control the flow of combat and link powerful combinations of abilities between players and their companions that can quickly turn the tide of any battle. We think we’ve found an exciting balance between fun, fluidity and strategy for every encounter.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN BioWare Game Review</h3></div></output><p>It all points toward a game that seems likely to please longtime fans of the series who have been waiting anxiously for a new entry over the last 10 years – and it’ll need to be. BioWare won’t say it directly, but everyone seems aware that a lot is riding on Dragon Age. Its reception will say a lot about whether BioWare is able to reestablish itself as a top-tier RPG studio alongside Larian, CD Projekt Red, and other recent success stories.</p><p>“This is a game and experience that continues BioWare’s tradition of single player RPG storytelling set in the epic fantasy world of Thedas,” McKay says. “We know Dragon Age fans and the community have been waiting a long time for the next game and we could not be more excited to share our gameplay reveal on June 11."</p><p>Make sure to stay tuned to IGN for more Dragon Age info, as well as lots more from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-and-livestream-details-officially-announced">Summer Game Fest</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Live</a>, and more. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Dragon Age: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Here's every release in the acclaimed RPG series past and future.</p></div><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/house-flipper-2-fairytale-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frozen District and PlayWay have announced a&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>update that's bringing some much-needed improvements to the game's Story Mode, as well as a, erm, "crossover" with a world-famous fairytale.</p>

<p>In a press release, Frozen District says the new update will allow you to renovate Little Red Riding Hood's grandma's house, which has been "left in shambles after encountering the Big Bad Wolf".</p>

<p>As such, you'll have to clean up the aftermath of the wolf's rampage, including "claw marks" and "fur remnants", as well as pawprints in the bedroom. You'll also need to work with "retro appliances" and a small elderly-friendly bathroom.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/house-flipper-2-fairytale-update-before-after.jpg?itok=gOFC6S8m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/house-flipper-2-fairytale-update-before-after.jpg?itok=l1rhZ7VX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>has a fairytale cottage for you to renovate in its latest update.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the aforementioned fairytale renovation, this latest&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>update also adds a new Before-After mechanic, which allows you to view before and after pictures of your renovation side-by-side.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>update without new items, and there are a whopping 190 to discover, including new wood materials, "charming cat-patterned wallpapers", and much more.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to gameplay improvements like simplified repairs, better HUD hiding, and "enhanced lamp style copying", which sounds like a feature pretty much any game could benefit from.</p>




<p><em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to&nbsp;<em>House Flipper</em>, a house renovation sim in which you must take crumbling properties and transform them into beautiful places in which people would actually want to live.</p>

<p>If you're not in the mood for taking on challenges, you can always enjoy things at your own pace in Sandbox Mode, which essentially allows you to build your dream home at your own pace.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190970/House_Flipper_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">right now on PC via Steam</a>.

Microsoft started the year by laying off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees</a>, then announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">four in-house games</a> would drop their exclusivity and ship on PS5 and Nintendo Switch. More recently, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">shut down three game studios</a>, including Tango Gameworks, maker of the award-winning and widely praised <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.</p><p>The moves have rattled fans. Hardcore Xbox customers are upset that exclusives are available on rival consoles, with many wondering why they should continue to invest in the Xbox ecosystem when Microsoft is shutting down studios and its games are appearing on rival platforms anyway. Sunday’s Xbox Games Showcase is a chance for Microsoft to try and get fans excited about the future again. I’m expecting two big game reveals, a lot of release dates, and some surprises along the way.</p><p>At the heart of all the turmoil leading up to this Xbox showcase are strategy shifts for both hardware and first-party games. Microsoft has promised a big technical leap for its next-gen Xbox, and the company is rumored to be working on an Xbox handheld. But there’s an ongoing project to bring more games to rival consoles like the PS5 and Nintendo Switch that could undermine both hardware efforts.</p><p>The plan that’s proven so controversial with hardcore Xbox fans is known internally as “Project Latitude,” sources familiar with Microsoft’s efforts tell me. Project Latitude started off with an initial wave of games, including <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Pentiment</em>, <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and <em>Grounded</em>,<em> </em>heading to the PS5, with some going to the Nintendo Switch, but the plan extends beyond these four games and into some titles that might surprise Xbox fans.</p><div>

</div><div>



            
<p>I’ve been scouring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> demos specifically for something laid back, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/">Spilled!</a> – despite sounding like the title of a musical about upturned milk – has delivered nicely. It’s a light and breezy ocean cleanup game that has you sailing a cute lil’ boat around polluted seas, cleansing oil patches and scooping up plastic bottles. Even if it doesn’t have the every-last-speck detailing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/viscera-cleanup-detail">Viscera Cleanup Detail</a>, it satisfies in very similar ways, and I would very much like to get back out on the water whenever the full game is complete.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Spilled! technically operates on a cash-for-gunk system: returning any collected waste to a stationary mothership will reward you with coins, which can then be spent on improving your own boat’s speed, oil carrying capacity, and scoop size. Ultimately, though, these upgrades are optional, your only real task being the collection of those pollutants in the first instance. Plus the occasional rescue of gooed-up wildlife, who are subsequently added to... some kind of collection? It might just be a UI thing but I like to think all the animals come hang out on the boat out of gratitude.</p>
<p>Either way, the pleasure is very much found in the cleaning itself, rather than the rewards. And what a gentle, cosy kind of pleasure it is. Maybe as an English person, I just want to live out the fantasy of someone <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-62631320">relieving my nation’s water of its turds</a>, but anyone with a functioning heart should be warmed from within by Spilled!’s riverscrubbing. As the pitch-black splotches subside, hellish red waters gradually return to a crystalline blue, revealing even more happy fauna under the surface. Meanwhile, nearby hills are dotted liberally with solar panels and wind turbines, making each new stretch of spotless water feel like not just a return to the natural order but another step towards the harmonious green ideal that this world’s denizens have managed to figure out back on land.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It’s not challenging in any way, but that’s kind of the point, and at least there are a few different types of clearable junk to break up the routine. Oil slicks can simply be sailed over, but discard plastic must be manually pushed back to the control ship, thus calling for more careful steering. Eventually you get a water cannon to clean up stains above the waterline; again, this might lack the puzzle element of PowerWash Sim’s swappable nozzles, but damned if I don’t smile at its cartoon bubbling effect.</p>
<p>On that note, Spilled! understands that any cleaning game worth its soap needs a healthy collection of ear-pleasing sounds. These keep the gratifaction coming, whether it’s the soft buzz of your oil vacuum, the airy doinking of plastic bottles knocking together in the scoop, or merely the light trickling as your boat passes through freshly cleared waters. That’s all on top of an appropriately flowy piano ‘n’ strings soundtrack, too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/">try the demo</a> yourself, including three stages of the game’s planned eight. Closer inspection of that Steam store page also reveals that Spilled! is actually being <em>developed</em> on a boat as well, so bonus seafaring points there for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172878/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-name-change-bioware<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="GpXcf2">BioWare’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23151929/dragon-age-dread-wolf-title-bioware-da4-dreadwolf"><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em></a> is no more. The next entry in the role-playing game franchise is now known as <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, the developer announced Thursday, ahead of a planned first look at gameplay on June 11.</p>
<p id="LHc7u4">Gary McKay, executive producer on Dragon Age and general manager of BioWare, says the name change for the fourth mainline Dragon Age game reflects the developer’s focus not on the game’s antagonist, but on the heroes you’ll play as in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p>
<p id="GldwGT">“Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them — as well as their lives,” <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/">McKay said in a blog post</a>. “You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions — not your enemies — are the heart of this new experience.</p>
<p id="aFiu7l">“So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn’t show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you’ll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas.” Hence, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</p>

<p id="7zEjUt">BioWare and publisher Electronic Arts have been using the name <em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em> for their follow-up to 2014’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/11/7134385/dragon-age-inquisition-review-ps4-xbox-one-playstation-4-pc"><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em></a> for the past two years. So there are still plenty of product listings and watermarked screenshots that currently carry the old name for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. EA and BioWare will have no small amount of work for themselves to condition players to forget the old <em>Dreadwolf</em> name, but hopefully the gameplay they show next week will impress to the point where those memories are wiped away. No pressure, folks!</p>
<p id="8bV7UV">If you want to see 15 minutes of gameplay from <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, you’ll need to tune in to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dragonage">Dragon Age YouTube channel</a> on June 11 at 8 a.m. PDT/11 a.m. EDT. BioWare’s new role-playing game promises to be an “incredible single-player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us,” McKay said. </p>
<p id="2bTnM2">The fourth Dragon Age game was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/2018/12/6/18129767/dragon-age-dread-wolf-rises-teaser-trailer-tga-2018">first teased back in 2018</a>. McKay said that over the course of the game’s lengthy development, BioWare experimented with multiple concepts, including a multiplayer take on Dragon Age. Ultimately, however, they settled on a classic, single-player adventure, with the blessing of EA.</p>
<p id="mepCYG"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is bound for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X, but does not have an announced release date. </p>

McKay says Solas will still be a major player in <em>The Veilguard</em>, but the title change is meant to put a spotlight on the companions you’ll recruit in the RPG.</p><p>“One thing that’s important to remind fans is that every <em>Dragon Age</em> game is a new and different experience and this game, more so than ever, is about you and your companions – a group that you must rally to fight by your side,” McKay tells IGN. “We can’t wait for players to meet, connect and form their own personal relationships with the unique companions that make up The Veilguard. That’s the spirit of this game…of this story. Choosing who will join you on your adventure, fight alongside you, and be there by your side in the end.”</p><p>McKay confirmed in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a></span> that <em>The Veilguard </em>will include seven companions. We’ll be meeting a few of them soon, as BioWare plans to release 15 minutes of footage highlighting the game’s opening on June 11 at 8 a.m. Pacific on the <em>Dragon Age </em>YouTube channel.</p><p>I understand the naming convention lines up with <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, which also was named after the team you were assembling, but <em>Dreadwolf </em>was a striking title that I will dearly miss. I already have my issues with <em>Dragon Age </em>not giving big storylines their due as it hops around its universe each game, so I hope what BioWare is saying about Solas remaining a fixture is true even as the name changes. I’m looking forward to obsessively scrubbing through 15 minutes of footage after a literal decade of waiting, though. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new report from Esquire has outlined the approximate costs for running a trailer during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">outlet says</a> that according to ‘multiple marketing professionals’, the Summer Game Fest’s main show will cost “$250,000 for 1 minute, $350,000 for 1.5 minutes, $450,000 for 2 minutes, and $550,000 for 2.5 minutes”, with the prices allegedly being in line with last year’s edition of The Game Awards.</p>



<p>“If you add up all of the 1-to-2.5-minute trailers aired during last year’s Summer Game Fest, those price levels could translate into a $9.65 million”, says Esquire. Speaking to PR professionals, the outlet says that “PR folks at larger studios say these trailer premieres are worth the spend”, but “the current pricing tiers make Summer Game Fest an unattainable goal for most indie developers and publishers”.</p>



<p>What’s particularly interesting here, though, is that the prices this year are supposedly the same as those of The Game Awards, which could explain why the show pressed winners during their acceptance speeches to “Wrap it up” after only 30 seconds of speaking—which is $125,000 of potential marketing revenue.</p>



<p>Geoff Keighley is yet to respond to the report.</p>



<p>What do you think about the pricing of Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards trailer? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

<h2 id="h-blockbuster-inc-interview">Blockbuster Inc Interview</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-were-the-inspirations-behind-blockbuster-inc">What were the inspirations behind Blockbuster Inc?</h3>



<p><strong>Panos Tzimas: </strong>Definitely.&nbsp;I mean, the game is definitely inspired and paying some sort of homage to this all-time classic, pretty much.&nbsp;It’s a niche and we’re exploring it right now with our own twist. So yeah, I mean, a lot of people will be comparing the two.&nbsp;And a lot of times, people will also say we’re the spiritual successors of the movies.</p>



<p>And we couldn’t be happier to hear that. So it’s fantastic.&nbsp;And we would love to deliver something that kind of like scratches that itch that people have from not being able to play this game anymore.&nbsp;It’s not available. So yeah, that’s pretty much what leads us to strive to produce the best game possible for the people and the fans.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-important-was-it-to-make-sure-there-was-much-more-than-that-top-layer-of-you-just-build-a-movie">How important was it to make sure there was much more than that top layer of you just build a movie?</h3>



<p><strong><strong>Tzimas:</strong></strong> I mean, this is kind of like an effort and a project that’s been going back for like six years, especially for me.&nbsp;It started as a side project.&nbsp;So you can imagine, like, we had no clue as a team that we would reach this point where, you know, the expansion we had, like from the development standpoint and how deep pretty much it got.It kind of like evolved through time.</p>



<p>&nbsp;But yeah, definitely.&nbsp;I mean, obviously, as a small team of three people, we always strive for the best and we have to like, you know, at work pretty much every other studio that makes similar stuff has more people and more manpower. So we would even love to add even more depth to the game.&nbsp;So, yeah, definitely.&nbsp;You can say this was the goal and it still is. </p>



<p>And, you know, post release, it’s going to get even deeper.&nbsp;So, you know, we’re excited for people to try it out and, you know, also kind of like give us feedback and see where we get.</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-how-important-was-it-to-make-sure-there-was-a-detailed-tutorial-system">How important was it to make sure there was a detailed tutorial system?</h3>



<p><strong><strong>Tzimas</strong></strong>: I think I think it’s extremely, extremely important, especially the way we structured our tutorial system.&nbsp;It’s not the classic mission oriented way of doing things because our focus is mostly on the sandbox kind of experience for people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we don’t want to really interrupt people while they’re building their studio from the ground up.&nbsp;So we have like these chapters, what we call them for the tutorials.&nbsp;And everybody can kind of like hop back to any chapter they have questions about.</p>



<p>It’s kind of like an in-game encyclopedia, but like an interactive one.&nbsp;That’s the way we consider it.&nbsp;So extremely important. </p>



<p>I mean, I know for sure that a lot of people will feel a lot of familiarity with what’s going on in the game, especially simulation fans and management fans.&nbsp;But at the same time, you got to assume people, you know, will will need help and adjusting to the game and the new features that we’re adding, because even if you played the movies, we’re adding a lot of new stuff.&nbsp;And, you know, you got to kind of help people explore through all these options and, you know, figure out like the tips and tricks and everything for the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-there-is-a-lot-to-do-in-the-game-like-managing-schedules-taking-care-of-housing-the-food-you-offer-and-more-how-did-that-process-go-into-coming-up-with-the-features-that-you-guys-wanted-in-blockbuster-inc">There is a lot to do in the game like managing schedules, taking care of housing, the food you offer, and more. How did that process go into coming up with the features that you guys wanted in Blockbuster Inc.?</h3>



<p><strong><strong>Tzimas</strong></strong>: It sounds difficult if we present it like that, but also keep in mind that a lot of these things help with automation within the game.&nbsp;So for example, the schedule is an automatic process that guides the people and employees in the studio and to their tasks.&nbsp;It’s also one of these things that we want to expand upon after the release where you can have like individual schedules for groups and specific things that you’re going to be creating. </p>



<p>And when it comes to city map, that’s what we call it when you go outside the studio and you can manage the rent and all these things.&nbsp;It’s also one of those things that we want to build upon.&nbsp;We want to make this city kind of like a live environment where you can hop on the award ceremonies and have it change and all these things through the decades, which is important for us to replicate the feelings of each decade and have people really draw them into every era so they can experience the cinematography and everything.</p>



<p>Pretty much the Hollywood experience through our lens.&nbsp;So yeah, I mean, especially with Costas, we talk a lot about balancing and the design of the game and how we can help people use all these tools that we’re giving them as a system-based game, but at the same time make their lives a bit easier so you don’t have to really micromanage everything.&nbsp;And that’s what guides our decision and that’s why we listen to the community and see what they wish and what they would change. And yeah, we’re really active there.</p>



<p><strong>Alkis Tagaras</strong>: Exactly, like community feedback was very important and still is.&nbsp;So yeah, they tell us what they like and what they don’t, and we listen, we manage, we delegate things, and we do what we have to do, I guess.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-how-is-it-juggling-all-this-feedback-and-everything-you-get-in-nbsp-what-i-guess-maybe-is-the-process-like-nbsp-do-you-compare-it-to-what-you-already-have-planned-or-how-does-that-work">How is it juggling all this feedback and everything you get in?&nbsp;What I guess maybe is the process like?&nbsp;Do you compare it to what you already have planned or how does that work?</h3>



<p><strong><strong>Tzimas</strong></strong>: It’s kind of like both, but we always pay attention to patterns.&nbsp;So if we see specific feedback, a type of feedback that always reoccurs within the community, then we know that it’s something that makes sense for us to at least investigate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, we heard some, as you said, ridiculous, we wouldn’t call it that, but we would call it funny, hilarious feedback for the game. It’s amazing to see how creative people can get through the community, but as I said before, keep in mind we’re just three core people and we can’t really, we gotta adjust everything to a tight schedule and we also gotta pay attention to add value to the game every time we add something new from the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I guess that’s it.&nbsp;First of all, it’s a pattern. So if it’s a pattern, then we’re gonna definitely investigate it.&nbsp;And then it’s just about efficiency and if we can manage to pull it in the game without disrupting any other mechanics.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-has-it-been-like-developing-and-releasing-a-game-when-there-is-so-much-turmoil-and-uncertainty-in-the-industry">What has it been like developing and releasing a game when there is so much turmoil and uncertainty in the industry?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas:</strong> I think everybody can comment, but I’m gonna start.&nbsp;For me, it’s a surreal feeling.&nbsp;It shows our resilience and passion about this project.No doubt, we just love working on this game.&nbsp;Also, I want to add that we’re lucky to have such publishers, because they’re supporting us.&nbsp;Not only financially, but throughout everything, we’re on the same page on what we want to deliver.I guess we do consider ourselves very lucky on that matter.&nbsp;I mean, we all hear stories about publishing developers, but props to them, props to the team.</p>



<p>We have a very good relationship between us. I think through the tough times, we hold each other up.&nbsp;It’s just teamwork, passion, and resilience in the end.&nbsp;I see a lot of indie teams that are struggling, but you gotta stay focused, man.</p>



<p>You gotta push through these tough times, because it’s kind of like a loop.&nbsp;Good times will come back, and then there’s gonna be hard times again, and that’s just gonna keep going, going, going.&nbsp;If you love game development, you’re gonna make it. I think that’s what I want to add.&nbsp;Maybe Alkis and Kostas can comment on how they view this whole thing.</p>



<p><strong>Tagaras</strong>: I mean, it’s exactly what Panos said, right?&nbsp;You need passion.&nbsp;You need a good team. We are lucky that we have good publishers, and we communicate very good.&nbsp;It takes a lot.&nbsp;It’s very challenging. I’m not gonna lie.&nbsp;Of course, it’s very challenging, but if you love what you do, you go to the end.</p>



<p><strong>Kostas Ventouras</strong>: Yeah, same thing.&nbsp;All of us started with the idea of making a game we like, and what made it happen is that we kept ourselves together.&nbsp;All of us wanted to make a good result out of it.We kept having good ideas, things to add, and as long as we have the time and the ability, we will keep adding stuff because we want to get the best out of it.&nbsp;I think that’s really what drives it the most.</p>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong> Yeah, and we’re having fun, right?&nbsp;So, it’s not just work for us.&nbsp;I think that’s important when you wake up, and it doesn’t feel like work no matter how many hours we’re gonna crunch, and that’s what keeps the passion alive. </p>



<p>Even post-release, adding all this new stuff that we have, concepts and ideas, this is not the end for us.&nbsp;So, that’s what keeps us active.&nbsp;It’s also the community. So, I think once you get the community in, they also feed you.&nbsp;You feed off each other, their energies, and it keeps the engine ignited and everything as well.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-was-a-full-video-editor-for-the-movies-a-plan-to-include-from-the-start-in-blockbuster-inc">Was a full video editor for the movies a plan to include from the start in Blockbuster Inc.?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong>Not at all.&nbsp;When I first designed the game, it was way closer as a concept to, can I name drop other games as inspirations?&nbsp;I guess I can.It was kind of like a blend of Game Dev Tycoon with Prison Architect, if it makes any sense.</p>



<p>So, it was also 2D back then, so it was never a 3D game originally, but as I said, as we started posting stuff and seeing what the community told us, everybody was expecting for this new, the movie’s kind of spiritual successor, and without this video editor and the visual feedback from the movies that you make, people were just like, okay, so what are you guys doing?&nbsp;How are we going to experience like Hollywood or film would, as we call it in the game, how can we experience it fully?&nbsp;And then we just realized, okay, we got to do it.</p>



<p>We definitely have to add something like this.&nbsp;And again, I’m just going to keep saying that, post-release, it’s going to get even better, even more content, even more animations to pick from.&nbsp;So, yeah, it was never the plan originally, but there’s a lot of stuff we added because of the people.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-did-the-team-decide-on-adding-features-genres-themes-and-more-into-the-game">How did the team decide on adding features, genres, themes, and more into the game?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong>I think we’re just trying to capture the majority of stuff.&nbsp;Obviously, each one of us have seen shows and movies that we like and pop culture elements, which we intend to add even more in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But originally, there were specific genres and themes that we had to add just as a base for the game. For example, vampires, you can’t really do a 1920s run without vampires.&nbsp;It’s just the basic elements, trying to get all the mainstream attention to this stuff.&nbsp;And then post-release, we’ll just keep adding. I think eventually, we might even have polls on what people would love to see, and we can make something close to the real stuff, but mostly as a reference.</p>



<h3 id="h-was-there-anything-that-just-didn-t-click-or-had-to-be-removed">Was there anything that just didn’t click or had to be removed?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas:</strong> We have not abandoned…&nbsp;Kostas, you can correct me if I’m wrong, but we have never abandoned a feature that we intended to add, but some of the features are not fully fleshed out yet completely.&nbsp;And we will also not abandon them, but we do have to prioritize. </p>



<p>There’s stuff for the meta game after the 60s or the 70s in game where stocks and shares come into play.&nbsp;And these things had to take lesser priority over, for example, the video editor that you said, because we saw that people really want a video editor. So yeah, we never cut content from the game, but we do have keep improving a lot of aspects of the game. So yeah, that’s pretty much how we roll.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-when-you-see-just-everything-you-guys-have-done-as-a-team-to-get-to-this-point-what-is-the-first-thing-that-goes-through-your-mind-knowing-it-s-here-it-s-out-now-it-s-just-supporting-it">When you see just everything you guys have done as a team to get to this point, what is the first thing that goes through your mind knowing it’s here, it’s out, now it’s just supporting it?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong>I don’t even know, man.&nbsp;It’s just a mix of emotions.&nbsp;To be honest, it feels surreal. Even talking about it, it’s just been so long that I think we’re all very excited and terrified at the same time.&nbsp;We even had a prologue out.&nbsp;It’s not even our first release. </p>



<p>There was a demo out and we saw the feedback from the people.&nbsp;I mean, we got 95% positive reactions.&nbsp;So yeah, I don’t know. I just say ecstatic.&nbsp;I think that’s the only word that describes my feelings.&nbsp;Maybe the guys can comment on what they feel like, but yeah, ecstatic and terrified.</p>



<p><strong>Tagaras</strong>: Exactly.&nbsp;It’s a mixture.&nbsp;I’m worried and excited.I’m happy.&nbsp;Every day I’m telling Thanos, 10 days, nine days, eight days, seven days.&nbsp;It’s crazy.It’s so surreal, but it’s exciting.&nbsp;Yeah, for sure.</p>



<p><strong>Ventouras</strong>: Yeah, I think that’s the thing.&nbsp;Mostly, it’s normal to be a little bit stressed on what you expect to see, but I think at this point, we can be optimistic enough about it.</p>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong>Yeah.&nbsp;And just one last thing to add to this question is that we’re not that stressed in a negative way because we know that we’re going to keep being super active on the community and the development post-release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So for us, it’s just work as usual. We just hope people understand that there’s definitely going to be a roadmap in the future.&nbsp;There’s definitely going to be more features than Conan added.&nbsp;So there’s, in a sense, nothing to be worried about. I mean, sure, some people might not enjoy what we created, but that’s all part of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-important-was-it-to-allow-that-flexibility-and-that-freedom-from-players-with-steam-workshop">How important was it to allow that flexibility and that freedom from players with Steam Workshop?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas</strong>: Extremely important.&nbsp;I think it’s a game like this one that need to have a workshop, like full-on creativity.&nbsp;And even the simplest example, there’s a lot of shows and movies that we can’t really replicate for copyright reasons, but that’s where the community comes into play and they create their very own unique stuff. </p>



<p>We will expand upon this as well.&nbsp;But for now, they can share their sets.&nbsp;And if somebody wants to get in the game and not have to build their own sets because they want to focus on the management side only, that’s fine. We got you.&nbsp;So as I said, extremely important.&nbsp;Involve the people as much as possible. This is the way we operate as a team in all aspects.&nbsp;Concepts, ideas, feedback, workshop, anything.&nbsp;And we will try to include even more options for the release.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-future-plans-for-blockbuster-inc">What are the future plans for Blockbuster Inc.?</h2>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong>I said, for example, one of the things that we want to add, a minor thing, is the schedules.&nbsp;Even more schedules, even more content.&nbsp;We cannot really say anything specific right now because the first month after release, it’s really important for us to gather all the feedback from a massive player base that’s going to play the game, hopefully. </p>



<p>And we’re going to direct pretty much our roadmap through that.&nbsp;So we can’t really say because we can’t promise something that’s not going to happen for the roadmap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stay tuned. You will see a roadmap very soon.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The update also includes a series of new character cosmetics and new brooms, allowing players to zoom around the Hogwarts campus in style. All of the update's features--including cosmetics--are available for free (though it's possible some of them must first be unlocked in-game via quests or other activities). Some of the new cosmetic items featured in the update include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Azkaban Coat</li><li dir="ltr">Azkaban Prisoner’s Outfit</li><li dir="ltr">The Glasses That Lived</li><li dir="ltr">Lavender Borealis Broom</li></ul><p dir="ltr">One major change included in the update is the ability to reset talent tree points. This will allow players a chance to change up their build and experiment with different playstyles on a single character, as opposed to starting a new one from scratch just to try out some different talents.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Hogwarts Legacy summer update has expanded access to the Haunted Hogsmeade Shop quest, which was previously available only to PlayStation users. As of the summer update, players on all platforms can take part in the quest and earn quest-exclusive rewards, including the Shop Keeper’s Outfit and the ability to gain ownership of their very own Hogsmeade shop.</p><p dir="ltr">Other previously exclusive items are now available to all players, including the Onyx Hippogriff mount and the Felix Felicis Potion Recipe item.</p>

        <p>Ampere Analysis' Piers Harding-Rolls predicts a boost to Game Pass Ultimate, and some disruption for Sony</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-continues-xboxs-bet-on-activision-boost-for-game-pass">recently confirmed that the upcoming annual Call of Duty premium release will enter its Game Pass multi-game subscription service</a> at launch.</p>
<p>This promises to boost interest in Game Pass and disrupt Sony’s full game business, but by how much? While it’s challenging to predict the specific commercial impact, Activision’s product strategy, and the agreements made during its acquisition by Microsoft, means the impact will not be as far reaching as it might have been in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft follows through with well-established strategy</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft’s decision to put all first-party games releases directly into Game Pass was a watershed moment for multi-game subscription services and propelled the service to more significant consumer adoption over the subsequent years.</p>
<p>Following the huge cost of Activision Blizzard’s acquisition, there was some recent speculation around whether its biggest franchise, Call of Duty, would make it day-and-date into Game Pass. Realistically, it would be difficult for Microsoft to row back on this key policy either by windowing the inclusion of the game or placing the game behind a more expensive subscription paywall. This would have undermined the positioning of Game Pass and weakened its appeal significantly.</p>
<p>Adding new Call of Duty releases to the service will attract entirely new and lapsed subscribers to Game Pass. We expect most of those new subscribers to be at the Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers. There is no doubt that adding Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 to Game Pass at launch will be expensive, at least initially, for Microsoft, but there are factors that will reduce the costs associated by such a move, while still maximizing the positive impact on subscription numbers.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>As an online game, inclusion of Call of Duty will drive upsell to Game Pass Ultimate from Game Pass Console generating higher average revenue per user.</li>
<li>The potential to offer early access to those who buy the premium/ultimate edition of the game, including those that upgrade having got access to the standard version of the game through Game Pass. This strategy worked well during the launch of Starfield in 2023 and, if used again, will boost premium revenue streams at launch</li>
<li>Call of Duty is now predominantly a live service game that monetises strongly in-game. Microsoft will be trading premium full-game sales in exchange for a bigger audience that can be monetised in-game instead</li>
<li>As part of the conditions of buying Activision Blizzard, Microsoft agreed to allow third-party cloud gaming service providers access to future Call of Duty games at launch. While third-party multi-game subscription services – such as Sony’s PS Plus - are very unlikely to be able to afford the licensing costs of such a move, Microsoft’s strategy will be exposing more gamers to the franchise via bring-your-own-game services such as Nvidia’s GeForce Now</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sony will be commercially disrupted, but F2P and live-service attributes lessen the blow </strong></p>
<p>PlayStation Call of Duty gamers will inevitably be disrupted to an extent and that will be a concern for Sony. At its recent annual Business Segment meeting, Sony highlighted that Call of Duty was one of ten major franchises that made up over 50% of its storefront revenue over the last three fiscal years.</p>
<p>However, the live-service nature of Call of Duty, and its very popular free-to-play offering Warzone, means the disruption will not be as significant as it might have been in the past when all revenue from a content point of view was centred on premium sales. Ampere’s data shows that Call of Duty HQ (the launcher covering Modern Warfare III, Modern Warfare II and Warzone) has consistently high monthly active users of between 22 to 26 million across PlayStation, Xbox and Steam.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Ampere-CoD-MAU-June-24.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Those that own both Xbox and PlayStation consoles may be swayed to play the game on Microsoft’s devices, but cross-platform play and multi-platform accounts means that this is not necessarily a permanent decision. Indeed, there could be scenarios where PlayStation-first multi-console gamers switch to Xbox to play the premium campaign while still playing the free-to-play Warzone on their preferred console under a single Activision account. Ampere’s consumer data shows ownership overlap between the disc-based PS5 and Xbox Series X in the US is around 35% for 16-64 year olds, so the numbers this is relevant to are significant.</p>
<p>Those Call of Duty gamers that have yet to upgrade to the latest generation of consoles and are ready to invest, will look more favourably on the Xbox Series offer. This will not have a major impact on current console sales trends, but it will influence a small share of buyers as they assess the advantages and disadvantages of the respective platforms. It’s worth noting that Call of Duty gamers are fairly high games content, service and accessories spenders, and adding more of those to Xbox will be a boost for the lifetime revenues of Microsoft’s player base.</p>

Not anything professional, mind you: just a humble compilation of recipes inspired by the games that made me hungry, a community-turned-personal project that I got over the finishing line more out of spite than anything else. At the time, video game cookbooks weren’t much of a thing, although pioneers on sites like Tumblr and SnackOrDie (and later, Pinterest and YouTube) were paving the way with homemade projects that eventually launched into entire geek cooking and baking channels where players could learn how to create facsimiles of in-game foods or goodies styled to look like game items or characters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These days, I’m outclassed by miles. These sorts of books or baking projects are no longer a hobbyist pursuit; you can get official video game cookbooks written by actual chefs, centered on famously delicious titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or the Pokémon series. Recently, the Official Fallout Cookbook played a huge role in the debut of the Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime, with scores of fans brewing up batches of Nuka Cola and Blamco Mac and Cheese to dine on while marathoning the show.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can even play a tabletop game that requires baking as part of its play, as with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Edible-Games-Cookbook-Play-your-ebook/dp/B08738MVBZ">Edible Games Cookbook by developer Jenn Sandercock</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Things have come a long way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I look back now and see the rise of video game cooking as part of the greater geekcraft movement of the late ‘10s, when the Internet was still driven by novelties and niche tchotchkes, and what holes existed in games merchandise were filled by hobbyists and artisans on Etsy. These days, I still like to make video game meals on my own, and it’s a little easier than it once was, at least in the selection department. Now that crafting and survival games have become so popular, there are a lot more dishes to choose from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But I still respect the classics. The Sims, for example, is one of those games that often inspires experiments in the kitchen not so much because the recipes are impressive or complex, but because I always get so hungry when I play. The Cooking skill has 10 levels, and as your Sim progresses in rank, the recipes increase in complexity. Oddly, French Toast is among the later recipes the Sims learn in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which I found confusing because of how easy the dish is to make. It’s truly a starter recipe. I remember whipping up batches of it when I was seven years old.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be fair though, I don't remember baking the French Toast in the oven, either; typically, it’s a skillet or griddle-made food. In The Sims, the character animation for making French toast shows them putting the ingredients in what appears to be a full-sized turkey roaster and then sticking it in the oven. I’m not sure why they do this, as other items are made on top of the stove.

<p data-characters="297" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’m ashamed to admit that, until recently, I didn’t realize that CD Projekt was behind the Good Old Game distribution platform. Of all the video game PC clients out there, Steam is undoubtedly the head honcho, but GOG is a great alternative, especially when it comes to retro releases.</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">However, there’s something you need to be aware of. As outlined in a section on the GOG.com <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/18730340487709-Review-your-Cloud-Saves-to-avoid-loss-of-files?product=gog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support page</a>, the platform will begin removing Cloud Save files from its servers after August 31. Everyone who has an account is encouraged to review their own files if they don’t want to lose any data.</p> <figure data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via support.gog.com</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">However, it’s only going to be on saves that exceed the “default allocation limit” of 200MB per game. But it’s in your best interest to see what – if anything – you’re happy to delete from the servers in order to stay within the storage cap.</p> <h2 id="h-why-s-this-happening" data-injectable="false">Why’s this happening?</h2> <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">According to the article, GOG is limiting cloud space to take into consideration the growing demand for storage in this modern gaming era. The message says that such measures being put into place after August are to “ensure that all players have access to sufficient and manageable space for their game progress” and that the company can “keep the associated costs under control.”</p>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">If you absolutely want to make sure you don’t lose any save data from the GOG cloud service, <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/18730324957213-How-do-I-back-up-my-cloud-saves?product=gog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this page</a> will give you a quick lowdown on how to back up files through the GOG GALAXY app. Once the time comes, data will be deleted from the servers, starting with unnecessary files, such as “things that are not at all related to your game, but have found their way into the Cloud Save folder.”</p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">However, save files that are stored “locally on your computer” will not be deleted. In short: if you have a GOG account – especially if you use GALAXY – make sure you <a href="https://www.gog.com/account/cloud-saves/page/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review the games on your account</a> to make sure they’re within the 200MB limit.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-dreadwolf-unveils-new-name-gameplay-coming-next-week.891384/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-the-veilguard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>has a new name, and that it won't be long before we finally get to see some gameplay for the long-awaited RPG.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a>, BioWare outlines the reasons for the change and teases what you can expect from the next major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>franchise, although no release date or release window have been revealed as yet.</p>

<h2><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>is now&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></h2>

<p><em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>executive producer Gary McKay says that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s previous name,&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf</em>, didn't adequately capture "what this game is all about" or "how strongly" the studio feels about the game's characters and narrative.</p>

<p>By contrast,&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>apparently expresses that fervor much more strongly, although given that we still don't know much about the game or its setup, I think the difference is relatively moot at the moment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-city.jpg?itok=-4_juBWx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-city.jpg?itok=AyENxo3z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>has a snazzy new name.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned blog post, McKay says that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>will introduce seven companions, each with "deep and compelling storylines" associated with them.</p>

<p>McKay also points to the fact that each&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>game introduces a new hero with a new identity: the Gray Warden, Hawke, and the Inquisitor. Perhaps "The Veilguard" will be the name of the new game's hero.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it won't be very long before we get to find out what's going on with<em>&nbsp;Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, because BioWare says it's planning to unveil the first gameplay footage for the game on June 11th at 8am Pacific.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas.jpg?itok=zJMCMi69 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas.jpg?itok=fXuZTOBZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em>'s original name was based around the elf Solas.</figcaption></figure><p>At that time, BioWare will show off "over 15 minutes" of gameplay from the opening moments of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, so we'll finally learn what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>(or&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>) actually is.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Age 4&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-named-as-next-dragon-age-game">officially unveiled</a> as&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>back in June 2022, having been in development for some years prior. The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-reaches-dragon-age-dreadwolf-alpha-milestone">passed its alpha development milestone</a> in October that same year, and BioWare subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-will-be-fully-revealed-in-summer-2024">promised a full reveal this summer</a>, which it looks like we're about to get.</p>

            <p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-confusion-over-whats-happening-with-dragon-age-dreadwolf-this-week">Eurogamer reported earlier today</a>, Dragon Age Dreadwolf has a new name - which has now been formally announced as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare boss Gary McKay revealed the game's new title in a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/">blog post</a> today that also offered fresh details on the game - and an explanation for why its name has changed at the eleventh hour. 
</p>
<p>
"Every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story," McKay wrote. "Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a new lead hero – The Warden, Hawke, The Inquisitor – that you can call your own. You can expect all that, and more, with the new game. 
</p>

<p>
"And of course, much like your unique hero, it wouldn't be a Dragon Age game without an amazing cast of companions - right? Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them - as well as their lives. 
</p>
<p>
"You'll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world," McKay continued. "Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience.
</p>
<p>
"So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn’t show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you'll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas."
</p>
<p>
In Dragon Age, the Veil is known to fans as the magical barrier that separates the normal world from the mystical Fade. The suggestion that players will form some kind of defence force - a Veil guard - of this is an intriguing new clue as to what we'll be getting up to when the game launches. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, BioWare has said we'll get our first look at 15 minutes of gameplay for Dragon Age: The Veilguard next week, on Tuesday 11th June at 4pm UK time. Another date to add to your bustling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">not-E3 / Summer Game Fest week calendar</a>!

<p>Back in the day I used to be one of those Counter Strike players who'd hop into a custom aim-training 'environment'. I'd spend a good ten minutes or so darting my eyes between blobs or skittish enemy models then whipping my wrist to blast them with an AK.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/glyphica">Glyphica</a> reminds me of those heady days. It's a roguelite horde survival game where you've got to protect your central pewpew from an onslaught of words. I think it's the perfect warm up for someone who's about to do a big essay or maybe defend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a> in an errant comments section. It's fun!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Glyphica's got this minimal aesthetic, all clean lines and inoffensive shapes that lend it a subtle cool. In the demo there's only one choice of shooter, which is a regular gun that spits bullets at whatever words you've typed in correctly. You see the words are relentless, pouring in from the sides slowly at first, but then picking up pace and upping in number as the timer ticks up. If they hit your base too many times, that's your run over.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/glyphica-upgrades.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/aliasBLACK/Squeaky Pixel</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Type in words quickly and correctly, and you'll level up. This lets you choose clever upgrades that'll defend you from the evil word salad. There's one called "Hunter", that spawns friendly drones that'll attack words for you, but only when you complete words containing the letters i, o, and u. There's another that spawns electricity fields that zap and slow down words caught in their radius, again, only when you complete words with certain letters in. As words grow stronger and in number, I like how you're rewarded for remaining calm and thinking somewhat tactically: if there's a big fatberg of words hurtling towards you, it might be worth targeting one that contains an "i", for example.</p>
<p>Words don't only get lengthier, they also develop traits. Some are encased in armour. Some hide their letters, forcing you to type in only the letters they gradually unveil and forcing your attention away from the other words at that moment. Others are simple, but launch themselves at your base with speed. Later on, some have spinny shields and buff other words, so you have to time your word completion to hit their weak spot.</p>
<p>Glyphica is a simple thing that trains your typing skills in a way that seems well-balanced and clean. It also reminds me of a game I'd play in school, which grants it an automatic, "Yeah, this is the good shit" bonus. You can nab the demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400160/Glyphica_Typing_Survival/">here</a>, if you're keen.</p>

			<p>Today, BioWare has revealed Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the new name for the fourth mainline installment in the fantasy roleplaying game series. The previous name was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-more-info-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreadwolf</a>, and the developers decided to switch the naming to focus on the hero and their companions rather than the (supposed) villain, the elf trickster god Fen'Harel.</p>
<p><em>After Dragon Age: Inquisition launched, the studio was given an incredible opportunity to explore, test, and validate a variety of gameplay concepts as we worked to determine what the next Dragon Age could look like. We brought everything to the table which, yes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even included a multiplayer concept</a>. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us.</em></p>
<p><em>At BioWare, we create worlds of adventure, conflict and companionship, where you’re at the center of it all. As fans of our franchise know, every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story. Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a new lead hero – The Warden, Hawke, The Inquisitor – that you can call your own. You can expect all that, and more, with the new game. And of course, much like your unique hero, it wouldn't be a Dragon Age game without an amazing cast of companions - right?</em></p>
<p><em>Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them – as well as their lives. You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience.</em></p>

<p>GTA 6 might be a mere year (or so) away, but that isn’t stopping Rockstar Games from pouring updates into GTA Online, the cash cow title that has been front and centre of the franchise for over a decade. In a recent post, Rockstar revealed that the next major update for GTA Online – which is set to drop in the coming weeks – will bring a new bounty hunter-themed venture to the game, allowing players to set up their own twisted law enforcement agency and chase down nefarious criminals. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-still-going-strong">Still Going Strong</h2>



<p>Many players are still locked in firmly on GTA Online and Grand Theft Auto 5, whether they’re playing the ‘vanilla’ offering or enjoying something more bespoke through one of the many GTA RP platforms around. One of the most popular practices in the world of GTA RP is assuming the role of a police officer and attempting to stop virtual crimes in a digital world, with many players seeing success in streaming these activities online.</p>



<p>Of course, many of them are mocked for taking it way too seriously, but who are we to judge how people spend their time in GTA Online?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/1774797o5ka358/coming-this-summer-a-new-brand-of-vigilante-justice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Games recently revealed</a> that the next major update in GTA Online will introduce a new pursuit based on that concept: being a cop in San Andreas. In a few weeks, players will be able to set up a bail enforcement agency, hunting down bounties and capturing criminals on the run from the courts. It’s the perfect time to RP as Dog the Bounty Hunter in GTA Online, and Rockstar is even introducing a range of outfits to help you become immersed in that practice.</p>



<p>The next update will bring further changes to the GTA Creator tool as well as several quality-of-life changes that will impact mission times and rewards, snacks, and the armour ratings on certain vehicles.</p>

<p>BioWare has released a new update for Dragon Age Dreadwolf, which includes a name change to Dragon Age The Veilguard.</p>



<p>In the new <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/TheVeilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post,</a> BioWare confirms that the game will get a first gameplay look on Tuesday, June 11, 2024. The gameplay will be around 15 minutes in length. </p>



<p>The update reads,</p>



<p>“After Dragon Age: Inquisition launched, the studio was given an incredible opportunity to explore, test, and validate a variety of gameplay concepts as we worked to determine what the next Dragon Age could look like. We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a multiplayer concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us.</p>



<p>At BioWare, we create worlds of adventure, conflict and companionship, where you’re at the center of it all. As fans of our franchise know, every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story. Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a new lead hero – The Warden, Hawke, The Inquisitor – that you can call your own. You can expect all that, and more, with the new game. And of course, much like your unique hero, it wouldn’t be a Dragon Age game without an amazing cast of companions – right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them – as well as their lives. You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience.</p>



<div><p>So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn’t show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you’ll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas.”</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-6-xbox-handheld-and-doom-what-to-expect-from-the-xbox-showcase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With the PlayStation State of Play done, Nintendo and Xbox still have yet to show their hand during this summer of gaming. Next up, Microsoft kicks off its Xbox Games Showcase on June 9, followed immediately after by a big reveal for the next Call of Duty. While we already know the next Call of Duty is set to be Black Ops 6, there’s plenty from the main show that remains a mystery and rife for speculation.</p><p>It feels like every year is a make-or-break year for Xbox and, well, this year is make-or-break for Xbox. With the dust from the Activision Blizzard acquisition settling down but closures of high-profile studios like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin</a> still fresh in everyone’s minds, it’s a summer for Xbox to find its center, take a breath, and share what the future looks like.</p><p>As such, here are some big announcements we hope to see at the Xbox Games Showcase that I think could help get Xbox back on track.</p><h3><strong>Return to Your Roots: Gears 6</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/06/11/gears-5-kait-hero-4k-1528680467219.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Please rediscover your fun side, Gears!</figcaption></figure></output><p>With the acquisition of Activision Blizzard and many other studios over recent years, Xbox is now home to tons of iconic franchises. But the Xbox brand was built on the likes of Master Chief and Gears of War.</p><p>If rumors are true, we are likely going to see a new Gears of War game announced this weekend, and it’ll be a welcome return to one of Xbox’s most iconic franchises. The over-the-top gore lost a bit of favor a few years ago when everyone was trying to make realistic, cinematically-inspired games, but I believe we’ve rounded the corner and are back to wanting a little fun with our sadness. Who needs existential dread when you can have a chainsaw attached to a gun?</p><p>Furthermore, it’s never been a better time to revisit a series known for its popular online multiplayer. What’s the biggest genre of games today? It’s online PvP gaming. Games like Apex Legends, Valorant, and Fortnite dominate the gaming landscape and Gears of War could be for Xbox what Helldivers is for PlayStation.</p><p>A new Gears of War game has been heavily rumored as has a Gears of War collection, which should hopefully bridge the gap during the wait for the newest Gears game.</p><h3><strong>The Xbox Handheld</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/xboxwirelesscontroller-1715885602639.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>It's an Xbox you hold in your hand, but we want a proper Xbox handheld.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Rumors of a handheld Xbox have been circling for months and Xbox boss Phil Spencer certainly loves <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-official-xbox-handheld-rumors-swirl-phil-spencer-reveals-what-he-wants-from-it">talking about the possibility of one</a>. And as we approach this weekend’s showcase, it certainly seems like some kind of official announcement is looming.</p><p>But what will the Xbox handheld be, apart from the obvious (it’s in the name, right?)? Our best guess is something akin to the Steam Deck, offering high-end portable gaming so you can play everything in your Xbox collection – and everything on Game Pass too, if you’re a subscriber – any time, any place. Sony recently tested the waters with the PlayStation Portal but that’s really a half-step than a full-fat portable, and with Nintendo’s Switch 2 on the horizon I wonder if Xbox is attempting to get ahead of the competition by offering a home console experience – high-definition graphics and a control pad setup that feels as natural and comfortable as a traditional Xbox controller – before Nintendo makes its move.</p><p>An Xbox handheld might not be the magic bullet for Xbox – that all depends on the capabilities of the machine itself and, more importantly, its price – but it will instantly become the Xbox Game Pass device the Xbox Series X and S currently are not. The idea of a high-end portable device capable of running Xbox games seems custom-built to combine with a subscription to Xbox Game Pass. Add in xCloud’s streaming capabilities, and the success of expensive hardware like the Steam Deck, and it feels like the time is right for Xbox to <em>finally </em>make a handheld game device.</p><h3><strong>Doom: The Dark Ages</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/06/10/e32019-bethesda-doom-eternal-screenshot-21-1560130978044.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Remember when I said we’re back to enjoying mindless schlock? 2016’s Doom helped pave the way for that. While returning to the big Xbox titles of yesteryear will go far in reminding audiences of the iconic brands under the Xbox banner, it’s also time to bring back a beloved franchise from one of the acquired Xbox Game Studios flagships.</p><p>2016’s Doom and its follow-up Doom: Eternal are some of the best first-person shooters of the modern era. While opinions are divided on which is better (I still prefer 2016 over Eternal, but that’s just me) what we can all agree on is it’s time for another Doom murder-fest. Word on the street is id Software is preparing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-doom-game-has-a-name-will-be-revealed-at-xbox-games-showcase-report">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, a heavy metal-like dark fantasy Doom game with big swords and bigger demons.</p><h3><strong>New Xbox Console</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/23/xbox-series-family-23-1686580123464-1692815463407.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Okay, so a new gaming hardware model actually isn’t that high on my list of things I’d like to see from Xbox but, based on various reports, it sounds like we’re fast approaching a mid-gen refresh from both PlayStation and Xbox. So far this gen, Xbox has beaten PlayStation to the punch when it comes to hardware reveals so if a pro is indeed coming, I feel it’ll be announced by Xbox first.</p><p>Rumors are abound that Xbox has a few different consoles currently in development, including a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/consider-the-next-xbox-series-x-a-slim-not-a-pro">new all-digital console</a> as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">a next-gen system</a>. Sony, meanwhile, seems intent on launching a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> with the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 specifically in mind. If true, I wouldn’t be surprised if Xbox also launches a ‘pro’ device and if Xbox is first out of the gate to announce a new system, it could give us a clear idea of what to expect from both Sony and Microsoft when it comes to their mid-gen refresh plans. True ray-tracing and more power seem to be the name of the game, but we need to see it in practice to grasp what this means in terms of practicality for the average gamer who already spent half a grand on the soon-to-be-kind-of outdated systems.</p><h3><strong>What About All the Other Xbox Games?</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/14/perfect-dark-1692035693301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>So far for the remainder of 2024 we’ll have <strong>Avowed</strong>, the new fantasy RPG from Obsidian, to look forward to as well as MachineGames’ <strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong> and Bethesda’s <strong>Starfield Shattered Space</strong> expansion. That’s three, but Xbox has announced then hidden away tons of other games including <strong>Blade</strong>, <strong>Fable</strong>, <strong>The Outer Worlds 2</strong>, <strong>Perfect Dark</strong>, <strong>State of Decay 3</strong>, and more. Where are they?</p><p>Fable from Playground Games and Blade from Arkane top my personal list of anticipated Xbox titles we haven’t heard from in a while. But even without those there’s still <strong>Everwild</strong> from Rare and The Initiative’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away">Perfect Dark reboot</a>. Plus there’s a lot of Fallout chatter for Bethesda despite publicly announcing <strong>Elder Scrolls 6</strong> as its next game. It’s a good time to double-down and triple confirm what Bethesda RPG we should all expect to see next, or maybe announce a change of plans (I <em>really</em> want a new Fallout)?. Either way, Xbox doesn’t just have a bunch of irons in the fire, it has the entire mill on the burner.</p><p>These are the big announcements we’re hoping to see at the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9 at 10 am PT / 1 pm ET. You can watch the whole show as well as our pre- and post-show right on IGN.</p><p><em>Matt T.M. Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-2-player-board-games-2024.891354/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Many of the most ancient and enduring board games around, from Chess to Checkers, are for two players only, and with good reason. Two going head-to-head is an undiluted contest of skill and, sometimes, luck. As soon as you introduce a third player into the mix, you have a problem. If there’s any interaction in the game, that third player may ally with or otherwise help one of the other two. If there’s not any interaction, then you either risk a dull game, or you risk a player of unequal skill inadvertently helping one of the others by making poor choices. So there’s a lot to be said for sticking to just two players, and that category contains some of the best, most exciting strategy games around.</p><p>Because it’s such a wide and flexible genre, we’ve broken our selection of the very best among this august club into three sub-sections. Quick games are great to break out with kids, but our picks will also suit adult gamers too. Co-operative games can be great for couples. Finally, the competitive games section contains the most intense and challenging titles for your enjoyment.  </p><p>And if you're looking for more recommendations, check out our lists of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">best board games for adults</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">best board games for kids</a>.

Perfect for baby nap times or killing a little time with a friend or loved one without taking up all evening.</p><h3>Mindbug: First Contact</h3><div id="195789"><p><h3>Mindbug First Contact</h3></p></div><p>A richly tactical <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy board game</a> that plays in 10 minutes and is easy enough for an eight-year-old to play sounds like a dream, but Mindbug: First Contact has made it a reality. It comes with a selection of creature cards, 20 of which will get used at random in each game. On your turn, you can either play a creature from your hand or attack your opponent with a played creature. They can defend with one of their own, comparing a single-digit strength value, or take the pain. This is a fascinating face-off in its own right, given the various simple keywords and special power on each creature. But the real kicker is that both players have two Mindbug cards, which they can use to steal enemy creatures. Not only is this a taut and fascinating exercise in timing - play it now, or wait in case something more powerful appears - but it’s a brilliant balancing exercise, since your most powerful cards can easily become your opponent’s. A minor stroke of genius in a tiny box.</p><h3>Radlands</h3><div id="155159"><p><h3>Radlands</h3></p></div><p>Radlands came out of the wastelands to huge critical acclaim. Players get a random selection of three camp cards that they must defend with irradiated warrior and event cards from their hands while also attacking the enemy camp. Cards cost water, however, and resources are extremely tight, meaning you have to balance discarding cards to gain short-term bonuses against spending to play them into your battle lines. Taut, thematic and rich with tactics, Radlands is shaping up to be a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">classic board game</a>.  </p><h3>Schotten Totten</h3><div id="155160"><p><h3>Schotten Totten 2</h3></p></div><p>In theory, Schotten Totten sees you lining up members of a Scottish clan, represented by superb cartoon art, for a factional showdown. In practice, it's more like Poker as you try to collect triplets of colour or number which you assign to one of nine flags. The secret of Schotten Totten is that you're forced to start making plays before you collect complete sets. That makes every card down and every card drawn an agony of anticipation where bluff and timing are everything. It's a fine game but, better still, you can also use the cards to play a related 2-player game, Lost Cities (<a href="https://zdcs.link/pVd8Y" target="_blank">see it on Amazon</a>).</p><h3>Jaipur</h3><div id="155161"><p><h3>Jaipur</h3></p></div><p>Trading games tend to work best with multiple players, so you've got a bit of bargaining going on. Jaipur solves this problem with an elegant economic system. As an Indian merchant you want to collect goods like cloth, gold and tea to sell in bulk. But the market is one of diminishing returns. That creates constant tension between hoarding goods and selling early to get the best prices and deny them to your opponent. With other smart, interlocking mechanics, Jaipur is a slippery customer. Whenever you feel like you've mastered it, it reveals new tricks: so it rewards repeat play against the same person. </p><h2>Co-operative Games</h2><p>These <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op board games</a> are challenging and only those who work together can hope to come out victorious. Plus they won’t have you going to bed angry at one another.</p><h3>Sky Team</h3><div id="195589"><p><h3>Sky Team: Prepare for Landing</h3></p></div><p>Sky Team is a super-quick cooperative game made especially for two players, who are working to land a plane as pilot and co-pilot. Each has their own set of instruments and pool of dice to assign to them, trying to keep the plane steady in the air, clear the approach of other aircraft and deploy all the necessary equipment for landing as it descends. Both the randomness of the dice and limited communication rules make this far trickier than it sounds, especially given that several of the instruments require a balance between the two player’s assigned dice. The consequences of failure don’t bear thinking about ... but fortunately it’s just a game, and you can just reset and give it another fifteen minute try.</p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3><div id="155163"><p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p></div><p>There are many H.P. Lovecraft based games on the market. And many are co-operative. After all, if you're going to go mad in the face of eldritch extra-dimensional horrors, it's best to do it with a friend. This is the best of them and, as a bonus, it's fairly fast and simple, too. Each player makes a deck for their character from the cards provided. Then you find forgotten secrets and vanquish horrors in scenarios that link together into a narrative campaign. Numerous expansions add not just more card options to add to your deck, but new horrific scenarios to defeat… or go insane trying.</p><h3>Fog of Love</h3><div id="155164"><p><h3>Fog of Love</h3></p></div><p>In co-op games, you don't fight each other. In Fog of Love, you don't fight anything: you're a couple, playing out a romantic relationship. Each player builds a character from a selection of trait, feature and occupation cards. These then inform what they want from, and how they behave in, the scenes of that make up each game. But there's a catch: traits must remain hidden so, like in the real world, the partners can have competing goals. Each play flowers into a complex story which can lead to love or loss or anything between. Their subtlety and realism make up for the lack of well-defined win conditions.</p><h3>Spirit Island</h3><div id="155165"><p><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p>If you've ever sympathized with the underdog, Spirit Island is for you. As ancient spirits, it's your job to help native islanders resist an invasion. But growing powerful enough to head off the colonists is slow going. Building up your spirit's abilities is an addictive draw, but to reach your potential, you must deal with those pesky explorers. You'll need to allocate precious energy and actions each turn to destroying their soldiers and cities. Take too long and their expansion will blight the landscape, causing you to lose. It's a heavy game in both rules and depth but brilliantly blends unusual mechanics with its unusual theme.</p><h3>Sleeping Gods</h3><div id="155166"><p><h3>Sleeping Gods</h3></p></div><p>If you want a single title you can immerse yourselves in to enjoy weaving your own narrative together, look no further than Sleeping Gods. It’s a behemoth of a game in which you’ll guide the crew of a small boat, lost in a strange and exotic dimension, and trying to get back home. On the one hand, this is a game of survival in which you must marshal crew and resources through dangerous encounters, trying to keep everyone alive. On the other, it’s a game of narrative, with a branching story, clues and puzzles that keep feeding back cleverly into the mechanical strategy of survival. If you do manage to pilot through to the conclusion, additional plays will tell an entirely different tale. </p><h2>Competitive Games</h2><p>Competition where you go up as the other player goes down can feel mean and unfair. Fortunately lots of board game designs have found ways to let couples compete without the cruelty.</p><h3>Splendor Duel</h3><div id="195790"><p><h3>Splendor: Duel</h3></p></div><p>Splendor Duel is part of a wave of designs that re-interpret popular classics as 2-player only affairs, and it’s the best of the lot. The core loop, a simple yet deep efficiency engine exercise where you buy gems that can later be used to help purchase other, bigger gems, remains intact and is as enthralling as ever. It also boasts the same satisfying poker-chip gems to play with. But the recipe has been extended in several fascinating ways. There’s a spatial element now, as you pick up adjacent gems from a pattern on a board, as well as gems with special powers and new win conditions. The result is a rich, crunchy game full of twist, turns and one-upmanship that’s far deeper than its straightforward rules suggest. </p><h3>YINSH</h3><div id="155167"><p><h3>YINSH</h3></p></div><p>No, no-one sneezed. YINSH is the best of a series of abstract games known (of course!) as the GIPF project. No, I don't know, either. Ignore the names and get stuck into this fascinating challenge instead. Players go head-to-head on a hexagonal board, moving rings which leave markers behind. To win you need to make chains of your own colour, but moving rings alternate between black and white. So you need to plan patterns ahead to get those connections. With several rings in play, YINSH weaves worrying webs in your head, but when you complete a chain you lose a ring. This elegant twist makes strategy easier but winning harder and ensures timing is part of the tactics.</p><h3>Race for the Galaxy</h3><div id="155168"><p><h3>Race for the Galaxy</h3></p></div><p>The icons in this game start out looking like an alien language, but Race for the Galaxy is fast and engaging. It's all about building an intergalactic empire from the planets, aliens and technologies in your hand. The hook is that you aren’t always in control over what cards you can play, as the players select what game phases get executed each turn. This makes everything into a tricky balancing act, with a thousand things to do funneling down into your limited actions. Pick the right priorities and construct the right card combos and your reward isn't just a win. It's a real sense of a space-born society growing and flourishing.</p><h3>Unmatched: Cobble and Fog</h3><div id="155169"><p><h3>Cobble and Fog</h3></p></div><p>If you fancy a bit of no-holds-barred, head to head fighting action, you won’t do any better than the Unmatched series. Each box has a set of unique characters with their own special power and deck of cards with which to attack, defend and pull off special moves. Play is all about combining tactical movement on a cramped board with managing your hand to build up powerful chains of cards. Despite the variety, the core rules are simple and can be learned in minutes. Cobble and Fog is the best set so far, with four characters from gothic literature to enjoy, but all the boxes can be combined with each other for even more options. See our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-cobble-and-fog-board-game-review">Unmatched: Cobble and Fog review</a> for more info.</p><h3>Watergate</h3><div id="155170"><p><h3>Watergate</h3></p></div><p>There’s a whole genre of games in which card play replicates key real-life events in order to explore alternative histories. Most are long and complex, but Watergate puts their tension and detail into the reach of any gamer. One player represents Nixon, the other the Washington Post, as each plays cards trying to connect or block connections on a web of evidence and witnesses linking the President to the famous scandal. Multi-use cards and a see-saw of supporting mechanics ensure plenty of depth and replay value alongside the excitement of trying to weave the web together.</p><h2>Upcoming 2-Player Board Games</h2><p>Salt &amp; Pepper are a small Spanish publisher that make very innovative, accessible games based on historical themes. Their latest title, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/saltandpepper/operation-barclay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Barclay is currently available to back on GameFound</a>, and it promises to be just as fun and as clever as their previous releases. It’s based loosely on making Poker-style hands in order to win board regions but with several neat twists, included bonuses marked on certain cards and a bidding element where you guess who’s likely to win before the reveal. Your reward for a winning meld is to reveal tokens that represent the intelligence war between the Axis and Allies prior to the invasion of Sicily in World War 2: find enough secrets, and you’ll win the game!</p><p>Open Season is the latest take on the appealing, and under-served theme of monsters taking their revenge on the infuriating adventurers that hunt them. It takes the form of a fast, novel, tableau-building game where you arrange the heads of the various heroes that you’ve hunted on your wall, with each card and its position influencing the scoring of the others. The fresh twist is that laid cards also trigger actions, giving a third dimension to the placement and another layer of strategy to explore. It works with up to four, but is best with two. It's <a href="https://sitdown-games.com/produit/open-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently available for pre-order from the publisher, Sit Down Games.</a></p><p>Finally, continuing the popular trend for two-player versions of multi-player classics, there’s a new head-to-head version of one of the very <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">best family board games</a> in the pipe: King of Tokyo Duel. Details on this are extremely light at the moment, but the game’s combination of massive monsters, push-your-luck dice rolling, and upgrade purchases is sure to be just as addictive at any player count and the original is poor with two so it’s a welcome new take.</p><p>For more ideas, take a look at our roundup of all the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trivia-board-games">best trivia board games</a>, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-roll-and-write-board-games">best roll and write board games</a>.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

    <p><span>Original title did not reflect the game's new heroes and stories.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em> is now titled <em><a title="Games > Dragon Age: The Veilguard [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a></em>, and a gameplay reveal trailer will premiere on June 11, publisher <a title="Companies > Electronic Arts [1,741 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts">Electronic Arts</a> and developer <a title="Companies > BioWare [362 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts/bioware">BioWare</a> <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/TheVeilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>. <span id="more-888303"></span></p><p>According to BioWare, the original title did not reflect how strongly the studio felt about the game’s new heroes and stories.</p><p>Get the full message from BioWare on the new name below.</p><blockquote><p>After <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> launched, the studio was given an incredible opportunity to explore, test, and validate a variety of gameplay concepts as we worked to determine what the next <em>Dragon Age</em> could look like. We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [321 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from Electronic Arts, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us.</p><p>At BioWare, we create worlds of <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,513 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, conflict and companionship, where you’re at the center of it all. As fans of our franchise know, every <em>Dragon Age</em> game has delivered a new standalone story. Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a new lead hero—The Warden, Hawke, <a title="Games > The Inquisitor [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-inquisitor">The Inquisitor</a>—that you can call your own. You can expect all that, and more, with the new game. And of course, much like your unique hero, it wouldn’t be a <em>Dragon Age</em> game without an amazing cast of companions—right?</p><p>Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them—as well as their lives. You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions—not your enemies—are the heart of this new experience.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn’t show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you’ll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,153 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,424 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,247 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_Dreadwolf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/dragon-age-dreadwolf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>.

                <p>Destiny 2: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a> introduces a new Exotic sword to the game in the form of Ergo Sum, and if you're lucky, this could be one of the most powerful weapons in the game. Ergo Sum is unique in a variety of ways: Not only can it be wildly different based on rolls you obtain, but it's also a sword that goes in the Energy weapon slot, unlike any previous weapon of this type.</p><p>Where things get really interesting is with Ergo Sum's intrinsic trait, as it can inherit one of several abilities from other Exotic weapons. With the right roll, you could get the sword with Gjallarhorn's Wolfpack Rounds or Cloudstrike's Stormbringer. Getting the weapon is also simple, and you can farm the Overthrow public event in the Pale Heart to potentially get new rolls.</p><p>It's worth pointing out that Ergo Sum's form isn't set in stone either, as you can get one with a different frame. Each unique sword frame has its own characteristics, like a Wave Sword frame allowing for shockwave uppercuts when you trigger its heavy attack. If all of this sounds like a recipe for success, here's how you can get Ergo Sum and the possible rolls you can unlock.</p><p>For more walkthroughs, you can check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Destiny 2: The Final Shape guides hub</a> to help you get through some of the trickier parts of the game.</p><h2 id="How_to_get_Ergo_Sum">How to get Ergo Sum</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4313865-ergo-sum-exotic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313865" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4313865-ergo-sum-exotic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313865"></a><figcaption>Ergo Sum</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4313865-ergo-sum-exotic.jpg"></figure><ol><li>Complete The Final Shape campaign</li><li>Start the "Destined Heroes" quest</li><li>Complete the mission "Queens I"</li><li>Complete the mission "Lost in the Light"</li><li>Complete the mission "Found in the Dark"</li><li>Visit Ghost to acquire the Dyadic Prism so that you can access a new landing zone and Ergo Sum</li></ol><p>After completing the campaign, you can obtain the Destined Heroes quest to unlock Ergo Sum through several objectives. This is an uncomplicated questline to go through, though it does involve quite a few individual steps and missions. But you'll be progressing not just toward getting Ergo Sum, but also obtaining additional Prismatic grenades, Super, and Aspect options.</p><h2 id="How_to_farm_Ergo_Sum">How to farm Ergo Sum</h2><p>Unlike most Exotic weapons, there is a reason to farm for Ergo Sum: As noted above, multiple aspects of the weapon can be different from version to version.</p><p>The first way to get more Ergo Sum swords is by checking out the Pathfinder system for the Pale Heart specifically. You can grab two more rolls of the Exotic by completing certain objectives and creating a path toward the prize. You can also farm for Ergo Sum through the new Overthrow activity in the Pale Heart.</p><h2 id="Ergo_Sum_weapon_perk__Transcendent_Duelist">Ergo Sum weapon perk: Transcendent Duelist</h2><p>This weapon collects less ammo. Final blows with this weapon accelerate Light and Darkness mastery. Deals increased damage while Transcendent; defeating targets lengthens Transcendence.</p><h2 id="Ergo_Sum__Possible_intrinsic_traits">Ergo Sum: Possible intrinsic traits</h2><p>Now it's time to look at the exciting potential of Ergo Sum. A few Guardians equipped with Ergo Sum swords that have Stormbringer intrinsic traits could unleash a superstorm of lightning strikes on enemies. Or imagine how you'll melt through bosses if you and your teammates have an Ergo Sum with the Perfect Fifth trait, attaching solar explosives with every fifth attack.</p><p>Throw one of these abilities on a sword like Falling Guillotine, which has a powerful spinning attack, and Ergo Sum looks like a fun new weapon to use and experiment with.</p><hr><table dir="ltr"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Wolfpack Rounds</strong></td><td>Powered heavy attacks cause nearby Sword-wielders to emit tracking missiles with every attack.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gathering Light</strong></td><td>Final blows with this weapon grant stacks of Gathering Light, improving guard stats and lunge range.

                <p>A Lego Horizon game, called Lego Horizon Adventures, is reportedly going to be announced during Summer Game Fest.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-tout-nouveau-jeu-de-playstation-a-paraitre-bientot-et-day-one-sur-ps5-mais-surtout-sur-pc-egalement-52357" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, the game is an action-adventure one and will be released simultaneously on PS5 and PC. It also reportedly supports co-op as well as cross-platform play between both platforms. For the PC version of the game, it will apparently require a PSN account to access, something that players have taken issue with in the past, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">especially with Helldivers 2</a>. However, it seems like Sony is still moving forward with the requirement for future releases on PC.</p><p>Additionally, the game will also reportedly support in-app purchases. Whether it's in the form of microtransactions or DLC is currently unknown.</p><p>Back in 2022, developer Guerrilla Games confirmed that it was working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-horizon-online-co-op-game-confirmed-in-job-listing/1100-6510122/" data-ref-id="1100-6510122">separate online project</a> set in the Horizon universe. It was said to have a new cast of characters and a unique stylized look. The Lego franchise does have a unique aesthetic, so it's possible that this is what the studio was referring to.</p><p>Two other rumored Horizon games are a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-ps5-remake-remaster-and-multiplayer-spin-off-reportedly-in-development/1100-6507954/" data-ref-id="1100-6507954">PS5 remake or remaster</a> of the first game and a separate multiplayer online game. However, Sony has not confirmed either of these at the moment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/06/dragon-age-4s-new-name-is-dragon-age-the-veilguard-first-gameplay-look-next-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the next game in the series, has a new name – Dragon Age: The Veilguard. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2018/2018/12/06/bioware-teases-next-dragon-age-game-with-the-dread-wolf-rises">BioWare first teased the game back in 2018</a>, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/02/dragon-age-dreadwolf-is-the-official-name-of-biowares-new-rpg">we later learned it was called Dragon Age: Dreadwolf in 2022</a>. Now, BioWare has changed the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with a promise of a first look at its gameplay next week on Tuesday, June 11.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for why, the team explains it's about the characters that will make up the companions you meet in the game in a new <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/TheVeilguard/">blog post</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tCokMTQ6qKk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"At BioWare, we create worlds of adventure, conflict and companionship, where you're at the center of it all. As fans of our franchise know, every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story. Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a new lead hero – The Warden, Hawke, The Inquisitor – that you can call your own. You can expect all that, and more, with the new game. And of course, much like your unique hero, it wouldn't be a Dragon Age game without an amazing cast of companions – right?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them – as well as their lives. You'll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience.</p>

<p>So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn't show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you'll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas."</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the announcement, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/25/dragon-age-4-reportedly-being-reworked-into-a-more-single-player-focused-experience">BioWare seemingly confirms earlier reporting that this game</a> – the fourth mainline Dragon Age entry in the series – was at one point being experimented on as a "multiplayer concept." However, as time and experimentation went on, the team decided to re-focus on its roots with "an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters, and world building you'd expect from us."&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's no release date for Dragon Age: The Veilguard but <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/12/04/dragon-age-dreadwolf-teaser-announces-full-reveal-next-summer">BioWare said last year the game's full reveal would be happening this summer</a> – it sounds like that's next week.&nbsp;</p>
