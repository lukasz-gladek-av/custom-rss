            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/16/xbox-360-blades-interface-returns-as-dynamic-background-ahead-of-digital-store-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>The Xbox 360 digital store <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/17/the-xbox-360-store-is-shutting-down">shuts down later this month</a> on July 26. Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.</p>

<p>For those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZYhri2tsM4">satisfying “whoosh” sound</a>, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Navigate to Profile &amp; system &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalization &gt; My background &gt; Dynamic backgrounds.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Choose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Select the background art you want using the A button.</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/focus-entertainment-release-statement-on-space-marine-2-leak.928899/</guid>

			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-dev-build-of-warhammer-40000-space-marines-2-leaks-online/">a dev build</a> of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 appeared online. It was a relatively finished build, with minimal assets missing and just some placeholder assets instead. It was fully playable, and binaries were available to allow for co-op. Since the release of this dev build, Focus Entertainment has come out with <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1813264114988294223/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> to speak on the issue.</p>
<p>Focus Entertainment has expressed its gratitude for the love and support from the community eagerly awaiting the release of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Additionally, they have requested that anyone who comes across the dev build doesn't engage with it. If they have or do choose to engage with it, they have politely asked that they do not spoil the game for those who want to go into a fully polished version of the game.</p>
<p>The dev build that went live is said to be roughly a year old by the time Space Marine 2 officially releases. While it is tragic that the dev build was released, it spells good news for those waiting for the official launch, as it means that the game will be significantly more polished and have much more content than was in the dev build.</p>
<p>Luckily, for those who are dodging spoilers from the dev build, you won't have to wait much longer. The official release date for Space Marine 2 is September 9, where players will experience the fully polished game and uncover many secrets that Focus Entertainment has been trying to keep concealed.</p>
<p>At the moment, it doesn't seem to be known who leaked the dev build, whether it was someone from Focus Entertainment or an outside source. According to the tracker where the dev build was uploaded, over 500 people downloaded it to play for themselves. Combining this with the footage that has been uploaded of the Space Marines 2 dev build, it gained way more traction than anyone would have thought.</p>
<p>Since the gameplay videos gained traction, they have been removed from YouTube. Several attempts have been made to re-upload the gameplay footage, but they have all been removed quickly.</p>
<p>Focus Entertainment's last message in the statement was to ask people not to look into the dev build nor spoil the game for those excited. "Space Marine 2 will launch on September 9, and the best way to support our teams' hard work is to play the game as they've always intended."</p>

These power-ups increase the overall capacity of weapon and hero modules, making you significantly more potent on the battlefield. The impact of Caliber on your gameplay is undeniable, but still a touchy subject given that it costs real money.</p><p>So let’s take a look at what you get for your money and whether or not Caliber is worth it for what you’re looking to get out of <em>The First Descendant</em>.</p><h2 id="h33657"><a id="two"></a>Two methods to get Caliber</h2><p>There are currently two methods to acquire Caliber in The First Descendant, and they both require real money.</p><figure id="" data-id="7cac67e2e71d97f5cbb0e08ff0b71f4e" data-recommend-id="image://7cac67e2e71d97f5cbb0e08ff0b71f4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of The First Descendant's store shows different prices for Caliber." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of The First Descendant's store shows different prices for Caliber." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nexon / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7cac67e2e71d97f5cbb0e08ff0b71f4e" data-recommend-id="image://7cac67e2e71d97f5cbb0e08ff0b71f4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of The First Descendant's store shows different prices for Caliber." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first method is the most straightforward. You can buy Caliber from the in-game store in packages that range from the lowest of 250 to the highest of 5,750. The more you purchase, the more expensive the package. But like all other free-to-play games with real-money currencies, the more you buy, the more you receive as a “bonus.”</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>$4.99 for 250 Caliber</li><li>$9.99 for 520 Caliber</li><li>$19.99 for 1,060 Caliber</li><li>$49.99 for 2,750 Caliber</li><li>$69.99 for 3,920 Caliber</li><li>$99.99 for 5,750 Caliber</li></ul><p>The second method to acquire Caliber is also the more rewarding of the two options, albeit still costly. To access this method, you must upgrade the free Battle Pass to the Premium Battle Pass, which unlocks additional rewards not included in the free Pass. And one such reward you’l;l unlock every few levels is more Caliber. If you’re going to spend money on Caliber for anything, start by trying out the Premium Battle Pass.</p><figure id="" data-id="0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-recommend-id="image://0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot of the game's store shows the battle pass rewards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen shot of the game's store shows the battle pass rewards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nexon / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-recommend-id="image://0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot of the game's store shows the battle pass rewards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Caliber rewards deal out small denominations of 25 Caliber per reward level, but it adds up if you complete the entire Pass.

<p>On Monday, it came to light that a fully playable development build of Space Marine 2 was posted online in an apparent leak. Now, just some 24 hours later, Focus Entertainment has <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1813264114988294223">released a s</a><a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1813264114988294223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">t</a><a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1813264114988294223">atement</a> on the matter.</p>



<p>The studio says it’s saddened by what’s happened, and would hope that players would avoid playing something that should’ve never been made public. What’s more is that the build that was uploaded is nearly a year old and, in no way, reflects the final product that will release on September 9.</p>



<p>“We are deeply touched by the overwhelming support we’ve received from our community following the leak of an old build of our upcoming game, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2,” Focus said.</p>



<p>“Our teams have poured years of hard work, passion, and dedication into creating a game worthy of your hopes and expectations, and it’s disheartening that many of the surprises we worked to keep secret were spoiled. We’re saddened that this build, which will be almost a year old by the time we launch, is how some of our most eager fans will first experience Space Marine 2.</p>



<p>“Our unwavering commitment has been to deliver the best possible game for our players. This was the driving force behind our decision to spend more time on development and ensure we deliver the best experience we can. </p>



<p>We’re asking everyone to avoid this unfinished build and to not spoil the game for those excited to experience it for the first time at launch. Space Marine 2 will release on September 9, and the best way to support our teams’ hard work is to play the game as they’ve always intended.”</p>

<p>The Casting of Frank Stone has a new trailer for those interested in sinking their teeth into this cosmic mystery. It shows off the "Murder Mill" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FODK6lwtM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homemade horror movie</a>, which is the core of the narrative for this new horror game. However, something isn't quite right. This movie is covered in a thick cloak of urban legend and cosmic mystery around every corner. Each time the movie was screened, the audience was overcome with horrific murderous impulses.</p>
<p>Whether that story is true remains up to the player to uncover in a twisted tale set in a city called Cedar Hills, where the name of Frank Stone looms forever. A young group of friends goes on a journey to uncover the truth of his story and finds that his legacy has tainted the town they live in, leaving scars and open wounds across multiple generations and even the cosmos itself.</p>

<p>As with every Supermassive Game, there will be hefty choices to make, impacting how your time in the game plays out. Will everyone survive, or will they be picked off individually as you try to uncover the story of Frank Stone? You'll also see some familiar elements from Dead by Daylight sprinkled through the story of this game, reminding you of just how connected the universes are.</p>
<p>It's time to start counting down the days until The Casting of Frank Stone's release.</p>

			<p>Dead by Daylight is expecting a massive update with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-d-and-d-castlevania-2v8-project-t-what-the-fog-spinoff-shadow-drop/">plenty of content</a> and scares planned for July. We are about halfway through the month and have already seen Lara Croft, the ultimate survival queen, be added to Dead by Daylight. The release of Lara Croft comes with three brand new perks to look out for Finesse, Hardened, and Specialist. Unfortunately, she is ill-equipped and won't be able to use any gun or crossbow to help keep her alive, and she has to rely solely on her wits to survive the Fog. Dead by Daylight also introduces cross-progression and a brand-new 2v8 Game Mode.</p>
<p>In addition to Lara Croft being added to Dead by Daylight, survivors and killers enjoy the new game mode coming. On July 25, players will get to experience a 2v8 game mode. In this game mode, you can either team up with a fellow killer or join a group of survivors. Two killers are tasked with finding and killing all eight survivors across five classic maps.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | Tomb Raider | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVtkcHfHcNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Don't expect it to be easy, though. You now have to secure 8 out of 13 generators to escape. There will be no use of Hooks or Perks to keep the game mode fresh. Instead, caught survivors will be taken directly to Cages once downed. In replacement of Perks, survivors will have access to a class system where they can pick a specific "role" within their team.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | 2v8 Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCumCxtPTew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Killers will also experience a shake-up with their Powers, as they have gotten a new look to keep the game mode fresh and exciting. They also have a powerful timed ability to use in conjunction with the other killers to make or break the game. This game mode will be available from July 25 to August 8.</p>
<p>The third central point of the Dead by Daylight update is that Cross-Progression is finally coming. For those who play the game across multiple platforms, you can finally sync up your progress to continue from where you left off across all platforms. All players need to ensure that they can access cross-progression in a <a href="https://support.bhvr.com/hc/en-us/articles/8265968349460-How-to-enable-Cross-Progression-via-a-Behaviour-Account#:~:text=Navigate%20to%20the%20My%20Account,platform%20to%20confirm%20your%20identity." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behavior account</a> to link their progress to their account.</p>
<p>The only downside of the Dead by Daylight cross-progression is that those who play on platforms and a Nintendo Switch cannot access their paid currency or DLC on Nintendo Switch if they are syncing up with another platform. Cross-progression will be available on July 22 for all players to access.</p>

But thankfully, it’s shaping up to have some gems of its own. We’ve collected nine of the best to add to your viewing schedule.<br></p><p>If there is a theme to this season’s lineup, it should be superb second seasons. That could be purely attributed to 2023 darling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kotatsu-anime-corner-hidive-oshi-no-ko-kaguya-sama-1850384126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kotatsu-anime-corner-hidive-oshi-no-ko-kaguya-sama-1850384126"><em>Oshi no Ko</em></a></span><em> </em>making its hotly anticipated return, but it’s also joined by sophomore runs of the <em>NieR: Automata</em> anime,<em> Tower of God</em>, and <em>Shy</em>. Of course, a lot of new shows are also on this list for you to check out. Here are nine anime you shouldn’t miss this summer 2024. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: MAX, Hulu</strong></p><p>There’s a genius to the simplicity of <em>Suicide Squad ISEKAI</em>: Send the DC universe’s team of villains into a tropey fantasy world, let them run wild, and hilarity will ensue. The Suicide Squad are well known enough now (thanks to two movies and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047">mediocre game</a></span>) that the anime dosn’t have to work overtime to familiarize the audience with the characters and their whole deal. This iteration of the team keeps it mostly classic, with the likes of Harley Quinn, Peacemaker, King Shark, Deadshot and Clayface, though—as is so often the case with this lot—this has proven to be Harley’s show, and I’m not complaining at all.</p><p>Watching the oddball team of villains deal with the often tongue-in-cheek issues of a fantasy realm at war has proven to be a wonderful combination, and seeing more DC characters pop up in the future will only add to the fun. The show also retains the team’s signature penchant for violence, and it looks fantastic in its energetic and colorful animation style.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: HIDIVE</strong></p><p>The first season of <em>Oshi no Ko</em> was one of 2023’s best anime, and the second aims to repeat the success in 2024. Based on the first two episodes, it’s going to easily accomplish that. For the uninitiated, <em>Oshi no Ko</em> follows siblings Aqua and Ruby, twin children of the murdered pop idol Ai Hoshino, on their dual missions to gain stardom while solving their mother’s murder. The first season saw the twins push into the world of fame in their own ways, Aqua through acting and Ruby through singing, while Aqua some detective work on the side. </p><p>Season one was an enthralling arc that had a lot to say about the dangers of celebrity and how society builds up these stars, holds them to insane standards, and turns on them in a second. The show’s wonderful writing and gorgeous animation made its expert weaving of comedy, drama, and mystery seem effortless. Season two throws us right into the next phase of Aqua’s investigation, set in the midst of a high-stakes theatrical production.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: HIDIVE</strong></p><p>If you are looking for something to fill the void left by <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, then <em>Dungeon People</em> is your best bet. The new anime follows a thief who gets an unexpected job offer to manage a dungeon full of monsters. It’s a fun twist on the dungeon fantasy formula that offers some more slice-of-life-style storytelling. </p><p>If you like the off-kilter approach to a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>style campaign that <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> often had, there is a lot in <em>Dungeon People</em> that can scratch that itch. So far it doesn’t do anything as spectacular in its storytelling and character work as <em>Frieren </em>or <em>Delicious in Dungeon,</em> but it’s a cute show to relax with.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>Simply put,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-anime-part-2-crunchyroll-adaptation-1851585264&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-anime-part-2-crunchyroll-adaptation-1851585264"><em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em></a></span> is the best video game adaptation around right now. The first part of the season (which aired last year) made this abundantly clear by offering new twists for returning fans of the game while also managing to be a succinct and engaging retread of the original story for newcomers. </p><p>Part two of season one looks to dive into the real meat of <em>NieR: Automata</em>, with the game’s endings A and B behind us. Returning viewers can expect even more philosophical conundrums and rugs being pulled out from under them. The first episode alone is a stunning reinterpretation of one of the source material’s most incredible moments. Hopefully this bundle of episodes won’t be plagued by the production issues of the first part.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>I’m always looking out for the next great rom-com anime whenever a new season drops its lineup. In the past we’ve gotten the likes of <em>Kaguya-sama: Love is War</em> or last years’ <em>Skip and Loafer</em>. <em>Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian</em> isn’t quite on that level yet, but I’m cautiously optimistic that it could be after a few more episodes. </p><p>Alya is a straight-laced student council member constantly berating Kuze for his antics, but she does find him cute and secretly says as much…in Russian. Of course, Kuze understands Russian and can’t find a way to tell Alya that he’s been able to understand her confessions all this time. What ensues in the first couple of episodes is a cute and combative relationship between the two. So far the duo have great chemistry, which is essential to success, but I’m still waiting for the show to be more than the typical genre trappings. There is a fanservice-y moment in the premiere that made me roll my eyes, but Alya and Kuze have unexpectedly serious discussion about it immediately after. If we are lucky this won’t devolve into pure fanservice and instead move past genre tropes to be something special.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>This might be the best-looking show of the season. The premiere alone has gorgeous animation and stunning use of color, from bright foliage to deep red blood. But <em>The Elusive Samurai </em>is more than a pretty face. It follows Tokiyuki, a carefree kid who just wants to live in peace but is thrust into a violent world after a brutal coup.</p><p>That conflict between peace and war at the heart of Tokiyuki’s journey is reflected in the show’s gorgeous animation. There is a lot of juxtaposing imagery that further visualizes that internal conflict. With such a strong protagonist and animation, I have high hopes that <em>The Elusive Samurai </em>will be able to sustain the standard set by its premiere.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>I love how heartfelt yet over-the-top sports girl anime always are. That’s why I’m already into <em>Narenare -Cheer for you!-</em>. I appreciate that the show takes cheerleading seriously as a sport. The way each girl talks about cheer is done without joking about it and the animation highlights how beautiful yet difficult it is. The core cast is constantly dedicating time and energy to their sport and their passion endears the audience to them.</p><p>Back to the animation—Wow, this show is gorgeous. It combines an almost pastel color-palette with a slight highlighting effect over everything that gives it an almost pop art feel. Of course, with any show like this I don’t want to get my hopes up about the yuri-potential, so if you are hoping for that just manage your expectations. </p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p><em>Mayonaka Punch</em> came out of nowhere and dazzled me with its premiere. It begins with our protagonist, Masaki, getting booted from her three- woman YouTuber group for being too violent after punching one of her costars on a livestream. She tries to start a new channel to regain her fanbase, but is disheartened by the constant hate she gets for her violent actions and the fact that her new channel bombs. Masiki’s luck turns around when she meets Live, a vampire who’s been having mysterious dreams of Masaki and is hell bent on drinking her blood. Masaki comes up with the bright idea to make spectacular videos using Live’s powers, and in exchange Live can feed on Masaki once her new channel reaches one million subscribers.</p><p>Masaki is an amazing protagonist whose brashness makes her an enjoyable girl failure, while Live’s overeager thirst for Masaki comes off as an adoring obsession. The first couple of episodes are full of fun hijinx, and there is some potential for Live and Masaki’s relationship to grow into something more than just a means to an end for both of them.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>I’ll be honest, <em>Tower of God </em>season two doesn’t have the juice in the same way that season one did back in 2020. The animation style has a much less distinct identity, especially with the lack of those bold black lines, yet I am still hooked. While the aesthetics might not be there, the world still is. </p><p>The titular Tower, and the inhabitants inside it fighting to make their way to the top, are still so well fleshed out that I can’t help but be interested in what awaits them all. Even after four years, It’s good to see Bam back and I’m ready to hopefully get some answers on season one’s cliffhanger and what’s really up with Rachel.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 41:single/related:9fbcecc4a267a305eb83c5f8a0b76700 --><!-- empty -->
<p>How badly do you want to play the upcoming <a href="https://store.focus-entmt.com/us/warhammer40000spacemarine2"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></a> ahead of its September 9 launch? Enough to torrent a 75GB package from a Russian site? Enough to not only unpack and play it, but connect to a server and start building up your character?</p>
<p>Me neither, but that hasn't stopped seemingly hundreds of people from doing just that. Publisher Focus Entertainment had announced the third-person action game having "gone gold" (released for manufacturing) <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1810722430144631112">on July 9</a>. The leaked build might date to February 23, 2024, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/">suggested by site Insider Gaming</a>, which had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240715211516/https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/">previously suggested a June 20 date</a>.</p>
<p>Footage from the leaked builds, which has been mostly taken offline by Focus through copyright claims, suggested that it was a mostly complete version of the game, with some placeholder assets in menus. Said footage also suggests that the game's pirates are playing online, and their characters are retaining their levels and items. For now, at least.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tqDxvpzsKM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Gameplay overview trailer for <em>Warhammer 40,000: </em><em>Space Marine 2</em>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some ways, this shouldn't really matter. When the game's servers go officially live, developer Saber Interactive and Focus should be able to flag those accounts that have logged unauthorized time. Getting online to play will likely require authentication from the Steam, Xbox, or PlayStation platform one chooses. And there's a chance that a closer look at the game, or even just news about its leak, might entice more people into buying and playing the game proper.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><figcaption><p>Focus Entertainment</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In other ways, though, it stinks. Spoilers from the game's campaign and multiplayer offerings will filter out, and firms that should be focusing entirely on release and quality control will have to deal with the security and fairness aspects of such a leak. A planned open beta of the game had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-dev-cancels-open-beta-hands-out-bolt-pistol-skin-as-an-apology">already been canceled</a>&nbsp;in favor of the developer's focus on launch readiness.</p>
<p>Game leaks of this scale aren't as common as select images or isolated information, but it does happen. <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-confirms-many-things-including-its-florida-vibes/">nearly an hour of gameplay footage leak in 2022</a>. Discs of <em>Starfield </em>being posted for sale in August 2023, weeks ahead of its September release, resulted in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/starfield-leaker-arrested-for-felony-theft-after-attempting-to-sell-early-copies/">felony charges for a Tennessee man</a>. Videos spoiling much of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/be-warned-massive-the-last-of-us-part-2-spoilers-have-been-leaked/"><em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> leaked online</a> in 2020, thanks to someone "not affiliated" with its developer and publisher.</p>
<p>And the biggest and most unexpected hack and leak came from a small German town, where Axel Gembe <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/">stole and leaked early source code for <em>Half-Life 2</em></a>. He later tried to apologize to Valve founder Gabe Newell and leverage his break-in to land a job at Valve, which was, to say the least, unsuccessful.
</p><p>Ars has contacted Focus Entertainment for comment and will update this post with new information.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/16/dead-by-deadlight-gets-lara-croft-survivor-today-2v8-mode-and-cross-progression-on-the<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tomb Raider Chapter</h2>

<p>Lara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Finesse:</strong>&nbsp;Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.</li>
	<li><strong>Hardened:</strong>&nbsp;When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.</li>
	<li><strong>Specialist:</strong>&nbsp;When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.</li>
</ul><p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVtkcHfHcNc" width="640"></iframe></p>



<p>On July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCumCxtPTew" width="640"></iframe></p>

<h2>Cross-Progression</h2>

<p>Cross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA released a new GeForce Game Ready driver, version 560.70, available via the official website, GeForce Experience, or the new NVIDIA app. This driver is optimized for three upcoming game launches: A44's Soulslite <a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-hands-on-preview-enjoyable-soulslite-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a>, Mithril Interactive's first-person 'extraction fantasy dungeon crawler' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448970/Dungeonborne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dungeonborne</a>, and Frost Giant's Warcraft-inspired real-time strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-inspired-stormgate-rts-is-well-on-its-way-to-become-the-biggest-kickstarter-game-campaign-in-a-while/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stormgate</a>.</p>
<p>All of these games support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation. Interestingly, NVIDIA also revealed that Flintlock: The Siege Dawn uses the AI-based Audio2Face technique to create facial animation and lip-syncing based on audio files.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also shared some benchmark data for Dungeonborne. DLSS 3 (Super Resolution and Frame Generation) can accelerate frame rates by 3.3x on average at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. The RTX 4090 graphics card registered nearly 190 average frames per second, and even the RTX 4060 was over 60 frames per second.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>GeForce RTX 40 users will also be able to try two NVIDIA DLSS in two upcoming beta tests: <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a> (July 18-23) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-games-announces-marvel-rivals-closed-beta-with-cross-platform-capabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> (July 23-August 5).</p>
<p>This GeForce Game Ready driver also introduces fourteen new G-Sync Compatible displays, which are listed in the table below.</p>

One member, who goes by Shrimp Blimp, told <em>Kotaku</em> the roleplaying kicked off a few hours later and lasted until around 6 a.m. ET, after moderators repeatedly stated that roleplaying was banned. As one might expect from a newly opened Discord server, the chat was also peppered with racist, sexist, and homophobic language, edgy memes, and even an allegation of grooming, but its primary function, at least for a while, was as a space for <em>The Boys</em> cosplay.</p><figure id="" data-id="1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-recommend-id="image://1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-format="png" data-width="280" data-height="347" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the DC Official Discord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Discord / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-recommend-id="image://1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-format="png" data-width="280" data-height="347" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though there were certainly members pretending to be other fictional characters and real-life people, including one person claiming they were the Green Goblin who implored people to buy his <em>Fortnite</em> bundle, and another with the username OJ Simpson, by and large the DC Official Discord was a <em>The Boys</em> roleplay session for over 12 hours. This is at least somewhat appropriate considering the comic is published by DC, but was taken to the extreme by the server’s members. Dozens changed their names to characters from the series or variations of those characters (including “gay Homelander”) and sent messages in the chat as if they were actually those people.<br></p><p>A Billy Butcher roleplayer (played by Karl Urban in the show, but probably not the Discord) wrote out all their words with an obvious Cockney accent, while someone pretending to be Kimiko (a non-verbal character who communicates via her own version of sign language,played by Karen Fukuhara) sent only hand signal emojis in the chat. Someone pretending to be Frenchie, the character with a close relationship to Kimiko and the only one who can understand her signing, occasionally responded to her with hand signal emojis. </p><p>At one point, a Homelander roleplayer quoted a line from a recent episode from <em>The Boys</em> in which the evil-Superman-coded character demanded one of the other superheroes fellate the other. “Vought [the evil in-universe corporation tied to the superheroes] will now take control of this server. Do not worry, America. The Seven will safely moderate this server from here,” wrote another Homelander at 4:52 p.m. ET.</p><figure id="" data-id="f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-recommend-id="image://f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-format="png" data-width="618" data-height="306" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot from the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen shot from the DC Official Discord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Discord / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-recommend-id="image://f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-format="png" data-width="618" data-height="306" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot from the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At around midnight ET, a moderator dropped a message in the general chat that read:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Hi everyone!<br>-No inappropriate memes/jokes are allowed<br>-No RP or Parody accounts are allowed<br>- We’re muting/banning people who do not follow the rules<br>-Please notify the Mod Team of anything weird</p></blockquote><p>Someone replied, “Half the server is getting banned.” Another member, who appeared to have been cosplaying Frenchie at one point, sent an approximation of the word “Frenchie” spelled out in American Sign Language along with the message, “we aren’t allowed to roleplay.”<br></p><p>Despite the warnings, the roleplaying continued—at 6 a.m. ET, a person pretending to be <em>The Boys</em>’ vice presidential candidate who can explode people’s heads with her mind, Victoria Neuman, asked “where’s Homelander?” A Butcher cosplayer replied, “with me,” while several other users claimed the flying hero “landed at home.” Several people changed their name to “Not Homelander” or “Not Billy Butcher” in an attempt to circumvent the anti-RP rule. Not Homelander had a profile pic of his actor, Anthony Starr in-character with a mustache Photoshopped onto his face. </p><p>The anti-RP message was shared around a dozen times by more than one moderator, the latest of which was sent at around 11 a.m. ET. As of the time of publication, the roleplaying has almost completely ceased, but many are unsurprised a DC-focused server would descend into chaos so swiftly. <em>Kotaku</em> reached out to an Official DC Discord moderator for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 5, Season 3, is set to be a blast from the past as the game brings back beloved weapons with its latest unvault announcement. The return of fan favourites like the Flint Knock Pistol and the Mammoth Pistol will surely stir up some nostalgia among players. Be sure to check out all the weapons that Fortnite has unvaulted and vaulted this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite Reload, the new fast-paced battle royale mode, will see the most new weapons arrive. As revealed by the Fortnite Status account, the weapons that have been unvaulted for the Reload mode include the Thunder Pump Shotgun, the Twin Mag SMG and the Mammoth Pistol. On the other hand, the Lever Action Shotgun, the Tactical Submachine Gun and the Hand Cannon will be vaulted going forward.</p>

<p>A reliable source of Fortnite leaks, ShiinaBR, has revealed that a classic Fortnite weapon has been unvaulted. The Flint-Knock Pistol, fondly known as the ‘Yeet Pistol’ (courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=b6yDfg1y-fA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lazarbeam</a>), has been unvaulted for Fortnite Battle Royale.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Ops 6 - Vault Edition Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_5">What to expect from Season 5</h2><p dir="ltr">A new season of Call of Duty means a brand-new battle pass is on the way, which usually introduces at least one new operator for MW3 and Warzone. New seasons typically include two or three weapons in the free tiers of the battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">The past few seasons of MW3 have included several events for unlocking free cosmetic items, such as camos, weapon blueprints, and calling cards. The only event confirmed by Activision is the upcoming collaboration with the WWE. Nothing specific is detailed for the WWE crossover event, but there will likely be free rewards to earn as well as shop bundles for operators.</p><p dir="ltr">It was previously suggested by leakers that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-might-include-a-deadpool-wolverine-crossover-in-season-5/1100-6524622/">Deadpool could crossover to Call of Duty</a>, as data mining allegedly revealed a series of potential finishing moves with poses and mannerisms reminiscent of Marvel's "Merc with a Mouth." It's possible these over-the-top finishing moves are related to a WWE superstar instead, but Season 5's launch does closely match up with the release of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, so a Marvel crossover event does fit the timeline.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Activision has teased the return of the Superstore point of interest, which was one of the most-popular landing spots on the Verdansk map. Superstore will arrive to Urzikstan sometime in Season 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer announcement for the Superstore POI also includes a first look at potential weapons and cosmetics coming to the game. One operator has a guitar on their back, which could mean it's a new melee weapon or a cosmetic variant of an existing melee weapon included in an upcoming operator bundle. Players are already suggesting that one weapon shown could potentially be a <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1813230866904088890" rel="nofollow ">modernized version of the STG-44 assault rifle</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">While we only have the one major announcement for battle royale so far, Season 5 will likely include more game modes, limited-time events, and feature a few weapon balances and small changes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Modern_Warfare_3">Modern Warfare 3</h2><p dir="ltr">Three map variants are confirmed for Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer. These will be cel-shaded variants of fan-favorite maps:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Toonoxide - Rust</li><li dir="ltr">Celship - Shipment</li><li dir="ltr">Ink House - Stash House</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For Zombies mode, it's uncertain if players will get any new content at launch. Season 5 is set to include the final story mission for Modern Warfare 3's Dark Aether narrative, but this content is <a href="https://x.com/MrDalekJD/status/1795826445421580385" rel="nofollow ">scheduled for the midseason "Reloaded" update</a>.</p>

During a clip shared by the <a href="https://x.com/UCF_Football/status/1812998691311263956" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> account of UCF Football, the commentator makes a note of a rocket launch happening in the midst of a game.</p><p>"And if we can divert your attention for the sky for a second, what an amazing sight that is," says the in-game commentator in the clip, as "Sandstorm" by Darude plays in the background. "Few people know that the 50-yard line at UCF Stadium lines up with the launch pad at Cape Canaveral about 50 miles away."</p>

<p>The attention to detail in display refers to the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It's unlikely that the in-game moment will mimic real-life events--<a href="https://english.news.cn/20240713/e40351d7ff064bde8ff811dc2d0b418a/c.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">exploding rockets</a> might be a bit too distracting--but it's nice to see either way.</p><p>Cape Canaveral has been on the news lately with the first-ever <a href="https://www.space.com/news/live/boeing-starliner-live-updates" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starliner astronaut mission</a> for NASA on behalf of Boeing. The mission, which started on June 6 and was initially set as a 10-day flight, has been extended indefinitely. The crew has been in orbit for more than a month now. In a <a href="https://www.space.com/boeing-starliner-no-return-date-from-iss" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press conference</a> on July 10, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program Steve Stich said that the capsule experienced helium leaks and thruster issues during the trip.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylights-highly-requested-2v8-mode-out-next-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dead by Daylight fans who have been asking Behaviour Interactive for years for a 2v8 mode will be happy to know that this highly requested feature will be available starting next week. </p><p>Behaviour Interactive confirmed that the 2v8 game mode will be available to players beginning July 25. As previously confirmed during the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-8th-anniversary-stream-everything-announced">Dead by Daylight 8th anniversary stream</a>, 2v8 is a fast-paced, chaotic mode in which two killers team up to hunt down and kill eight survivors. The mode will be available for a limited time, with players having until August 8 to try it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Dead by Daylight's 2v8 mode will be available on five classic maps. To accommodate the increase in players, the maps have been expanded, and generators "have also been doubled," according to Behaviour. Survivors only need to repair eight of the 13 generators to escape the map. </p><p>Additional changes to 2v8 mode include the removal of Hooks and Perks, and downed survivors will now be sent directly to cages. Survivor Perks are also being swapped in favor of a class system to place greater emphasis on teamwork. With the removal of classes, killers will receive "alterations to their powers," along with a team-based ability that will allow them to amplify the chaos. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead by Daylight 2v8 Mode Teaser Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In addition to 2v8, Behaviour confirmed cross-progression will arrive in Dead by Daylight starting July 22. This will allow players to sync their progress and purchases across the many different platforms the popular asymmetrical horror game is available on. To access cross-progression, players will need a Behaviour account and own a copy of the base game for whichever platforms they prefer to play Dead by Daylight on. </p><p>More interestingly, Behaviour quietly revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-casting-of-frank-stone-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-revealed">the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone</a> today. This upcoming horror game is a spinoff set in the Dead by Daylight universe developed by Until Dawn and The Quarry developer Supermassive Games.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.
