            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/pxn-p5-wireless-gaming-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The gamepad trees are bearing their joystick-equipped fruits early this year, with many manufacturers already launching their latest and greatest for 2025, covering a wide spread of different devices and price points. While we’ve just seen some incredible value offerings from GameSir, there’s space within the budget bracket to innovate and over-deliver as much as anywhere else. That’s where PXN are aiming the P5, a multiplatform wireless gaming controller that’s available for less than £30. With the features it totes, it’s ridiculous value for money.</p>

<p>The PXN P5 offers a trio of connection options: a wireless 2.4GHz dongle, Bluetooth or wired. That means it’s all set to work with your PC and Nintendo Switch, as well as mobile or smart TVs – something that’s becoming increasingly useful with the arrival of streaming services like Luna and GeForce Now. In fact, this is an ideal extra controller just to hop into the latest games on Apple TV arcade.</p>


<p>The headline feature set for a controller at this price makes a mockery of the other manufacturers out there, especially Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo’s standard offerings. It offers Hall Effect sticks with a 1000Hz polling rate, meaning better response time and faster reactions, while also cutting down on the risk of stick drift. It has a 256-level Hall Effect trigger, with trigger lockouts, 25 hour battery life, an air-mouse mode, and is equipped with a gyroscope for motion controls and back buttons. How have they done all of this?</p>
<p>Well, the money you’re saving can be felt the moment you pick it up. The P5 is extremely light, even though the black plastic of the main body feels solid and well-made. You can tell that it’s cheaper, but it doesn’t give you the ick like third party controllers used to. The Hall Effect analogue sticks have a decent level of tautness, and they feel great in use, making the most of the accurate response in Overwatch 2. In the heat of the moment, you could easily forget that this is a value controller.</p>


<p>The face buttons feel surprisingly good as well, with traditional membrane buttons that have the right level of activation. The D-pad is a weaker element, with the up direction on our review unit feeling a little less pliant than the other directions, but it proved absolutely fine in use. I’d probably be looking elsewhere if you’re a beat ‘em up fan that uses the D-pad heavily, but for most people it does the job.</p>
<p>The cost-cutting becomes more obvious when you put your fingers on the triggers and shoulder buttons. The plastic used here feels cheaper than elsewhere, and there’s definitely an acclimatisation period to getting used to them.</p>
<p>They haven’t skimped on the tech behind the triggers though, which, like the analogue sticks, boast Hall Effect technology, so not only are they more precise through their range of movement, but they should last longer than their traditional brethren. Of course, there’s other elements to a trigger’s durability, and the spring providing tension is the traditional breaking point.&nbsp;The PXN P5 also boasts trigger lockouts, which make playing FPS games much more immediate, and improve your activation time – vital if you’re into competitive gaming.</p>

<p>On the rear of the controller you’ll find a bunch of inputs and switches, first of which are the four back buttons. These are well placed beneath your middle fingers, though that depends on whether you play with four fingers across the triggers and shoulder buttons for a claw grip.</p>
<p>I found that shifting my hands up meant I had to stretch more with my ring fingers to activate the back buttons, as they are quite small, though that, in turn, makes them harder to activate accidentally. I do like the way that the central two buttons are angled, as this made them easier to use, and you won’t catch them when using the two that sit within the controller’s grips.</p>
<p>On the rear, there’s also a switch for moving between the wireless dongle, Bluetooth, or to move across to the Nintendo Switch mode. Unlike the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">GameSir Super Nova</a>, it’s chunky and very easy to use.</p>

<p>There’s two options when it comes to programming the PXN P5, and first amongst them is programming the controller using the PXN button on the front of the unit. Holding this down with a combination of buttons will let you alter a multitude of settings, including switching through deadzone settings as well as button mapping, but you’ll probably have to reach for the instructions to remind yourself each time.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s the PXN Nexus app which is available for Android and iOS. This gives you a clear and comprehensive way to update your controller, and alter all of its settings to within an inch of its life, including setting up macros on the back buttons. You can add multiple steps here, loop them, or add interval times between button activations, and it’s a great addition to an already impressive package.</p>
<p>The key competitors here are fundamentally all more expensive than the PXN P5, though the Gamesir Super Nova’s extra £15 buys a far more premium experience, and a charging stand. Meanwhile, for another few pounds, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">GameSir Cyclone 2</a> throws in a bevy of microswitches, and you also gain a 3.5mm headphone socket, if that’s important to your setup.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-remaster-textures/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-5-remaster-lumen-nanite/">Skyrim Unreal Engine 5 remaster</a> is now available for download, introducing a lot of new textures to improve the unofficial remaster's visuals.</p>
<p>The new version of the mod, which can be downloaded from the developer Greg Coulthard's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Udab2K5a5X">Discord server</a>, can be seen in action in the video below by Digital Dreams, the modder who provided the new 1000 textures the unofficial remaster now features in its latest iteration. While this unofficial remaster doesn't look as good as modded Skyrim does, it's still interesting to see how some of the original game's low polygon elements fare with the lighting improvements offered by the engine.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K60] Skyrim Port in Unreal engine 5 HUGE update with 1000 new textures | RTX5090 NextGen graphics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNIHJJZQPlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While an official Skyrim remaster or remake is nowhere on the horizon, there's the chance fans of The Elder Scrolls series will soon be able to revisit Oblivion with a remaster/remake that is rumored to be in development by Virtuos, the developer of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater that previously worked on plenty of other high-profile titles. Unofficially revealed via an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing with Phil Spencer back in 2023</a>, the remaster/remake is said to feature a lot of improvements over the original, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">combat, stealth, and interface improvements</a>. Unfortunately, the game has yet to be officially revealed, so everything about it is still up in the air, except for the fact that it was originally planned for a Fiscal Year 2022 release.</p>
<p>The latest version of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/">Anniversary Edition</a> now available on PC and consoles. It introduces some additional content over the Special Edition, which is also available on PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-player-count-how-many-people-are-playing-cs2-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Despite eternally sitting at the top of the Steam charts, the player count for Counter-Strike 2 is still an important metric to many in the community. From its early CS:GO days to its current day CS2, Counter-Strike continues to grow at an impressive rate, despite periods of fluctuation.</p>



<p>The doomers that predicted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Counter-Strike would die</a> after the release of CS2 have been proved (so far) to be very wrong.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2-player-count-march-2025">Counter-Strike 2 Player Count (March 2025)</h2>



<p>On March 1st, 2025, CS2 achieved 1,789,374 concurrent players, its highest ever player peak since releasing. CS2 is also currently averaging over 1 million players since mid February, which is also a first for the newest version of the game. The only time in Counter-Strike’s illustrious history when it was more popular was in May 2023, when CS:GO hit a peak of 1,818,773 and was averaging over 1.1 million players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned earlier, CS2 effectively owns the top spot on Steam’s Most Played chart. There are only three games that have ever had higher concurrent player peaks: PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, Black Myth: Wukong, and Palworld. To put into context how popular CS2 is, PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is currently the second most played game on Steam, and CS2 has almost twice as many players.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-cs2-more-popular-than-cs-go">Why is CS2 More Popular Than CS:GO?</h2>



<p>Despite resounding community resentment towards CS2 after it was first released, the game did reignite many dormant fans and attract several new ones. CS2’s esports scene has also flourished since the COVID-19 online-only era, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers a day. While the game is certainly not in a perfect state, Valve has released updates addressing major issues, launched a new seasonal competitive model in Premier, and is keeping the map pool fresh.</p>



<p>Is CS2 in a good place? Is it possible that it eclipses 2 million players? Let us know down below or in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>An Ubisoft shareholder is planning a protest outside the company’s Paris offices after it claims the studio failed to disclose meetings regarding a potential acquisition.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, AJ Investments, a firm with less than a 1% stake in Ubisoft, says that studio is “horribly mismanaged by current management”. In addition, the firm’s CEO Juraj Krúpa says that the company failed to disclose reported meetings with EA and Microsoft, among other interested parties, regarding potential acquisition of Ubisoft IPs.</p>



<p>Krúpa says that the company didn’t “appropriately” communicate its plans or talks with shareholders. Because of that, he is calling those “who are frustrated with the prolonged stagnation in Ubisoft’s stock performance and the lack of decisive action from the management team” to join them in protest in May.</p>



<p>Krúpa added that AJ Investments is ready to sue Ubisoft for “misleading investors”. He did add, however, that they are aware of Ubisoft management having a financial review of various strategic options that is being advised by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan</p>



<p>In a statement given to IGN, Ubisoft restated its past messaging that reviews of strategic and capitalistic options is ongoing at the company.</p>



<p>“The Board has established an ad-hoc independent Committee to oversee this formal and competitive process, so as to extract the best value from Ubisoft’s assets and franchises for all stakeholders,” the company said. “Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materialises.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Warside is touted as a "fast-paced, turn-based tactics game" and will offer a story campaign alongside multiplayer support. First Break Labs is also promising 14 playable commanders (possessing their own passive skills and powers), over 30 unit types, and a map editor.</p><p dir="ltr">This appears to be the first title from developer Lavabird Games.

A free demo was released for the game in September on PC.</p><p>In addition to PC, Warside is also planned for Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/niantic-sells-gaming-division-and-pokemon-go-to-saudi-owned-scopely-for-3-5-billion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Niantic has announced the sale of its gaming business to Saudi-owned mobile gaming specialists Scopely in a deal worth $3.5 billion. This brings <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-now">Monster Hunter Now</a> and more into Scopely’s portfolio, which also includes the likes of Monopoly Go!, Star Trek Fleet Command and Marvel Strike Force.</p>
<p>The deal will keep all the current developer teams together to continue working on the AR gaming hits, while Niantic is transitioning to being “<span>a geospatial AI company”, seemingly looking to use all their experience with augmented reality technologies (including something called Gaussian splatting) for more general purposes.</span></p>


<p>Announcing the change on the Pokémon Go website, Ed Wu, head of Pokémon Go said, It’s been an incredible joy to serve hundreds of millions of Trainers in our real-world community for the past 10 years, and I truly believe the best is yet to come. Our mission remains clear: to inspire people to discover Pokémon in the real world together. With Scopely’s full commitment, experience, and resources, we’re going to make Pokémon Go the very best it can be – from incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events to new ways to connect to your friends and community. Most importantly, we’ll remain focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokémon in the real world.”</p>
<p>Scopely was founded in 2011 and has its headquarters in Culver City, California. it had its initial success with its series of … With Buddies games in 2012, before pushing into licensed IP for games like The Walking Dead: Road to Survive, Star Treck Fleet Command and Scrabble Go. In April 2023, Saudi PIF group Savvy Games Group bought Scopely for $4.9 billion, adding to its portfolio of owned companies and investments across the games industry.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see what influence Scopely has on Niantic’s games, with the outgoing company often having a fractious relationship with its fanbase. After its breakout success in 2016, Niantic regularly sought to tweak and adjust how in-game items were used and available, often to the chagrin of the player base as this affected their ability to play – most notable, perhaps, was how Niantic made changes in 2020 to enable more distant playing through lockdowns, and then rolled them back at still contentious moments.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go was a huge success for the company, and remains the best example of its augmented reality game style, while they’ve struggled to adapt it to other IP. A Harry Potter game came and went, while Pikmin Bloom and Monster Hunter now haven’t hit the same heights. They’ve also created companion pieces like Campfire to add a new social avenue for playing their games, instead of seeing people resort to other platforms.</p>

			<p>Just over two weeks ago, Bloomberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-go-creator-niantic-rumored-to-sell-video-games-unit-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Niantic wanted to sell its games division. Today, the deal has been made official, and just as was mentioned in that report, the buyer is Scopely (for $3.5 billion, though Niantic is contributing an extra $350 million of cash for the benefit of stakeholders).</p>
<p>The Californian company is already the second biggest mobile publisher per revenue in 2024 (albeit at a great distance from leader Tencent) thanks to popular titles like MONOPOLY GO!, Marvel Strike Force, Star Trek Fleet Command, and more. Now, it will add the rights to <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-go-1-billion-player-spending-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon GO</a>, Pikmin Bloom, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantics-monster-hunter-now-brings-the-hunt-to-the-real-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Now</a>, as well as the companion apps Campfire and Wayfarer. Pokémon GO remains the proverbial golden goose, as it still engaged over a hundred million unique users last year. Overall, Scopely now boasts that its portfolio, combined with that of Niantic Games, has reached over half a billion gamers in 2024, making it one of the biggest gaming communities.</p>
<p>Tim O’Brien, Chief Revenue Officer and Board Member of Scopely, provided the following statement to explain the motives behind this acquisition:</p>
<p><em>Scopely has always been focused on cultivating meaningful communities through a shared love of play, and the Niantic games organization is one of the best in the world at this endeavor. We are extremely inspired by what the team has built over the last decade, delivering innovative experiences that captivate a vast, enduring global audience and get people out in the real world. We look forward to further accelerating the team’s creativity through our partnership. Few games in the world have delivered the scale and longevity of ‘Pokémon GO’, which reached over 100 million players just last year. The experience also stands apart for its unique ability to foster in-person connections, with Pokémon GO live events attracting millions of attendees. After spending time with the Niantic team, it quickly became clear that this organization shares our inclination to create industry-leading outcomes and exceptional player experiences. We look forward to a bright future ahead.</em></p>
<p>John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic, added:</p>
<p><em>Niantic games have always been a bridge to connect people and inspire exploration, and I am confident they will continue to do both as part of Scopely. Scopely shares our focus on building and operating incredible live services, has exceptional experience working with the world's biggest and most beloved intellectual properties, and cares deeply about its player communities and game-making teams. I firmly believe this partnership is great for our players and is the best way to ensure that our games have the long-term support and investment needed to be 'forever games' that will endure for future generations.</em></p>
<p>By the way, Niantic is simultaneously spinning off its technology platform into a new company called <a href="https://www.nianticspatial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Niantic Spatial</a>, which was described as a 'geospatial AI company powered by a next-generation map'. This company will continue to operate Ingress Prime and Peridot.</p>
<p>For all the Pokémon GO players, Senior Vice President Ed Wu also had a prepared statement:</p>
<p><em>It’s been an incredible joy to serve hundreds of millions of Trainers in our real-world community for the past 10 years, and I truly believe the best is yet to come. Our mission remains clear: to inspire people to discover Pokémon in the real world together. With Scopely’s full commitment, experience, and resources, we're going to make Pokémon GO the very best it can be - from incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events to new ways to connect to your friends and community. Most importantly, we’ll remain focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokémon in the real world.</em></p>
<p>There's also a dedicated letter <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/moving-to-a-new-home-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on the game's website</a> for those interested in more details.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-crossplay-update-officially-slated-for-late-march.1132341/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-late-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossplay update is coming later this month, so you'll soon be able to play with your friends across different platforms.</p>

<p>Per a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/541100079887417458" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, the crossplay update will bring not only the ability to play with other&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>players across PC and console, but also the ability to move Pals between worlds, which should make your Pal management a little bit easier.</p>

<p>Pocketpair says that if you want more information about the crossplay update, you should check the patch notes, which will be revealed "on the day of the update", although the studio doesn't reveal what the day of the update actually is.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-release-window-world.jpg?itok=wzoJ01Ty 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-release-window-world.jpg?itok=KpO_T49E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossplay update is coming later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd expect, crossplay will be supported between all of the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is currently available, including the PS5, for which the game was released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release" rel="nofollow">back in September</a>.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the crossplay update will extend to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>when it's eventually released, but given that the mobile version sounds as though it'll be a completely separate game, that's unlikely.</p>

<p>Crossplay and world transfers for Pals are just two of the features promised on the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> that was revealed back in January. Others include an "ending scenario" for the game, as well as more ways to improve your Pals, new Pals and technologies, and more game collaborations, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>&nbsp;announced back in November.</p>

<p>Pocketpair hasn't specified whether any of those features will be included in the crossover update, but it's likely we'll have to wait a little while for those.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's a creature-collecting survival game that tasks you with building a base and surviving in a world filled with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-esque creatures known as Pals.</p>

<p>The similarities between&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>are often disputed, but Nintendo thought they were similar enough to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">bring a lawsuit against Pocketpair</a>, which hasn't yet been settled at time of writing.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/palworld/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can also play it as part of Xbox Game Pass.</p>

Titled “Stamp,” the project aimed to be a 2D action platformer for the PlayStation Portable where PlayStation button symbols (square, triangle, circle, X) were used to navigate obstacles and create new structures in the environment. </p><p> Triangle would hurt enemies, circle would create bouncy objects, square would create platforms, and X would act as the delete button for objects. The story, meanwhile, revolved around a hero called Stampie rescuing his bug friends and family from the nasty oil bugs that had captured them. The game would also feature a multiplayer mode with co-op puzzles or battles where players tried to outlast one another. </p><p>“It’s like <em>LocoRoco</em> mixed with <em>Freakyforms</em> from 3DS,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j927bo/a_cancelled_psp_sony_japan_studio_games_prototype/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j927bo/a_cancelled_psp_sony_japan_studio_games_prototype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remarked one fan on Reddit</a></span>. “I love it and want it.”<br></p><p>But the PSP game obviously never came out. It presumably never got past certain internal review gates needed to greenlight the entire product. While it’s impossible to tell why that was from the prototype materials, the pitch deck shows the types of concerns that go into making that type of decision, at least for a small, first-party portable game back in 2010.</p><p>A production schedule estimates the time and costs to complete the game and localize it (roughly 12 months and $3 million). A business case section projects break-even points for unit sales and the expected return on investment at various levels of marketing spend. It also points to other “Kawaii taste” games on the market and their respective sales numbers to give a ballpark, including <em>Pokémon Heart Gold </em>and <em>Soul Silver</em> at 2.8 million copies and<em> LittleBigPlanet</em> at 2.5 million copies. </p><p>Much of the pitch deck is just charts showing how many copies the game would need to sell at various price points and marketing budgets in order to break even or exceed certain levels of return on investment. Apparently, the people making the call didn’t think the math panned out. The game itself seemed like a neat idea, though maybe too small stakes for where Sony’s first-party ambitions were going. </p><p>Japan Studio was ultimately shut down in 2021 and its remaining teams spun off into other divisions, including Team Asobi which produced last year’s  imaginative hit <em>Astro Bot</em>. Still, Stamp is exactly the type of smaller whimsical experiment we don’t see as often from Sony these days, in part because it no longer has a gaming handheld to sell them on. Maybe that will change if the company ships the new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119">portable gaming device</a></span> it’s reportedly working on. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>MLB The Show 25 is San Diego Studio’s latest effort. It aims to deliver a main event spectacle worthy of anybody’s money, and if you’re prepared to spend the pennies, Early Access might not be a dream.</p>



<p>“The Show” line of baseball games began in 2006. It’s become the most celebrated and accomplished sports title for delivering an authentic baseball experience for those who can only dream of yeeting a 90mph rocket. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mlb-the-show-25-cover-athletes-and-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MLB The Show 25</a> is the newest iteration of the franchise, and with little competition around it, The Show 25 is still a major league player for baseball.</p>



<p>The Major League Baseball season has a start date, but if you can’t wait for the season’s opener, let’s see if I can pitch you Early Access information.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-mlb-the-show-25-early-access">Can You Play MLB The Show 25 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>That’s outta here. Credit to San Diego Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>San Diego Studio is 100% offering Early Access for MLB The Show 25 if you’re keen enough.</strong></p>



<p>Most sports titles seem to offer some form of Early Access now. EA FC includes it with special editions, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> has followed suit this year. <a href="https://theshow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MLB The Show 25</a> doesn’t see why it has to miss out on the party, and its invite is red hot.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-mlb-the-show-25-early-access">How to Get MLB The Show 25 Early Access</h2>



<p><strong>You get four-day Early Access for MLB The Show 25 by pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>If you intend to buy a physical copy, you can say goodbye to Early Access. But if you’re only willing to commit to the Standard Edition, you too will miss out on a vital headstart.</p>



<p><strong>Only the Digital Edition offers Early Access</strong>, and it’s a pricey number at <strong>$99.99 or £89.99</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-mlb-the-show-25-early-access-start">When Does MLB The Show 25 Early Access Start?</h2>



<p><strong>MLB The Show 25 Early Access officially goes live on March 15—a full four days before the March 19 release date.</strong></p>



<p>This means if you are eligible for Early Access, you can start playing MLB The Show 96 hours before the game officially goes live to the world. You can give yourself a huge advantage over your friends and foes. You can get to grips with the new gameplay and intricacies of the in-game mechanics first.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you battering up and prepping for an early MLB The Show 25 start? What do you think the main advantages are to Early Access in MLB The Show 25 and any other title?</p>

			<p>Today, inZOI Studio (a subsidiary of KRAFTON) unveiled the detailed system requirements and optimal settings for the highly anticipated life simulation game for PC. While the minimum requirements are more or less in line with what we've come to expect nowadays (they even require less RAM than <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-will-require-rtx-2060-gpu-and-16gb-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall's</a>), to play at higher graphics presets, you will need a very powerful computer. The High preset even recommends AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which launched just a few months ago to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-3d-v-cache-cpu-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent reviews</a>, establishing itself as the best CPU gamers can buy when it comes to the quality/price ratio and its efficiency.</p>

<p>inZOI is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and delivers not only high quality graphics but also high-fidelity simulations, the developer said in an attempt to explain the high requirements.</p>
<p>The studio has prepared eight different preset options to allow players to easily find the best visuals and performance for their system. These presets also confirm the inclusion of NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, Intel XeSS, and ray tracing. There's no mention of Frame Generation, though.</p>

<p>The Better Graphics mode will focus on delivering the best image quality while playing inZOI at the expense of possible frame drops and longer loading. Better Performance, as you can easily guess, reduces visual quality and optimized simulation speed to increase frame rates.</p>

<p>It's worth reminding that inZOI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch on March 28</a> in early access. In the future, the developers will add an automatic system to adjust in-game settings according to the PC specs. Of course, they also plan to further optimize the game for a variety of configurations.</p>
<p>The game will also offer other interesting features, such as official mods (<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-partners-with-overwolf-to-bring-official-mods-into-life-simulation-game-inzoi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to a partnership with Overwolf</a>) and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI companions named Smart ZOI</a>, who will be powered by NVIDIA ACE.</p>

Talk to some guys on the overworld map, get into a battle, fight all the soldiers and capture all the bases, rinse and repeat until the game is done. Even the postgame lays a clear path forward for those who want to see and do everything the game offers. With that said, you can imagine my surprise once I realized that, with over 100 hours put into the game, I found some pretty huge secrets that I <em>totally </em>missed as I played.</p><p>It’s a shame, as some of these hidden scenes and battles are pretty awesome! So whether you’re aiming for total completion yourself, or you just want to pick the game up again, here are five secrets that you don’t want to miss.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85431102d5f363e9dfa173dfbc30dc23" data-recommend-id="image://85431102d5f363e9dfa173dfbc30dc23" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

However, even after her semi-romantic date with Ziluan and her dramatic capture by Dong Zhuo, she almost completely disappears from the main story after Chapter 3. What happened with her and Lu Bu? Where did she go?</p><p>Don’t worry, these questions have answers! <strong>To uncover Diaochan’s fate and unlock her final Bond event, you must attain complete peace in the Sili Province</strong>. You’ll naturally bolster the peace gauge if you aim to unlock every story path in the game, but you’ll almost certainly need to grind skirmishes to max out the peace in this region completely. Once you achieve total peace, a letter will appear in the inn as long as you’ve progressed far enough in the story. This will lead you to one final conversation with Diaochan, uniting her and Ziluan as they discuss what the future will look like for them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d382e72894616303d601d87dfcb2189e" data-recommend-id="image://d382e72894616303d601d87dfcb2189e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Fortunately, it seems Koei Tecmo and Omega Force agree, as <strong>you can unlock an entire string of Bond events with Zhang Jiao by replaying Chapter One in New Game Plus.</strong></p><p>Maxing out this Bond can be a bit tricky, as you need to complete several missions that you can’t skip by visiting Shui Jing Retreat. However, once you see the first two Bond event cutscenes, you can skip to Chapter 2 to unlock the final scene.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37be1337b9cc242d3f4b26a7e2940820" data-recommend-id="image://37be1337b9cc242d3f4b26a7e2940820" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from a cinematic in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

You can save Dian Wei in Chapter 4, save Guo Jia in Chapter 5, and completely change the final Battle of Chibi by bringing Guo Jia with you and foiling Zhuge Liang’s surprise fire attack. With all these alternate outcomes, it’s <em>incredibly </em>easy to miss one <em>technically </em>unique cutscene that <em>only </em>triggers if you <em>don’t </em>save Dian Wei but <em>do </em>save Guo Jia. I <em>hope </em>my <em>use </em>of <em>italics </em>drives <em>home</em> how much <em>fun</em> I had <em>figuring </em>this <em>out</em>.</p><p>This scene genuinely adds functionally nothing to your experience, but it is a requirement if you want 100 percent story completion.

However, voice actors may choose not to sign new contracts in solidarity with striking union members, or in the absence of a SAG Interim Agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Emeri Chase — who portrays Soldier 11 — said they were "replaced as Soldier 11 because I am unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protection, the outcome of which will determine the future of our industry." Nicholas Thurkettle, who played Lycaon, has been similarly replaced, although Thurkettle is not a union member.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'd like to clarify that there's a difference between being 'struck' and not being on an Interim Agreement," Chase explained in a thread on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eun6fzj2cssacea3u2ukfewb/post/3lk5orkz76s2y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bluesky</u></a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>). "Union projects that began work prior to the strike and non-union projects are not 'struck.' But they also do not offer the Union-enforced AI rights we are fighting for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Many actors are choosing to voluntarily withhold work on these categories of projects because we feel it is the best way to support the union's fight for the protections that are critical to our continued ability to create the art we love."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chase added that they knew "that by withholding work it was possible" they'd be replaced, but had "hoped [developer HoYoVerse] would choose to leave her silent until I was able to return."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I found out the role was recast today alongside all of you," Chase said, while Thurkettle stated: "I'm learning about this as you are, and I share your shock. Neither HoYoverse nor Sound Cadence has communicated with me since October. I've been fully available and recorded multiple voice jobs in that time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm not SAG but what game companies want to do with AI is an existential threat. I took a personal stand to ask for protection, and had to be willing to give up the best thing that's ever happened in my professional life. I stand by my choice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked HoYoVerse for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a similar case from December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices">Activision confirmed it had recast some members of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 cast</a> after fans noticed much-loved Zombies characters with new voices in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company issued a statement to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Developer</a> admitting characters in Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode were recast amid the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies characters William Peck (Zeke Alton) and Samantha Maxis (Julie Nathanson) are currently voiced by new, unknown actors. Alton told Game Developer that he took no issue with Activision’s actions with Peck, but expressed concern “for my brand as a performer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans of the game have reached out to me because the lack of crediting [of the replacement actor] implies that it may still be me which unfairly represents my abilities as a performer," Alton said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on how the strike has, and will continue to, affect the games you play, check out our feature from last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers"><u>What the SAG-AFTRA Video Game Actors Strike Means for Gamers</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

Unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-ea-admits-failure"><u>Battlefield 2042's lukewarm reception</u></a>, fans seem <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-fans-are-digging-the-leaks-and-ea-hasnt-taken-them-down-yet"><u>pretty pleased with what they've seen so far</u></a>, and the leaks have been so impressive, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-fans-are-digging-the-leaks-and-ea-hasnt-taken-them-down-yet"><u>EA's not even trying to take them down yet</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Battlefield team has <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899415906104512741" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a> there's still more tests to come to give more players a chance to get involved, we've pulled together all the improvements and new features we've spotted so far.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 has a drag mechanic</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most notable is the ability to drag wounded allies away to safety. At the time of writing, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j6fw6j/what_do_you_think_of_the_mechanics_of_dragging_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>video clip on the Battlefield subreddit</u></a> showing off the new feature has had almost 8,000 upvotes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899346999545086390" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>post on X</u></a>, Battlefield lead producer, David Sirland, confirmed he was "not okay with leaks," hinting that "[leakers] are [being] dealt with accordingly." Despite this, however, Sirland acknowledged that the new drag and revive feature is a key part of the "revive loop," adding: "I am expecting to see some interesting use in the next test on labs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this feature, there's more of that fun interaction with more pieces to the puzzle," he <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899203918351196567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>. "There's some really fun combinations that can happen (it's cancellable at any time with hold version). I can't wait for you guys to start finding out what they are."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 lets you cling on to vehicles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It also looks as though <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j7y8n9/new_mechanic_clinging_to_vehicles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>players can cling to vehicles</u></a>, too, either to get around the map quicker or lie in wait for a perfect sneaky ambush. While some players still aren't sure if the images are merely enter/exit animations, this feature was rumored some time ago, and it appears the playtest now confirms it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 has improved in-game movement</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also been a lot of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1j6441p/battlefield_labs_community_update_gunplay_and/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>positive chatter about in-game movement</u></a>, too, with improved and/or reintroduced movement features such as crouch sprint, combat dive, and landing roll, as well as new visual indicators "to make it easier to understand when movements such as vaulting or leaning are possible."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 reportedly has 3D maps</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">3D maps are back as well. According to sources who've played the pre-alpha playtest, it looks as though both the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j8agdd/3d_maps_are_back_in_bf6_explanation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>mini-map and the spawn screen maps are 3D</u></a>. This makes it easier to see the elevation of tall buildings and landscapes, helping you choose the perfect spawn point. The last time we saw 3D maps in Battlefield was in 2018's Battlefield 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 has improved destruction</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Environmental destruction — a key part of Battlefield's appeal that can be used to give players a tactical advantage — is similarly beefed up, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j7uk4q/a_full_view_of_the_destructibility_from_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>as this brief clip</u></a>, with over 9000 upvotes and 600 comments, shows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what's next?

                <p>Ubisoft is "horribly mismanaged" and has failed to inform the public about supposed conversations with Microsoft and EA regarding possible acquisition deals. That's according to the Ubisoft minority shareholder AJ Investments, which said in a memo that it might organize a protest at Ubisoft's office in Paris to help elevate its concerns and get attention.</p><p>AJ Investments CEO Juraj Krupa said in a statement <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">seen by IGN</a> that Ubisoft is "horribly mismanaged by current management." The investment group, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-urges-company-to-make-drastic-change-amid-sinking-stock/1100-6526392/" data-ref-id="1100-6526392">previously urged Ubisoft management to make drastic changes</a>, said Ubisoft needs to disclose a "clear roadmap for recovery" amid "declining shareholder value, lackluster operational execution, and failure to adapt effectively to market trends."</p><p>Krupa went on to say that the private financial market platform MergerMarket carried a story that claims Ubisoft was talking to Microsoft, EA, and other companies about potentially acquiring unspecified franchises from Ubisoft. Krupa said Ubisoft management failed to disclose these discussions publicly.</p><p>A spokesperson for Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">reiterated what it said months ago</a>, which is that Ubisoft is in the process of conducting a strategic review of "transformation strategic and capitalistic options," but that the company does not plan to make public announcements until a possible deal materializes.</p><p>In addition to possibly Microsoft and EA, Ubisoft is reported to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">possibly be in discussions with Tencent about some kind of financing deal.</a> It remains to be seen how this might all materialize, but one possibility that's rumored is Ubisoft selling off individual franchises.</p><p>Krupa added that the latest delay for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> to March 20 caused Ubisoft's stock to decline in value, but mainly retail investors were harmed by this--not institutional investors like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Because Ubisoft did not act "appropriately," as AJ Investments sees it, the company is asking frustrated investors to join a protest planned for May.</p><p>Krupa said AJ Investments will call of its protest if Ubisoft's strategic review leads to an end result that increases shareholder value. It also hasn't ruled out suing Ubisoft.</p><p>"Ubisoft has continued to underperform compared to its industry peers, and it is time for the company to listen to its shareholders. This demonstration will be a powerful statement from investors who believe in the company's potential but demand urgent change," Krupa said.</p><p>As mentioned, Ubisoft's next big release is Assassin's Creed Shadows on March 20. It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210"> shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p>
