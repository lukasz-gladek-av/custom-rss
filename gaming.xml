For everyone else.... oh boy.</p><p>Here’s that trailer, in case you haven’t seen it:</p><p> The idea of a <em>Snow White</em> remake always made me nervous. Even if you aren’t a massive Disney fan (and I would consider myself to be one), the original <em>Snow White</em> movie, released in 1937, is a genuine piece of cinematic history. So remaking <em>Snow White</em> as a live-action movie felt almost sacrilegious and always seemed like a bad idea. And now, my fears have been confirmed via the first official trailer for the remake. </p><p>While I think Rachel Zegler is a fantastic Snow White, nearly everything else about this trailer looks bad or bland. But the worst part of the, by far, are the nightmare fuel dwarfs.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e79017942c2254892b5f54c009cf9290" data-recommend-id="image://e79017942c2254892b5f54c009cf9290" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from the new Snow White trailer.

                <p>Over the last decade, streamers have taken on greater prominence in the gaming landscape and some have even attracted significant fan followings. Now, a new report suggests that players are spending more time watching gaming videos than they are actually playing the games themselves. And it may represent an opportunity for video game publishers to add more revenue from the hardcore fans.</p><p>Midia Research has released <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/the-case-for-in-game-video-platforms-closing-the-direct-to-consumer-gap#overlay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a 17-page report</a> detailing the time that players of various age groups spend playing games and watching game-related videos. The consumer survey was conducted in the second quarter of 2024 and featured responses from players in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Sweden, South Korea, and Brazil. According to the report, the total average time that players devote to their hobby is approximately just under 16 hours a week. Only 7.4 hours are spent with the games, while the remaining 8.5 hours are devoted to watching the gaming content on Twitch, YouTube, and social media outlets.</p><p>The report goes on to argue that video game companies should capitalize on this trend by creating their own platforms for players to watch game-related user content. This "untapped potential for game publishers to bring video content inside their own ecosystem" could theoretically attract advertisements and sponsorships that currently go to other outlets. More importantly, it could give publishers a direct line to in-game buyers among many of their most devoted customers.</p><p>However, there is a drawback from any publisher's attempt to follow these suggestions. YouTube, Twitch, and the other outlets already have a sizable share of the gaming audience. Attempting to convince fans to jump from a place where they can see whatever they want to a closed-off ecosystem dedicated only to a single publisher may not be as enticing as the report's author suggests.</p>

But interested players will want to plan ahead, as the free trial only runs from December 13 - 20.</p>

                <p>Longtime PlayStation boss Shawn Layden left the company in 2019, and he recently gave an interview about the PlayStation's 30th anniversary. In that interview he touched on a great number of topics, and he also revealed the one classic PlayStation franchise he'd like to see Sony return to one day.</p><p>Layden told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-playstation-30th-anniversary-interview-with-shawn-layden-it-was-a-fight-to-get-the-sony-name-on-the-machine-they-didnt-want-to-be-associated-with-it" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that he would like to see the MediEvil series make a comeback for modern audiences. He said the game spoke to him the first time he saw it and he was a big fan of the team behind it, so much so that he helped get a sequel out the door and eventually a remaster on PS4.</p><p>"I would love another whack at MediEvil," he said.</p><p>The original MediEvil, released in 1998, began its development at Millennium before Sony acquired the studio and created a team called SCE Studio Cambridge. This studio later became Guerrilla Cambridge and eventually closed its doors in 2017.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1997618321" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

series was inspired by the work of Tim Burton and Monty Python, and Layden noted that it was "really hard" to make the comedy work for other audiences with localization. A sequel, MediEvil 2, was released in 2000, with a PSP release, MediEvil: Resurrection, landing in 2005. A remake of the first game from Other Ocean Emeryville was released in 2019 for PS4.</p><p>"If I could wave a magic wand and have one more bite at an apple, it would be the MediEvil apple," Layden said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Layden revealed the one game he was jealous of from a rival platform--Tomb Raider. When he was working in Tokyo during the PS1 days, Layden's job was to help bring Western titles to Japan, and when he saw Tomb Raider from Derby-based Core Design, he wanted it to be a PlayStation game from the start. He didn't get his way, however, as 1996's Tomb Raider debuted as an exclusive to Sega Saturn before coming to PlayStation.</p><p>"I wanted it to be on PlayStation. And I saw the [Core Design Jeremy Heath-Smith and Adrian Smith] brothers, and we talked about it, and they were really excited about the concept. We talked it through. They talked it through. Bada bing, bada boom... they signed to bring it out on Sega Saturn. Sega?!" Layden said. "And then shortly thereafter, they did get it onto the PlayStation in Japan as well, but it launched on Sega. And yeah, that always felt... What could I have done to have actually gotten it? But I came that close."</p>

		<p>Commandos: Origins is now set to be released in March 2025, Claymore Game Studios and Kalypso Media have announced. The reason for Commandos: Origins getting a new release window is to allow the development team more time. The studio is working on feedback from those who played both the game’s demo and those who took part in the closed beta.</p>
<p><iframe title="Commandos: Origins | Gameplay Trailer (US)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HImqjeqCANo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“<em>The Commandos franchise has always been rooted in tactical precision; offering different approaches to solve versatile missions. The teams at Claymore Game Studios and Kalypso Media are fully committed to honoring this legacy. With the valuable feedback we have collected from our devoted community, we’re now making the final adjustments needed to deliver the best possible tactical experience for our players</em>” said Jürgen Reusswig, Studio Director at Claymore Game Studios.</p>
<p>The updates that Claymore Game Studios will be working on addressing the feedback that Commandos: Origins felt clunky, so optimisation is key. The enemy AI will also be looked at to make them react better to player actions. The voice work is also be re-recorded with the final release featuring &nbsp;English, German, French, Spanish, and Chinese voices. The voice work that was in the demo and beta was temporary, according to the studio. At release there will be three different control schemes, and custom keybinding will be available on PC. The loot system is also being reworked where some enemies will drop loot, and other loot can be found in buildings. This loot will then be usable by the Commando that collected it as part of their abilities, without having to deal with an inventory. Non-lethal combat options are also going to made available at the game’s launch, along with more hints and tooltips.</p>

<p>Commandos: Origins will be available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, as well as being on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>

I think its final choice is a meaningful reminder that war is not won without sacrifice, and I love how the original, unedited version made no attempts to reassure you that you made the right decision. However, one criticism that has always lingered over the controversial ending since 2012 is that you spend the whole trilogy forming alliances just for it to feel like the specifics of what you’d done don’t matter when the final assault plays out. Now, 12 years later, it feels like BioWare managed to pull a reactive full-scale assault off in a way that feels more tailored to your playthrough in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span>. The final run of missions is easily the highlight of the game for me, and it feels like a confident second draft of some of BioWare’s greatest hits.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

This amorphous blob of people, resources, and knowledge is funneled into a big number that unlocks different endings if it clears certain thresholds. That’s all well and good, but when it came to actually portraying the specifics of the alliances you’d made and resources you’d gathered, <em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s final assault plays out mostly the same regardless of how you played the game. Some of this was alleviated in the amended ending in the Extended Cut, which made more distinctions between an assault that was going poorly or relatively well depending on your War Assets. But, by and large, <em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s final battle in London shows the same people doing the same shit. There are scenes of non-descript alien soldiers fighting the invading Reaper forces, but the same people are showing up and meeting the same fate regardless of what you’ve done. I still find these scenes effective in a vacuum, but once people started comparing their endings to the ones they saw on YouTube and found them too similar for their liking, this criticism was inevitable.</p><figure id="" data-id="1d4648fc94c55d5303ebef4d5e31b817" data-recommend-id="image://1d4648fc94c55d5303ebef4d5e31b817" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook talks to members of his team in the Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook talks to members of his team in the Lighthouse." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1d4648fc94c55d5303ebef4d5e31b817" data-recommend-id="image://1d4648fc94c55d5303ebef4d5e31b817" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook talks to members of his team in the Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What makes <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s ending a better iteration of these ideas is that it has more interlocked, moving parts to reflect an individual playthrough. Before you begin the final stretch, <em>The Veilguard </em>warns you that if your companions aren’t ready and you haven’t strengthened your alliances with the six factions across northern Thedas, the next few hours could go poorly. <em>The Veilguard</em>’s final mission will naturally draw comparisons to <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s suicide mission, as it also requires you to assign the appropriate teammate to a task, and if you choose someone who isn’t suited for the job or hasn’t completed their loyalty mission, there are deadly consequences. But given that <em>The Veilguard</em>’s assault on the city of Minrathous lacks the same team-based gameplay elements, the more accurate comparison is <em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s assault on London.</p><p><em>The Veilguard</em>’s final stretch seems aware that BioWare fans are going in expecting a retread of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s suicide mission. Its first act has two decisions in which you pick between two pairs of companions to handle different assignments, only for the person you choose to either <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-harding-davrin-death-alive-survive-1851697615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-harding-davrin-death-alive-survive-1851697615">sacrifice themselves</a></span> for the greater good or be captured by the enemy. Not since the original <em>Mass Effect</em>’s Virmire has BioWare made a player actively choose between two party members (no, the killing of one of your twin siblings based on your class in <em>Dragon Age II </em>doesn’t count), so this makes the stakes going into the endgame feel pretty high. When protagonist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496">Rook</a></span> gathers the remnants of their team to plan the attack on Minrathous, which has been overtaken by the elven god Elgar’nan, they sit at a war table with their team and representatives of the factions they’ve allied themselves with throughout the game. Each decision you make in assigning party members to certain tasks also plays into how powerful your allied forces are going into the fight.</p><p>On the ground level, success in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s final battle starts with your seven companions. Each must have achieved a “Hero of the Veilguard” status to be able to properly carry out their assigned jobs in the finale, which is roughly the equivalent of loyalty in the <em>Mass Effect </em>series. This means seeing through their personal questlines so they’re focused and effective in the fight. But their effectiveness isn’t the only thing that matters. Your allied forces must be in top shape to offer support in the struggle.</p><figure id="" data-id="3c448640e61dd1c8d4373b34d20c3a92" data-recommend-id="image://3c448640e61dd1c8d4373b34d20c3a92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Taash and Morrigan prepare for a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Taash and Morrigan prepare for a fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3c448640e61dd1c8d4373b34d20c3a92" data-recommend-id="image://3c448640e61dd1c8d4373b34d20c3a92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Taash and Morrigan prepare for a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For those who aren’t completionists, none of these instances rely on one faction to succeed. <em>The Veilguard</em>’s final battle is more forgiving than similar missions in BioWare’s catalog (and maybe a little too hand-holdy for my taste), so, for example,  if you struggled to raise support for the Mourn Watch, the Grey Wardens can pick up some slack. Each faction’s capability is measured by its strength ranking, which can reach up to three stars for maximum efficiency. This, like reaching Hero of the Veilguard status, can be achieved by completing questlines associated with each group or their home city, selling them supplies and rare items you find on your journey, or by getting a slight boost depending on which faction your Rook belongs to. By the time you’ve reached the highest faction strength rank, the factions and their leaders feel like extensions of your party, ones who you likely feel just as invested in saving as the friends who have stood beside you all game.</p><p>That protectiveness extends to the final mission, as making the wrong decision or coming into the fight unprepared may not end in the death of a companion, but of a faction leader you’ve been supporting throughout the game. Picking the wrong teammate to assist in a certain task can lead to characters like the elven Veil Jumper Strife dying at the hands of the Venatori. Because outcomes are determined by both companion loyalty and faction strength, there are more opportunities to fail, but also a bevy of ways to make up for some deficiencies. All of this comes together to make the outcomes and ending assault more dynamic than the last time BioWare ended a game with a battle in a city.</p><figure id="" data-id="84f9305bc8b989ed4bb0dd75077c5d6e" data-recommend-id="image://84f9305bc8b989ed4bb0dd75077c5d6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook addresses the team around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook addresses the team around a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="84f9305bc8b989ed4bb0dd75077c5d6e" data-recommend-id="image://84f9305bc8b989ed4bb0dd75077c5d6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook addresses the team around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Overall, <em>The Veilguard</em>’s multiple endings are still about flavor more than anything else. Rook will always kill Elgar’nan and the elven trickster god Solas will be bound the Veil. The final quest will likely not satisfy those who are still waiting for a BioWare game that diverges the plot based on their decisions. But from a systemic level, it’s one of the most reactive endings the studio has put out, as it takes into account relationships both big and small that you’ve nurtured (or not) throughout the game. It’s not merely implied, it’s shown when you see your teammates take up arms with forces you’ve helped strengthen throughout your quest to take down the elven gods, rather than being watered down into a big, meaningless number in one pot. It’s a sign that as BioWare has hopped between its fantasy series and its science fiction one, they’re clearly learning lessons from one another.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Fallout 76: Gleaming Depths update is now available for all Fallout 76 players for free across all platforms. For those who are in the endgame of Fallout 76, this is the perfect free update to get stuck into. This update contains the<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-a-proper-mmo-style-endgame-raid/"> new Raids feature</a>, which long-term Fallout 76 players have highly anticipated. With this feature, players will be able to go into a former Enclave laboratory where research on Ultracite was being carried out, with the promise of reshaping Appalachia. However, the lab is now abandoned and overrun by enemies, and you will have to work together in teams of four to survive the extreme journey. If you want to see what's in store in the Fallout 76: Gleaming Depths update, Bethesda has released a launch trailer that is just under two minutes long and showcases some of the biggest features being added to the game, including the very first raid.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76: The Gleaming Depths Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGRp8ERt0DI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This update is revolutionary for the Fallout franchise, as it includes the biggest enemy ever created in the Fallout series. This is the Ultracite Terror, a mutated monster that you will find lurking in the Gleaming Depths. There will be tons of enemies and encounters for you and your team members to deal with while slowly working through the raid to uncover the secrets of the research operation that was taking place here.</p>
<p>Raids aren't the only thing being added in this free update to the game, as the Legendary System has now been expanded to 4-Stars, allowing players to get new 4-Star Legendary weapons, armor, and mods that can be earned from playing the Gleaming Depths raid. This update also adds in Player Titles and C.A.M.P. Pets, so you can finally pet the dog (or cat) that you've been longing to have at your base.</p>
<p>With this update comes Season 19: The Scientific Forge. This is where players will explore the Enclave, which is a deep-state faction made up of AI supercomputer M.O.D.U.S., a faction that is dedicated to rebuilding America through science. By exploring this, players will get in-game rewards for their exploration and efforts, such as the Enclave Lab Coat and Enclave Water cooler, if you want to build your base to replicate the science lab.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>For more information on what to expect from the new season, Bethesda has released a <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/W8itKKaqVMKpd23YQx0mH/fallout-76-season-19-the-scientific-forge-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that details the roadmap for the season and what events will be coming up over the winter period.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-says-game-developers-will-have-to-balance-human-touch-and-leveraging-ai/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-ceo-says-game-developers-will-have-to-balance-human-touch-and-leveraging-ai.1051017/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-says-game-developers-will-have-to-balance-human-touch-and-leveraging-ai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst was featured in an interview published today <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the BBC's website</a>. As you might recall, Hulst was the managing director of Guerrilla Games (Killzone, Horizon) for eighteen years. Following the success enjoyed with Horizon: Zero Dawn, Hulst was <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shuhei-yoshida-replaced-hermen-hulst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted</a> to head of PlayStation Worldwide Studios in November 2019, succeeding Shuhei Yoshida (who, as we <a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> last week, will be leaving Sony Interactive Entertainment early next year).</p>
<p>Earlier this year<span>, following Jim Ryan's departure, Hulst&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-its-two-new-ceos-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> another promotion and became the new co-CEO of the entire PlayStation business alongside Hideaki Nishino</span>. Hulst is handling the Studio Business Group and is, therefore, closer to the game development side, which makes sense given his background, while Nishino handles the Platform Business Group.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned interview, the executive was asked one of the most important questions in most industries: what kind of impact will generative AI have? When it comes to game development, Hulst believes there will have to be a balance between maintaining the human touch and leveraging the opportunities enabled by generative AI technologies.</p>
<p><em>I suspect there will be a dual demand in gaming: one for AI-driven innovative experiences and another for handcrafted, thoughtful content. Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial.</em></p>
<p>That's probably a safe approach in most cases with generative AI. So far, PlayStation hasn't announced any specific initiative to implement gen AI into its own games, but that doesn't mean they are not researching it. Microsoft's Xbox, on the other hand, has <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-partners-with-inworld-ai-to-empower-game-creators-through-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered</a> with leading startup Inworld AI to create Narrative Graph, a tool that game developers can use to generate a branching graph of the narrative alongside character profiles and their knowledge. It may be a while before we see actual triple-A games shipping with the technology, though.</p>
<p>The PlayStation CEO of Studio Business Group also talked about the ongoing goal of bringing game franchises to the big and small screen through <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-productions-founded-to-adapt-sonys-videogame-ips-for-cinema-and-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Productions</a> and its partners. Hulst said:</p>
<p><em>I am hoping to raise the PlayStation IP outside of just the gaming category and elevate it so it sits comfortably within the larger entertainment industry.</em></p>
<p>So far, Sony has released two feature films (Uncharted and Gran Turismo) and two TV series (The Last of Us and Twisted Metal), with many more on the way, such as Until Dawn, Ghost of Tsushima, Days Gone, Gravity Rush, God of War, and of course the sequels to Uncharted and The Last of Us.</p>

If that sounds up your alley, here’s what you can expect from this newly released slice of gameplay.</p><h2 id="h22798"><a id="length"></a>How Long Is The Dynasty Warriors Origins Demo?</h2><figure id="" data-id="b73adb4a51bd582be0e7d8925c96eaa7" data-recommend-id="image://b73adb4a51bd582be0e7d8925c96eaa7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist uses a wind-based special move against an overwhelming onslaught of enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist uses a wind-based special move against an overwhelming onslaught of enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Koei Tecmo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b73adb4a51bd582be0e7d8925c96eaa7" data-recommend-id="image://b73adb4a51bd582be0e7d8925c96eaa7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist uses a wind-based special move against an overwhelming onslaught of enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>About an hour.</p><p>The demo is relatively short, all told. After a few short cutscenes and some battle preparation, the demo will take place entirely in the “Battle of Sishui Gate” mission. <strong>A single run through all the demo content shouldn’t take longer than an hour</strong>, but this may extend longer for reasons we’ll get to later.</p><p>That said, <strong>the demo does have some replay value</strong>. You can equip your protagonist with different weapons and special moves before going into battle, so hardcore fans may get some mileage out of trying different playstyles ahead of the game’s launch.</p><h2 id="h22799"><a id="progress"></a>Does The Demo Carry Over To The Full Game?</h2><p>No. </p><p>The demo is its own standalone experience, and there’s no prompt to save since it consists of a single mission. The demo also contains a disclaimer that “some scenes and elements may differ from the final game.” In other words, the way events unfold in the demo may not actually reflect the full game.</p><h2 id="h22800"><a id="playedbefore"></a>Can You Enjoy The Dynasty Warriors Origins Demo If You’ve Never Played Dynasty Warriors Before?</h2><figure id="" data-id="de5ccc1bcf4e985ec28da746f2b72da0" data-recommend-id="image://de5ccc1bcf4e985ec28da746f2b72da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist is in a duel with Hua Xiong, his sword is approaching the enemy’s legs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist is in a duel with Hua Xiong, his sword is approaching the enemy’s legs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Koei Tecmo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de5ccc1bcf4e985ec28da746f2b72da0" data-recommend-id="image://de5ccc1bcf4e985ec28da746f2b72da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist is in a duel with Hua Xiong, his sword is approaching the enemy’s legs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kind of. </p><p>For someone who has <em>never</em> played a Musou before, you may feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information this demo throws at you. But the game isn’t impossible to understand, especially if you stick with your default setup and follow the onscreen warnings and tutorials as you play. But if you’ve never played a <em>Warriors</em> game before, you might find the <em>Zelda</em> spinoff <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> to be a better introduction to the series.</p><p>If this <em>is</em> your first <em>Warriors</em> experience, I’d recommend starting on the easier “Historian” difficulty and trying the demo again on a higher difficulty once you’ve got a handle on the core game mechanics.</p><p>While the demo will run you through all the mechanics and systems you need to know, there is one moment at the end of the demo that we do need to talk about. While it’s not a huge plot twist or anything, consider this a spoiler warning if you’d prefer to experience this moment firsthand yourself.</p><figure id="" data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h22801"><a id="lubu"></a>Okay, Is that Lu Bu Fight For Real?</h2><figure id="" data-id="8062b899a6194e895edda8648552ff5b" data-recommend-id="image://8062b899a6194e895edda8648552ff5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The infamous Lu Bu is seen riding a horse while wearing heavy armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The infamous Lu Bu is seen riding a horse while wearing heavy armor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Koei Tecmo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8062b899a6194e895edda8648552ff5b" data-recommend-id="image://8062b899a6194e895edda8648552ff5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The infamous Lu Bu is seen riding a horse while wearing heavy armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It sure is.</p><p>Lu Bu is the final boss of the demo, and you need to approach him like he’s a boss in a soulslike. He can easily drain your health from full in two hits, and what remains of your army will be ground to dust if Lu Bu so much as brushes their shoulders. He’s quite hard.</p><p>That said, there’s no secret reward or hidden cutscene for defeating Lu Bu. You get to see your fight time against him on the results screen, but that’s about it. So <strong>if you get to this point of the demo and decide you don’t want to deal with him, you aren’t missing anything</strong>. The only reason to defeat Lu Bu is your own satisfaction.</p><h3 id="h22802"><a id=""></a>How To Defeat Lu Bu</h3><p>Given this is <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>, there may be some strategies to cheese Lu Bu fans will undoubtedly unearth in due time. That aside, your only real recourse is to learn Lu Bu’s attack patterns and time your dodges just right so you can pull off perfect evades. By default, your protagonist will use a sword that makes perfect evades easier to pull off, which should help you learn Lu Bu’s attacks. Otherwise, my advice for you would be as follows.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The boss fight begins right after you clear the large force on the northwest side of the map. The better condition you’re in before this encounter, the better off you’ll be against Lu Bu. Before you challenge that aforementioned large force, <strong>take some time to clear out the enemy bases around the map so you can break pots and replenish your stock of Meat Buns</strong>. Ideally, save the pots inside the two bases closest to the northwest side of the map.</li><li>Try to put up as strong of a fight as you can to Lu Bu right out the gate. Your allies will probably get wiped out in a single hit, but they can at least serve as distractions while you score some hits. If you immediately retreat, your allies will probably bite the dust before they can offer you any benefit.</li><li>When (or, optimistically, <em>if</em>) your nearby allies get wiped out and you find yourself low on health, retreat to one of the nearby bases. You can get some emergency healing under your belt, and if you have command over the bases, you’ll gain some new troops to help you out as well.</li><li>Have patience! <strong>You probably won’t clear this fight on your first or second try</strong>, but as long as you prioritize evasion and score hits when you have clean openings, you can whittle Lu Bu’s health down. It’s a tough fight, but the glory of victory is worth the struggle.</li></ul><hr><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> releases on January 17, 2025 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Absurd Ventures, the new studio formed by Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser, has a new partner in Lost Ark developer Smilegate. </p>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smilegate-makes-strategic-investment-in-dan-housers-absurd-ventures-accelerating-its-growth-in-the-global-gaming-market-302321072.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tuesday</a>, the partnership is being called a “strategic investment” by both sides that “aims to create vast and sustainable business opportunities”. Smilegate is the studio behind games such as Lost Ark and Crossfire.</p>



<p>“This collaboration with Smilegate was borne from a mutual respect and a philosophical alignment with founder Kwon, and the great passion he and his team bring to making AAA games,” Houser said via press release. “We both want to build interesting worlds and new player experiences.”</p>



<p>Joonhoo Sung, Smilegate’s CEO, added: “We are thrilled to collaborate with the developers behind globally renowned series that have millions of fans worldwide. Together with Absurd Ventures, Smilegate aims to deliver games that players across the globe will love. This partnership marks a critical milestone in Smilegate’s journey toward becoming a global IP powerhouse.”</p>



<p>Absurd Ventures is currently working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dan-houser-rockstar-studio-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAA third-person open world game</a> and recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/immortals-of-aveum-devs-absurd-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw developers from Immortals of Aveum</a> join the team. There was no update on what this investment from Smilegate will do for the development of their current game, or if things will change with how Absurd Ventures operates.</p>

Players are tasked with uncovering one of history's greatest mysteries in the first person single player adventure, and arrives as a day one title on December 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Generations of gamers both new and old should care [about this game]," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-final-preview">IGN said in our preview</a>. "Because as good as the studio’s recent Wolfenstein reboots were, The Great Circle might be even better."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled is something quite different as a colorful kart racer akin to Mario Kart. "Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled’s difficulty, memorable track design, and addictive power-slide mechanic make it a kart racer worth playing but it's not without its frustrations," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-review">IGN said in our 8/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on the racing front, EA Sports WRC is available December 5 and brings its rally championship action to Game Pass subscribers. It didn't review as well as previous entries, however. "EA Sports WRC feels like a great racing game trying to fight its way out of an unfinished one," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-wrc-review">we said in our 6/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overthrown arrives the same day. "Lift and throw anything as you build and manage your kingdom in this chaotic city builder for one to six players," the synopsis reads. "Harness the power of your soul-stealing crown to defend your citizens from bandits and mutants, farm the land, and gather resources."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aptly arrived in the midst of winter, Wildfrost is a tactical roguelike deckbuilder set in the town of Snowdell. The sun has frozen over and its survivors stand as the last bastion against an eternal winter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flipping the traditional hero saves the day narrative on its head is the next entry, the side scrolling action game Carrion. "Carrion nails the power fantasy of being a horror movie monster, but makes exploration a chore that pads the adventure," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/carrion-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, wrapping up the month is Road 96, the wild and wacky procedurally generated game about taking a road trip. "Road 96 is a fascinating and frequently tense adventure that manages to keep its story on track despite the odd bump in the road," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/road-96-review">IGN said in our 8/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those not subscribed to Ultimate can look forward to some new titles too, as Xbox Game Pass Standard is getting the likes of Forza Motorsport and Humanity while Xbox Game Pass core is getting DayZ and Goat Simulator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-the-quarry-and-more-leaving-xbox-game-pass-in-december-2024">A handful of games are leaving Xbox Game Pass this month too,</a> though those looking to continue playing afterwards can save 20% on their full price by purchasing them while they're still available on the subscription service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

More importantly, Jodi has maintained her access to sensitive FIB files, which can deliver some very valuable intel to players. In partnership with Jodi, players can take over the Darnell Bros Garment Factory and use it as a staging ground for new crimes. This expansion is also bringing back Pavel, a supporting character who appeared in The Cayo Perico Heist expansion four years ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-grand-theft-auto-games-are-leaving-netflixs-game-library-soon/1100-6527923/" data-ref-id="1100-6527923">Netflix is set to remove</a> Grand Theft Auto 3 - The Definitive Edition and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition on December 13.

<p>It has been confirmed by ESL FACEIT that IEM Dallas will run alongside DreamHack Dallas in Texas in May 2025.</p>



<p>From May 23 – 25, the world’s most prolific Counter-Strike teams will descend on Texas to take part in IEM Dallas, one of the most prestigious events in the CS2 esports calendar.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full story.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-iem-going-to-texas">IEM Going to Texas</h2>



<p>This year’s IEM Dallas event was a monumental spectacle, with the event going down to the wire between G2 Esports and Team Vitality. It ended up being a win for G2, putting an end to a cold period that had lasted since the team won at IEM Cologne in August 2023. </p>



<p>It effectively kickstarted a spree for G2, with the team going on to win big at the BLAST Fall Final and then the BLAST World Final later in the year. The squad also wound up in second place in Counter-Strike’s tournament at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ESL FACEIT Group, the leading esports and video game entertainment company, today announced DreamHack Dallas and Intel® Extreme Masters (IEM) Dallas 2025 will jointly return to Texas’ Key Bailey Hutchison Convention Center on May 23-25. </p>



<p>The pair of events will rally tens of thousands of gaming and esports fans to witness top-tier competition, hundreds of their favorite creators, dozens of indie titles, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tickets will go on sale from December 5 – are you interested in heading to IEM Dallas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>GSC has released a small update for STALKER 2 that addresses some issues with memory leaks, controls, AI, and missions. This is the third update that has dropped since the game was released on November 20, and it’s indicative of GSC’s intention to patch the game as much as possible following mixed feedback and reviews.</p>



<p>In my eyes, STALKER 2 is fantastic – and my review of the game was glowing. If I’m being honest, I’ve not experienced many – if any – of the issues fixed in this latest update, but you might have.</p>



<p>Check out the list below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-1-03-fixes-and-changes">STALKER 2 1.03 Fixes and Changes</h2>

            <p>
PlayStation co-CEO Hermen Hulst has weighed in on on the role of artificial intelligence in game development, saying that while the technology has the capacity to "revolutionise" the games industry, it won't replace the "human touch".
</p>
<p>
Speaking <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o">with the BBC</a> to mark <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">PlayStation's 30th anniversary</a>, Hulst acknowledged that while AI technology is changing game development, human developers will always have a role to play. "I suspect there will be a dual demand in gaming," he suggested. "One for AI-driven innovative experiences and another for handcrafted, thoughtful content... Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial."
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time PlayStation execs have addressed the issue of AI. PlayStation Studios' head of product Asad Qizilbash previously <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/3.html">insisted</a> the technology "will create more personalised experiences and meaningful stories for consumers", adding, "This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalisation across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."

<p>
AI chatter has, of course, become increasingly pronounced in recent years as advancements make headlines and executives - from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-offering-generative-ai-tools-to-its-studios">Microsoft</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-says-it-will-have-a-human-centric-approach-to-leveraging-the-potential-of-ai">Embracer Group</a> - talk up the technology to excite investors. Earlier this year, for instance, EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">told investors</a> AI was at "the very core of our business", adding the company had over a hundred "active novel AI projects" to assist with game development. 
</p><p>
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa, too, recently acknowledged "game development and AI technology have always had a close relationship" and that generative AI could be "used in creative ways". However, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eschewing-generative-ai-in-favour-of-decades-of-know-how">insisted</a> the company's "decades of know-how" was more valuable than AI when it came to "creating the best gaming experiences for our players".
</p>
<p>
Earlier this, a report by game engine maker Unity claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">62 percent of studios have used AI at some point during game development</a>, with 71 percent saying AI had improved their delivery and operations, reducing time to launch. But aspects of the technology remain highly controversial, from the sources it utilises to the things it creates. In March, for instance, several <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-actors-reveal-the-darker-side-of-success-fuelled-by-ai-voice-cloning">Baldur's Gate 3 actors discussed the darker side of success fuelled by AI voice cloning</a>.
</p>
<p>
And if you're curious to learn more, Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale took a closer look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI's current and future game development role</a> back in May.

Foam storage either has the miniatures sitting between two layers or has shapes in the foam that the miniatures sit in. Magnetic has metal in a part of it, and after attaching magnets to your miniatures, they'll sit securely on the metal plate in the carry case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.safeandsound.pl/" rel="nofollow">Safe and Sound</a> decided that if you're going to the trouble of selecting and carrying a case, it might as well be useful once you get to your gaming area. The&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Action Box, once it's done the job of transporting your miniatures securely, also doubles as a piece of scenery during the game. In this article, we'll look at the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, and see how many <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Infinity</a></em> miniatures we can get in it, and we'll also look at some of the larger magnetic boxes Safe and Sound offers.</p>

<p>The Safe and Sound<i> Infinity </i>Action Box is a magnetic miniatures transportation box, that also doubles as a scenery piece for your games. It's officially sanctioned by Corvus Belli, the makers of <em>Infinity</em>, so you'll see lots of Infinity markings all over it. The box also comes with a removable internal element that acts as walls if you want to use the case an internal building, and also a card shipping container.</p>

<p>As you can see in the image above, we got nearly our entire <em>Infinity</em> JSA collection into a single <em>Infinity</em> Action Box. That was 65 miniatures, including 5 on large bases. The only ones we couldn't get in were 2 bikes, 2 remotes, and the old&nbsp;O-Yoroi Kidobutai T.A.G. (which doesn't fit in the box standing up and needs to be laid down). If we had the box with the magnetized back plate or lid, we could have easily put these in as there was loads of space above the standard units in the larger area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-3.jpg?itok=gh0sZP3S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-3.jpg?itok=WfdQfzCn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once your miniatures are magnatised, the Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box keeps them secure during movement.</figcaption></figure><p>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box also held the miniatures securely when sideways or upside down, the magnets holding well to the metal plate. To magnetize your miniatures, pick up some&nbsp;5x2mm magnets, which are pretty small and very cheap for packs of 100 or more. The standard <em>Infinity</em> bases (because Corvus Belli are awesome), actually have a round slot for the magnet to fit in, so once a small bit of super glue is on the base, it keeps the magnet from sliding around while it dries, giving you a solid connection. Some of the older larger, metal <em>Infinity</em> miniatures like the bikes and the O-Yoroi need 2 of the smaller magnets, but as the new larger <em>Infinity</em> miniatures are made from a lightweight resin, one 5x2mm is perfect to hold them in place.</p>

<p>When you think about a card box, it probably doesn't sound very durable over a plastic box, but the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box can take a knock and still keep your miniatures safe. More so because they're stuck to the base, so they're not moving around inside when it is moved or bashed. When closed, two card folds slide into slits, and a velcro fastener keeps it shut while traveling. The thickness of the sides also helps with durability, keeping the lid straight across the top, even with heavy miniatures placed on it (like you might when using it during games).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-6.jpg?itok=4Y9ulusY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-6.jpg?itok=qxbVcKYw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here you can see the Strike Force box is twice the size of&nbsp;The Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, with some extra height for larger miniatures.</figcaption></figure><h2>Do Safe And Sound Make Other Box Sizes?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.safeandsound.pl/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Safe and Sound</a> makes a whole range of boxes, storage, and transport products for your wargaming needs. They even make foam inserts for the boxes and bags that you can stack multiple boxes in. You can see in the image above the size comparison of the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, and the Sci-Fi Strike Force Box, which is two Action Boxes long, and a bit higher for the taller miniatures. Safe and Sound offers a range of sizes and styles of magnetized and standard boxes to suit your army transportation requirements. I generally play skirmish games, with smaller army sizes, like <em>Infinity</em>, <em>Bushido</em>, and <em>Kill Team</em>, and the Army Box is perfect for carrying my entire collection for that game's faction, to give me some list-building variety while I'm there.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box?</h2>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box is a solid transportation option, that fits a lot of miniatures for its small size. The fact that it doubles as a scenery piece is a bonus and that you get another scenery piece and the internal walls is awesome. I would definitely invest in the Action Box with the metal lid, just for the extra capacity and to maximize the use of the space, and also because having your JSA ninjas hanging off the roof is very on-theme.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box?</h2>

<p>If you want a magnatised transport option, that also looks great during games of <em>Infinity</em>, then the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box is a great purchase. The box doesn't suit fantasy settings, but Safe and Sound do offer other box styles. It also fits a lot of miniatures for a skirmish game. If you only play with 10-15 miniatures, it might be too big, and if you roll out with 70+ miniatures and large vehicles, then the other size boxes might be a better option.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312047/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-review-microtransactions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Though it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691618/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review-iphone-android-nintendo">started out pretty chill</a>, over the years, <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> steadily became bloated with monetization. There were all kinds of things to spend real money on, including loot boxes for unlocking rare items. When I logged in to the game last week after months away, my screen was dominated by notifications vying for my attention, most of them involving spending some kind of cash.</p><p>That’s what makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24310972/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-paid-launch-iphone-android">the new paid version of the app</a> so intriguing. The original <em>Pocket Camp</em> has technically shut down, replaced by <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em>, which gets rid of all the in-app purchases in exchange for a one-time fee. (It’s $9.99 at launch on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967">iOS</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.nintendo.zasa">Android</a>, which will jump to $19.99 in January.) And without the looming specter of having to spend real money, this version of <em>Pocket Camp</em> is a whole lot more relaxing.</p><p>Fundamentally, the game is the same. You’re tasked with running a campground for a bunch of friendly animals, which involves designing various spots for them to hang out, while also doing traditional <em>Animal Crossing</em> activities like fishing and catching bugs. The game allows existing <em>Pocket Camp</em> players to transfer their saves — all you need to do is link a Nintendo account — and I found the process pretty seamless. I simply logged in to the new app, and my old campground, along with the seven years’ worth of stuff I’d accumulated, was there waiting for me.</p><p>In the original version, you could spend money on a currency called Leaf Tickets that let you do a lot of things, like speeding up crafting and plant growth or unlocking additional treasures from the seafaring Gulliver. The most notorious thing you could buy with Leaf Tickets were fortune cookies, which are essentially loot boxes: eat one, and you got a random item tied to a themed set. But you never knew what you’d get, so if you were after a particular item to finish off your campground cafe, it was easy to spend a lot on cookies.</p><p>In <em>Complete</em>, Leaf Tickets have been replaced by Leaf Tokens. Fundamentally, the tokens are the same. But crucially, you can’t buy them with real cash; you either earn them in-game by completing quests or buy them with bells, <em>Animal Crossing</em>’s in-game currency. Psychologically, this makes a huge difference. It never feels like the game is trying to cheat me out of actual money, since I can’t actually spend any. Instead, they’re a nice bonus that I can save up to buy cool things or speed up an annoyingly long renovation.</p><p>You can still feel the previous monetization inherent in <em>Complete</em>’s design; the loot box cookies remain, as do some of the more annoying features, like treasure maps that require very specific items to explore. I would love to see a version of <em>Pocket Camp</em> that was designed from the ground up to be a one-time paid experience. But even if the free-to-play seams show, <em>Complete</em> is still a much more enjoyable experience simply by removing the ability to spend real cash.</p><p>On top of that, <em>Complete</em> adds a handful of genuinely good features. There’s a new location where you can hang out with your human friends and listen to a K.K. Slider concert, and you can now assign a caretaker animal for your campground, who will do some of the busywork when you’re away from the game. There are also friend cards that make it a little easier to find and play with other people.</p><p>Perhaps most interesting, there’s a new connection with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>New Horizons</em></a>; <em>Pocket Camp</em> players can import certain custom designs from the Switch game, which really expands options for clothing in particular. During the height of <em>New Horizons</em>’ popularity, players (and also brands) made all kinds of impressive things, and I’ve spent too much time digging through old creator codes to find stuff to wear. It’s not perfect — not all designs are compatible, and some show up fairly pixelated in the mobile game — but at least I can finally wear a Montreal Expos cap when I grab a coffee from Brewster.</p><p>Nintendo’s mobile ambitions didn’t quite take off the way many of us expected <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12836392/nintendo-mario-iphone-apple">when Shigeru Miyamoto stood onstage at an Apple event to introduce <em>Super Mario Run</em></a>. That game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16580976/super-mario-run-nintendo-downloads-profit">didn’t make profit the way Nintendo had hoped</a>, and the company’s subsequent mobile games, like <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> and <em>Mario Kart Tour</em>, are all heavily monetized. That was the case for <em>Pocket Camp,</em> too — but its new iteration provides a brief glimpse at an alternate timeline where Nintendo’s smartphone games aren’t always trying to sell you something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just released ‘The Gleaming Depths’ update on Fallout 76. This super-sized patch stands as the largest endgame update the game has ever received, and it introduces a string of new features – including the game’s first ‘raid’ – to give late-game players more of a point in playing.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about everything coming in Fallout 76’s last major update in 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-gleaming-depths">Enter The Gleaming Depths</h2>



<p>The most important thing being delivered in this update is The Gleaming Depths, an all-new raid that’s designed to push players to new heights in terms of a solid, in-game challenge. It’s built to be tackled by a team of four players, all overseeing a unique role, such as Healer, Tank, or DPS.</p>



<p>Bethesda has finally introduced 4-Star Legendary Items into Fallout 76 with The Gleaming Depths update. Players will need to complete challenges in the new raid to unlock the top-most Legendary mods that boast powerful attributes.</p>



<p>Pets are also being brought into the game in The Gleaming Depths update. These C.A.M.P. items are open to everyone, but they’re locked to these ‘bases’ in-game. They won’t follow you around, but they can be customised slightly and interacted with, if that’s your kind of thing.</p>



<p>Following this update, you’ll also be able to assign yourself a title, using a series of prefixes and suffixes earned through quests and events to denote what kind of player you are in the Appalachian wasteland.</p>



<p>And of course, The Gleaming Depths update marks the arrival of Season 19 – The Scientific Forge. This update offers a boon for Enclave fans, as the entire scoreboard full of rewards is focused on the mysterious, malicious faction.</p>



<p>Finally, the team has worked to bring about hundreds of bug fixes, perk adjustments, and optimisations to the game. It’s one hell of an update.</p>



<p>Here are the install sizes for <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5jYSbvocrji7E0eDJRJl9z/fallout-76-the-gleaming-depths-release-notes?linkId=100000315193526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gleaming Depths update</a>:</p>
