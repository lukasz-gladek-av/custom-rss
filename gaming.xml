            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173179/adata-xpg-gaming-handheld-modded-lpcamm2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Adata has become the latest company to join the hype surrounding PC gaming handhelds — but the <a href="https://www.adata.com/us/news/1136/">XPG Nia prototype it revealed</a> during Computex 2024 is completely different from what we’ve seen so far. The handheld is the first to come <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151369/lpcamm2-laptop-memory-ram-lenovo-ifixit">with LPCAMM2 memory</a>, making it far easier to swap out and upgrade RAM. </p><p>As <a href="https://liliputing.com/adata-xpg-nia-handheld-gaming-pc-will-have-upgradeable-lpcamm2-memory-a-display-that-tilts-upward-and-a-focus-on-the-modding-community/">reported by <em>Liliputing</em></a>, you’ll be able to access the device’s storage beneath the kickstand on the back of the device. You can also remove and replace the device’s M.2 2230 SSD. These aren’t the only things you’ll be able to mod, either.</p><p>During an interview <a href="https://youtu.be/-wmj02v4I_8?si=q-90IrPlrs9w12t8&amp;t=440">with YouTuber GGF Events</a>, XPG product head Luca Di Fiore said the company is building the handheld for the “modding market” and will use a “circular computing platform.” This means that Adata will release 3D files and pinout information for the device so users can mod the device, 3D print their own accessories, or even repurpose its parts.</p><p>The XPG Nia features a seven-inch display that lifts up and away from the handheld’s chassis, along with four rear buttons, a USB-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It will also have a front-facing camera that enables eye and head tracking to change your game’s point of view automatically, according to Di Fiore. He also said it could enable other game performance features that XPG is still working on.</p><p>XPG still hasn’t confirmed the chip that will power its handheld, but Di Fiore tells GGF Events that it has multiple prototypes based on <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amds-hardware-ai-ryzen-phoenix-cpus-set-to-soar-in-razers-blade-14-laptop">AMD’s line of Phoenix chips</a>. The company is also shooting for a price between $500 and $600 but may launch the device through a Kickstarter campaign. Even though the XPG Nia is just a prototype for now, it holds a lot of promise and could be a refreshing addition to the growing handheld gaming market, which already has the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Asus Rog Ally,</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">the MSI Claw</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-does-ttk-mean-in-warzone-answered/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-does-ttk-mean-in-warzone-answered<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re new to <em>Warzone</em> or first-person shooter games in general, there can be a lot of phrases and acronyms that won’t make sense to you at first. One of those is TTK, but don’t worry if you’re lost, as I’m here to give you the answer. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">FPS games have dominated the gaming world for years, and <em>Call of Duty</em> is without question one of, if not the biggest of them all. It’s no surprise then that it has a huge community of players, and has essentially created its own language among those who regularly play it. </p> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">If you’re new to the scene and see people talking about TTK, but just can’t figure out what it means, then I’ve got you covered. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>TTK is super important. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-what-does-ttk-stand" data-injectable="false">What does TTK stand?</h2> <p data-characters="80" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"><strong>TTK in <em>Warzone</em> and other FPS games simply stands for “Time To Kill.”</strong></p> <h2 id="h-ttk-in-warzone-explained" data-injectable="false">TTK in <em>Warzone</em> explained</h2> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true">Knowing what it stands for is all well and good, but what does it actually mean? Well, Time To Kill is exactly what it sounds like—how long it takes to kill an enemy from the moment you fire your weapon. Therefore, you want to use guns that have a low TTK as they’ll be the quickest at eliminating your opponents. </p>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Now, it’s worth remembering that having the fastest fire rate doesn’t automatically mean it has a low TTK. You could use a gun with a high fire rate that deals very little damage, and its TTK would actually be slower than a gun with a low fire rate but high damage. Both fire rate and damage factor are included in the calculation. </p> <h2 id="h-what-gun-has-the-fastest-ttk-in-warzone-right-now" data-injectable="false">What gun has the fastest TTK in <em>Warzone</em> right now?</h2> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="false">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fastest-time-to-kill-weapons-in-warzone-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warzone</em> gun with the fastest TTK</a> right now is the SOA Subverter at 688 milliseconds. This battle rifle does pack quite the punch, but if you can control the recoil, you’ll kill your enemies very quickly. </p>

<p data-characters="388" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2’s The Final Shape</em> expansion will take you quite some time to work through. Given the price of the expansion, this makes sense since you’re paying the premium of a lot of bigger games. However, this also might leave you wondering just how far you have left until the main campaign is complete. Here are all the missions in <em>Destiny 2’s The Final Shape</em> expansion.</p> <h2 id="h-every-mission-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape-expansion" data-injectable="false">Every mission in Destiny 2: The Final Shape expansion</h2> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">In total, there are <strong>eight main missions</strong> you must complete before completing the <em>Final Shape</em> campaign. There’s more to it than that, however, which we’ll discuss further below. For now, here’s every mission in order:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-transmigration-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Transmigration</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-temptation-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Temptation</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-exegesis-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Exegesis</a></li> <li>Requiem</li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-ascent-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Ascent</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-dissent-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Dissent</a></li> <li>Iconoclasm</li> <li>Final Mission (locked behind <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-schedule-and-details-for-the-final-shape-race/">the Salvation’s Edge raid</a>)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">The final mission is a little confusing since we’re currently unsure if this is referring to the World First clear of the raid, or if you’re required to complete the raid yourself to experience the final chapter in the story. Once we have more details on it, we’ll update this guide to reflect that.</p> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="false">All in all, this <strong>should take around 10 hours</strong> for the average player to complete. Weaved in between each of the above missions are some added side activities, such as speaking with your Ghost, conversing with your fireteam, or completing open-world content like Lost Sectors and Strikes. If you’re playing in Normal mode, this may go by a little faster. It can also go a bit faster with a fire team of three people.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Week in Gaming Business - Gone but Not Forgotten]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-7th</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-week-in-gaming-business-gone-but-not-forgotten.892608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-7th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time for another roundup of what's been happening this week on the business side of the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Sadly, this week saw more studios laying off employees, including the somewhat bizarre closure of a studio purchased by its parent company just a few months ago.</p>
<p>We also saw a damning report regarding Warner Bros' management of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>emerging, as well as a touching billboard message from New Blood. Let's see what's been happening this week!</p>
<h2>Behaviour Interactive lays off employees, calls layoffs "strategic changes"</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-behaviour-interactive-gaming-business.jpg?itok=p5VqVO5x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-behaviour-interactive-gaming-business.jpg?itok=J-X1utdm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>may be going strong, but Behaviour Interactive has still been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>developer Behaviour Interactive <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced this week</a> that it would lay off "up to 95 employees", most of whom are based in the company's Montreal studio.</p>
<p>A rather ghoulishly-worded press release describes these layoffs as "strategic changes for future growth", calling them a part of "improving the distinction between [Behaviour's] product, production, business development, and marketing resources".</p>
<p>The timing of this announcement seems a little unfortunate given that Behaviour revealed a round of new spinoff games and partnerships for&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">just a few scant weeks ago</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>developer Avalanche closes an eight-month-old studio</h2>
<p>Another studio hit by layoffs this week is&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rage 2&nbsp;</em>developer Avalanche, which <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/statement-nymr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced the closure of two of its locations</a>&nbsp;a few days ago.</p>
<p>Avalanche's New York and Montreal locations will be shut down, resulting in around 50 employees losing their jobs.</p>
<p>The closure of the Montreal location is particularly remarkable given that Avalanche <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/avalanche-studios-group-expands-to-montreal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only opened the studio in October last year</a>&nbsp;after acquiring Montreal-based developer Monster Closet back in 2021.</p>
<h2><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>developer's Kharkiv studio apparently hit by layoffs</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-gameloft-kharkiv-gaming-business.jpg?itok=F2zYqxTn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-gameloft-kharkiv-gaming-business.jpg?itok=8_95TRhW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>studio Gameloft has apparently been hit by layoffs too.</figcaption></figure><p>Reports emerged this week that&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>developer Gameloft has been hit by layoffs, concentrated in its Kharkiv location.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://gamedev.dou.ua/news/layoffs-in-gameloft-kharkiv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ukrainian news platform GameDev DOU</a>, the layoffs affected more employees than were laid off at Gameloft's Lviv location earlier this year, which means that over 38 employees were let go from the Kharkiv studio.</p>
<p>GameDev DOU says that affected employees weren't compensated, and that studio manager Artem Nabatov was one of the employees let go. No official confirmation of these layoffs has been released, however.</p>
<h2>Summer Game Fest trailers are reportedly very expensive indeed</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an Esquire article</a> that appeared earlier this week, if you're a developer looking to have your trailer showcased at Summer Game Fest, you're going to be paying a very heavy toll.</p>
<p>Esquire cites an "insider" who describes Summer Game Fest and Geoff Keighley's other show, The Game Awards, as "really ***ing expensive". Reportedly, trailers cost $250k for a single minute, with prices rising to an eye-watering $550k for two and a half minutes.</p>
<p>If those prices are accurate, the work of <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-taco" rel="noopener" target="_blank">whoever's still holding onto the summergamesfest.com domain</a> seems even more important.</p>
<h2>Inside the troubled development of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gaming-business.jpg?itok=HgtfDA-e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gaming-business.jpg?itok=0RY5xFU_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s development was reportedly fraught with trouble.</figcaption></figure><p>This week, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">published an article</a> detailing the fraught story of how Warner Bros'&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>became the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">very expensive flop</a> that it was.</p>
<p>Schreier's report talks of a constantly-changing development focus, a culture of "toxic positivity" that discouraged honest internal criticism, and an insistence that last-minute magic would save the project. Where have we <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964" rel="noopener" target="_blank">heard</a> that one <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-mass-effect-andromedas-troubled-five-1795886428" rel="noopener" target="_blank">before</a>?</p>
<p>That same report also claimed that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady is helping out with a director's cut version of&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and that the studio is pitching a new single-player project. Here's hoping you succeed, Rocksteady.</p>
<h2>New Blood's poignant billboard eulogy</h2>
<p>We're ending today on what I suppose cannot be called a "positive" note, but it is a rather sweet one, albeit a poignant one as well.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1798905939497738456" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spotted by reporter Stephen Totilo</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dusk&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>publisher New Blood hired an electronic billboard in downtown Los Angeles to eulogize <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks</a>, and several other studios that were (in some cases allegedly) shut down this year, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">Roll7</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition">Volition</a>.</p>
<p>The billboard features the messages "gone but not forgotten", "thank you for great games from your friends at New Blood", and, perhaps most pointedly, "we love you, we miss you, we hate money". Amen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Slitterhead Release Date Accidentally Leaked by Developer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slitterhead-release-date-apparently-leaked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-release-date-accidentally-leaked-by-developer.892605/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slitterhead-release-date-apparently-leaked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>release date appears to have been leaked ahead of the long-awaited horror project's gameplay reveal during the Summer Game Fest showcase later today.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, SGF host Geoff Keighley <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-2024">confirmed</a> that&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>would feature during the showcase, but thanks to developer Bokeh Game Studio (seemingly) mistakenly uploading a trailer earlier today, we now know when it's launching.</p>
<p>If that trailer is to be believed, then the&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>release date is November 8th. The game will arrive on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X|S, but an Xbox One release doesn't seem to be lined up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slitterhead-release-date-leaked-standoff.jpg?itok=IWdrheaT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slitterhead-release-date-leaked-standoff.jpg?itok=xu6ae0Jh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>is coming your way in November, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer, which you can <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/slitterhead-launches-november-8-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-and-pc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still see right here via Gematsu</a>, shows off some of&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead</em>'s hack-and-slash-inspired gameplay, which looks to blend survival horror-style atmosphere with a more action-oriented combat focus.</p>
<p>As befits a project led by&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>creator Keiichiro Toyama, we get to see some pretty horrific imagery in the trailer, including characters with caved-in eye sockets and horrific spindly monsters.</p>
<p><em>Slitterhead</em>'s core gameplay conceit appears to be the ability to possess any number of people walking around the game's city environment, with those characters subsequently gaining the ability to fight against monsters using weapons apparently conjured from blood.</p>
<p>It also looks like multiple characters will be able to fight together, although whether this represents a multiplayer component or simply an AI companion system remains to be seen.</p>

<p><em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>is the newest project from&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>creator Keiichiro Toyama. It's being developed under the auspices of his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-creator-keiichiro-toyama-founds-bokeh-game-studio">new company Bokeh Game Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Officially revealed back in 2021,&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>also boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>alumnus Akira Toriyama, who's working on music for the game. Other Bokeh staffers with industry history include&nbsp;<em>The Last Guardian&nbsp;</em>producer Kazunobu Sato and <i>Gravity Rush</i>&nbsp;producer Junya Okura.</p>
<p>Assuming the aforementioned trailer is accurate,&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>launches on November 8th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Steam is home to some absolutely brilliant games - everything from psychological horrors to adorable pet sims. It is also home to a game simply called Banana. 
</p>
<p>
"What exactly is Banana?" I hear you ask. Well, it's a free game where you do nothing more than click on the image of a banana, as a counter keeps a tally of how many times you have clicked it.
</p>
<p>
And yet, despite this simple concept, there are over 100,000 people currently playing Banana. 
</p>

At the time of writing, 137,817 Steam users are clicking away at a banana on a screen (or at least have the game open). 
</p>
<p>
To put that into comparison, there are currently 42,521 people playing Helldivers 2, Ghost of Tsushima has 23,511 current players and Hellblade 2 has 199. Even with Banana being a free game to download, it is still quite something to see these figures... so, of course I had to give it a go. 
</p>
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, Banana became the first game I ever managed to get all of the achievements for.  I thought this was because I'd clicked the banana 100 times, which awarded me with the 'Click' accolade, but after looking further  you unlock this achievement after having the game open for one minute, so maybe I happened to click beyond 100 after 60 seconds. 
</p>
<p>
Surely there must be more to Banana than that? Even though I had my achievement, I kept on clicking. I had a hunch that something would happen when I hit 1000 clicks. 
</p>
<p>
997, 998, 999... the moment of truth was here. I clicked again and... nothing happened. The banana on my screen remained as it had been from the very beginning.

<p>
Despite this seemingly benign gameplay, further digging has led me to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1225691328998936576/1236959941097558056">Banana Discord</a>, and the revelation that this game is not simply an idle pastime. It is actually a game that lets players collect bananas to sell in Steam's marketplace, which tops up their Steam wallet.
</p>
<p>
Some bananas on the marketplace are going for mere pennies (the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/2923300/Pandanana">Pandanana banana</a> is currently on there for 3p), but others are being sold at a much higher price. There is a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/2923300/Crypticnana">Crypticnana banana</a> currently on there with a starting price of £254.52. Apparently there are only 25 of these bananas in existence.
</p>
<p>
As far as I can tell, there isn't any shady blockchain situation going on with the whole Banana movement, but it is certainly not what I was expecting to come across this afternoon. To each their own, I guess.

  <p id="K4Pi0C"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/honkai-star-rail/40897"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a> just closed out its <strong>version 2.3 livestream</strong>, teasing what’s to come in the next update, which launches the evening of June 18 EDT. Alongside new characters and events, Hoyoverse uses the stream to distribute <strong>codes</strong> that reward free Stellar Jade and other upgrade materials.</p>
<p id="AghpTw">This update brings some highly anticipated characters: the fire Destruction-user Firefly and the quantum Erudition character Jade. Both of these characters played large roles in the Penacony story (whether it’s directly or by helping some more familiar faces from off-screen) and it makes sense that they’re getting their praise, since the main story on Penacony is wrapping up.</p>
<p id="2xwFN7">The stream also showed a new spin-off of Simulated Universe, a <em>Bejeweled</em>-like origami bird minigame, and new relic and planar ornament sets to equip your characters with.</p>
<hr id="QnPN8o">

<p id="oAC8SV">These codes are only active until the day ends, so you’ll want to make sure to use them quickly.</p>
<p id="FWwhcK">The <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> reward codes from the version 2.3 livestream are:</p>
<ul>
<li id="BKIIiC"><a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/gift?code=3AJUD36P766B">3AJUD36P766B</a></li>

</ul>
<p id="xdLCVT">These codes will expire on <strong>June 8 at 11:59 a.m. EDT / 8:59 a.m. PDT</strong>, so use them quickly or you’ll miss out on the free loot.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172471/chime-how-to-watch-best-horror-movie-2024-kiyoshi-kurosawa<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Nk4WcM">The release date on a new Kiyoshi Kurosawa movie should be an internationally recognized holiday for film fans, particularly for horror die-hards. <em>Chime</em>, the latest from the Japanese director of <em>Cure </em>and <em>Pulse</em>,<em> </em>warrants that kind of celebration. It’s terrifying, beautifully made, and one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24064917/best-movies-2024">the highlights of 2024</a> so far, no matter the genre. The only problem is that most people don’t know the movie exists, or don’t know they can watch it, because it’s only available through a somewhat complicated, NFT-inflected process. </p>
<p id="fGhgqz"><em>Chime </em>is currently rentable through the Japanese digital video trading platform Roadstead.io. Digital video trading, or DVT, as Roadstead’s site calls it, is sort of an evolution of NFTs. A certain number of copies of a movie are made available to purchase, and then the purchasers can do whatever they want with them, including renting them out to other users at whatever price point they decide on. </p>
<p id="iFVmhT"><em>Chime </em>seems to be Roadstead’s only movie so far, and thankfully, it’s easy enough to rent, though you’ll have to jump through a few hoops, starting with making an account on Roadstead’s site. From there, you head to <em>Chime</em>’s rental page — which I can’t actually figure out how to access without a <a href="https://roadstead.io/asset/rental/8d2e6759582dec0f5f35fa5a91ca0000">direct link</a> or a Google search. </p>
<p id="8USQSX">Once you click the “Rental” button, you can select which user’s copy of the movie you’d like to rent. The prices vary from copy to copy, and they’re available for a variable number of days as well. For example, one copy might cost $4.50 for a one-day rental, while another owner offers a $10 rental that lasts a week. Once you’ve selected a price and length, you can rent the movie, so long as you have a card that can be used internationally, as the site currently only accepts payment in yen. But after all that, the movie’s right there in your “assets” tab to watch for as long as you’ve got it rented. </p>
<p id="cvLcjs">The good news is that <em>Chime </em>is more than worth jumping through all these hoops for. </p>

<p id="0S7NI0">The movie follows a former chef named Matsuoka who is teaching cooking classes while he waits to find another job. One day, a student starts complaining about a strange sound he can’t stop hearing, which seems to be changing him from the inside out, causing him to lose control of his behavior and even become violent. What makes the noise especially terrifying, though, is that it seems to spread from person to person with no warning or signs at all, leaving every moment of the movie unpredictable and tense. Kurosawa hasn’t made a horror film since 2016, but he’s sharper than he’s ever been. </p>
<p id="0mB2gX">Kurosawa has always been a master of creating tense, terrifying atmospheres, and he seems to take the idea of building this mood within <em>Chime</em>’s short run time as a personal challenge. He pulls out every trick in his very deep bag and manages to create a creepier, more intense movie in just a couple of scenes than most movies this year have managed in their entirety. </p>
<p id="iERl6z">From its earliest moments, set in Matsuoka’s kitchen classroom, everything about <em>Chime </em>feels perfectly calibrated to unsettle viewers. Kurosawa’s camera sweeps by students innocently cooking, but lingers on knives and burners. It sits sedately while people chop onions, like it’s just waiting for them to have an accident. When people walk through the space, it feels like a threat. They move quickly and with purpose, sometimes even with a knife pointing out in front of them, though only to cut more vegetables back at their station. It’s agonizing and brilliant. </p>
<p id="os27SX">In minutes, before any of the plot has been introduced, there’s an inescapable pull, a sense that something is going to go horribly wrong. All that’s left is to wait and see what. Kurosawa makes this whole sequence feel like a magic trick, a movie’s worth of tone-setting, handled in minutes through nothing but framing and blocking. But Kurosawa’s most impressive element in <em>Chime </em>is the movie’s brilliant sound design, which makes every noise feel cacophonous and inescapable. </p>

<p id="tiGnu3">The audience never officially hears “the sound,” which the student first describes as a kind of “chime.” But there’s a recurring motif in the movie’s sparse score that seems to stand in for it instead. Around that, though, every part of the movie’s sound design is ratcheted up. Noises are distinct and clear, played with a loud crispness that feels designed to worm its way into viewers’ heads and infuriate them. Inside the sparse kitchen classroom where much of the movie’s action takes place, the sounds of knives hitting cutting boards feels like an echo that can’t be escaped, and the spatulas on frying pans sound like nails on a chalkboard.</p>
<p id="3OHsyC">Each sound presses down around the audience and the characters until the chime cuts through and turns the scene on its head, providing both relief from the encroaching shroud of other noises and unease in the sudden silence — and often violence — that follows it. </p>
<p id="3ajxxq">With all these elements working in dreadful harmony, Kurosawa has made far and away one of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090384/best-horror-movies-2024-how-scary">best horror movies of the year so far</a>, and he sets a more complete and frightening tone in less than half the run time of most of those movies. Like all Kurosawa’s movies, <em>Chime </em>isn’t necessarily the kind of scary that’s going to make you jump in the moment. It’s the kind of scary that might wake you up a few days later with an uneasy feeling, with a scene from the movie stuck uncomfortably in your head. In fact, the noise at the center of <em>Chime </em>feels like an almost perfect metaphor for the way its director treats his horror movies. They start quiet and strange, and they echo in your head until it’s all you can think about. </p>

Thanks to a new teaser from Netflix, we now have roughly 15 seconds more footage than we did before. It’s not a lot, but it’s enough to get fans excited again.</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1798833731442217130&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1798833731442217130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new footage</a></span> appears in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knuUMiHzfK8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knuUMiHzfK8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promotional video from Netflix</a></span> highlighting the streaming platform’s upcoming animation projects. The video itself is around three minutes and has a couple of clips from <em>Arcane </em>but the new footage appears at the 2:39 mark. The highlight of the short teaser is our first look at what the protagonist duo of Caitlyn and Vi will look like in the second season. The footage shows the two in a lineup of other characters, all of whom are enforcers (the name given to the city of Piltover’s police department).</p><p>Caitlyn’s new look is only a slight twist on her season one appearance, which makes sense given she was also an enforcer then—how much can a uniform really change? The highlights of her new appearance are a white beret, a red ribbon around her neck, and a pair of black pants. She looks much more in charge than the young enforcer we saw previously, so she may be leading some special task force.</p><p>Vi is sporting a whole new look, also donning an enforcer uniform, complete with her signature gauntlets as well as a more armored shoulder section of the jacket. Vi becoming an enforcer makes sense, given that’s what she is in <em>League of Legends</em>, but in the context of <em>Arcane</em>, it still feels weird to see. Overall, she looks so uncomfortable in the clothes of a cop, and who can blame her given how she grew up in the undercity under their cruel, authoritarian rule, the very thing that led her to distrust Caitlyn at the beginning of season one. Who knows if she’ll be able to stand the new threads for long?</p><p>As for the other three characters we see in the new footage, they both appear to be original characters to <em>Arcane</em>,<em> </em>not taken directly from <em>League of Legends</em>. That might spell trouble for them as it gives the show more room to make their fates less than good. The full lineup does appear to support the idea of a special enforcer task force led by Caitlyn. Given the cliffhanger ending of season one—in which we see Jinx launching a rocket directly at the Piltover council—the gang will surely have a lot of new problems to tackle.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We miss you. We hate money.”</p><p>Folks from around the industry are reacting warmly to the solidarity, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/studioanisa/status/1799021086321111077&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/studioanisa/status/1799021086321111077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developers who worked at the studios mentioned</a></span>. Some criticism was directed at New Blood for putting its name on the billboard as that could be read as an advertisement for its own games, but I’d argue that anonymous support isn’t what anyone needs right now. The video game industry is at a crisis point and visibly speaking out against corporate greed is a big part of how any of this gets better in the future.</p><p>The billboard uses the glitch aesthetic, which almost gives it the vibe of someone hacking into an ad space to cut through the usual promotional noise that goes on at these things to say something of substance. New Blood CEO and co-founder Dave Oshry <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1798907381356875900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1798907381356875900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> that he is “always trying to find new and creative ways to waste money,” and said he hopes that those affected by the swath of layoffs in the past two years land on their feet in the aftermath. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/8-ways-final-fantasy-14-is-unlike-other-mmorpgs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8-ways-final-fantasy-14-is-unlike-other-mmorpgs.892575/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/8-ways-final-fantasy-14-is-unlike-other-mmorpgs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Over the last decade, Final Fantasy 14 has transformed from a failure to one of the most-played multiplayer games in the entire world. A huge part of that success is how FF14 has broken the mold of MMOs, striking out in new ways that have clearly attracted millions of players. Over a decade after the relaunch of A Realm Reborn, FF14 shows no signs of stopping, and if you find yourself tired of the usual MMO fare, it might be the right choice for you. </p><p>With a huge main game and multiple expansions starting FF14<em> </em>might seem like a daunting task, but so much of what the game does differently revolves around attracting new players, or those wholly unfamiliar with the genre. Here are some of the major ways FF14 differs from other MMOs. </p><h2><strong>A Story to Rival the Single-Player Games</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Final Fantasy’s most defining feature has always been its story, and FF14 carries on that tradition with gusto. In fact, it’s fair to say the story is one of the major focuses of the game, which is fairly uncommon in the world of MMOs. </p><p>Set in the land of Eorzea, FF14<em> </em>tells a sweeping tale about the Warrior of Light, a chosen hero with the power to see into other people’s souls using something called “The Echo.” Despite being a multiplayer game, FF14 has a core cast of characters that serve as the party. These characters grow and change in fascinating ways alongside your Warrior of Light, building deep complex relationships with the player. </p><p>While each expansion has a new story, each one is basically the next step in a larger narrative. What makes<em> </em>FF14 so compelling, however, is the deeply human and emotional themes it consistently tackles. Heavensward<em> </em>tackles religious fervor and the cycle of revenge, Stormblood<em> </em>shows rebellion against subjugation, Shadowbringers deconstructs the nature of heroes, and Endwalker asks big questions about the meaning of life itself.</p><p>While these core themes permeate the stories, the grand sweeping tales also do a great job of fleshing out the world with lore and politics, making Eorzea and the rest of the world feel like real places. At the same time, despite being a multiplayer game, FF14 has a core cast of characters that serve as the party. These characters grow and change in fascinating ways alongside your Warrior of Light, building deep complex relationships with the player. Seeing these characters grow and change across each expansion is a delight, especially when coupled with the larger themes present. </p><p>While the main story is riveting on its own, FF14 also has dozens of side stories that tie into that overarching narrative, or help develop side characters even further. Nearly everything in the game has some kind of story or narrative purpose attached, and the tales found within the MMO rival the best you can find in the Final Fantasy series. </p><h2><strong>You Can Play Final Fantasy 14 Solo</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/07/28/finalfantasy14dawntrailerteasertrailer-ign-blogroll-1690572007862.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Despite being a massively multiplayer game, you can play through a surprising amount of FF14 solo. If you want to dive in and experience the story, there is a wealth of systems to let you do that with as little interaction with other players as possible. </p><p>The majority of story-related dungeons can be completed using Trusts, which are NPC characters that act as your party members. Of course, the majority of story quests can be played solo on top of that. This means you have a massive world and riveting story with hundreds of hours of content to experience. Doing dungeons with NPCs means you can also take your time, soak in the story, and even experiment with jobs and train your skills. </p><p>The only times you’ll need to strike out are whenever you do 8-man content, like the boss-fight Trials. But if you don’t know anyone playing FF14<em> </em>you can always use the game’s matchmaking to take these on, and the Roulette system means there are always players looking to help with content. </p><p>Of course, if you find that you want to get more social and engage with more multiplayer content, like Alliance Raids, those options will always be there waiting. </p><h2><strong>You Can Do Everything With One Character</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/16/ffxiv-xbx-obt-promo-dash-9070a617204be30b2073-1705431972894.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the major differences between FF14 and other MMOs is that literally everything in the game can be done with a single character: every quest, every job, every dungeon. In FF14 you can learn every battle job and crafting job with just that one character, and swap between wherever and whenever you want. This means you won’t need to craft multiple characters to see every class, or side with different factions. </p><p>On top of that, all of FF14’s content is designed to be as easily accessible as possible. This means if you want to play everything as a DPS job, but avoid Tank and Healer entirely, you can do that. The matchmaking and party systems in FF14<em> </em>are built to make getting through content as easy as possible, and again, that includes if you just want to play the game solo. </p><h2><strong>Jobs/Classes Only Have One Build</strong></h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/27/ffxiv-40-mediakit-20170501-010-1498603434810.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Final Fantasy 14 features dozens of different jobs to choose from, and there’s a lot of variety baked into the actual individual roles. However, each job has a specific set of skills that will apply to anyone and everyone who plays it. Unlike other MMOs, there aren’t any alternative builds you can construct, or different ways to play a specific class. So if you’re playing Dragoon there’s one set of skills, you learn those, and that’s it. </p><p>For some players, this might count as a negative, but for anyone who might not be well-versed in MMOs, it means you won’t have to juggle trying to choose different builds or options, but can focus on learning the core ins and outs of each job. It also means you’ll have more opportunities to try out different jobs and find whatever you like best. </p><h2><strong>It Plays Great on a Controller</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail Official Images</h3></div></output><p>MMORPGs have traditionally been seen as PC-focused experiences, but more and more have started to make their way to consoles over the years. In that regard, FF14 has nearly every other MMO out there beat with its controller support. </p><p>Playing FF14 with a controller is every bit as viable as playing with a mouse and keyboard. Square Enix has put a ton of thought and time into making that a reality, with minimal time and learning required from players. </p><p>By default, you have quick access to 16 different actions when using a controller, by setting actions to the left/right trigger and then D-pad and face buttons. Past that, there are little additions, like the Cross Hotbar, that you can use to add even more actions. Other elements, like cycling through allies for healing, have also been given intuitive button presses that are easy to use. </p><p>You will, of course, need to spend a bit of time learning jobs and getting used to setting up your hotbars on controllers, but the FF14 community has created countless videos and guides to advise new players on setting things up. If you’re hesitant to pick up FF14 on consoles because of having to use a controller, don’t let that be a worry at all. Just keep in mind you still may want a keyboard if you’re planning on chatting in-game a lot. </p><h2><strong>Final Fantasy 14 Respects Your Time</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/21/ff14thumb-1697894557689.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>There are hundreds of hours of content to wade through in<em> </em>FF14, and catching up is always going to be an undertaking. That being said, the MMO does a fantastic job of respecting player’s time, making sure that you always feel rewarded or engaged in some way. </p><p>Outside of the main story nothing in<em> </em>FF14 is mandatory, and you can always engage with every piece of side content as much, or as little, as you want. The game liberally makes sure that you don’t have to waste dozens of hours grinding to get to any content unless you’re looking to do the absolute hardest raids available. If you want to follow the main story you’ll gain all the levels you need simply by doing story quests and dungeons, and some of the more “grind-y” side quests are still worth doing because they have unique stories or mechanics attached. On top of this, you can acquire new gear in a multitude of different ways, from new raids to purchasing on the market board. This means anytime a new patch is released you should have an easy time leveling up your jobs to stay relevant. </p><p>Apart from that, the development team has been vocal about how they want players to take breaks, with director Naoki Yoshida previously <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/517ql0/a_player_asks_on_how_to_maintain_motivation_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>saying</u></a> it’s “okay” to not play the game every day. </p><p>There’s always new content to play through with a new patch, but<em> </em>FF14<em> </em>isn’t going to soak up your time every day or even every week. You can stop playing, come back months later, and be able to jump right back in. </p><h2><strong>Old Content Stays Relevant</strong></h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/11/19/ffxiv-pub-fanfestival-2018-lasvegas-13-1542667050158.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the remarkable things about FF14<em> </em>is that you can go back and play virtually any piece of content released. Any piece of content from when the game relaunched as A Realm Reborn to now, is still accessible, and more often than not changed or enhanced. The only exception to this rule is timed season events or collaborations, like the Fall Guys collaboration or the crossover quests with Final Fantasy 15. More often than not, though, times events tend to come back later down the road. </p><p>Other than that, Square Enix has made a deliberate choice to not block off any old content or make it inaccessible. In fact, the development team has taken liberal steps to update old story quests, raids, and more, so they fall more in line with what you’ll find in current updates for FF14. </p><p>Daily roulette rewards make it easier to find parties for old content, but even if you’re unable to find matchmaking you can take on older content with a tight group of friends, or even solo it after you’ve leveled a bit. </p><h2><strong>The Developers Genuinely Listen to Fan Feedback</strong></h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/05/21/yoshida20830131280jpg-dcfa9f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the core reasons FF14 has been so successful over the years is the transparency and dedication the development team has shown. There’s a reason director and producer Naoki Yoshida is lovingly referred to as “Yoshi-P” by the community. There are other MMOs out there that do a great job at addressing feedback, but in many ways FF14 has set the precedent for the last decade.</p><p>Every few months Yoshida holds a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrFWly2wJzL4qSWYxNAVsKqtPIUQCiaJ_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Letter From the Producer</u></a>” livestream that goes in-depth on all the changes or additions coming with each patch. More often than not, during these segments, Yoshida and other members of the team will directly address player feedback. </p><p>There is, of course, always a balance that needs to be struck, as Yoshida and his team simply can’t adapt or change everything players want. But over the years there’s been a meaningful change to player housing, differences between jobs, more solo options, varied content like the cozy building sidequest Island Sanctuary, and more. </p><p>In a 2017 interview with <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/final-fantasy-xiv-final-fantasy-naoki-yoshida-video-games-games-gamers-627047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Newsweek</em></u></a> Yoshida summed up the development team’s philosophy by saying it wants to "make sure that we are growing this game together, and the development team is not the enemy of the players. We all love Final Fantasy 14, and we just want to come together as allies. The communication should be going both ways, not unilaterally."</p><p>FF14 still has problems and things that can be improved upon, but it’s the perfect MMO to pick up if you’re looking for something that has had meaningful change in the past and will likely continue to have even more. </p><p><em>Hayes Madsen is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-avoids-f2p-as-its-live-service-model-takes-shape-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Concord following Helldivers 2's pricing suggests a non-F2P strategy – which creates difficult challenges, but could lead to a more sustainable business in the end</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony's decision to devote around a third of the entire runtime of its State of Play event last week to upcoming hero shooter Concord was a fairly clear statement of intent – the company's desire to pivot towards live service games burns unabated, and while the high-quality singleplayer games upon which PlayStation's studios' reputation was built aren't going anywhere for now, they will at least have to share the spotlight with their upstart live service brethren from now on.</p>
<p>Beyond that headline grabbing strategy, though, Sony has also made one further statement of intent with regard to Concord, although this one, for some reason, was made about as quietly as the firm could manage. Concord isn't going to be a free-to-play game; following in the footsteps of Sony's earlier live service success, Helldivers 2, it's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/concord-store-listings-show-sony-maintaining-helldivers-style-lower-price-point-for-live-service-titles">going to launch at a $40 price point</a>.</p>
<p>Two games does not a strategy make, I suppose, but the fact that Sony has chosen to use this pricing for both a co-operative PvE game like Helldivers 2 and now a PvP hero shooter like Concord strongly suggests that this is a model the firm is at least somewhat committed to.</p>
<p>It's certainly not shouting about any such commitment from the rooftops, though. Concord's pricing details were released on its PlayStation Store listings without fanfare or announcement, which actually feels like something of a missed opportunity, since the corollary information that the game's future maps, characters, and story vignettes will all be available for free would probably have gone down very well with the State of Play audience, and might even have shifted the conversation about the game a little more positive.</p>
<p>If this is indeed Sony's emerging 'house style' for live service games, then it's a very interesting one. I'm sure there will be some latitude within the model for games that are more obviously suited to a different monetisation strategy – perhaps Sony will even fully embrace F2P for some titles – but thus far the shape of what Sony is doing with these games involves an up-front payment, albeit a competitively priced one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony is making things a bit harder for itself by avoiding free-to-play – but its calculation that this approach will lead to a more sustainable live service business in the medium to long-term may be well founded</p></blockquote>
<p>That runs counter to the prevailing industry logic about live service games, which generally holds that the F2P approach of making the game client itself free to download is required to remove barriers to entry and get the maximum possible number of players into the game, where they can eventually be converted into paying customers. Sony isn't taking that approach, and that's a decision which has far-reaching consequences for the types of live service games it will ultimately launch.</p>
<p>Of course, Sony has one powerful data point on its side in this regard: Helldivers 2, which launched with precisely this model and has become the fastest-selling PlayStation game to date, and the breakout hit of the first half of this year. That's a pretty good counterpoint to anyone raising their eyebrows and pointing at disasters like Warner Bros.' Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, a live service title which launched at full price and which, according to Bloomberg, has performed so badly that its publisher has taken an <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/insiders-blame-suicide-squads-failings-on-changing-vision-and-lack-of-live-service-skills">eye-watering $200 million loss</a> on the game.</p>
<p>Of course, Suicide Squad had deep, deep problems that went far beyond its business model, but the roll-call of premium-priced live service titles that have flopped hard is difficult to ignore; from the likes of Anthem and Marvel's Avengers, via more recent failures like Skull &amp; Bones, to even some attempts at exploring lower price points like Foamstars, the list of failed live service games whose model included an up-front payment is a sobering one.</p>
<p>Not that there haven't been F2P failures, of course; but a model that forces a live service game to convince players to pay for it before they start playing is undoubtedly setting the difficulty on hard for itself. Nonetheless, it's undeniable that Helldivers 2 has managed it thus far.</p>
<p>It's worth setting out clearly what the advantages of F2P for a live service game actually are, because – as many, many companies that have tried to transition premium games to F2P models after the fact have discovered – the basic decision of whether to charge up-front for the game or not has knock-on effects across a huge swathe of the design of the game and its systems.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/concord-gameplay-3.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Concord is following the same model as Helldivers 2 with a $40 price tag. Maps and characters will be added for free</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Removing this financial barrier to entry doesn't just encourage a much wider group of players to try out the game, it also generally improves the experience for paying players by creating a large base of 'free' players who make the game feel much more active and dynamic. Removing the up-front cost barrier helps to avoid speed bumps and plateaus in the growth of the game – points where despite the game having a generally good reception, growth flattens and player numbers fall off because the highly engaged audience is saturated, and the 'next tier down,' casually curious audience is much more sensitive to up-front costs.</p>
<p>The F2P model is also great for encouraging cross-platform play, since players can easily download the client to any of their devices and log into their account to access their paid-for content and upgrades.</p>
<p>All of this is exacerbated greatly by the fact that most of the competition a live service title will face is already F2P – so in essence, you're asking people to pay money for a product your most established competitors offer for 'free.'</p>
<p>This is the factor which ultimately led Blizzard to rework its hero shooter Overwatch, which seems to be the most analogous title on the market to Concord, into an F2P business model – it simply didn't seem like Overwatch could compete with the F2P behemoths in that field while being held back by its own price tag.</p>
<p>Yet the F2P-reworked Overwatch 2 is also a tough lesson in how deeply the difference between a paid-for game and a free client impacts player psychology in their engagement with game systems; the original audience for Overwatch, who paid for the game up-front, reacted incredibly negatively to the more aggressive monetisation strategies of the now-F2P Overwatch 2, forcing Blizzard to roll back several of its more egregious changes to the game.</p>
<blockquote><p>The decision of whether or not to charge up-front for the game has knock-on effects across the design of the game</p></blockquote>
<p>Sony will have to tiptoe carefully around post-launch monetisation of its own live service games for this reason; players who have paid for a game up front have a very different tolerance level for monetisation strategies to those who have downloaded a free client.</p>
<p>So why, given all of this, is Sony not embracing a pure F2P approach with its games? It's tempting to suggest that Sony's focus on the paid-for model is simply down to being a company deeply embedded in traditional game software business models, and wary or nervous of committing itself fully to F2P. That's certainly behaviour we've seen in the past from publishers that just can't bring themselves to 'give away' a game that's taken them tens of millions of dollars to develop, or can't make themselves comfortable with counter-intuitive aspects of the F2P model such as having such a large group of players who don't pay any money at all.</p>
<p>However, I don't think that analysis fits with what we're seeing from Sony. The company may be pretty new to F2P overall, but this is a platform holder that's watching the Hoyoverse cash roll in on PlayStation; it sees and understands how F2P works and what it requires, and has nonetheless made a choice to eschew that approach.</p>
<p>I can see three major reasons why Sony may have decided to avoid F2P and instead push forward with an upfront payment model for its live service games. Firstly, this approach reduces player churn and gives the developers more breathing room in the early stages of the game's operation. Many F2P games are flash in the pan; there is a large group of consumers who try out each new game as it appears but move on rapidly, churning over to the next big release without ever becoming paying customers.</p>
<p>Adding a payment barrier means missing out on those players – who arguably aren't very important to the business anyway – but ensures that the players you do have are quite literally invested in the success of the game, and are encouraged to hang around for long enough to get their money's worth, at least. This is a trade-off; you slow your player acquisition, but those players you do acquire are more likely to stick with the game and give it a fair shot, rather than bouncing at the first sign of friction.</p>
<p>Sony seems to feel that while full-price is too high a barrier, the $40 price point is a sweet spot for this trade-off. Long-term, though, it will still run into issues with trying to engage more casually interested audiences – there's some evidence to suggest that Helldivers 2 has hit a speed bump of this sort in recent weeks, for example.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/suicide-squad-headline-3-postacie.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Suicide Squad, Anthem, Marvel's Avengers - there are plenty of examples of full-priced live service games that failed</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Secondly, creating a cost barrier to entry can also have very positive effects for the community which forms around the game, because it inherently means that efforts to reduce abusive behaviour in the game actually have teeth. Getting banned or suspended from an F2P game generally just means creating a new free email address so you can sign up again; getting banned from a paid-for game can mean having to buy a whole new copy of the game.</p>
<p>This is notably a bigger concern for Sony than for most live service game operators because Sony is also a platform holder; it's conscious of being seen as responsible for player behaviour on its platform and of the importance of protecting the PlayStation image and brand. I don't think this aspect would be enough to prevent Sony from embracing F2P if it really thought that was the best way forward for its games (and notably, it also has enforcement avenues via the PS Plus subscription service), but it's undoubtedly aware of it as a side benefit of its approach.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most notably, there's the PS Plus aspect to this. Sony has an option in its arsenal that is very unusual among live service game operators; it doesn't ever have to overhaul the business model of its live service games to make them F2P (like Overwatch did), because it already has a hugely popular mechanism for making games free for a certain period of time to people who pay a monthly subscription to PlayStation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony has been watching the Hoyoverse cash roll in on PlayStation; it sees and understands how F2P works and what it requires, and has nonetheless made a choice to eschew that approach</p></blockquote>
<p>This could allow it to overcome plateaus in its games' growth curves, giving an injection of new players at some point down the road from launch, without the stigma of being seen to make the game F2P – a move generally associated with failure in players' minds. Of course, this only works on the PS5 platform, not on PC, so some other strategy may be needed for PC launches, but at least on the console side of things, PS Plus' game catalogue is a powerful weapon for the live service strategy to have in reserve.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Sony is undoubtedly making things a bit harder for itself by avoiding going F2P up front with these titles – but the company's calculation that this approach will lead to a more sustainable live service business in the medium- to long-term may be well founded.</p>
<p>The broader questions of how deep consumers' tolerance for an endless flood of live service games is, and how many of these games can be supported concurrently by the existing market, remain extremely challenging to answer – but in the choice of business model, at least, there may indeed be method to Sony's madness.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mark-cerny-at-60-i-the-gi-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Mark Cerny has just added something to his growing list of achievements.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about the global success of last year's Spider-Man 2, on which Cerny worked as executive producer. But something, in many ways, just as impressive.</p>
<p>"I just finished playing Animal Well, and before that and I was very heavily into Neon White, which is my first speedrun," he says.</p>
<p>"I actually platinumed that. That was a real challenge. I wasn't sure if I could do it, because reflexes as I head towards 60 are very different from the reflexes I had when I was a teenager and playing in the arcades. But I am glad I went after it. The precision and stamina that you need to get through a game like that is different in the way it feels, compared with these character action games like Spider-Man that I've been working on."</p>
<p>Cerny is explaining to us that despite his current role as the architect behind PlayStation hardware, what he finds interesting about a game isn't necessarily what it's doing technically, but rather what's <em>new</em> about it. In fact, for all the different roles that Cerny has had in his 42-year games industry career, the one he's never stopped doing is that of 'gamer'.</p>
<p>"I continue to be a massive player," he tells us. "I got into this 40-something years ago because I was an arcade addict.</p>
<p>"Back in the day, I was one of the best players in the country at Defender. That's actually how I got my job at Atari. There was a reporter who was writing a book on arcade games strategies. We're talking about an era so distant that there weren't even games magazines. So if you wanted to learn arcade game strategy, you would go to the supermarket and at the checkout there would be a book that you could buy that would tell you how to play whatever game. And he interviewed me for Defender because I was a well-known local player. I bumped into him later, I told him I wanted to get into the business, and he very kindly called Atari Coin-Op and got me an interview, and the rest is history."</p>
<p>Cerny's career has taken him from designing and programming games like Marble Madness and Major Havoc in the 1980s, to producing and developing iconic platform games such as Sonic The Hedgehog 2, Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon in the 1990s, to today, where's he's led the creation of the PlayStation 4 and 5 hardware. There are not a whole lot of game leaders who have been able to stay on top for over four decades, and Cerny believes that variety has been key to this longevity.</p>
<p>"The industry has certainly changed a lot in the last 40-something years, and one thing I've noticed is that the people who are very actively participating after that amount of time tend to have done a lot of things," he says. "[Game developer] Amy Hennig and I talk about this a lot. In her case, she's been a writer, an animator, an artist, a director, and I'm sure a few other things. For me, because I'm much more technical, it’s been programmer, designer, producer, executive producer – which is a bit different – I've run a small publisher, I've been a game director, and then of course there's the hardware work today."</p>
<p>He adds: "One way I look at it, if you want to have an interesting career in games, don't do one thing. You really don't want to be the physics programmer, because then you end up being, after a couple of years, perhaps just the programmer who integrates the physics middleware package. This is nothing against physics programmers, some of whom are incredible. But if you have a very specific niche, my feeling is that, after a few decades, you're probably not doing as interesting a set of things as you would if you had kept evolving your role."</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's not bittersweet at all to say that instead of creating games, I've chosen to support the creation of the games"</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, when Cerny was starting out, games developers didn't really have roles.</p>
<p>"When I joined Atari in 1982 there was one job, and it was a hybrid of programmer, designer and artist," he explains. "You even had to make your own artwork. There were about 15 of us programmer/designer/artists, and so Atari Coin-Op was making 15 games. That was how it was. We didn't see any real specialisation until the 1990s."</p>
<p>Cerny still does multiple things, but to the current generation of gamers, he's probably best known as the lead architect behind PlayStation 4 and 5.</p>
<p>We're roughly at the mid-way point in the PS5's lifecycle, and so we wanted to ask if there's anything developers have been doing with the hardware that has surprised him.</p>
<p>"I have been very surprised by the degree to which developers are using ray-tracing," he begins. "Putting that in, that was a big decision and actually a rather late one. I thought that this is not going to get much use initially, but if we look at generations, and a generation is seven years or so, software is created for ten years, and so later in the lifecycle we will start seeing people using that technology. But instead we had launch titles that were taking advantage of it. I guess, having worked on games for consoles that were a bit difficult to get into, like the PlayStation 3, I can be a little skittish about very deep technology like that. But in this case, my guess as to how things would go was totally wrong. And I am so happy to have seen the early adoption of the technology.</p>
<p>"The other thing that has been surprising is the push to 60 frames per second. Based on previous console lifecycles, I would have expected there to be a lot more games that are 30 frames per second only, just because the artwork can be so much more detailed if you have longer time to render it. Instead, the almost universal rule this time around has been the games run at 60.</p>
<p>"It's great from a play perspective. Gamers overwhelmingly prefer games that are higher frame rates. I just didn't expect such a departure from previous generations."</p>

<p>Cerny says building a console takes about four years, and nowadays that's less time than it takes to make some of the big AAA titles. There is a lot of focus right now on the time it takes to build these games, and Cerny says that, ultimately, it's the developers that have chosen this path.</p>
<p>"With the consoles, one thing I've been trying to do is reduce the amount of time it takes [developers] to get going with their games. I call this 'time to triangle'. All that means is that if I just want to get a triangle up on the screen, how long does it take to build the engine technology that will allow me to do that? That might not sound very difficult. The first PlayStation you could maybe do that in a month, but the consoles got so complex that by PlayStation 3 that was taking probably six months to a year. So I've been working to bring that down. PlayStation 4 and 5 are much quicker. It takes a month or two before you have those fundamental graphics technologies up and running on [those systems].</p>
<p>"I probably shouldn't, but I spend a lot of time on the boards. And I see people asking… if the time to triangle has been greatly reduced, why is it then taking so many years to create a game? And the answer is that is what the teams are choosing to do. They are going after these massive creations that really do need four or six years to put together."</p>
<blockquote><p>"If you want to have an interesting career in games, don't do one thing... After a few decades, you're probably not doing as interesting a set of things as you would if you had kept evolving your role"</p></blockquote>
<p>Another shift in the development landscape is around multiplatform games. Developers are increasingly building their projects for as many platforms as possible. Even PlayStation has been bringing its games to PC (albeit a few years after the console version). The issue is that consoles often have bespoke technologies in them, and if developers use these technologies, it might hinder their ability to port the game elsewhere. Cerny admits his team is aware of this challenge, but actually it's an opportunity for them to lead.</p>
<p>“One of the exciting aspects of console hardware design is that we have freedom with regards to what we put in the console," Cerny begins. "Or to put that differently, we’re not trying to build a low-cost PC, and we aren’t bound by any particular standards. So if we have a brainstorm that audio can become much more immersive and dimensional if there’s a dedicated unit that’s capable of complex math, then we can do that. Or if the future feels like high-speed SSDs rather than HDDs, we can put an end-to-end system in the console – everything from the flash dies to the software interfaces that the game creators use – and get 100% adoption.</p>
<p>"I like to think that occasionally we’re even showing the way for the larger industry, and that our efforts end up benefiting those gaming on PC as well. It’s a tech-heavy example, but on PS4 we had very efficient GPU interfaces, and that may well have spurred DirectX to become more efficient in response. Or to look at something more consumer-focused, I believe that releasing PS5 in 2020 with a very high-performance integrated SSD put pressure on the PC world to get their corresponding DirectStorage API into the hands of their gamers.</p>
<p>"There’s a recent development here, which is console exclusives that were created to run on bespoke PlayStation systems are now making their way to PC. That conversion has been simpler than many thought. The main consequence is that the minimum spec for the PC version of the game gets a bit higher, perhaps more CPUs or more RAM, in order to replace the missing systems.”</p>

<p>Not only can gamers now play PlayStation games on PC, but they can also use PlayStation hardware, including the DualSense and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/psvr-2-pc-adapter-to-launch-on-august-7">PlayStation VR 2</a>. Meanwhile, on the other end, we're increasingly seeing <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/iphone-15-pro-will-run-native-versions-of-aaa-titles">AAA developers getting a version of their games running on mobile</a>. The lines between platforms seem to be blurring, but Cerny feels consoles continue to play a crucial role in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>He points to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfpXMuMvcWQ">amusing video by Linus Tech Tips</a>, which attempted to 'kill' the PlayStation 5 by building a $500 gaming PC that outperformed the console.</p>
<p>"They had to get a used motherboard," he says. "That was the only way that they could build a PlayStation 5 equivalent for a PlayStation 5 price. And if you're using used parts… well you can get a used PlayStation 5 for eBay for $300-something.</p>
<p>"I think as long as we continue to create that very nice package, the future of consoles is pretty bright."</p>
<p>Cerny turns 60 this year, and it's at moments like this when one might look back on where they've been. He says he tries not to get nostalgic, but if there are days he looks back on with fondness, "it's probably back to the days when a single designer could lay out a third of a game, half of a game or even an entire game."</p>
<blockquote><p>"As long as we continue to create that very nice package, the future of consoles is pretty bright"</p></blockquote>
<p>He explains: "I am not talking about what we would call today an indie game, but what we would have called a AAA game back in those days. Something like Crash Bandicoot 2, where if you are running down the path and there's an apple that you picked up, odds are I was the one that put it there."</p>
<p>Since the days of Atari, Cerny has been – step-by-step – moving away from pure game creation to more of a support role. And although that might be a shame, it does afford him the ability to work with a variety of developers on all sorts of projects.</p>
<p>"I see incredible games getting made," he says. "It's not bittersweet at all to say that instead of creating games, I've chosen to support the creation of the games. Because there is really good work being done."</p>
<p>With a big birthday on the horizon, the question of retirement inevitably comes up.</p>
<p>"It is something that's a bit on my mind," he admits, "but I do believe I have a bit of time left in this industry."</p>
<p>I suspect a few people reading this would have hoped to have heard a definitive: 'Retire? Never!'.</p>
<p>"Well, Clint Eastwood is a pretty good role model," he concludes.</p>
<p>"At least the part where he's still directing movies at age 90-something, not the part where he started a movie with a chimpanzee."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nightdive-outlines-the-process-of-remastering-killing-time.892560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/nightdive-outlines-the-process-of-remastering-killing-time/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nightdive-outlines-the-process-of-remastering-killing-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="267" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Killing Time</em> feels like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nightdive-and-ziggurat-are-restoring-a-cult-classic-with-killing-time-resurrected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such an obvious choice</a> for Nightdive to tackle for a remaster. Initially released on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer console in 1995, it received a port to PC in 1996. It’s an underappreciated gem that could use a polish and a second chance.</p> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">One thing that struck me in the recent trailer is just how much of an upgrade the new enemy sprites and textures look. Their remaster of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-star-wars-dark-forces-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Dark Forces</a></em> was already an impressive touch-up, but the assets in <em>Killing Time</em> struck me as something that would be more difficult to really improve. Many of the enemies are digitized actors – pictures of people in costume. Others are 3D models turned into 2D sprites. How do you improve these without losing the feel of the originals?</p>
 <p data-characters="88" data-current-count="88" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/turok-3-comparison-video-nightdive-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightdive artist Albert Marin Garau</a> sent me some details on the magic. Prepare to learn.</p> <figure data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Nightdive Studios</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">“We had access to old backup CDs that contained the original photographs they took to the real-life actors for the 3DO version of the game, and also higher resolution renders of other non-human enemies,” Albert told me.</p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">The important thing to note is that the PC version of <em>Killing Time</em> wasn’t a direct port. The map was expanded and changed, and all the enemies had different sprites. These new enemy appearances weren’t always better. They were often just different. Notably, they removed the actors. This may look less hokey, but also changes the feel of the game.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">Albert explained, “All this backup data was for the original 3DO version of the game, so we don’t have hi-res sprites of the enemies’ PC version.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Killing Time: Resurrected Announcement Trailer | Nightdive Studios" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zkvx_2g68n4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true">As I mentioned, the PC version added (and technically removed in a couple of cases) new enemies. So, without having high-resolution versions of the assets, Albert had to do things the hard way.</p>
 <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">“Since some of the enemies are exclusive to the PC version (the Gardener, the Sexy Maid, the Tough Guy, and even the final boss, Tess, for example) we needed to do something to get a good quality balance between the backed and non-backed up assets. I modeled, rigged, skinned, and animated those exclusive PC enemies and rendered hi-res sprites that match the quality of the other hi-res assets,” he told me.</p>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">When the trailer flips from classic graphics to the remaster, the change in enemy design might seem a bit jarring. That’s not because Nightdive’s artists took liberties with the art style, it’s because of the change between PC and 3DO versions. “The low-res ones are the PC enemies, the hi-res are the 3DO enemies,” Albert explained.</p> <figure data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Nightdive Studios</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="174" data-current-count="174" data-injectable="false">As for the textures, which also have been upgraded for the remaster, the team once again had access to higher-quality versions from backup data… some of them, anyway.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">“All backup data we have is for the 3DO version,” Albert explained. “Most textures used in the PC version came from the 3DO version, but around 25% of them are exclusive to PC. But thanks to the hand-drawn look nature of this game art style in the stage textures, it was possible to upscale and hand-draw all missing details with excellent results. All assets dimensions are 400% bigger than the original assets.”</p>
 <p data-characters="649" data-current-count="649" data-injectable="false">Altogether, while Nightdive’s upgrades to the visuals seem pretty stark, a lot of effort was taken to ensure it’s true to the original experience. Despite sporting a gloss that feels more at home on modern displays, you still get a sense of the ‘90s sensibilities. It’s true to the studio’s attempts to ensure that their remasters are the new definitive versions, compiling all the original content, and changing as little as possible, while presenting them with modern comforts. After all, if you’re interested in playing <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em>, it’s probably because you want to play <em>Killing Time</em>; not somebody’s weak facsimile.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-lingyang-build-in-wuthering-waves-%E2%80%93-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions.892554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-lingyang-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-best-lingyang-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="242" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Although not an optimal pick against foes who cannot be juggled or stay within his reach while in the air, Lingyang’s ability to deal high damage while staying mobile earned him the title of the best Glacio main DPS in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>. </p> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">But as you might imagine, he needs the right build and team to put on a performance worthy of his fame. To help you show all the might of the Liondance Troupe, here’s the best Lingyang build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The best weapon for Lingyang in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">As you might imagine, the best weapon for Lingyang is the 5-star<strong> Abyss Surges</strong>. The only 5-star gauntlet in the game, the weapon will increase his Energy Regen by 12.8% —and thus the availability of his Resonance Liberation buffs. Abyss Surges will also provide him with a 10% Basic Attack DMG Bonus increase after he hits targets with his Resonance Skill, and vice versa. The DMG buffs will last for eight seconds and are independent. All of the values here are related to the weapon at Rank 1. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Best 4-star and F2P weapons for Lingyang</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true">The best 4-star weapon for Lingyang is the Battle Pass-exclusive<strong> Stonard</strong>. The weapon clinches the spot thanks to its Crit Rate substat. Stonard will also provide him with an 18% Resonance Liberation DMG boost after he performs his Skill (R1). I know the latter won’t help much, but is better than nothing. </p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">If you don’t plan on getting the BP, the best 4-star pick for Lingyang is Hollow Mirage. The weapon has a high attack value (412 plus a 30.3% ATK% substat) and will allow Lingyang to get a 9% ATK and DEF buff after performing his Resonance Liberation. Once active, the value of the buff will decrease by 3% with each hit received by him. To recap, here are the best weapons for Lingyang, as well as the best F2P pick for him as an extra:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Weapon Name</th><th data-align="center">Main Substat</th><th data-align="center">Reason Why</th><th data-align="center">How to Get</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Abyss Surges</td><td data-align="center">ATK</td><td data-align="center">Offers an ER buff, massive ATK, and two great 10% FMG boosts.</td><td data-align="center">Gacha</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stonard</td><td data-align="center">Crit Rate</td><td data-align="center">Crit Rate substat.</td><td data-align="center">Battle Pass</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hollow Mirage</td><td data-align="center">ATK</td><td data-align="center">Massive ATK increase. </td><td data-align="center">Gacha</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Gauntlets#21D (Best F2P pick)</td><td data-align="center">Energy Regen</td><td data-align="center">Offers a good ATK value and a 50% counter DMG buff. Allows Lingyang to heal by 5% HP after performing counters, dashes, and dodges (6s CD). </td><td data-align="center">Mainly by crafting.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 id="h-best-sonata-and-echoes-for-lingyang" data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Lingyang</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="767" data-injectable="true">The best Sonata for Lingyang is a <strong>5-echo Freezing Frost</strong>. The Sonata feels handmade for him and will offer a 10% Glacio DMG Bonus boost. You will also be able to increase the buff by a total of 30% by performing Basic and Heavy Attacks. Echo-wise, <strong>Lampylumen Myriad </strong>is my main pick for the main slot given its ability to offer an up to 12% boost in both Glacio and Resonance Skill DMG. For the remaining spots. I recommend going with two Elites and two Common echoes. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Best stats and substats </h3> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">I recommend going with Crit Rate as the main stat for the Lampylumen Myriad. This is a must, as Lingyang demands that you raise the stat to at least 50%. For the remaining echoes, go with two pairs of Resonance DMG Bonus (in this case Glacio) and ATK. For substats, prioritize Crit Rate, Crit DMG, ATK, and Basic Attack DMG Bonus, in that order. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Teams for Lingyang in Wuthering Waves </h2> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true">The best team for Lingyang in<em> Wuthering Waves</em> has him as its main DPS and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sanhua-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanhua</a> as its main support/sub-DPS. Sanhua is a game changer for Lingyang, as her 38% Basic Attack DMG Deepen buff takes his damage to a whole new plane. If you don’t have her, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortefi </a>can fill in and do okay given his ability to buff Heavy Attacks and deal off-the-field DMG. </p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">For the remaining spot in the composition, we will go with either<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Baizhi </a>or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-verina-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verina</a> as our healer. Keep in mind that Verina is by far the best between them, as she will provide significantly more healing while also offering more buffs. She can also revive teammates while at RS0. </p>

  <p id="adKaSF"><a href="https://www.gamesforchange.org/">Games for Change</a>, a leading <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/31/17411916/games-for-change-awards-2018-g4c-nominees">progressive voice in gaming</a>, spent 2023 getting way into tabletop. Now it’s back for the summer convention circuit with the <a href="https://festival.gamesforchange.org/">Games for Change Festival</a> in New York City, held this year from June 27 to 28. It will also award the second annual <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23778937/games-for-change-board-game-award-nominations-ceremony">Best Board or Tabletop Game for Impact Award</a>. Polygon has an exclusive look at the exceptional finalists, plus details of an extraordinary panel to be hosted by yours truly.</p>
<p id="ChLchQ">“We made the decision last year to expand our programming and our awards category to include [...] analog games to the Festival for the first time,” said Games for Change president Susanna Pollack. “I feel like this is something that has been [inquired about] for years, and we felt that the momentum and enthusiasm had grown so much that we really would be remiss if we ignored the demand.”</p>
<p id="dsp5tS">The global tabletop games industry clearly got the message, as Pollack said submissions were up 71% compared to 2023. Three finalists, described below, were selected by a jury chosen by Games for Change. The program’s partner, Hasbro, will make the final selection.</p>
<p id="k907js">“This program beautifully showcases the ability for designers to connect people through a shared love of games,” said Brian Baker, senior vice president and global play lead of board games at Hasbro. “The creativity demonstrated by the applicants was truly impressive. Crafting an engaging game is already a challenge, but the added dimension of tackling social issues inherent in this program makes the submissions even more inspiring.”</p>
<p id="uxhwuq">Here are the finalists, which will all be available to play during the <a href="https://festival.gamesforchange.org/">Games for Change Festival</a>:</p>

<p id="wrgemq">“We were really impressed by how deep the research was, and the partnerships that went into designing the game,” said Pollack. “They’ve also partnered with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They represent the domain experts, and to have that kind of expertise in the design process from the beginning is a model that we certainly advocate for. [...] The integrity of the data and the information that was infused in what is a beautifully designed game [...] helps incorporate a complicated issue of climate change in a way that feels personal. That balance is not always easy to achieve.”</p>

<p id="qrSk20">A print-and-play card game, <em>Empiric Pediatrics 2023</em> is intended to help medical students learn about antibiotics. Residents and practicing physicians can also keep up with their own continuing education thanks to the platform’s regular updates across multiple disciplines. </p>
<p id="RPPyu9">“There is a need for, and a real interest in, finding creative ways [...] to infuse [games] into learning opportunities for higher education, and in specific disciplines,” Pollack said. “The traditional methods of study and memorization in the field of medicine is effective [...] but the opportunity to create these game-like learning tools, for us, is a great application of games and game design into different sectors. The team behind <em>Empiric Pediatrics</em> [...] demonstrated this really well, and also demonstrated the scalability of this model to other fields.”</p>

<p id="GcSxME">Martinez’s playful, colorful design is both modular and semi-cooperative. In it, players work together to solve the problems of the city that they share. It’s intended to promote civics and a focus on citizen-driven urban solutions.</p>
<p id="klJb2Z">“<em>Trilhas Urbanas</em> translates into <em>Urban Trails</em>,” Pollack said. “It allows players to problem solve with a community focus. [...] There’s this wonderful critical thinking and problem solving [through] what can be framed as social emotional skills that are involved and can empower youth in urban areas. [...] There’s also this super fun approach of how you can configure the board, [...] so there’s this high replay value and how you can shape the board and that is an attractive feature as well.”</p>
<p id="92QmoU">In a further expansion of the <a href="https://festival.gamesforchange.org/">Games for Change Festival</a>, I will also be participating on behalf of Polygon this year.

                <p>Silent Hill creator Keiichirō Toyoma and Bokeh Game Studio's debut horror game, Slitterhead, will launch on November 8 for PC, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>A new gameplay trailer was <a href="https://x.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1799082333582344354" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaked early</a> and revealed the release date. The trailer shows an interesting mix of concepts. It's set in Japan with supernatural creatures, reminiscent of Ghostwire: Tokyo. However, instead of first-person, Slitterhead is in third-person. You can also possess what seem to be NPCs to fight against supernatural creatures in a similar manner to the Dishonored games.</p><p>It appears to play like a third-person action-adventure game where you can swap between different characters on the fly while in combat, similar to the Final Fantasy VII Remake games.

Slitterhead reunites Toyoma with Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka, whose most-memorable work may be the Silent Hill 2 music.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-has-reportedly-removed-the-8k-logo-from-its-playstation-5-boxes.892521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/sony-has-reportedly-removed-8k-logo-from-its-playstation-5-boxes/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sony-has-reportedly-removed-8k-logo-from-its-playstation-5-boxes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Sony has reportedly removed the 8K logo from its PlayStation 5 boxes. The PS5 box has been displaying the 8K logo ever since the console’s release in 2020. It only took the company four years to remove claims about the (so far) non-existent feature of the console.</p> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">The change was spotted by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingnews/comments/1d812nx/sony_removed_the_claims_of_ps5_being_able_to_do/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> user (reported first by <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/06/05/ps5-box-8k-claim-removed/">PlayStation Lifestyle</a>), who posted images of two PS5 boxes in comparison, where one had the 8K logo but it was missing from the updated PS5 box.</p> <figure data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">Sony’s <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/11/09/ps5-the-ultimate-faq/">FAQ blog</a> in 2020 mentioned that the 8K display would arrive later with a system software update, but four years later, an update that enables this functionality for the PS5 is still missing. Sony senior vice president Naomi Matsuoka reportedly said earlier in February this year, that the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-says-the-ps5-is-entering-the-latter-stage-of-its-life-cycle/">PS5 has entered the “latter stages” of its life cycle</a>. With PS5 now out for four years, and apparently entering its twilight years, the 8K resolution might not be arriving for the PS5 after all.</p>
 <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">However, fans believe that the long-rumoured PS5 Pro might receive 8K resolution as one of the features, which may explain why Sony has decided to remove the label from PS5 so that the PS5 Pro can be marketed as an 8K supported console instead. While the situation is upsetting for PlayStation users, the feeling is likely mutual for Xbox Series X owners as well. Microsoft also claims that the Xbox Series X supports 8K display as well, but the feature is similarly locked behind a system update.</p>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">As it stands, the 8K display is not on the standard PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X console. Given that the 8K display resolution has not become mainstream in gaming or entertainment, and with few 8K TVs on the market, it seems like it will be some time before 8K becomes a household name like 4K is at the moment.</p>

<p data-characters="326" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the announcement of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-adds-throwing-knives-and-the-very-first-vehicle-customizations-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Viper Commandos Warbond for <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, developer Arrowhead Game Studios revealed that it would be slowing down the rate at which it releases Warbonds. This is because it wants to ensure they’re ready and polished when they hit the game, but all players want is more tools of destruction. </p> <p data-characters="596" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-rave-about-its-battle-pass-warbond-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warbonds are <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s battle passes</a>. Each one adds a collection of gear and weapons for players to purchase with in-game currency, but they never include new Stratagems. While they bulk up the number of items players can pick up for their Helldivers in future missions, they aren’t as meaningfully impactful as the new Stratagems that are only ever sparingly shared out over time, usually through Major Orders. Players are happy the developer will take more time to avoid Warbond weapons breaking the game, but ideally, they want a larger and more lethal arsenal of deployables.</p>
 <h2 id="h-players-are-happy-with-a-slower-warbond-rollout-but-want-more-stratagems-to-spice-up-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">Players are happy with a slower Warbond rollout but want more Stratagems to spice up <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">The roster of Stratagems in <em>Helldivers 2</em> has barely changed since the game was initially released in February 2024. Over time and through the completion of Major Orders, players have <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-mock-the-games-fragile-mechs-and-manufacturer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlocked new ones like the Exosuit mechs</a>, but the selection available to unlock and play around with is still pretty limited, especially if you’ve been playing since day one. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="810" data-injectable="true">On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d9hibh/warbonds_will_release_less_frequently_from_now_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit</a>, players have expressed how happy they are with Warbonds being more spread out, but they also can’t help but emphasize how important more Stratagems would be to them. User Kelevelin sums it all up saying, “I care more about stratagems tbh.” User Gilmore75’s response perfectly echoes what most of us are thinking at this point. “Same. I want even more boom. Give us that bomber that Pilested teased a while back. I want even larger airstrikes.”</p>
 <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">It’s not that the Stratagems in <em>Helldivers 2</em> are bad. Being able to call in a bomb so giant it blows up half the map or an array of weapons that allow you to burn and cut through hordes of enemies as they relentlessly march toward you and your squad feels incredible. But four months down the line, most of us have unlocked all the available Stratagems and are hungry for new ones that will mix up the loadouts we can play with. </p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">We’ve had roughly one new Warbond per month since the game’s release. But as user unicornlocostacos explains, “If they did more Stratagems, and just released new weapons when they had a good idea, that’d be better. Right now, it feels like we have a ton of weapons, but I wouldn’t use most of them.”</p> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true">I couldn’t agree more. There are dozens of great weapons to master in<em> Helldivers 2</em>, but the Stratagems are what make missions so dynamic and enjoyable. I’d prefer to see four completely unique loadouts in every mission rather than four Helldivers rocking the same armor, primary, and secondary weapons any day. </p>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">Arrowhead Game Studios putting more work into adding new ones to the game over putting even more work into Warbonds would be no bad thing, and it would certainly earn the developer a lot of points with everyone in the game’s community. </p>

<p data-characters="310" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The end of <em>Eden Zero</em> draws near. After a couple more chapters, Shiki Granbell will have finished his grand quest — concluding Hiro Mashima’s space odyssey. To avoid spoilers, I’ll leave out direct story elements from this article. Here is everything to know regarding <em>Edens Zero</em> chapter 291. </p> <h2 id="h-when-does-edens-zero-chapter-291-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Edens Zero chapter 291 come out? </h2> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">According to <em><a href="https://kmanga.kodansha.com/title/10004/episode/351989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weekly Shonen Magazine</a></em>, <em>Edens Zero</em> chapter 291 releases June 11, 2024. As a part of Weekly Shonen Magazine, Eden Zero’s new chapter release date is the day a new magazine issue drops. The speculated release time is 8 am PST, which aligns with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/edens-zero-chapter-290-release-date-time-and-what-to-expect/">previous week’s release</a>. </p> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">Weekly Shonen Magazine is released every <strong>Wednesday</strong> in Japan, which is Tuesday in the United States. Therefore, as long as there are no unscheduled delays, the <em>Edens Zero</em> chapter 291 release date is on June 11. </p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">For those wanting to read the new chapter for free on the official website, you can check in on the <a href="https://kmanga.kodansha.com/title/10004/episode/351989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kmanga’s official site</a> on <strong>June 16, 2024</strong>. This is five days after its initial release. You can also read it as part of a volume set 29, which releases on <strong>June 25, 2024</strong>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What to expect</h2> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true">Speculating from the volume 29 release date, it seems we have three more chapters left before <em>Eden Zero </em>ends. This includes chapter 291, putting the last chapter at chapter 293. Rather than prolonging the series’ life, like how he did with <em>Fairy Tail</em>, Hiro Mashima is approaching <em>Edens Zero </em>closer to how he approached <em>Rave Master</em>. In essence, he’s going for a concise story rather than a drawn-out one. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">EDENS ZERO manga will end in 5 more chapters, in Shonen Magazine issue 29</p>— Shonen Magazine News (@WSM_manga) <a href="https://twitter.com/WSM_manga/status/1791754821415965022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="false">Even after <em>Edens Zero</em> ends, fans will likely see many of the characters again in the near future. Hiro Mashima has a tendency to recycle character designs and concepts in his future series. Therefore, although we will soon have to say goodbye to the series, we may not have to bid our farewells to all the characters. </p>

<p>Titled "Farewell Penacony", the update will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-22-release-date">follow on from May's Version 2.2</a>&nbsp;and will launch on June 19th. It'll see the crew of the Astral Express soaring into the skies above Penacony to board the Radiant Feldspar and watch the Family try to fix its issues.</p>
<p>The Trailblaze Mission in Version 2.3 will revolve around "crucial Family discussions", but the Radiant Feldspar has other delights to offer as well, including a new Origami Birds minigame and gameplay improvements courtesy of Mr. Screwllum's new "Divergent Universe" project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.3-release-date-new-characters.jpg?itok=TKuDWPle 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.3-release-date-new-characters.jpg?itok=AwMugRlC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jade and Firefly will make their debut in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.3.</figcaption></figure><p>Two new five-star characters will also make their debut during&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.3.</p>
<p>The first, Jade, is a Quantum-type character with a unique "Debt Collector" mechanic. She can appoint one of her party members as her Debt Collector, and any attack launched by Jade or her designated Collector charges a meter. Once that meter is full, Jade launches an additional attack against all enemies.</p>
<p>The second five-star character in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.3 is Firefly, who can summon her SAM armor in battle. You'll even get an internal perspective within the mech's cockpit, which is a pretty impressive extra.</p>
<p>Two extra five-star characters will also make a return in Version 2.3.

            <p>
Civilization 7 has seemingly leaked ahead of a possible reveal this weekend.
</p>
<p>
A banner for the game was spotted on the 2K website and shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1da8hse/civilization_vii_banner_up_early_in_2k_website/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-vii-leaked-in-2k-games-website.892344/">Resetera</a>, though has since been removed. The banner is little more than a logo, so no further details about the game are known.
</p>
<p>
Last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-to-reveal-new-game-in-one-of-its-biggest-and-most-beloved-franchises-next-month">2K stated it would reveal a new game</a> in one of its "biggest and most beloved" franchises, causing fans to speculate.

<p>
Some believed a new Borderlands was on the way, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">Gearbox was acquired by Take-Two Interactive</a> from Embracer. Plus, there's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-first-look-shows-red-haired-cate-blanchett-staring-into-a-manhole">Borderlands film</a> due out in August this year.

</p>
<p>
Another possible reveal was a new Mafia game, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">Mafia 3 developer Hangar 13 confirming work was underway</a> back in August 2022.

</p>
<p>
Others thought a new BioShock would be on the way, since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-in-development-at-new-2k-studio-cloud-chamber">2K confirmed a game was in development</a> years back.

</p>
<p>
Now, though, it seems these guesses were incorrect and Civilization is likely the planned reveal.
</p>
<p>
The sixth game in the Civilization series released in 2016, so it's been some time since the strategy game series made headlines.
</p>
<p>
Civ 6 was well-received, so expectations will be high for the seventh. "Civ 6 harnesses the series' great strengths and adds wonderful new features of its own in an accessible and compelling entry," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-6-review">Eurogamer Civilization 6 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/subscriptions-journalism-and-you/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Over the last week, </em>Remap<em> turned one. It's shocking to realize it's been a full year since Waypoint imploded, but it was also amazing that </em>Waypoint<em> even managed to survive nearly seven years under </em>VICE<em>. But </em>Waypoint<em> arrived into a media environment that was very different from the current one. Tons of media jobs are going away, and it's unclear how many are coming back. None of us got into this line of work wanting to run a business, yet suddenly, here we are!</em></p><p><em>Is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? How do we create pipelines for new talent? What does it mean to scale a business like this? Rob and Patrick don't have all the answers, but one year into </em>Remap<em>, they're trying to figure it out.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> It’s hard to overstate how bleak I find the prospect of Ziff-Davis-owned IGN buying up all the Gamer Network websites. <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun </em>was a formative website for me, probably the last site I read truly religiously before embarking on this as a career. <em>Eurogamer</em> has maintained the highest quality bar for consumer reviews I’ve seen in games, an accomplishment I’ve come to appreciate more having been on both sides of the editing and writing dynamic. It was hard to imagine that those websites would not be seriously diminished under Ziff management, and of course within an hour of the news breaking we saw <em>GI.biz</em>’s Brendan Sinclair and <em>RPS</em>’s Alice Bell posting that they had been laid-off. It was probably the fastest I have ever seen an acquisition transform into the process of throwing people out of their jobs.</p><p>As you always see around stories like this, you see a lot of folks wondering what they can do and talking about the importance of supporting independent outlets, or subscriber-supported media. Obviously as someone in that line of work, I’m always happy to see people have that impulse. It’s cool that people want to know how they can help at a time when we are daily witnessing the hollowing-out of media.</p><p>But I always feel a bit uncomfortable when I see people saying stuff like, “...and that’s why people should support places like <em>Remap</em>!” the face of layoffs like this. Because much as I’d like to pretend otherwise, I know how far we are from being able to replicate a fraction of what an <em>IGN</em>, or a <em>Eurogamer</em>, or even an <em>RPS </em>can do.</p><p><em>Remap </em>is three people plus some contractors and contributors, all of whom do work that almost immediately turns into outcomes that our audience can see. If I were feeling grandiose I’d say that it’s a "lean operation" where every penny goes to pay or gets reinvested in the business. However, that would be masking another reality: <em>Remap </em>does not have a ton of <em>capacity</em>. The reason we operate this way is because we don’t have the kind of margins where we can pay for work and time that doesn’t translate into some kind of immediate output. That’s not because the audience is putting us under any real pressure to deliver, but because we mostly have enough on our hands doing a handful of podcasts and streams a week, plus the odd article. When we are recording, there is no other work getting done at <em>Remap</em>. If we are investing time in looking at one game release for the podcast that week, that means there’s a bunch of others that are necessarily being ignored. To deliver any kind of meaningful journalistic or critical coverage of the industry would require having enough people available to get a lot of work done in parallel to the main stuff <em>Remap </em>does. And by the way, that kind of work is harder and frequently more time intensive.</p><p>That's where scale becomes a real challenge in subscriber-supported journalism. It’s not like it’d be “double the size of <em>Remap</em>” or “increase <em>Remap</em>’s freelance budget.” Covering an industry as a reporter is not a thing that can be done very easily on a part-time or piece-by-piece commission basis. It’s a job where someone is tasked with research and reporting every day, and that work might not generate a good story out of it for weeks, months, or ever. A lot of that work results in answers to questions about minutiae that aren’t of interest outside a fraction of the audience… but it’s important work that also enables more ambitious and widely-read pieces of journalism. Ditto a reviews desk: even if you’re relying a lot on strong freelance contributors, planning, coordinating, and editing all that coverage is a full-time job at minimum. Probably it’s more than a single full-time job to take it from “viable” to “good.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>The future if Remap gets ten thousand new subscribers. Don't worry about what happens later in the movie. Doesn't this look like fun?</span></figcaption></figure><p>If I tell people to subscribe to <em>Remap</em>, I’m optimistically hoping for some good linear growth. If we got a hundred new subscribers last month, it’d be truly <em>amazing</em> to get a hundred and ten this month. That would be an astonishing growth trend for a company like ours! But to replicate the functions of a major games website, we’d be talking about <em>thousands</em> of new subscribers funding something where it won’t always be obvious what their money is buying. “Hey thanks for subscribing, you’ve enabled us to have a reporter go beat their heads against walls five days a week, and an expensive legal insurance policy to let them actually write something, plus there’s now an accountant you’ll never hear about doing expense tracking so nobody ever has to interact with Concur, the Wage Theft Legalization Software.”</p><p>That’s a hard sell! It’s such a hard sell that it basically explains why all this stuff has historically depended on the ad model. In a nutshell, good journalism and criticism depends on people doing a lot of work that most people appreciate in the abstract or the aggregate, but would rarely purchase directly. Making the jump from “hey support this handful of creators” to “support this expensive and increasingly abstract enterprise” feels like going from building a biplane to landing on the moon for a business like ours.</p><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I recently hosted a panel at Northwestern University, and at the end, I was chatting with a few folks who were trying to pursue jobs in games media. I found myself at a complete loss at what to describe as their path forward. “Simply be like me and spend 20+ years gaining knowledge, experience, and fans who will then pay you to continue working” is not a viable option. Go on YouTube, I guess? It’s probably the most realistic answer, because it’s probably where the future of most games commentary is headed.&nbsp;</p><p>But is commentary and analysis the same as being a member of the media? Am I just an elitist? Probably.</p><p>When the latest round of media layoffs were happening in the leadup to our own, I tried to calm my nerves with a sense of history, a history you and I have experienced over the decades. This has happened before, this will happen again. Layoffs are brutal but cyclical. People love games, so there will be publications to cover games. And that’s probably still true in the most basic senses, but in what form?&nbsp;</p><p>I don't even know what a “website” is anymore. We spent money to build one, but we’re slowly waiting for <em>VICE </em>to delete <em>Waypoint</em>’s history from the internet. The function of a website in the past was to, hopefully, become a homepage for someone. Ours is functionally an archive. I think it’s possible for us to track how often people are visiting the website, but I haven’t looked at any of that data since we launched the website. But I have to admit one of my favorite tiny little joys every day is going into our database, publishing articles for the podcasts and articles and videos we’ve done, and arranging the promotional wheel at the top. Our work is scattered across so many places because that’s just how modern media publishing works, but it’s so satisfying to see it arranged nearly. It helps me more fully appreciate our work.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday</span></figcaption></figure><p>People still think of me as a reporter, I think, but the “Scoops” nickname is less and less applicable these days, because I simply do not have the bandwidth to do meaningful reporting. I still like talking to game developers, I still like unpacking the creative process. I like to think that my time in the industry has given me some insight that’s useful on Remap Radio. I do not know if the interviews we publish on the podcast are everyone’s favorite thing that we do, but it makes me really happy, and lets me pretend I’m still living in a world where reporting, my bread and butter, is also paying the bills, and so I can live with the difference.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that’s what comes to mind when I work through these meta trends, though. For all the faults of mega sites like <em>IGN</em>, <em>GameSpot</em>, and the like, they provided opportunities for new writers to learn the craft and go elsewhere. That “elsewhere” might not have even been in games journalism, but applying the lessons of writing and communication “elsewhere” in video games. We can pay freelancers and contractors good rates, but at our current scale, it's hard to be a proper funnel for the next generation of critics.</p><p>We're not the only ones in this space and maybe some of our peers have better answers to the questions around expansion. But from my perspective, outlets like ours are like life rafts to help maintain an identity that, thankfully, some find important. But that also makes it hard to grow. </p>

<p id="GejVwt">Weighing in with just 1,082 pieces, the Lego AT-TE walker is the smaller, Clone Wars-era predecessor to the AT-AT. It may be a fraction of the size of the massive AT-AT replica, but the AT-TE still features plenty of neat details like a modeled cockpit and an array of pivoting turrets.

The leak suggests an announcement at Summer Game Fest today, June 7. 2K is yet to comment.</p><p>In May, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2k-games-teases-sequel-reveal-summer-game-fest-bioshock-borderlands">Summer Game Fest said</a> 2K Games would reveal the "next iteration in one of its biggest and most beloved franchises" during the show. The tease instantly got fans speculating on the possibilities, with many wondering whether BioShock 4 would finally be revealed after a five year wait. Others suggested it might be Mafia 4 or Borderlands 4. It seems likely now that the tease is related to Civilization 7.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SummerGameFest</a> on Friday, June 7. <a href="https://t.co/1vyFXE2N4z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z</a></p>— Summer Game Fest (@summergamefest) <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1791201250521825718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Sid Meier's Civilization 6</a> was developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K on PC in 2016, before ports for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and mobile were released. IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/26/sid-meiers-civilization-vi-review">Civ 6 review</a> returned a 9.4. We said: "Civilization 6 is fully loaded with features and makes some very smart changes to its winning 4X strategy formula."</p><p>Given the game’s enormous popularity (Civ 6 remains in the top 20 most-played games on Steam and the franchise has sold an impressive 71 million copies to date), a seventh entry in the long-running series was inevitable. Indeed, in February last year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-civilization-game-officially-announced-by-firaxis">Firaxis announced it was working on the next mainline Civ</a>, although it didn't call it Civ 7 at the time.</p><p>That’s all we have to go on for now, with more sure to be revealed during Summer Game Fest.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
