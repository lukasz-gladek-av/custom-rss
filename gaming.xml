            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>11 Bit Studios has announced the console launch date for Frostpunk 2, which will arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles on <strong>September 18, 2025</strong>. </p>



<p>While the release date was announced with a new trailer for the console's launch, it seems like the news has accidentally gone live early, since the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whxlgvwTZIk"> trailer published to YouTube is now set to private</a>. That doesn't mean you can't see the trailer elsewhere, since it was still downloaded and published by others before it was private.</p>



<p>And to match the fact that Frostpunk 2 is available in Xbox Game Pass for PC, it'll be available in Xbox Game Pass for console players when it launches in September.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Frostpunk 2 | Console Date Reveal Trailer</p><p>Coming to Day One on Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on September 18th, 2025 <a href="https://t.co/oOaop5H5ow">pic.twitter.com/oOaop5H5ow</a></p></div>— VGT Gaming News (@GAMERNEWSonX) <a href="https://twitter.com/GAMERNEWSonX/status/1948392802900979880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Along with the console launch, there are still <a href="https://wccftech.com/11-bit-studios-reveals-revised-roadmap-for-frostpunk-2-console-ports-arriving-in-summer/">two more DLC expansions </a>currently scheduled to arrive before the end of this year as part of a previously revealed roadmap for the game, and a third, unnamed DLC set to arrive in 2026.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate for 11 Bit Studios that an announcement which seemingly wasn't meant to go live today has done so, but exciting for console players who have been eagerly awaiting its arrival on PS5 and Xbox Series devices since the game first launched on PC last September to strong reviews. </p>



<p>Wccftech's Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/">adored it when he reviewed it last year</a>, writing, "<em>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others."</em></p>

                <p>One battle royale after another. After prolific <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-cel-shaded-superman-looks-incredible/1100-6532550/" data-ref-id="1100-6532550">crossovers with Superman</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantastic-four-nikes-are-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6533214/" data-ref-id="1100-6533214">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a>, Fortnite appears to be gearing up for a collaboration with the film One Battle After Another. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the upcoming thriller, slated for a September 26 theatrical release, isn't what anyone would consider fodder for Fortnite, making this crossover all the more intriguing.</p><p>The official Instagram account for the film put out a brief teaser, recreating a scene from the movie in which DiCaprio's character (replaced by Fortnite protagonist Jonesy in this teaser video) answers a covert call at a phone booth. "There are no hands on the clock. #OneBattleAfterAnother x Fortnite coming soon," the video's caption reads.</p><p>It's unclear what kind of content will come out of this collaboration, including whether it will take the form of skins based on the movie's characters or any missions given by NPCs on the battle royale map. Perhaps it'll be a Fortnite Creative experience with the purpose of promoting the film, but it's hard to imagine what that would look like.</p><p>One Battle After Another follows DiCaprio's character, an ex-revolutionary, reuniting with other fellow activists after an old enemy of theirs reemerges. The film also stars Sean Penn as the film's antagonist and Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, and Teyana Taylor in supporting roles.</p><p>The possibility of playing as Leonardo DiCaprio or Sean Penn in Fortnite is pretty hysterical. Now it's hard not to imagine characters from Anderson's extensive filmography joining the fray-- picture Barry Egan from Punch-Drunk Love or Dirk Diggler from Boogie Nights wielding a pickaxe and running alongside a humanoid fish and a banana with limbs.</p><p>In the meantime, Fortnite studio Epic Games is still trying to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epics-plan-to-get-fortnite-back-on-ios-has-hit-a-snag-in-the-uk/1100-6533394/" data-ref-id="1100-6533394">get the title playable on iOS in the UK</a>. This comes after an extended legal battle that resulted in Fortnite's return to the US iOS App Store and the Epic Games Store in the EU iOS App Store.</p>

Some, like this writer, are still fairly early on in DK's latest outing, whilst others, such as our very own Liam Doolan, are already done with the thing. No messing around there!</p>
<p>Now, very mild spoilers ahead, but by way of some of the old 'water-cooler' banter (proving once and for all that such a thing can even exist betwixt online colleagues), Liam shared with us that he'd actually managed to complete the game without unlocking one of Donkey Kong's transformations.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Further to this, he hasn't even completed one of the layers. He skipped the entire frozen area of the game. All that lovely snow!</p>
<p>After a quick look online, and it seems Nintendo Life's crack squad of pro gamers aren't the only ones finding lots of new ways to beat the game and/or skip things in the name of speedrunning. On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1m2ud1r/you_can_completely_skip_freezer_layer_and_zebra/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">r/DonkeyKong</a>, people are already sharing Liam's trick, along with a whole bunch of other ways to beat the game quickly.</p>

<p>Some of these techniques can be a little spoilery, so take care.</p>
<p>The video below, meanwhile, gives an indication of the sorts of things gamers are already doing in terms of mechanics, rather than simply skipping things.</p>
<p>There's some real potential here, as this post exclaims, as the Bananza transformations can be freely switched between once engaged. As seen in the vid, entire areas can be avoided if you use the right moves at the right time.</p>

<p>Another post on the forum claims to have only unlocked two of the five total Bananza transformations in the game, so we can only imagine that there's plenty more shenanigans ahead in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>We're genuinely feeling quite tired just considering trying some of this stuff. Whatever happened to just taking your sweet time, y'know?</p>

			<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6ogkWkxq1HusqpqGtQvCpn/assassins-creed-shadows-summer-roadmap-update">announced</a> its summer update for the Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap, including the reveal that new game plus is getting added to the game next week, the player level cap is getting an increase, and the Claws of Awaji DLC is launching on <strong>September 16, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>As far as what's coming next week, on July 29, 2025, Ubisoft is pushing an update for Assassin's Creed Shadows that will add new game plus, a level cap increase from 60 to 80, and some new Animus-related collectibles, and the arrival of Project 3. For new game plus, it'll be available once you've played through the final story mission and seen the credits roll, and all your gear, hideout progression, skill points, and character level will stay the same when starting a new game plus run. Discovered location, objective, and storyboard progression will all be reset. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Later in the summer in August, Ubisoft will push another update that adds a few quality of life updates players have been asking for, like being able to unfog the entire map by synchronizing every viewpoint in the game, and for PC players, Ubisoft is uncapping the framerate in cutscenes, so the game won't be swapping back and forth between a capped and uncapped framerate. Ubisoft is also giving players the chance to voice their concerns and feedback directly to the development team, with a Reddit AMA set for August 12, 2025.</p>



<p>The last highlight of today's announcement is the Claws of Awaji release date, set for September 16, 2025. This is also when a few more quality of life updates will go live, like being able to swap the time of day on the fly, and plenty of new gear rarities and equipment that'll come alongside the DLC.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Ubisoft celebrated Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-5-million-players-ubisoft-lower-performance/">hitting 5 million players</a> since launch, amid one of the company's other major franchises, Rainbow Six Siege, performing below expectations.</p>

That movie was independently produced and then picked up by Disney, and went on to become a big hit, spawning 14 sequels and spin-offs. Yes. That’s not a typo. There have been 14 follow-ups to a movie about a dog that plays basketball. Weirdly, most of them have nothing to do with basketball. </p><p><em>Air Bud Returns</em> is being written and directed by Robert Vince. He was a producer on the original <em>Air Bud</em> film in the ‘90s and then produced all 14 sequels, as well as writing and directing 10 of them.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-bud-returns-aint-no-rule-says-a-dog-cant-release-another-movie-302512830.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-bud-returns-aint-no-rule-says-a-dog-cant-release-another-movie-302512830.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s the official synopsis of the upcoming movie</a></span>, which is set to start filming this summer in British Columbia, Canada: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> In <em>Air Bud Returns</em>, 12-year-old Jacob has always dreamt of being a star basketball player. After the passing of his father, that dream felt even more impossible. But everything changes when he and his mom move into his dad’s childhood home in Fernfield. There, Jacob discovers an original VHS of the <em>Air Bud</em> movie in his father’s belongings and has a chance meeting of a stray golden retriever he names Buddy. Together they embark on a journey of healing, unite a team of misfits, and chase a championship. Through it all they learn to play from the heart, believe in each other, and always take the shot!</p></blockquote><p> “<em>Air Bud Returns</em> isn’t just another sequel or remake—it’s a unique story,” said Vince in a press release. “This movie will engage nostalgic <em>Air Bud </em>fans while introducing a new generation to the beloved basketball-playing golden retriever, Buddy. It builds upon the legacy of the OG <em>Air Bud</em> with all the fun, the magic, heartwarming scenes, and Buddy playing basketball. More than anything, it’s a deeply human story about a dog and boy, centered on themes of adaptation, redemption, and teamwork.”</p><p>I can’t say I’m excited for a new <em>Air Bud </em>movie, as the previous films have all been low-quality, straight-to-DVD garbage made on the cheap in an effort to milk a decades-old franchise. But hey, maybe this one will be good. Or not. There’s not a damn thing I can do to influence that. The universe is a chaotic place that can’t be controlled by any one person. Events happen. We live through them. <em>Air Bud Returns </em>hits theaters next year. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/air-bud-returns-air-bud-15-new-film-2026-poster-teaser-1851786906]]></content:encoded>

A multiplayer reveal is set for next week, where we'll get a sample of the game's new and returning modes, as well as how Battlefield's iconic classes will look in this new modern skirmish.</p><h2>How to watch the Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_BRbvYxgOY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c_BRbvYxgOY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will be livestreamed on Battlefield's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube </a>and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> channels. Following the showcase, which will feature developers from Battlefield Studios, viewers will be able to watch press and content creators play the game's new multiplayer suite live.</p><h2>Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal start times</h2><p>Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will kickoff at 11:30 AM PT / 2:30 PM ET on July 31.</p><ul><li>11:30 AM PDT</li><li>2:30 PM EDT</li><li>7:30 PM BST</li><li>4:30 AM AET (August 1)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>EA and Battlefield Studios have claimed that Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will showcase various elements of the multiplayer suite. Specific mention is made of new and returning modes, which lends some credibility to reports of a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">battle royale mode</a> coming to Battlefield for the first time in the franchise's history.</p><p>Besides the aforementioned battle royale mode, it is incredibly likely that the team will be showing off both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-leak-shows-off-rush-mode-and-it-looks-fantastic/1100-6532821/" data-ref-id="1100-6532821">Rush</a> and Conquest, which are arguably Battlefield's signature game modes. The former sees teams planting bombs at pairs of objectives on a small section of a much larger map. The completion of these goals unlocks another set of the map and another pair of bomb sites, until eventually the entire map is unlocked or conversely, the attackers are held off within the time limit.</p><p>Conquest is Battlefield's flagship mode, often touting each respective games' biggest player count, and features warring teams fighting over a series of points of interest in a Domination-like competition. Holding the majority of the points begins to deplete the losing team's respawn counter, which also goes down with every kill.</p><p>Given the emphasis on New York City in the game's initial reveal, a safe assumption would be that the team will show off a multiplayer map taking place there. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-teases-all-out-war-ahead-of-full-reveal/1100-6533382/" data-ref-id="1100-6533382">teaser trailer</a> ahead of the reveal also made mention of Georgia (the country) and Gibraltar, which suggests these could also be maps in the latest game. Expect to see a lot of player destruction of the environments, as well as an emphasis on urban warfare in a deliberate callback to some of Battlefield's most iconic multiplayer arenas.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has also been very open about how it's been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-add-something-close-to-an-ultimate-ability-for-each-class/1100-6533119/" data-ref-id="1100-6533119">tweaking Battlefield's classes</a> following criticism of the last major release in the franchise, Battlefield 2042. That game released with specialists, which were reminiscent of heroes in titles like Overwatch 2, and their implementation proved to be controversial to stalwart Battlefield fans, who felt like the change diluted what they loved about the tactical squad-based gameplay of the series' past. Expect to hear a lot about these changes, as well as other alterations made to character and loadout customization.</p>

Forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/enjoy-8-inches-of-lego-shadow-the-hedgehog-this-october">eight inches of Shadow the Hedgehog</a>; forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treat-yourself-to-22-inches-of-snake-with-big-boss-metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-statue">22 inches of Solid Snake</a> (until you're alone at least), and behold the terrifying majesty of Grounded 2's 10-foot ant plushie/gaming chair hybrid, which Microsoft is currently giving away to promote its upcoming sequel.
</p>
<p>
Grounded 2 is, of course, the follow-up to Obsidian Entertainment's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-review-a-delightful-mix-of-harsh-survival-and-warm-hearted-design">well-received 2022 co-op garden survival game</a>, which cast players as inadvertently miniaturised children - very much in the style of 80s movie favourite Honey, I shrunk the Kids - then set them loose in a backyard now transformed into a perilous landscape of towering blades of grass and truck-sized spiders.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian's sequel doesn't do much to shake up the fundamental premise - you're small again, but this time in a park - but that new location should hopefully spice things up, and then there are mounts. Yup, this time you can saddle up on insects and barrel around the place, bringing us back to that giant ant. Xbox's <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1948367630902931457">giveaway</a> features a monstrous plushie version of that aforementioned mount, sprawling threateningly across your gaming room floor and equipped with a little saddle you can pop your botty on, spread-eagled and ready for more survival.

One winner will walk away with (well, awkwardly shuffle away with) that 10ft gaming ant, which Microsoft officially refers to as "gaming furniture", if you were wondering.

<p>
As for Grounded 2 itself, it launches into PC early access and Xbox Series X/S "game preview" on 29th July, and our Bertie Purchase has been having a natter with Obsidian ahead of its release.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/ea-sports-fc-26-preview-hands-on-the-new-authentic-and-competitive-gameplay-modes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-fc-26-preview-%E2%80%93-hands-on-the-new-authentic-and-competitive-gameplay-modes.1252482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA is looking at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a> to be a major turning point for its football games, especially with the tagline ‘The Club is Yours.’ FC 26 is all about taking the feedback from the community of the past two FC games, as well as from the preceding FIFA games, and using that to address gameplay complaints that have persisted over the years. These are things like passing being too rigid, goalkeepers not being intelligent enough, animations not being reflective of reality, and player behaviours not meeting expectations.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GE8YCIQF2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A core change in FC 26 is splitting the gameplay into two distinct and different styles, Authentic and Competitive. Authentic has been designed to give a real match day feeling and experience, based on what you would expect to see if you are watching teams in real life, while Competitive could be considered the more arcade style of what you expect from a video game, and that reflects in where they are going to be used. Authentic has been created primarily for single-player modes whereas Competitive is for the online modes including Ultimate Team.</p>


<p>The preview build of FC 26 gave us access to the single player kick off mode featuring both the men’s and women’s UEFA Champions League – Bayern Munchen. Paris St Germain, Liverpool, and Real Madrid for the men, and OL Lyonnes, Bayern Munchen, Real Madrid, and Chelsea for the women. Given the gameplay split, I flipped back and forth between the modes using the Professional difficulty.</p>


<p>Immediately, FC 26’s Authentic setting feels heavy and slow, with player attributes, including size, having a much bigger influence here. Slow players will not sprint for long, while nimble players will have the ability to hop between defenders. But the bigger defenders can easily bully smaller players off the ball too. During my matches, you could absolutely feel when a bigger player was trying to shoulder off a smaller player, but on the flip side you learn how to avoid this situation by wrong-footing bigger players and putting space between them.</p>
<p>As this is supposed to mimic real world football, you shouldn’t expect players to be constantly going end to end. It is quite methodical in where you must place your passes and position your players, and while it is more fluid than previous FC experiences, there is still some of that rigidity. There is a slowness to it that will be appreciated by some, as you probe defences looking for that moment you can break through, or learning precisely when to go in for the tackle and when to bring your keeper out to stop a shot. Mistime these moments and the opposition will punish you.</p>
<p>In the Competitive setting, which will be used for online modes, the restrictions on players are a lot looser. Suddenly, someone like Harry Kane is a natural sprinter and can bully their way into the box, dealing with defenders with ease. This setting is much more fast paced, with the ball pinging from player to player, the action moving incredibly quickly. It will be familiar to most FC players, and it might not be what some were hoping for, because defensive play comes second to offence again.</p>

<p>There is a clear gulf between offence and defence in both modes, though the women’s game seemed better balanced than the men’s at this point. Here are the scores from the 10 matches I played:</p>
<p><strong>Authentic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real Madrid 9 – 0 Liverpool</li>
<li>Liverpool 6 – 0 Real Madrid</li>
<li>Bayern Munchen 4 – 2 Paris St-Germain</li>
<li>Chelsea 3 – 2 Bayern Munchen</li>
<li>OL Lyonnes 8 – 2 Real Madrid</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Competitive</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real Madrid 7 – 0 Liverpool</li>
<li>Liverpool 8 – 0 Real Madrid</li>
<li>Bayern Munchen 9 – 0 Paris St-Germain</li>
<li>Chelsea 10 – 2 Bayern Munchen</li>
<li>OL Lyonnes 6 – 4 Real Madrid</li>
</ul>
<p>EA has said it has reworked goalkeeping in FC 26 to be more responsive, but there still is still discrepancy between goalkeeper behaviour and attacker behaviour. While playing, I noticed that when a keeper performs well when their defensive players are near them, but fall apart in one on one situations. In one example, as Salah I cut in from the right-hand side of the box, and Courtois kind of slid past leaving the goal wide open. Goalkeepers do have some more animations compared to previous entries, and it can cause some interesting situations with this early build. In one match Allison punched the ball up into the air and did so a couple more times while still surrounded by players instead of trying to catch it. Quite an incredible flex, when you think about it. Real Allison should take notes!</p>

<p>There has been an increased focus on player individualism so each one is more distinctive, and plays more like their real life counterparts. PlayStyles make a return with players having up to six of these equipped to showcase their skills. Examples of PlayStyles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finesse Shot+ – Faster finesse shots with max curve and accuracy</li>
<li>Precision Header – Increased accuracy for headers, Precision Header animations</li>
<li>Acrobatic – Perform volleys with improved accuracy, acrobatic volley animations</li>
<li>Aerial Fortress – Higher jmpus and improved aerial defence presence</li>
<li>Trickster+ – More unique ground and flick Skill moves, quicker strafe dribbling</li>
<li>Whipped Pass – Accurate, faster crosses with more curve</li>
<li>Rapid – Higher sprint speed while dribbling, reduced error on knock ons</li>
<li>First Touch – Reduced trapping error, faster dribbling transitions</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, these seem to able to shine better in Authentic gameplay compared to Competitive, as you notice the differences between each player. Of course, these play styles will come into play in both settings and impact the way matches unfold. Archetypes are new addition to further individualise the top players in the game, and there is a setting where these players will act and react like they would in real life too.</p>
<p>From the preview build. FC 26 does show a lot of improvements over <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">FC 25</a>. Gameplay is generally better, and the split between Authentic for single player modes and Competitive for online modes while give a new variety for players that switch between the two. However, there is still work to be done on the defensive side, as it is still really easy to get through the defence and beat keepers one on one.</p>

<p>Coming January 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>NIS America has revealed that the next entry in the expansive turn-based RPG franchise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, will launch on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>15th January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This announcement follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/trails-beyond-the-horizon-slips-to-early-2026-but-its-also-coming-to-switch-2">game's delay just last month</a> from its Fall 2025 date, where the Switch 2 version — which is a Game Key-Card — was also revealed.</p>
<p>Taking place across the continent of Zemuria, Trails Beyond the Horizon is the third game in the Calvard Arc, and the 13th game in the wider Trails series. You'll control three different protagonists throughout the adventure — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak">Daybreak</a>'s lead Van Arkride, the founder of Arkride Solutions and a Spriggan; Rean Schwarzer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_of_cold_steel_iii">Cold Steel</a>'s protagonist and the Ashen Chevalier; and Kevin Graham, a high-ranking member of the Septian Church who hasn't been seen since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_to_azure">Trails to Azure</a>.</p>
<p>The game features a robust blend of turn-based and real-time combat, which legendary Japanese developer Nihon Falcom has been steadily improving over the course of the series. The game will be playable at PAX West later this year, so if you're heading there, keep an eye out for the booth!</p>
<p>Let's get a better rundown of what to expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Van Arkride and the members of Arkride Solutions are back, and this time the future of the entire Zemurian continent is at stake! The people of Zemuria await the launch of humanity's first foray into space with bated breath. A sudden invitation from Marduk to cooperate in a high-tech training exercise sets Van, Ashen Chevalier Rean Schwarzer, and Father Kevin Graham on a collision course with the secrets at the very core of Zemuria.</p>
<p>Their paths may diverge, but the ultimate question remains the same: Just what lies beyond the edge of the horizon?</p>
<p>● All Trails Lead Here: Paths from across Zemuria intertwine with higher stakes than ever before as the Trails series enters its final chapter!<br>
● Gameplay, Evolved: New gameplay mechanics such as Shard Commands,<br>
Awakening, and the time-freezing Z.O.C. give you an unprecedented amount of options in both Field and Command Battles!<br>
● Dream Teams: Gather allies from all over Calvard and beyond and put a stop to Ouroboros' machinations in the Grim Garten, a dungeon that you can take on with your own custom party!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's looking pretty fantastic, and will be an excellent way to ring in 2026 for RPG fans.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Release Date Indirectly Confirmed by Official Website]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-official-website/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-by-official-website.1252476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, renowned leaker billbill-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> details on the Battlefield 6 release date. According to the insider, the game would be released on October 10, priced at €69.99/79.99 for the Standard Edition and €99.99/109.99 for the Phantom Edition, with the PC version being €10 cheaper as with most games.</p>



<p>Today, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debut trailer</a> and the news that the reveal event would take place on July 31, eagle-eyed spotter Wario64 has already <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1948404850288427225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> some fine print on the official Battlefield 6 website that practically confirms the aforementioned release date as correct.</p>



<p>On the legal disclaimers, it is confirmed that pre-order offers will expire on October 10, which makes perfect sense if that's the game's release date. Moreover, the codes can be redeemed for two years through October 10, 2027, as with most games. If rumors are to be believed, fans should get their hands on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta test</a> much earlier than that, though, possibly in early August.</p>



<p>As to the game itself, the developers did not reveal much today, except that the bad guys are the so-called Pax Armata, a private military corporation 'bankrolled by former NATO states' whose agenda threatens to plunge the world into global conflict. This sets the stage for what players can expect on the battlefield, in both multiplayer and the series's return to a single-player campaign, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being handled by Motive Studios</a>. </p>



<p>The press release also confirms a veritable return to the core tenets of the franchise in Battlefield 6: visceral combat, epic warfare, and player freedom. Players will be able to blow through walls, bring down entire buildings, and take to the skies in dogfights for a tactical advantage, but working together with your squad will still be the secret to victory.</p>



<p>Next week, all will be revealed through a series of live events taking place in Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, and London, with another scheduled in Singapore on August 2. We'll have Kai on the ground in LA to report his first impressions on the long-awaited next chapter in the Battlefield series. Stay tuned for his hands-on!</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>will revolve around the conflict between NATO and a fictional private military company known as Pax Armata, which translates to "armed peace" in Latin. How very appropriate.</p>

<p>The new game will bring "high-intensity infantry combat", along with aerial dogfighting, tank combat, and more. Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, you'll also have the ability to destroy the environment around you "for a strategic advantage", as EA says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-revealed-destruction.jpg?itok=3tx_G83C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-revealed-destruction.jpg?itok=jxhwnGSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has officially been revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that the conflict in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>revolves around NATO and a PMC, it's safe to assume we're in for another modern setting akin to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 4</em>; basically, we're not going to get a period-piece historical warfare game along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield V&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1</em>.</p>

<p>If EA's legal disclaimers for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>are anything to go by, it looks like we can expect an October release for the game as well. As spotted by Wario64 on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3luptwxr5rh2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, pre-sell offers for the game expire on October 10th, so that's likely the release date, although it hasn't officially been announced yet.</p>

<p>That would also chime with the fact that EA has previously revealed the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game will launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">sometime before March next year</a>, as will the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">won't feature an offline mode</a>).</p>

<p>The debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>doesn't give away any gameplay, although it's fair to say we know roughly what to expect from this one if previous <i>Battlefield&nbsp;</i>games are any indication. Nevertheless, you can check out the trailer here.</p>




<p>EA has a lot to prove when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Following the player base's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/60000-battlefield-2042-players-want-their-money-back" rel="nofollow">hostile reception</a> to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, EA CEO Andrew Wilson admitted in 2022 that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-says-battlefield-needs-lot-of-work-restore-reputation" rel="nofollow">it would take "a lot of work"</a> to restore the franchise's reputation.</p>

<p>In April last year, when EA announced the end of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>seasons, the publisher also confirmed that the next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-seasons-ending" rel="nofollow">would be a co-development effort</a> between four studios: DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect.</p>

<p><i>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</i>is set to launch sometime in the future for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009568/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/battlefield-6/9p2ff14jzll3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. A multiplayer gameplay reveal is due to air next week, so stay tuned for that.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has been revealed, all official-like, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">after months of leaks</a>. And what a reveal it was, with a trailer featuring enough explosions to satisfy Michael Bay for at least two hours - though without a release date to accompany it.</p>
<p>Yep, we'll have to wait a bit longer to see if the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-release-date-appears-to-have-leaked-jumping-the-gun-ahead-of-its-reveal-trailer">October date recently cited by a prominent leaker</a> is on target, as for now all we got was a tease of the campaign that ended in promo for a multiplayer reveal next week. Which, to be fair, is a chef's kiss way to have done things if EA's aim was to be totally on brand for today's big shooters.</p>

<p>Despite the game's teaser trailer making a big deal of NATO being under attack, and featured various European cities, this trailer looked to be tapping more into the typical American jingoism both this series and its brother in big shootering Call of Duty have embraced at various points over the years. While the latter's now got Beavis and Butthead in it, this reveal was very much flying the flag for Battlefield 6 being back in its grimy, realistic modern-day military guise, at least as far as the singleplayer's concerned.</p>
<p>The game also really seems to hate helicopters, with the two-minute trailer featuring no less than four rotored birds having a bad time in various crashy and explodey ways, as things cut between cinematic action and a US president talking about an attack by the Pax Armata private military corporation. They're shaping up to be Battlefield 6's main baddies, further hinting in my eyes that it might be a bit of a 'Can you believe these mercenaries do war for money? You should do it for honour and nationalism like we do' sort of tale.</p>
<p>The trailer ended with the announcement that the game's multiplayer bit will be getting its own reveal on July 31st. That'll kick off at 7:30 PM BST / 2:30 PM ET / 11:30 AM PT / 8:30 PM CEST, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_BRbvYxgOY">link's already live</a> if you want to sit in chat for the whole week gradually typing out the lyrics to every anti-war song ever written.</p>
<p>EA promise it'll showcase some maps, as well as new and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-over-a-week-on-from-the-last-one-theres-a-fresh-battlefield-6-leak-here-that-shows-the-return-of-rush">returning modes</a> you'll be able to battle your way through the fields of. That's the same EA, of course, who are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">reportedly hoping 100 million people</a> will join you in those killing fields. Given how the trailer went, I assume that means they'll have 100 million spare helicopters on standby.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date]]></content:encoded>

That’s some of the best pricing we’ve seen outside of limited restocks, and probably your best shot at avoiding inflated third-party listings (although it's still way over MSRP).</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in today’s deals, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is $799.99 at Best Buy, which is $500 off its usual price and a great buy for an unlocked flagship. ROG Ally is also down to $499.99 with the Z1 Extreme chip and 512GB storage, which makes it one of the better portable gaming options if you want full Windows access. Soundcore P20i earbuds are just $19.98, the Anker 332 Power Strip is $15.99, and the upgraded 100W Anker Nano Charging Station is $35.99.

We're not at the custom limited edition console point of the Switch 2's life cycle yet, but this is a smart way to secure the system and save some money whilst doing it. Just preorder quickly - I'm amazed Best Buy still has it live.</p></div><p id="pokmon-legends-z-a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A">Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Switch 2)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225675"><div id="225675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This $69.99 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the Switch 1 game with the Switch 2 upgrade included. From what we've seen so far, we're talking 4K resolutions running at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second. Real-time battles, a fully explorable Lumiose City, and nighttime Z-A Royale events all benefit from the sharper visuals and faster load times. If you're already going in on a Switch 2, this is the version to get. It looks like the most technically ambitious Pokémon game yet, and Switch 2 seems to be the only way to experience it at its best.</p></div><p id="pokmon-legends-z-a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A">Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Switch 1)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225676"><div id="225676" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not ready to upgrade to a Nintendo Switch 2 yet, the Switch 1 version still has an upgrade path so you have options down the line. Legends Z-A switches things up with real-time battles, an urban setting in Lumiose City, and the full return of Mega Evolutions, including 27 new forms like Mega Dragonite. The starter picks are a nice throwback, but what really caught my attention is the Z-A Royale system and Alpha Pokémon lurking across the city at night. Add in deep trainer customization and the Switch 2 upgrade option, and it’s clear the developers are trying to evolve more than just the Pokémon this time. If it plays as good as it sounds, this could be the next real shift for the series.</p></div><p id="black-bolt-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box">Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225517"><div id="225517" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The fluxuations on this Elite Trainer Box has been crazy this week, but TCG Player finally has listings cheaper than Amazon starting at $91.50, around $20 cheaper than the big box giant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here come the Fares followers, and this one could be mighty special.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Josef Fares-directed co-op games from Hazelight have been so good – and crucially, also so commercially successful – that it’s about time we started seeing some other developers trying to get in on that artistically beautiful, mandatory two-player action. And Out of Words, from poet Morten Søndergaard and co-developers WiredFly and Kong Orange, not only fits the mold cast by Fares, but has the potential to be as good as anything the former filmmaker has made so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s purely coincidental that Out of Words has so much in common with Hazelight’s games, but it’s an interesting coincidence nonetheless. Søndergaard, like Fares, is a European artist who came from outside of the games industry. And Out of Words promises an emotional two-player coming-of-age physics-based puzzle platforming journey for its pair of handcrafted protagonists, Kurt and Karla. Those parallels aside, though, Out of Words very clearly looks set to stand tall on its own two feet. First of all, it’s absolutely gorgeous, and completely handmade. Literally. Each character and set piece was made in real life and painstakingly animated frame by frame. In motion it looks – and sounds – absolutely gorgeous. I got to play it for a quick 20 minutes, but if the entire game is anything like my brief hands-on, then this could be up there with anything Hazelight has made so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Søndergaard jumped me around to a few different parts of the story, but I got to see a bit of the beginning, when Kurt and Karla find themselves transported to Vokabulantis just as they are each trying to find the words to say that they have feelings for each other. They awaken to find that they have no mouths – kinda like that part in The Matrix, but less disturbing – and must find new ways to communicate. This translates in game terms to co-op puzzles, usually physics-based. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They awaken to find that they have no mouths – kinda like that part in The Matrix, but less disturbing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, in one section I played, whichever one of you held Aleph, a pet creature that is a literal symbol of your friendship, would have their gravity reversed and float up to the ceiling, while the other stayed on the ground. Navigating through various vertically oriented sections required careful timing of both jumping and tossing Aleph to the other person, lest one of you fall into the abyss. In another area, Kurt and Karla came to an area under Vokabulantis, where books are stacked everywhere and the doubt about their feelings for each other is represented by literal darkness. And in yet another spot, you both become a ball of primordial clay with each of you controlling an arm that can jut out from the body of the clay ball to grab onto the environment. You must work together to successfully work your way through all of the obstacles in your path. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Out of Words - SGF 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I mentioned music earlier for good reason. During a serene early moment, as the two of you run across a puddle-strewn grassy field, a subtle-but-powerful musical note hits every time either of you jumps and lands back on the ground. Hopefully there are more moments like that throughout Out of Words’s run, as it added a poignant punch to what promises to be a very emotional game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, if all of this sounds…<em>weird</em>, I get it. It’s definitely weird. But when you and a friend sit down to play it, via cross-play online co-op or together on a couch in same-screen, it’ll all start to make sense. I can’t say I’ve played a game quite like Out of Words. Sure, it has a lot in common with Hazelight’s body of work, but it’s also very much its own unique expression of art and story.

<section><p>The idea of a "forever game" is a myth, and game makers should be cognizant of the end of their products.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In a July 2025 shareholders meeting, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot made a salient yet obvious point about online video games: "You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal." He added: "Support for all games cannot last forever."</p><p dir="ltr">This was in response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-addresses-the-stop-killing-games-movement/1100-6533318/">"Stop Killing Games," a consumer movement</a> that rallies against purported "planned obsolescence" of online video games from publishers. Sparked by the shutdown of Ubisoft's The Crew, the movement has gained traction in the past year through petitions directly to European governments.</p><p dir="ltr">From a certain point of view, Guillemot sounds dismissive--like an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/30/joni-ernst-town-hall-00376747" rel="nofollow ">elected official shrugging off constituent concerns</a> about healthcare coverage by citing the inevitability of mortality. But the limited lifespan of modern live-service games is a reality that publishers and studios never address, at least publicly--or until it's suddenly time to pull the plug. Rarely does an executive acknowledge that their online game will, one day, come to an end.</p><p dir="ltr">Whenever a company ships a video game, there's hope from all stakeholders involved that the title will make an impact. Newly shipped online games, in particular, would love to become the "forever game" for as many players as possible--the next Fortnite or Destiny 2. Nowadays, online games are in a relentless and never-ending pursuit of an unknown and unseen finish line. However, as we've seen with the likes of Concord, MultiVersus, XDefiant, and too many others to count, becoming the next Fortnite is an uphill, and perhaps in current market conditions, unfeasible goal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537414-xd_screenshot-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537414" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537414-xd_screenshot-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537414"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft's XDefiant, which shut down in June</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537414-xd_screenshot-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The failures of so many aspiring killers of Genshin Impact, Call of Duty, Destiny, etc., lead me to ponder the "forever games" that continue to thrive. Will we be playing Fortnite Chapter 30 Season 4 in our twilight years from the cloud through data centers on Mars?</p><p dir="ltr">If we all take the "nothing is eternal" comment to heart, Fortnite will not literally last forever. One day, perhaps in the absurdly far future, Epic Games will stop adding new content to Fortnite. Some number of years later, Fortnite will go offline, and the game as we knew it will be dead.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe companies can stop killing games, but that won't stop games from dying. And the folks who make online games should at least consider how they'll give their games a merciful death when it's time.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo--a company not renowned for its online titles--did something strange before releasing Splatoon 3: it gave the game an endpoint. The shooting game would only get two years of seasonal content, including new maps, weapons, and clothes--though the game would very much remain playable.</p><p dir="ltr">I recall going through all stages of grief while playing Splatoon 3. Having an expiration date for new content was conflicting. At first, playing it felt meaningless; I knew that, despite whatever level of success or popularity it reached, Nintendo was already planning to toss it aside, as it had with Super Mario Maker 2 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Yet, unlike those two other cases, Nintendo was very clear upfront about the level of support Splatoon 3 would receive.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537413-splatoon3_grandfestival_idols_scrn_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537413" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5760" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537413-splatoon3_grandfestival_idols_scrn_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537413"></a><figcaption>The Grand Festival event for Splatoon 3, which came at the end of two years of content updates</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537413-splatoon3_grandfestival_idols_scrn_01.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">From my own experience, those two years with Splatoon 3 were immensely meaningful and special--knowing how long the game would remain fresh made me want to experience as much of that time as possible. And the fact that it got a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splatoon-raiders-spin-off-game-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6532308/">Switch 2 update</a> with new weapons, beyond the two-year limit, served as a pleasant surprise.</p><p dir="ltr">But what about a case like Mortal Kombat 1? Upon its release, game director Ed Boon sometimes spoke of <a href="https://x.com/Murdoink/status/1922686641396764849" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"years of content"</a> for the fighting game. So, when the news broke about this "Definitive Edition," which would feature less than two years of content, including 12 new characters and a story expansion, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-devs-respond-to-calls-for-more-dlc/1100-6531826/">produced outrage from fans</a>. After all, that's about the same amount of new content--and just a few months short--of the amount of support the preceding game, Mortal Kombat 11, received.</p><p dir="ltr">To fans dissatisfied with the state of MK1, this perceived death of the game was premature. It's an example of how the "fairness" of a video game's end-of-life support is ultimately defined by the relationship between the developers' transparency and the consumers' expectations. Maybe NetherRealm Studios wasn't candid enough about the life of MK1, but players might have expected too much--how many more characters did that game need? Still, any imbalance on either side of that developer-player relationship can lead to a PR nightmare.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite video games having more than enough "video game" in it, today's business models have consumers constantly yearning for more. These games need to be constantly supported, improved, and iterated upon; otherwise, they're a "dead game." Yet we also hear cries that online games are becoming too bloated, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fomo-has-infected-many-modern-games-remedy-dev-says/1100-6531538/">rooted in FOMO</a>, and becoming second jobs.</p><p dir="ltr">To escape either of these pitfalls, developers of a live game could make it clear from the start that their service will only have, say, three years of new content. It may sting to hear at first, but I'd argue that it could make those three years impactful.</p><p dir="ltr">Developers can stay focused with a clear goal in mind and move on to the next project afterward. Players can have proper expectations, knowing they have something quantifiable and solid to look forward to without devoting an indefinite amount of time. It's an option that might not make investors happy, but it's not one that companies should count out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537415-2025_apollo_core_game_press_kit_solo_ops_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537415" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537415-2025_apollo_core_game_press_kit_solo_ops_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537415"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2, which launched its latest expansion in July</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537415-2025_apollo_core_game_press_kit_solo_ops_compressed_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There lies the distinction, though, because at least Splatoon 3 and Mortal Kombat 1 are still playable online. Where the more challenging conversations lie is when those online services cease entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">With the total shutdown of a live-service game, especially one like The Crew, in which digital licenses are stripped away, there are legal and financial ramifications--and since the genesis of Stop Killing Games, there has been no shortage of internet debates surrounding them. But from a moral and philosophical standpoint, what does the complete shuttering of a game really mean?</p><p dir="ltr">As simple and true as Guillemot's point might be, it doesn't actually address one of the bigger points from Stop Killing Games, which is preservation and additional end-of-life options. When a video game is completely unplayable in any form, that is certain death.</p><p dir="ltr">The possible solutions for averting demise aren't revelatory: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasonal-updates-ending-with-offline-mode-coming-soon/1100-6528327/">offline modes like with Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> and private server support <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/knockout-citys-closure-is-part-of-a-painful-truth-of-the-games-industry-studio-says/1100-6511390/">like with Knockout City</a> are viable options. These solutions take time, labor, and devotion to implement, and as developers will tell us, they aren't easy to accomplish.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, the industry must rethink the path it is on where it has trained players into expecting endless content, and any gap or shortcoming spells death. We have to imagine a time when Fortnite concerts will be a thing of the past, and Destiny 2 actually has a final shape. This broader existential issue of end-of-life for video games and how to make it palatable for consumers is something that game makers must consider, and soon. "Forever" is running out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2xko-tournaments-could-start-earlier-than-you-think-due-to-this-closed-beta-feature.1252443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> developers at Riot Games have confirmed that the upcoming 2v2 fighting game will have a cool feature in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heads-up-arcane-fans-vi-has-been-revealed-as-2xkos-eighth-fighter-ahead-of-its-final-beta-landing-in-september">its closed beta</a> that should allow for a wave of competitive tournaments to flourish before its full release.
</p>
<p>This feature is offline play, confirmed by <a href="https://x.com/TheNitten/status/1948130703540891659">executive producer Tom Cannon</a> on the 2XKO Discord. Now that may not sound like a big deal, but there are a few quirks and considerations that make this a bigger deal than you may assume. For one, all characters are playable offline. 
</p>
<p>That means that from the closed beta launch until the foreseeable future, new characters won't have to be arduously unlocked or grinded out in-game to play with friends or at big tournaments. This is cool for everyone, but for tournament organisers who need dozens of set-ups with all characters unlocked, it's a lifesaver.

<p>On top of that, the lack of an online connection is a massive deal for these tournaments as it lowers costs. If you rent out a venue, you often have to pay for internet access. This can be expensive for larger events in convention centres or hotels. Plus, the internet in these venues isn't always stable. In a competitive environment, having a local match fall apart due to an internet connection would be a major problem.
</p>
<p>Riot Games is essentially making this decision to lend a head to the competitive space, which even today acts as a major foundation for the genre's popularity. Be it smaller events in your local cities, or annual super-events bringing in thousands of players, the in-person experience remains central to the overall enjoyment of fighting games. 
</p>
<p>2XKO has been present at the largest of these events - Evo - in the years prior to its release. The reason being a consistent source of feedback from players of all levels of skill and a way of telling genre diehards that this new company stepping into the space understands what the core audience values. So if you're excited for 2XKO, or just want an excuse to get out of the house in September when the closed beta launches, this is certainly good news for you.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-tournaments-could-start-earlier-than-you-think-due-to-this-closed-beta-feature]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky to Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b78769a3c506f/trails-in-the-sky-to-trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Falcom is one of the most influential and long-standing Japanese developers out there. Pioneering the action RPG space with the <strong>Ys</strong> series, it's recently become more well-known for its continent-spanning epic turn-based series, <strong>Trails</strong>.</p>
<p>On <strong>15th January 2026</strong>, the series' 13th entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, will be launching on Switch and Switch 2 in the West. And, as a huge fan of the franchise, it's probably the most excited I've been for a new game from Falcom in some time. Daybreak's more-thoughtful and modern threads have really connected with me, and Van has become one of my favourite RPG protagonists in recent memory.</p>
<p>But, with Beyond the Horizon, we have another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_of_cold_steel_iv">Cold Steel IV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_into_reverie">Trails into Reverie</a> situation on our hands — a huge gathering of characters across the franchise all impacted by one big event. It really feels like the culmination of this gigantic series, and with the end steadily approaching, I was eager to reflect and look back with Falcom President and series producer Toshihiro Kondo.</p>
<p>What starts off as a chat about the newest game turned into a peek behind 20 years of history, from technological advancements (both narratively and in the world), the influence of real-world politics, and the potential of the Switch 2 for the series going forward. It's a long one, so grab a cup of coffee and settle in!</p>
<p><em>Note: There are a few spoilers about Trails into Reverie here, so if you haven't played that game or don't know the identity of a certain character yet, you might want to wait before diving in!</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Alana Hagues): Let's start with something very simple - can you set the scene for Trails Beyond the Horizon? How does it tie in with Van’s story and what can fans expect on a general level?</strong></p>
<div><p><strong>Toshihiro Kondo</strong><strong>, President of Falcom:</strong> For Trails Beyond the Horizon, it's essentially a sequel to Trails through Daybreak II, and takes place directly after it. While Daybreak 1 and 2 dealt with issues that were occurring within the Republic of Calvard, this time the scope broadens to not only include what’s happening in Calvard, but also to the continent itself. So the series finally opens up into these mysteries that have been at the core of what the continent is and what this world is overall.</p><p>

One of our main characters is Van still. Van will continue his work as a Spriggan, handling the things that he's done. And what he's acting upon is due to a lot of the events and connections that he made throughout the course of Daybreak 1 and 2. Whether that be connections in the government or connections in the Ouroboros Society, all of these people Van met are now going to come into play here as he looks to see what's going on with this event that's going to be happening in the course of this game in Calvard.</p></div>

<p>This event is a space program, which has been built up as a national project, and pretty much all of the events of this game have to do with what's going on with this space project. Without spoiling anything, we've been adding some teasers in there, that's kind of what's going on with this game.</p>
<p><strong>One of the big focuses for the series is the technological advancements across the games —</strong> <strong>now seems like a good time to ask, why space travel now? What do you think the importance is in the canon at this point? It's such a big leap from where we were 20 years ago to now.</strong></p>
<p>That’s a great question! And the answer to that is precisely what Trails Beyond the Horizon is all about. Why has technology advanced so much?</p>
<p>As you mentioned, we're 20 years out from the release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/legend_of_heroes_trails_in_the_sky">Trails in the Sky</a> (in Japan, at least), but if you look at the actual in-game timeline from Sky and what's happening now in Calvard, that's less than 10 years. It's a very short span of time. And so that's a really good observation — how did we go from airships to space?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. We've been planning this all along (laughs).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another one of the big mysteries of this world is Orbment and the powers that Orbment bestows upon the inhabitants of the world and how the world operates itself. These are also things that you can expect to see touched upon and explored, and begun to be unraveled in Trails Beyond the Horizon. If you look even at Trails in the Sky into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_from_zero">Trails from Zero</a>, you'll notice that technology gets a pretty big bump from those two games. For one thing, you've got what amounts to the internet in Crossbell, as well as what we could consider smartphones.</p>
<p>I’m sure a lot of the fans were probably thinking when these games originally were released, ‘oh, well, you're just hopping on current trends. This is what's happening in modern society, so this is what you're using as topics within the game to colour your world.’ No. We've been planning this all along (laughs). There's a lot here that we've been thinking about.</p>
<p>It's been many years since those games originally came out, now we can finally show the fans this has been part of the plan all along, and all of this is a very detailed plan for why technology has progressed as fast as it has</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Now I'm scared. (laughs)</strong> <strong>So</strong>, <strong>you touched on something in that t</strong><strong>his is the first game that's really “global” – you’ve got Van from Calvard, Rean from Erebonia, and Kevin from the Septian Church</strong>, <strong>all characters from across Zemuria. Why is the story of the continent now important?</strong></p>
<p>This answer is more from a game development perspective than from the more story-based thrust of your question…</p>
<p><strong>That’s totally fair! (laughs)</strong></p>
<p>In terms of Kevin specifically, he's part of the church, and his going to Calvard and doing what he does in this game has been flagged ever since his first appearance, and particularly in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/pc/legend_of_heroes_trails_in_the_sky_the_3rd">Sky The 3rd</a>. There's a lot going on with [the church] and their relationship to the world itself. And so it makes sense that you would have someone there for that.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6be8454dbb032/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of Rean, if you look at the end of his story from Cold Steel IV, and then look at one of the ending events in Trails into Reverie, his story also touches upon the heart of what's going on in this world. Given that Rean's been confronted with various issues, he's not the type of person to just ignore things and stay home in Erebonia. He's going to get involved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They need to be able to have these different experiences and meet these different people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the story were to take place solely through Van's eyes and minutely carry out all of these things that the story is trying to tell, it would be a ridiculously long game. It would end up killing the realism because he'd have to go to so many different places and meet so many different people and meet so many different things.</p>
<p>Choosing the direction we did to be able to tell this story covers a lot of the complexities of the nation of Calvard but also the overarching world as well, it necessitated us to have different routes so we could show all of these things concurrently. And all the more so, it wouldn't make sense for all the three of the characters to be similar to Van or to be in a situation to do what Van does. They need to be able to have these different experiences and meet these different people and these reasons for doing and going on the routes that they go on.</p>
<p>That's why the system was chosen of having multiple main characters, to be able to cover as cleanly as possible all of the events in the story that need to be covered and to also offer fresh perspective on the events that are taking place as being seen through the eyes of each different main character as we go through their roots.</p>
<p><strong>Right, and with Kevin in particular,</strong> <strong>this is the first time he's been playable</strong> <strong>since Trails in the Sky the 3rd as you brought up — there are a lot of people who won't even know who he is, which I feel really bad about because he's my favourite character (laughs).</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, what is it like revisiting a character like that after so long and</strong> <strong>putting him in the spotlight in this way?</strong></p>
<p>Good question (laughs) A hint for your answer lies in something that you pointed out, which is that Kevin is a member of the Septian Church. You can't expect someone who is jumping into Beyond the Horizon (as their first game) to fully grasp this organisation and the world it exists in. But if you are someone who has been playing the series at least for a few entries, you have an understanding of what the Septian Church is, at least on a superficial level. By having at least a superficial level of knowledge, that automatically places Kevin at a certain position in the players mind and their expectations.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac4de25fc0fb7/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The thing about Kevin is that at first glance he seems like a happy-go-lucky priest out there to do good and change the world for the better, but he has this very dark side to him too. These are things which we as developers paid careful attention to to kind of introduce or reintroduce to people throughout the course of the game.</p>
<p>For example, the group that Kevin works with in his story path is with Rufus from Cold Steel (and Reverie). And even though Kevin is a very senior member of the church who has authority and dignity and all these other things, he kind of gets given the runaround a lot by the people that he's dealt with. It's a really interesting balance between this dignity that he should have as a high member of a priest and what these characters are saying to him or making him do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are things that we're paying attention to when reviving this character</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the flip side, a lot of the interactions are written in a way, whether it be with Kevin and these characters or Kevin with other characters, that shows characters who this man is. Even though he has this very happy light side to him, there's also times when certain scenes necessitate him to have more of that darkness that we know that he has, that really serious side that occasionally has to get into given his role. These are things that we're paying attention to when reviving this character after he's not really been present in the series for so long (since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_to_azure">Azure</a>).</p>
<p>So, to kind of re-encapsulate that into something simple is first,to have players understand who the character is because of his role within the organisation that has already been introduced. And then second, to show through the interactions that he has with the other characters that he deals with in the game, these two sides of him as a character.</p>
<p><strong>There are so many characters at this point — how do you keep track of all of those personality changes and</strong> <strong>balance all of that together?</strong> <strong>Some we haven't seen for a long time, others are very new so we're still getting used to them. What's it like threading all of that together?</strong></p>
<p>It kind of comes down to the characters we want to show and the characters we want to introduce players to. How that works from a process standpoint is you create a character, particularly a main character, and then you think about that character in contrast to who they're paired with in their story.</p>
<p>To use Rean as an example; you've got a young man of few words, he's got this dark past about him, but he's also very serious. And he very much wants to get this job done, whatever that might be. And so around him, what kind of characters would you expect to see? How can they play off him? Are they different from him? How can they show these aspects of him that we've discussed? When creating these characters, it’s about how they can play off one another and how they're different from one another, that they get formed and created.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5755e4f8586d4/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond that, you have a larger role of who these characters are in this world. So, taking the three countries that we're most familiar with being, Erebonia (Cold Steel), the Kingdom of Liberl (Sky), and then the Republic of Calvard (Daybreak), what kinds of people would exist within these countries. In Liberl, you've got this very kind queen who's like a motherly figure to her people. How would the people in this country act? You've got Erebonia, which is a very strict class system with nobility and commoners. What kind of people would this give rise to?</p>
<p>Looking at what we have here now in the Republic of Calvard, it's a country made up of immigrants, of people from many different places. and that's how you're able to get characters like Feri or Aaron who are not Calvardian necessarily in terms of their race or ethnicity, but they are in this place. They contribute to this story and then being characterized against someone like Van, who is from Calvard, but he does the dirty work, right? He's got these sides to him which are very different than those around him and what came before. All of these things together are what creates the characters and how maybe not necessarily they keep track of them, but that's how they end up where they end up in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the series as a whole, one of the goals and ideas was to portray these very human problems and societal experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, you do bring up a good point when you say there are a lot of characters (laughs). This is something we’ve talked about internally on how to keep it manageable and reasonable and how to tell the stories that we want to tell without having these gigantic ballooning casts. We will continue to think about these things going forward when it comes to cast selection and who appears in games.</p>
<p><strong>To bounce off your point about Calvard, Trails feels extremely progressive and it feels like it's very much rolling with</strong> <strong>modern times and how society and politics and events are taking place in the real world. Do political or any kind of real events ever influence the story at all?</strong></p>
<p>For the series as a whole, one of the goals and ideas was to portray these very human problems and societal experiences. The thing is because many of the settings of the games veered more towards fantasy or something that felt divorced from reality, it probably didn't hit as hard as you would expect.</p>
<p>Now, looking at Calvard, that allowed us to do something different because the setting is so close to what is happening or modern day, We knew from the beginning because it's introduced in Sky that Calvard is a country that has lots of immigrants, a melting pot and made up of all these different people. However, that's where we left it in our minds (laughs) and we didn't really think about the details of Calvard at that point in time.</p>
<p>What really caused us to think about what Calvard was and who it's comprised of and the issues that it has is when we started making Erebonia. Calvard stands in direct contrast to each other when it comes to the societies that Erebonia have and the worlds Erebonians inhabit. So a lot of the guiding principles that caused Erebonia to be developed with its ideas and goals and issues, all that is reflected in Calvard. And that just kind of necessarily made it more of a realistic thing.</p>
<p>To more directly answer your question, absolutely real life events are referenced throughout. I thought it would be interesting to cover these types of topics, because many the staff who created this series 20 years ago are still here, particularly the core writing team. Over the course of 20 years as we've gotten older, and as we've begun to look at the world differently, and we have different outlooks on things and different things to say about what's happening in our world. And that gets reflected within the work itself on purpose.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d8965f4f13276/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last but not least, particularly in regards to immigration and racism, as a country Japan is not really known for having a bunch of people who are not Japanese inhabiting it. However, due to some recent initiatives by the Japanese government, the country is becoming more open and welcoming to people who are not originally Japanese. And because more and more people are coming into Japan, that creates a new society for Japanese people as well, and new issues that we've never encountered before.</p>
<p>We thought this would be an interesting thing to also explore in the Calvard games, something that we as Japanese people ourselves might be facing in the not too distant future. So yeah, all of these things that you touched upon, the real world does absolutely impact the writing, and we do want to make specific commentary or at least explore what's happening in the world through the events of the game and the societies and the people and the things that are depicted there.</p>
<p><strong>So I guess going along with the core team evolving along with the games, how has it been continuing to watch the world that everyone wrote down and dreamt up and all these characters grow up over 20 years?</strong> <strong>How do you continue a 20-year process like that?</strong></p>
<p>That’s a good question – I wonder how we do continue! (laughs)</p>
<p>So the interesting thing about the genesis of this whole world to begin with is one of practicality. At the time, if you look at the previous <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> games (<strong>Dragon Slayer</strong>, the <strong>Gagharv</strong> trilogy) that were pixel art. All of them depict a world; there was one whole world per game.</p>

<p>When game development and graphic design shifted to 3D, that greatly limited what we could do asset-wise. We were no longer able to create an entire world for one specific game. So the idea became between me and my co-worker, <em>"what if we can't depict the whole world maybe we can depict a country instead"</em>. So why don't we have a story about a country and then why don't we find out how this country connects to another country that would be in the same world but wouldn't be depicted in one single game.</p>
<p>As I started planning this some of the older people in the company were like, <em>"you guys are getting way ahead of yourselves here"</em> (laughs) <em>"</em><em>Why don't you try making one game first before you develop all these grand plans for things".</em> So this became a challenge to see what you could with what you essentially call limited resources to be able to work within this framework of telling the story of not a world now but a country, continuing that story in the next game in a different country within the world</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally, this was only meant to be three parts, and by parts I mean games:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That has what's become our motivation these last 20 years, to finish what we started. All of these games do take place in one world and they're all connected to one another by virtue of this fact and by virtue of the fact there being an overarching story that does connect everything. That's the real motivation now. That's what keeps us going. And that's how you keep a series going, is just this desire to finish what you started.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever think you would make it this far?</strong></p>
<p>No, I’m surprised too! (laughs) Originally, this was only meant to be three parts, and by parts I mean games: Liberl, then Erebonia, and then Calvard. That was it.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of creating Trails in the Sky [after three years], the president came up to us and said, <em>“okay, you guys have been working on this game for quite a while now. How close to completion are you here?”</em> And we said, <em>“we're about halfway through.”</em> He responded, <em>“great, release what you have, I don't care.”</em> So that's why Sky is divided into two parts.</p>
<p>The plan had started to fall apart because what was supposed to be one game is now two games. So what we had to do afterwards is create a game in a quicker span of time for the company to get it out there, which is obviously what became Sky the 3rd.</p>
<p>Logically, our next move would have been to make Erebonia. But I thought, <em>“well, no, we can't really go into this big area of Erebonia first. We need to think of something else first to lead into this a little bit better."</em> So that’s where Crossbell (Zero/Azure) came from.</p>
<p>But the thing about Crossbell is that it was only supposed to be one game as this bridge, which of course ended up being two games. Then we reach Erebonia and we start working on it. Only supposed to be two games. We figured at this point, it was gonna take at least two games to finish this part of the story. Yet that eventually turned into four games. And now here we are in Calvard and the story continues.</p>
<p>But no, never in my wildest dreams would I have expected this to be continuing and I never expected for things to turn out as they have in terms of how each location which was originally supposed to be one game is now multiple game-spanning arcs.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, I'll ask a sillier question in terms of evolution next.</strong> <strong>When you see character designs over the years, do you ever look at the new one and go “oh wow, I wish they’d looked this cool earlier!”?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah! There’s definitely things that you look at and think “oh, this is really cool now”, but the truth is that whenever a game is released, we believe we’re releasing the best we can do at that time period. What you can see throughout the course of the history, not specifically for Trails but for all of our titles, is you can hopefully see us having improved and gotten better both in terms of art and then graphics as well. So things that were not able to have been done in the past have been able to do now</p>
<p>Within this also, you've got just visual trends, you know, what was cool 20 years ago is not necessarily cool or on trend for today. Sure there are things that you maybe think are cooler now compared to what you did before, but that doesn't change the idea that what's being released at the time is the best for that given time.</p>
<p>There's also some things as cool as a change might be, there's some lines that you can't cross, specifically when it comes to certain aspects of character design or what he would call like a silhouette. The character needs to have a specific look. Again, using Rean as an example, kind of a slim man who always has his katana at his side. You know who this character is. These are things which are visual clues and signs for the players to know who this character is.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3bbca1649e10a/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of this together is just, it's essentially just evolution. I'm pretty proud of what we're releasing, whether it be in terms of character design itself or graphics as well.</p>
<p><strong>So another thing that has</strong> <strong>evolved is the combat. T</strong><strong>urn-based has always been like the core of Trails, and there's been a lot of discussion recently about turn-based combat and RPGs. Are you always conscious to keep turn-based combat in the series, and how have you looked to progress that, even outside of the real-time additions?</strong></p>
<p>The reason you have the turn-based combat battle system goes back to the very beginning, before the games even released in the West. This is a story-first series and these are story-first games. The general trend, at least in Japan at the time, was for story-based games to be turn-based. What that does is that essentially allows the players to take the game at their own pace and not have to feel pressure because of all this frantic action that they constantly have to worry about. Players can slowly go from place to place, enjoying the game and enjoying the world that's been created.</p>
<p>It also has to do with the DNA of the series itself, because the series itself does have a group of turn-based predecessors to it for the most part.</p>
<p>Also within Falcom's catalogue, you have the <strong>Ys</strong> series, which is in direct contrast as an action series. There's plenty of fans of the Ys series and plenty of fans of the Trails series, but people played what they wanted to play in terms of, "I like action," okay, you play Ys. "I like story focused," well, then you should play Trails. There was a little bit of overlap, but by and large, those groups were pretty separate from one another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we wondered how we could incorporate elements that made things move a little quicker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, over the course of developing the Trails series, we didn’t want things to become stale and as people became more used to the games, we wondered how we could incorporate elements that made things move a little quicker.</p>
<p>One of the issues that you encounter when it comes to command-based systems is that some think it's slow. You'll notice improvements come incrementally. In the two Crossbell games, you've got a little bit of field actions, where you can hit the enemy and then you'll start the battle. That kind of makes it a little bit more engaging, a little bit more active.</p>
<p>Moving into the Cold Steel series, that actually gets quite a bit more advanced in terms of positioning behind the enemies and what you can do on the field outside of the combat itself, but leading into the combat. So it finally culminates in Trails Through Daybreak, which is of course a hybrid battle system containing both the action RPG and the turn-based RPGs.</p>
<p>However, we were really careful because of this trend of players who still preferred the more methodical approach of turn-based combat. We wanted to make the action combat simple and unobtrusive so far as if someone didn't want to engage it, that they didn't have to. So you'll note that the combat system outside of the turn-based combat system is pretty simple for Daybreak 1. And even though there are some additions in Daybreak 2, it's kind of a refinement; just a little bit is added, and the player can still choose to engage with it if they want.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the forthcoming Trails Beyond the Horizon; feeling that probably people have at least played Daybreak 1 and 2, we thought we could add a little bit more and so we've made the action system even more robust. There's a system called Awakening — it makes the combat feel even more quick, even more responsive. You can now cast arts on the field like you could in Daybreak, but it's also been refined so it makes this whole action system a really big part of what the game is and slowly acclimates people who might not be so familiar with it.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dbb3747a2b284/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>By the same token, the turn-based element is always going to be there being part of the DNA, but that doesn't mean that because we wanted to have a more exciting action element that the turn-based side has been neglected. Rather, you'll see that the turn-based system has been iterated upon too, particularly in the forthcoming Horizon, there's many buffs that you can do, things that are unique and new that also further make the turn-based combat engaging and interesting as well. So it really is this nice balance of both of them.</p>
<p><strong>Trails Beyond the Horizon will be the first Trails game on the Nintendo Switch 2; at what point did you decide to release a Switch 2-specific version, and why was it important to release it on the new console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NIS America:</strong> We felt it was important to release the title on Nintendo Switch 2 as many fans have been following our releases on Nintendo Switch, and we believe that those who have bought a Nintendo Switch 2 will be eager to play this title on it.</p>
<p><strong>What new opportunities</strong> <strong>does the Switch 2 bring for the Trails series?</strong></p>
<p>Kondo: The biggest thing obviously is the specs; such a big element of [Horizon] is the action, the specs being as they were [on Switch 1] it was very difficult to, you know, provide a positive or really good experience with that. Working with NIS America to be able to create a Switch 2 version, you know, that gets ameliorated and that makes it better now for the players</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can expect to see the Trails series on the Switch 2 going forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, what this means for us going forward is that, yes, we do want to make sure that the games are on the Switch 2. And now, because we're more understanding of the specs and the capabilities that it has, we don't have to worry about that necessarily during development. And we can put it through its paces, as it were, to be able to release the types of games that we want that contain the elements that we want it to contain. You can expect to see the Trails series on the Switch 2 going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain the decision to release the game as a Game-Key Card on the Switch 2 and not a full physical release?</strong></p>
<p>NIS America: We decided to release this title as a Game-Key Card on the Nintendo Switch 2 as we believed it was the most beneficial option for our customers.</p>

There’s not much in the way of gameplay in the trailer, but it looks like <em>Battlefield 6</em> will focus heavily on spectacle and set-pieces.

It’s not the only device hoping to capitalize on N64 nostalgia this year, though.

Nintendo now has the chance to do the funniest thing and finally release its own N64 classic fans have long requested. While diehard enthusiasts will still opt for more premium alternatives, it would save everyone else who just wants to recreate that old Christmas morning fun with a few rounds of Mario Kart a lot of money. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>EA has unveiled the first trailer for Battlefield 6. While the two-minute trailer was more cinematics than actual gameplay, it sets a grim tone for the next installment.</p><p>The trailer begins with the US president giving a conference discussing a “dark day” in the country’s history after suffering a mysterious, unprovoked attack. We then see cinematic, in-engine footage of locations like New York City embroiled in all-out war, suggesting the conflict will at least partially unfold on American soil.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>According to a press release, Battlefield 6’s single-player campaign centers on a private military corporation called Pax Armata. Funded by former NATO states, this force threatens to ignite a global conflict.</p><p>“In Battlefield 6, the series’ incredible blend of visceral combat, epic warfare, and player freedom returns,” reads the press release. "Blow through walls and bring down buildings for a tactical advantage or take to the skies in white-knuckle dogfights. Take part in a war filled with tanks, fighter jets, and sweeping combat at a grand scale but remember: the deadliest weapon is your squad.”</p><p>Today’s trailer ended with a teaser for the reveal of the game’s multiplayer content one week later on July 31. Billed as “The biggest moment in Battlefield history” in the press release, the designers at Battlefield Studios (which consists of developers from multiple studios such as DICE, Criterion Games, Motive Studios, and Ripple Effect) will discuss the suite of new and returning multiplayer modes, showcase the game’s maps, and broadcast the first multiplayer matches played by content creators.</p><p>Battlefield 6 does not yet have a release date or announced platforms.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/battlefield-6-gets-debut-trailer-multiplayer-reveal-set-for-july-31]]></content:encoded>
