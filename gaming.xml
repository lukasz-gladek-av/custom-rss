			<p>Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQs3LRIVEyE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checked out</a> the upcoming PS5 Pro console at a recent preview event and came back with an hour-long video to discuss their first impressions (with some excerpts of game developer interviews sprinkled in) and show off some new footage from various games.</p>
<p><em><strong>F1 24: </strong>Besides <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-unveils-track-and-driver-updates-talks-raytraced-ddgi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DDGI</a> (Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination), Codemasters has added three ray-traced effects for ambient occlusion, transparency, and opaque reflections. Moreover, anisotropic filtering has improved. According to DF's Oliver Mackenzie, these additions translate almost into a generational leap in visuals in some instances. However, image stability in this RT mode isn't as stable as in the base PS5 Quality mode, probably due to a combination of PSSR and the noise caused by the ray-traced effects. PSSR will be added to other modes in the future.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Gran Turismo 7:</strong> Polyphony Digital's latest game offers two PS5 Pro modes. One, as mentioned in the other report <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-games-get-detailed-specs-and-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted earlier today</a>, adds real-time ray-traced reflections during races. However, GT7 has a more limited ray tracing implementation than F1 24, with off-track elements and even some on-track elements not being factored in the reflections. Image quality and stability also suffer a bit in this RT mode compared to the base PS5. For those players who aren't interested in the ray-traced reflections, there is an image quality priority mode that uses PSSR and looks very clean in comparison.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Horizon Forbidden West:</strong> This one is interesting. Guerrilla Games confirmed that it uses a new anti-aliasing reconstruction technique originally developed for future games but was then ported back to the second installment in the Horizon series. It's not PSSR or checkerboard, but Digital Foundry was very impressed as it looked way more detailed and stable than the previous solution included with the game. There will be a Quality mode that renders more often at 4K or near-4K resolution, but the developers really believe PS5 Pro players should rather use the new Performance mode since it looks extremely good already.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hogwarts Legacy:</strong> The Fidelity RT mode will offer vastly improved ray-traced shadows and reflections on PS5 Pro compared to the base PS5, with reflections using doubled resolution. The developers credited this to the console's BVH management, which is much faster than the PlayStation 5's and allows them to 'collect' objects from much further out. Avalanche Software also confirmed to have switched to PSSR for all modes (they were previously using Unreal Engine 4's TAA).</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart:</strong> According to Digital Foundry, in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, PSSR in the Performance Pro mode looks 'different' compared to the Quality mode from the PS5 version, resolving some details better and others not as well. Of course, that's while running at twice the frame rate. Insomniac said they plan to further improve the Quality Pro mode, hinting at potentially adding some ray tracing techniques that would take advantage of the PS5 Pro's much-improved ray tracing capabilities. They also confirmed to have removed a sharpening filter that was previously applied to their anti-aliasing reconstruction technique, since it is not needed with PSSR anymore. As for Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, image quality and PSSR hold better than Marvel's Spider-Man 2, possibly due to the less intensive load.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Last of Us Part II Remastered:</strong> PSSR once again appears to resolve a lot more details than the blurry TAA used in the base PS5. However, it also has worse image stability, and the depth of field isn't working correctly in some cases.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth:</strong> In many ways, this is the poster child for the PS5 Pro since the PlayStation 5 console delivered profoundly disappointing image quality in the Performance mode. The details are much higher on the PlayStation 5 Pro. However, DF again noted some stability issues, and the Level of Detail (LOD) drawbacks haven't been improved.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Crew Motorfest:</strong> This is another game where the Performance mode sees a big detail improvement thanks to PSSR. The developers are also porting some of the higher settings from the PS5's Quality mode.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Demon's Souls:</strong> While still an incredible-looking game despite being a PS5 launch title, the PS5 Pro makes it even better by allowing a higher resolution and introducing contact shadows.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2:</strong> PSSR looks a lot better than the old checkerboard solution, but it does seem to have some issues in this game with RTGI. Overall, though, the game ran much faster on PS5 Pro, reaching around 50 frames per second in the notoriously troublesome city scenarios.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 5 Pro Hands-On: 11 Games Tested, PSSR and RT Upgrades Revealed, Developers Interviewed!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQs3LRIVEyE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To round up the preview, Digital Foundry said that multiple developers hinted at PSSR having improved over time, and they expect the same will occur in the future. It makes sense, being a machine learning technique. As for the elephant in the room (whether the PS5 Pro is worth the $699 price Sony is asking), they said its improvements will matter more to users interested in playing games at 60 or higher frames per second.</p>

It has caused no small amount of controversy and Steam review bombing.<br></p><p>A silver lining on that dark cloud is that the Expansion Pass comes with a bit more than just <em>The Answer</em>.</p><h3 id="h2040"><a id=""></a>Everything in the Expansion Pass</h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>New Story Scenario, <em>Episode Aigis: The Answer</em></li><li>Velvet Costume &amp; BGM Set</li><li><em>Persona 5 Royal EX</em> BGM Set and <em>Persona 4 Golden EX</em> BGM Set</li></ul><p>While <em>The Answer</em> is the main draw for many, being able to customize a bunch of music and a handful of outfits is a nice addition.</p><p>To change your Costume, open the menu, then follow this chain: Equip &gt; Select Character &gt; Select Outfit.

Start it whenever you like at whatever power level you’re at, although you should know that once you load your main game save for <em>Episode Aigis</em>, that’s it. “You will not be able to carry over save data later or redo the carryover using a different save,” it says.

That means there are now 10 levels in the strategy game, with the campaign taking most players 8-12 hours, per Grizzly Games. This update also offers new equipment and quality-of-life improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the campaign, there is a roguelike mode in Thronefall, too. The game sees players building their bases and armies during the day and then taking on hordes of enemies at nightfall. Grizzly notes that players can also charge into the conflicts themselves, if they so wish. Successfully surviving the darkness and baddies leads to the ability to pick out new weapons and perks.</p><p dir="ltr">Before Thronefall, Grizzly previously worked on Superflight and Islanders. The latter surprise-launched on Switch back in 2021 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/axiom-verge-2-surprise-releases-on-switch-today-alongside-six-other-games/1100-6495049/" data-ref-id="1100-6495049">alongside Axiom Verge 2 after a Nintendo Indie World stream</a>.</p>

                <p>Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime left Blizzard because he was reportedly tired of fighting with former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, according to those who worked closely with him, the two leaders having butted heads for years regarding the future of Blizzard.</p><p dir="ltr">New details about Morhaime's 2018 departure and Blizzard's contentious relationship with Activision come via an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-25/book-excerpt-play-nice-the-rise-fall-and-future-of-blizzard-entertainment?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNzI2MjU3MywiZXhwIjoxNzI3ODY3MzczLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTS0Q1NFJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ju6VKxgSlDycOC4T4Zo1isSTpRn05b_o9bPKL-Z8qmE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">excerpt</a> from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier's upcoming book <span data-embed-type="buylink" data-size="buylink__embed" data-collection="%7B%22text%22:%22Play%20Nice:%20The%20Rise,%20Fall,%20and%20Future%20of%20Blizzard%20Entertainment%22,%22monetizedUrl%22:%22https://www.amazon.com/Play-Nice-Future-Blizzard-Entertainment/dp/1538725428?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20%22,%22rawUrl%22:%22https://www.amazon.com/Play-Nice-Future-Blizzard-Entertainment/dp/1538725428%22%7D">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Play-Nice-Future-Blizzard-Entertainment/dp/1538725428?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Play-Nice-Future-Blizzard-Entertainment\/dp\/1538725428&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;buylink|embedded-link&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;buylink|embedded-link&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Play-Nice-Future-Blizzard-Entertainment/dp/1538725428">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a> </span>, which releases on October 8 (the same day Blizzard's first expansion for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>, Vessel of Hatred, launches).</p><p dir="ltr">For years, Morhaime attempted to keep Activision, which acquired Blizzard in 2007, at bay. That goal of keeping Blizzard insulated from outside Activision pressure became harder in 2013 when Blizzard canceled project Titan, an FPS MMO that had been intended to be the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>, according to Schreier.</p><p dir="ltr">After the project's cancellation, which cost Blizzard around $80 million, Kotick and Activision began to assert more control over Blizzard, including pushing Blizzard to hire a chief financial officer, Armin Zerza, to keep costs in check. Zerza just "kept talking about how to make as much money as possible," according to one former employee, and at one point suggested axing Blizzard's annual BlizzCon fan convention, confused as to why a project with such low profit margins was allowed to exist, according to Schreier's sources. Blizzard announced this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/" data-ref-id="1100-6522953">there would not be a BlizzCon 2024</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Morhaime continued to battle Kotick in the following years, defending Blizzard's need for customer service employees and the studio's cinematics team. Following a meeting of Activision, Blizzard, and King leaders focused around the theme of "One ABK," Morhaime feared Blizzard was losing its independence, according to Schreier. He wrote a lengthy email to Kotick in response, stating he believed "preserving Blizzard's culture and magic" was a necessity in order to attract and retain "the best creative talent in the world." He additionally said that it had been "increasingly hard for me to provide Blizzard leadership and staff confidence that Blizzard has a stable future."</p><p dir="ltr">In 2017, Morhaime submitted a resignation letter, but was persuaded at the time by Kotick and others to take it back. Following the One ABK meeting in the spring of 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-co-founderpresident-mike-morhaime-steps-d/1100-6462259/" data-ref-id="1100-6462259">Morhaime formally announced his departure that October</a>, saying it was time for someone else to lead.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's story would of course continue, but without the man that Schreier said many Blizzard staff worshiped. Morhaime went on in 2020 to found a new game studio and publisher, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-blizzard-boss-mike-morhaime-founds-new-studio-dreamhaven/1100-6482533/" data-ref-id="1100-6482533">Dreamhaven</a>. Blizzard, meanwhile, in 2021 found itself embroiled in controversy following an explosive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-lawsuits-and-investigations-timeline-of-events/1100-6494785/" data-ref-id="1100-6494785">state of California lawsuit that accused Activision Blizzard of systemic sexual misconduct and discrimination</a>, eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-will-pay-54-million-to-california-after-settling-lawsuit/1100-6520018/" data-ref-id="1100-6520018">settling with the state in 2023 to the tune of $54 million</a>. Morhaime said in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-blizzard-executives-mike-morhaime-and-chris-metzen-respond-to-harassment-lawsuit/1100-6494388/" data-ref-id="1100-6494388">statement addressing the lawsuit that he was "ashamed."</a></p><p dir="ltr">"To the Blizzard women who experienced any of these things, I am extremely sorry that I failed you," Morhaime said.</p><p dir="ltr">In the wake of the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-in-deal-valued-at-nearly-70-billion-bobby-kotick-staying-on-as-ceo/1100-6499710/" data-ref-id="1100-6499710">Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard for $69 billion</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-leaving-the-company-soon/1100-6520060/" data-ref-id="1100-6520060">Kotick stepping down as Activision Blizzard CEO</a> in December 2023.</p>

            <p>
We already knew it was coming this October, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> - the promising VR take on Rocksteady's acclaimed superhero series - now has a proper release date. It's launching for Meta Quest 3 and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-quest-3s-officially-unveiled-with-290-price-tag-and-october-release-date">newly announced Meta Quest 3S</a> on 22nd October this year.
</p>
<p>
Arkham Shadow - officially a canonical entry in the Arkhamverse - whisks players back in the timeline, taking place before the events of Rocksteady's Arkham Asylum, but after Warner Bros. Montreal's Arkham Oranges. It'll feature the likes of Harley Quinn, Scarecrow, Two-Face, and Jim Gordon, with series newcomer Ratcatcher also set to appear.
</p>
<p>
Gameplay wise, it's pretty much business as usual for the series, with stealth, fisticuffs, grappling, gadgets, and Detective Vision all present - the obvious difference being that players get to experience it all through the eyes of Batman. It sounds pretty ambitious, and developer Camouflaj - known for its work on the likes of Iron Man VR - has series veterans including design director Bill Green on hand to help make it feel like an authentic Arkhamverse game.

<p>
The good news is it's looking pretty great. Eurogamer's Tom Phillips took Batman: Arkham Shadow for a whirl earlier this year and came away <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadow-might-be-vr-but-its-the-first-dc-game-since-arkham-knight-im-actually-excited-for">impressed</a>, saying it "undoubtedly leans into the possibilities of VR and replicates Rocksteady's original work well."
</p>
<p>
And we now know Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S owners will have the opportunity to don Batman's cowl, prowl Gotham's streets, and punch goons in the butt using their actual fists starting on 22nd October this year. There's no word on a price yet, but if you don't already have a headset, it'll be bundled with new Meta Quest 3 and 3S purchases until 30th April next year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/we-had-to-push-konami-very-hard-to-also-focus-on-pc-for-silent-hill-2-says-bloober-team/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It isn't surprising that a company like Konami would want to make the game a PlayStation exclusive, especially since the original Silent Hill 2 was created for PlayStation 2 before going to Xbox the year after. In an interview with Bloober Team, they also mentioned that they had to fight hard to get the Silent Hill 2 remake on PC. While the game will have performed very well on its own if it was released exclusively on PlayStation 5, having it on additional platforms gives it even more opportunity to perform and become a financial success for both Bloober Team and Konami.</p>
<p>In regards to the financial success of the game, they say they haven't hit all of their milestones as of yet but that they are consistently changing in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bloober-Team-spodziewa-sie-kolejnych-rozliczen-z-Konami-za-kamienie-milowe-8818376.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with Bankier</a>.&nbsp;However, it's expected that the release of Silent Hill 2 in October will have a significant impact on their financial results in the fourth quarter. Producer Piotr Babieno has noted that most of the revenue for Silent Hill 2 will come from those who purchase it on Silent Hill 2. However, he is very aware that there is significant interest in the game from those who are PC gamers.</p>
<p>"Silent Hill 2 is definitely a game that has been associated with the PlayStation brand from the very beginning," says Babieno. However, the game has seen remakes and mods made for PC, as well as high-definition releases for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. "At the very beginning, we had to push Konami very hard to focus on the PC. For them, the main market is PlayStation, but looking at the interest on the Steam platform it seems that it should also be a successful launch."</p>
<p>While they can't say how the milestones are distributed, it's said that the company's president is able to note that Konami is very pleased with the cooperation thus far with Bloober Team, so much so that they want to continue working with Konami in the future. "You can expect that this is not the end of the adventure with Konami," says the president. This perhaps means that there will be more Silent Hill remakes in the future, as the first game in the franchise and Silent Hill 3 are all equally well-loved and are iconic games in the franchise.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-gets-hours-of-pc-gameplay-from-review-build/">release of Silent Hill 2</a> isn't far away, with the game being released on October 8, 2024, on both PC and PlayStation 5. To purchase the game, it will cost $69.99, with the Digital Deluxe version costing $79.99.</p>
<p><strong>Correction:&nbsp;</strong>"We had to push Konami very hard to focus on PC" was a casual remark, and the statement was taken out of context due to mistranslation, as the original article is in Polish. Instead, it was meant more of how Bloober Team wanted to get the game on PC, with no pressure involved.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bioware-speaks-on-how-balancing-reappearing-characters-and-solas-role-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The release date for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is fast approaching, and the developers are conducting interviews with plenty of different outlets to answer their burning questions about the upcoming game and what to expect from it. This game is entirely single-player, something which people weren't sure of whether that would go ahead under EA. John Epler, the Creative Director for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, said that the one definite thing throughout the near-decade of development was Solas being at the front and center. "There was never a version of the story of Dragon Age 4 where Solas was not at the center," he says in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with IGN</a>.</p>
<p>Solas has always been an iconic character in the franchise, despite only being in Inquisition. He has gone from being a gentle, mysterious <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-features-companions-ability-wheel-for-strategic-combat-romance-has-no-limitations/">companion</a> to a mainstay in Veilguard. The "bones" of the story were always going to come from what happened in the story of the Trespasser DLC in Dragon Age: Inquisition. Dragon Age: The Veilguard has undergone many changes and evolutions to try and perfect the story. "There were different versions of the story. There were versions of the story where maybe you didn't necessarily progress as far in your fight against Solas, but Solas has always been at the center of Dragon Age 4."</p>
<p>For this game, Rook was designed to be "almost a mirror of Solas." This design gives the player plenty of new interactions and conversations between Rook and Solas, which can help expand their relationship.</p>
<p>Dragon Age is known for having some really iconic characters throughout, and they've had to decide which ones will appear in Dragon Age: The Veilguard and how to avoid making it overwhelmingly full of cameos.</p>
<p>In another vein, during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-roundtable-qa-the-conclusion-to-this-game-needs-to-matter/">Q&amp;A</a> portion of The Veilguard's preview event earlier in the month, BioWare was asked how they decided who to include in the game as side characters or even just cameos from the existing cast.</p>
<p>"It honestly comes down to: Do they have more of a story to tell. We don't want to just bring back characters so you can be like, 'Hey, I recognize that person!' but certain characters have more to their story."</p>
<p>While many characters won't be appearing in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, some fan favorites will. For example, Morrigan, an incredibly popular character, will appear again. Not only that, but the previous protagonist will also be showing up, and players will get to see The Inquisitor show up.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is either a high-fantasy Persona or a Shin Megami Tensei with cool fonts and a warm heart.

<p>You'll find the prologue demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679460/Metaphor_ReFantazio/">the game's Steam page</a> or on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3130330/Metaphor_ReFantazio__Prologue_Demo/">its own dedicated Steam page</a>. You can write a review of the demo on the latter, maybe, as per Steam's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-has-made-it-easier-to-find-download-and-even-review-game-demos">recent changes for demos</a>. 
</p>
<p>The demo features the beginning of Metaphor's story, where "the protagonist sets out on a journey to save his best friend, the prince" and participates in an election to become the new king. Is that how kings work now? You'll be able to fight through the game's first four dungeons and unlock seven of its 40 character classes, here called Archetypes. Your progress will carry over to the full game, should you choose to purchase it.
</p>
<p>Metaphor has more than fonts to draw comparisons with Persona. Although not set on a school with a rigid class timetable, how you manage time remains important in the game, and you'll spend daylight hours adventurin', fightin', treasure-me-doin' and the evenings making friends. Maybe you can make friends with the tooth-with-a-face James was enamoured by, I do not know.
</p>
<p>If it's not clear, this is made by Persona and Shin Megami Tensei developers Atlus, with its design led by Personas 3-5 director Katsura Hashino. They can crib from themselves, it's fine. Recommended, even.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Much of <em>The Veilguard </em>takes place in northern areas of the series’ world rather than the ones in the south featured in the first three games, and the status of things in those other regions isn’t necessarily relevant to the new game’s story.</p><p>“Our philosophy when it comes to integrating past player choices and world states is wherever possible we want to avoid contradicting what has happened before. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112?_gl=1*122inm0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzI4ODY2NC4xODEuMS4xNzI3Mjg4OTUzLjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112?_gl=1*122inm0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzI4ODY2NC4xODEuMS4xNzI3Mjg4OTUzLjU3LjAuMA..">We never want to invalidate your choices</a></span>,” he says. “For <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, among many reasons why we moved to Northern Thedas is it becomes a little bit more of a clean slate for us. There’s not as many decisions you have made up to this point that have an impact on what’s happening in Northern Thedas. And we don’t have to speak directly to things like who is the Divine? Because again, that’s happening in the South.”</p><p>“There’s never a sense of, ‘Oh, that decision doesn’t exist.’ But maybe we don’t touch on it in this particular title,” he says. “Much like <em>Inquisition</em> didn’t touch on every decision from <em>Origins</em>, much like <em>DA2</em> didn’t touch on every decision from <em>Origins</em>, it’s kind of in that same vein of we’re not going to contradict it. We just may not always reference it directly.”</p><p>We got to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350">seven hours of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span><em> </em>earlier this month, and part of that demo included messing around with the character creator. First, you make Rook, your new hero in <em>The Veilguard</em>. Second, you make the Inquisitor, the protagonist of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. After you’ve finalized their appearance, you’re asked a few questions about the Inquisitor’s story so they can be properly recognized in your <em>Veilguard</em> playthrough. Here’s a rundown of the choices that carry forward:</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="86e8783d30e758b1d447d3fceb0d19d2" data-recommend-id="image://86e8783d30e758b1d447d3fceb0d19d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorian holds the Inquisitor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dorian holds the Inquisitor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86e8783d30e758b1d447d3fceb0d19d2" data-recommend-id="image://86e8783d30e758b1d447d3fceb0d19d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorian holds the Inquisitor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This one’s straightforward: Who did your Inquisitor have sexy sleepovers with while trying to stop the god-wannabe Corypheus?

So if you’re making a male Inquisitor, you won’t be able to put that he was in a relationship with Sera, or that non-elf female Inquisitor romanced Solas. There’s also an option to say the Inquisitor didn’t get with anyone, if you, for some reason, chose the lonely road.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e16c23ac15dedc254059d1536903fb1c" data-recommend-id="image://e16c23ac15dedc254059d1536903fb1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor addresses a room while holding a book." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor addresses a room while holding a book." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e16c23ac15dedc254059d1536903fb1c" data-recommend-id="image://e16c23ac15dedc254059d1536903fb1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor addresses a room while holding a book." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The next two choices specifically refer to <em>Inquisition</em>’s <em>Trespasser </em>DLC, which capped off the story two years after the events of the base game. <em>Trespasser </em>is all about a dispute between the Inquisition, the religious institution known as the Chantry, and local governments who fear the organization is becoming too powerful as an independent, militarized force. At the end of the expansion, the player is asked to either disband the Inquisition or surrender control of it to the church. There are compelling reasons for either, as disbanding would keep the Inquisitor’s inner circle small and less open to infiltration while operating under the church would give them far more resources for the incoming threat but open them up to traitors in their ranks.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c1959b60495274f24d20908087f5fcef" data-recommend-id="image://c1959b60495274f24d20908087f5fcef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor decides how to handle Solas." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor decides how to handle Solas." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c1959b60495274f24d20908087f5fcef" data-recommend-id="image://c1959b60495274f24d20908087f5fcef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor decides how to handle Solas." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In <em>Trespasser</em>, the Inquisitor meets with Solas, the party-member-turned-antagonist who was secretly an elven god called the Dread Wolf. The DLC reveals he plans to tear down the Veil, a barrier between the real world and the spirit world known as the Fade, in an effort to bring the elven race to its former glory. Doing so will result in death and destruction for the rest of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, but Solas believes this to be an atonement for erecting the wall in the first place to seal away the ancient, corrupt elven gods of old. In their final conversation, the Inquisitor is able to tell Solas one of two things: they will stop him by any means necessary, or they will find a way to save him from himself. How this will manifest itself in <em>The Veilguard </em>remains to be seen, but it’s ultimately determining whether or not your old hero still views Solas as a friend or just a threat to the world.</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 31.

<p>In addition to the investigation, it was confirmed that Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performed below expectations</a> in terms of sales, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows was delayed</a> until February 2025. </p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Bungie is adding new ways of maintaining challenge to some of the main activities of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, starting with new modifiers to enemies that'll start popping up randomly in its next content drop.</p><p dir="ltr">The new modifiers, called Banes, will require players to change strategy as they encounter enemies afflicted with them. Bungie detailed the Banes in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/combatant_modifiers">blog post</a> running down <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-changing-destiny-2-approach-to-content-as-it-begins-a-new-multi-year-saga/1100-6526354/" data-ref-id="1100-6526354">changes coming to the game with Codename: Frontiers</a>, its next two content expansions. The developer will test at least two of those Banes in Episode: Revenant, Destiny 2's next content addition, which releases on October 8.</p><p dir="ltr">As Bungie describes them, Banes can appear randomly on enemies as you make your way through something like a Nightfall Strike. They're a bit like less- intense versions of the Champion enemies currently in the game. One Bane, Meteors, causes an enemy to randomly spawn Solar Meteors that fly through the air and track players, but can be shot down--similar to what the end boss of the Proving Grounds Strike throws at players now. Another, Shock, sees an enemy building up an electric shock that can then be discharged onto a player target within line-of-sight. If you kill the enemy with the Shock Bane, the effect can transfer to other, nearby enemies. You can see them in action in Bungie's video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMrJeez2W8g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BMrJeez2W8g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">You'll know enemies sporting a Bane based on a big, colorful crescent that hovers over their head, which also indicates what kind of Bane you're dealing with. Other Banes Bungie detailed included Punchable, where an enemy has an unbreakable shield until someone hits it with a melee attack; Berserk, where the enemy with the Bane causes nearby enemies to gain the Enrage buff and become more powerful; and Nuclear, where the Bane enemy explodes in a Solar shockwave after a certain amount of time passes once it hits low health.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the Banes are still in development, according to the blog post, so how they work in-game and what they end up looking like is still subject to change. Bungie also noted that Banes won't be applied to Champions, at least in Revenant, and that Banes won't stack on a single enemy.</p><p dir="ltr">Banes are part of Bungie's larger approach to changing PvE activities in Destiny 2 to increase their challenge and make them more fun to replay over and over, since replaying activities is a central part of Destiny 2's MMO design. In addition to Banes showing up randomly while you're fighting enemies, you can expect larger Enemy and Combat Modifiers to be applied to different content to change up how you approach it.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of these have already been in the game--Surges applied to specific element types, for example, are a Combat Modifier that can change how players approach an activity. As for Enemy Modifiers, Bungie hints that you might see some enemies dropping boobytrapped loot, an element from the Trickster boss that appeared in the Forsaken expansion's campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie writes that it's looking to add new modifiers to both enemy behavior, giving them new powers or requirements to defeat, and player combat, but it wants to move away from modifiers requiring players to come into an activity with custom loadouts in order to deal with or take advantage of them. That doesn't mean it's replacing all the modifiers that are currently in the game, but it sounds like at least some of them are getting reworked or replaced by new ones in keeping with the new design goals Bungie has laid out for Codename: Frontiers.</p>

		<p>Square Enix has announced that it is releasing Triangle Strategy as a VR title, and it will be released on Meta Quest 2 and 3. You will not have to wait too long to get your hands on Triangle Strategy in VR, as it will be launching on October 31st. You can check out the announcement trailer, which shows the gameplay in VR.</p>
<p><iframe title="Triangle Strategy | Meta Quest Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5Y7dKcwZnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a description for the VR version of Triangle Strategy, Square Enix has said, <em>“You’ll get a better view of the battlefield with 360-degree movement that lets you see the conflict how you want. Controlling characters is a snap and incredibly immersive thanks to intuitive VR controls that let you place characters, take actions and define battle strategies with ease.Yes, the fate of Serenoa and his allies is now in your hands (well, in a pair of controllers technically, but you take our point).The game also supports Meta Quest’s Passthrough feature on Meta Quest 3 which lets you mesh the game’s environments with real-world surroundings. It’s fun, engaging and… well, just really cool.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/triangle-strategy/5340130476095884/">Pre-orders for Triangle Strategy</a> on Meta Quest 2 and 3 are live now, with the full price being £22.99. However, there is a pre-order discount of 13% which knocks the price down to £19.99 until it releases.</p>

<p>In our Triangle Strategy review, Dom said, <em>“Triangle Strategy is a beautiful and authentic tactical RPG. Fans of Fire Emblem in particular will love the involving narrative on top of the strategic action – just be prepared for a slow start as it sets its expansive story in motion.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-backstory-important/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>HBO is currently working on bringing the second season of The Last of Us to life, but there are still a few months before it’s ready to air. In recent weeks, we’ve seen set photos leak from inside the production, revealing costumes, locations, story points, and some of the newly casted actors in roles pulled straight from The Last of Us Part II (2020). </p>



<p>Recently, Neil Druckmann, the series’ creator and head at Naughty Dog, sat down with Variety to talk about the expectations for the second season of the award-winning live-action adaptation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-diving-deeper">Diving Deeper</h2>



<p>One thing that the first season did so well was setting up a little more meat on the bones in terms of backstories for the characters, both lead <strong>and </strong>supporting. There was an entire episode dedicated to the origin story of Bill and Frank, relatively understated characters in the game but the source of an intense and deeply emotional sub-story in the television series.</p>



<p>It was that episode that pulled in one of The Last of Us’ Emmy Awards.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/last-of-us-season-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-strictly-business-1236155347/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speaking recently to Variety</a>, Druckmann suggested that the concept of diving into important backstories will surface again in the second season:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>And there’s stuff in this season that I’m really excited about — stuff that we hinted at — one scene in particular comes to mind that I think fans of the game will eat up, because it really kind of tells you a lot of backstory of this important character that there wasn’t really a way for us to even do that in the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That could be any number of characters. The Last of Us Part II is diverse, lengthy, and brings together a wild cast of characters in a story that unravels over many hours. Many have suggested that it could be an exploration of ‘Lev’, a runaway ‘Seraphite’ in the game who forms a tight bond with Abby, one of the game’s antagonists.</p>



<p>Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin have been true to the source material of The Last of Us while at the same time pushing their creative license into new ways to portray the universe that was uncovered when the franchise began way back in 2013. There are very few faults with the first season, and the hype for the second remains consistent and high – I’m expecting great things.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Meta Quest 3S Finally Announced, Launches October 15]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-3s-revealed-vr/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-quest-3s-finally-announced-launches-october-15.992202/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-3s-revealed-vr/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Mark ‘The Zuck’ Zuckerberg has taken to the stage at Meta Connect, and one of the first items on his agenda was the official reveal of the Meta Quest 3S. This all-new virtual reality headset represents a more accessible entry point into the world of VR gaming and applications. It’s hitting the market on October 15, and given the specification and price point, it could be one of the best options for anyone picking up their first VR headset.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-bit-of-this-a-bit-of-that">A Bit of This, a Bit of That</h2>



<p>The Meta Quest 3S VR headset is a bit of a mix-and-match device that incorporates elements of the Meta Quest 2 <strong>and </strong>the Meta Quest 3. It features slightly older lenses that might not offer as solid a viewing experience, but it has the same chipset as the Meta Quest 3, which means there’s parity in terms of what it can play, display, and operate.</p>



<p>However, if we put the ‘older’ technology to the side for a second, we’re presented with a VR headset that sits at a very attractive price point. It was confirmed that a 128 GB version of the headset will be released in October for just $300, while the 256 GB version will run with a $400 price tag.</p>



<p>It’ll feature full-colour passthrough technology and a battery life that’s more or less comparable with the Quest 3, it just won’t offer as solid an experience from a viewing perspective, but that’s only because of the less sophisticated lenses.</p>



<p>It also uses the same controllers as the Meta Quest 3, which are easy to get to grips with an very responsive.</p>



<p>If you’ve been hurting for a relatively affordable VR experience, you can’t go wrong with a Meta Quest headset, and now that the 3S is on the horizon, you can get involved for even less. I picked up a Meta Quest 3 a few weeks ago after experiencing the terrifying wonder of Metro Awakening at Gamescom, and I can confirm that it’s the most immersive way to play games that you’ll ever witness.</p>



<p>At least, until we’re plugging ourselves into devices –  but that’s at least a few years away yet.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's financial disclosures this week don't have a lot of good news for investors, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">Star Wars Outlaws</a> debuted to disappointing sales and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows has been delayed</a> to 2025. However, the company did offer an encouraging update about its relationship with Steam. Ubisoft has reversed its previous stance and will now release both Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin's Creed Shadows on Steam, along with other day-one releases.</p><p>In 2019, Ubisoft executive Chris Early explained why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-business-model-is-unrealistic-ubisoft-execu/1100-6469434/" data-ref-id="1100-6469434">the company had pulled back from Steam</a> and shared his thoughts on its business model. "It's unrealistic, the current business model they have," said Early. "It doesn't reflect where the world is today in terms of game distribution."</p><p>Instead of releasing games through Steam, Ubisoft dropped titles through its own online store and via the Epic Games Store. It was widely assumed that Ubisoft continued to support Epic because it takes a smaller percentage of game sales than Steam does. Ubisoft's decision to rethink its relationship with Steam may mean that the company believes it can increase its sales by utilizing that store's wider reach.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws will hit Steam on November 21, while Assassin's Creed Shadow will be released on Steam simultaneously with its debut on consoles on February 14, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/star-of-providence-sets-bigmode-up-for-another-success<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New publisher <a href="https://bigmode.com/">Bigmode</a>, owned by the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/videogamedunkey">videogamedunkey</a>, knocked it out of the park with the company's first title, <em>Animal Well</em>. This indie developed by Billy Basso exceeded expectations from press, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-well-review-icebergs-worth-of-puzzles-deep-below-surface">TechRaptor included</a>. With such an outstanding reception, many are excited to see what comes next for Bigmode, and that game is <em>Star of Providence</em>.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: <em>Star of Providence</em> is already out. It's been out since 2017, and you can buy it on Steam right now. While not unheard of for games to get a new publisher after release, Bigmode's decision to publish this title seemed like a confusing one.</p>
<p>After playing a demo for <em>Star of Providence</em> at PAX West 2024, I wanted to get to the bottom of things.</p>

<h2>What's Bigmode's Role in <em>Star of Providence</em>?</h2>
<p>As it turns out, <em>Star of Providence</em> is insanely fun. How did I miss <em>Star of Providence </em>after so long? Well, the thing to keep in mind is that <em>Star of Providence</em> once went by the title <em>Monolith</em>, which might be one source of confusion. Leah Gastrow of Bigmode was able to provide more context to the publishing decision.</p>
<p>"<em>Star of Providence</em> is a game that, despite its initial Steam release in 2017 and having a dedicated and loving fanbase, we would consider a largely hidden gem," said Gastrow. "Our goals partnering with Team D-13 are broadly - supporting a Switch console launch, localizing to many new languages, funding as the team finishes work on a major content update they have had in the works for a couple of years, and bringing more eyes to the project. We really hope that we’ll be able to translate what’s so special and fun about the game, giving it its day in the sun!"</p>

<p>Bigmode's decision to publisher <em>Star of Providence</em> is a good lesson on the role of publishers in the industry; as Gastrow mentioned, Bigmode brings support in porting the game as well as bringing in a large update for both PC and the Switch version. Having the publisher attached should also create a new fervor for the title.</p>
<p>"It’s come a long way since then and been polished into a real masterwork," said Gastrow. "Some standouts you’ll notice are the buttery smooth controls paired with heart-pounding action and epic, vast soundtrack from Garoslaw. Members of the dev team have also worked with Toby Fox contributing to <em>Deltarune</em>, and all were testers of the game <em>Void Stranger</em>, a sokoban-style puzzle game released in 2023. Basically, they’re the real deal making a real-deal game that we want to do our best to shine a spotlight on and help achieve the success it deserves."</p>

<h2>But is it Fun? Yes, <em>Star of Providence </em>is Very Fun</h2>
<p>Based on my time with the demo from PAX West, <em>Star of Providence</em> is most definitely a special game. I went so far as to buy it on PC to do some <em>brief </em>research on this very article, and found myself addicted to its core gameplay loop. I see what Bigmode sees -- <em>Star of Providence</em> is another hit for the publisher.</p>
<p>To be concise, <em>Star of Providence</em> is a retro-inspired dungeon crawler with SHMUP and roguelite elements. The synthesis between these genres creates a harmonious gameplay loop, one that seems perfect for the portable nature of the Switch.</p>

<p>You pilot this little starship, exploring dungeons room-by-room a la the original <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. With randomized elements, obstacles and enemy placement vary as you progress and get progressively harder as you navigate different floors of the dungeon. No, it's not an unheard of concept, but the way it's executed is what makes <em>Star of Providence</em> so addicting.</p>
<p>Rooms take seconds to clear, so combat is extremely fast. You're constantly awarded with new treasures in the form of weapons, health, and ammo and even stronger upgrades as you progress, making it addicting.</p>
<p>Dying isn't the end since the metaprogression of <em>Star of Providence</em> assures players will have new weapons and other upgrades to play with in subsequent runs. Perhaps the strongest element of <em>Star of Providence</em> are its weapons, with various keywords that change the characteristics of your projectiles.</p>

<p>RNG can grant you this godkilling weapon that homes in on enemies and blasts them constantly with a stream of ridiculous damage, or a not-so-great weapon that's slow and takes time to charge. When you get that big weapon and plow through the rest of your run, that's where <em>Star of Providence</em> shines.</p>
<p>If there was any worry that Bigmode would have a sophomore slump with its next game, well, <em>Star of Providence</em> assuages any fears. Though it's already out, the big content update and launch on the Switch should be the best time to dive into what is possibly your next gaming addiction -- I already know it has <em>me </em>hooked.</p>
