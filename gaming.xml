            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/24/game-of-the-year-2024-best-multiplayer-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If 2024 has shown us anything, it’s that the multiplayer live service boom is well and truly over. Despite being objectively fun to play and super polished, games such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">Suicide Squad</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">XDefiant</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord</a> failed to make a splash – the latter being dead on arrival in one of the biggest gaming flops ever. It casts a grim shadow over the wider multiplayer genre, proving that there’s really only room for a handful of majorly successful online games at one time.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there weren’t any great multiplayer games in 2024, though. While legions of gamers are still glued to Fortnite, Warzone, Counter-Strike, and League of Legends, there have been some hot new contenders, one of them arriving at the start of the year…</p>

<p>Playing big, bombastic shooters with friends is always more fun, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> is the kind of game to remind you that these can also be silly and just funny as well. It takes the satire and violence of Paul Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and adds in a bit of player-led workplace comedy. Sure, it’s fun to call in a huge orbital barrage or minefield on a bug’s nest, but it’s <em>funny</em> to do that five seconds after your team has just rushed in and “forget” to call it out in time.</p>
<p>Arrowhead has always made fun and silly co-op games where the fire is always friendly, and explosions are always excessive, but the jump from the top-down action of the original to a third person view with more realistic graphics just managed to capture the attention of gamers at large. Add to that an engaging meta layer to the game, actively engaging with the community through highs and lows of balance and gameplay changes, and the recent reveal of a new enemy faction, and this is easily the best multiplayer game of the year.</p>

<p><em>– Stefan L</em></p>
<h2>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Through the last generation, it’s felt as though couldn’t so much as blink without a new Warhammer 40,000 game being announced, resulting in a never-ending slew of PC and mobile titles. With 40K having witnessed a huge spike in popularity over the past few years, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a> arrived at the perfect time, with Boltgun and Chainsword in-hand.</p>
<p>What made the sequel such a strong offering was its pairing of a solid campaign with a whole suite of multiplayer options, allowing friends to play through the story together, duke it out in PvP, or run a gauntlet of missions designed for co-op play. There’s a lot of shared DNA with Saber Interactive’s brilliant World War Z video game, enhanced with dynamic melee combat and a heavily expanded arsenal of weaponry plucked from the 41st millennium.</p>
<h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Last year’s Call of Duty wasn’t the flawless end to Infinity Ward’s Modern Warfare trilogy fans had hoped for: it was by no means poor but felt more like a DLC expansion as opposed to a full-blown sequel. Going into 2025, it seemed as though the next Call of Duty would be even further entrenched in a lack of innovation and growing player fatigue. We were wrong to doubt Treyarch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Black Ops 6</a> is the full package: the best CoD campaign in many years, rewardingly layered Zombies co-op, and punchy, tactical online play. On paper it’s a subtle change yet the inclusion of “omnidirectional” player movement adds a silky smoothness that elevates each part of Treyarch’s trifecta. It’s hard to imagine this feature being dropped in future instalments.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst.1068522/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Nintendo will have been watching the recent stream of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> design leaks and is likely now keen to unveil its under-wraps new console as soon as possible, an analyst has said.
</p>
<p>
We've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September</a>. But recent weeks have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">further images posted</a>, this time by accessory companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons</a>, which show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">close estimations for Nintendo's next console</a> in greater detail.
</p>
<p>
In other words, it's now widely expected that Switch 2 will simply look like a slightly larger Switch 1, now with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.
</p>
<p>
So, when will Nintendo finally unveil Switch 2? In early November, industry analyst Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told Eurogamer that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">the company had now run out of time to reveal its Switch successor in 2024</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has set itself a deadline of 31st March 2025</a> to show off its Switch successor, but, considering the leaks, and the falling sales of Switch 1, Toto suggested to Eurogamer today that the company was unlikely to wait that long. 
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo will not have much time in January, so a potential announcement early in the month could make sense," Toto said. "You can bet that Nintendo is aware of all the leaks and not happy about them, even if some of them will turn out to be made up. 
</p>
<p>
"It is actually getting so bad with those leaks that they might cause Nintendo to release information earlier than planned."
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 is widely expected to arrive later in 2025, and while Nintendo is yet to offer any suggestion of timing, we don't have too long now to wait and find out.
</p>
<p>
When Switch 2 does arrive, fans expect next year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-awaited blockbuster Metroid Prime 4</a> to launch on Nintendo's new hardware. Nintendo has also confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch 2 will be backwards compatible</a>.

Wahoo! Etc. You can now listen to tunes from Nintendo's seminal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a> via the Nintendo Music app.
</p>
<p>
Today's additions bring 49 minutes of Super Mario 64 melodies to your ears, across 36 tracks. These include the game's memorable opening theme, that bit of music which plays as you muck about with Mario's face, and the theme for Cool, Cool, Mountain - where you toss the penguin to its death.
</p>
<p>
Want something more chilled? Dire, Dire Docks is an absolute banger. You also have two versions of Piranha Plant's Lullaby to choose from.</p>
<p>Of course, the game's best theme is "Slider" - what you'll know best as Princess Peach's Slide. And yes, you can extend this track up to an hour in length.

            <p>
As more characters join the Sonic the Hedgehog movie series, fans have been curious when their favourite big cat - Big the Cat - will pop up.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-writers-reveal-the-big-the-cat-cameo-that-almost-was">IGN</a> alongside the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, the movie series' writing duo Pat Casey and Josh Miller revealed a Big the Cat cameo had actually been written for the previous film - only to be left on the cutting room floor.
</p>
<p>
(There's no spoilers here for the new movie, we should add.)
</p>
<p>
In <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, Big the Cat would have popped up in skeletal form as Sonic passed through a cave. Within it, viewers would have gotten a quick glimpse at Big's decomposed body. Dark. 
</p>
<p>
Still, confusingly, this might not have been the Big the Cat fans know and love, the duo continued - which perhaps is why the sequence never made it on screen.
</p>

"In one draft of Sonic 2, when they're going through the snowy mountains to the cave, we had a bit, because Sonic 2 was sort of an Indiana Jones," Casey said. 
</p>
<p>
"Indiana Jones, it's a trope that at some point a skeleton pops out at you and scares you. So we were going to do that, but with a skeleton of a, I would say, a Big the Cat, not necessarily-"
</p>
<p>
"Not necessarily the Big the Cat," Miller interjected.
</p>
<p>
"But we ended up cutting it," Casey concluded. "It didn't make any sense."
</p>
<p>
So, no Big the Cat. But on the upside, for fans of the character, no dead Big the Cat either.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-knock-off-appears-on-nintendo-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Myth Wukong, Game Science’s latest action RPG, is the latest title to receive a knock-off on the Nintendo e-shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Black Myth Wukong knock-off on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wukong-sun-black-legend-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo eShop</a> is titled “Wukong Sun: Black Legend,” which couldn’t be more obvious. The title will be released on December 26, 2024, for the Nintendo Switch and can be purchased for $7.99. Even the cover art is heavily inspired by the cover art used by Game Science for their game. For those wondering, Black Myth Wukong wasn’t released for the Switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It gets worse when you read the description for the Black Myth Wukong knock-off, as it states the following:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Embark on an epic Journey to the West in Wukong Sun: Black Legend! Step into the role of the immortal Wukong, the legendary Monkey King, as he battles through a chaotic world teeming with powerful monsters and untold dangers. Explore a story inspired by Chinese mythology, filled with action-packed battles, stunning environments, and legendary foes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, the gameplay for this Black Myth Wukong clone is miles apart from the original title. From the screenshots on the store page, it seems like Wukong Sun: Black Legend is a 2D, side-scrolling game where you fight various enemies and bosses in four different biomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clones and knocks-offs are not new in the gaming world; whenever any title goes viral, we see copies of that game floating around different stores. Last year, we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a clone of The Last of Us</a> appear on the Nintendo eShop, too, and just this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-copy-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a rip-off of Gary Zone Warfare</a> was seen on the PlayStation Store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Science CEO recently revealed his views</a> on Black Myth Wukong not winning GOTY. Also, the title helped push <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China’s gaming industry to new heights</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-shooter-of-2024-best-fps-tps-games-this-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-shooter-of-2024%E2%80%94best-fps-tps-games-this-year.1068486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-shooter-of-2024-best-fps-tps-games-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This year has been wild for shooters, with bullets ricocheting all over the place and in different ways. So let’s give you a guide to Insider Gaming’s 2024 best shooter of the year, across FPS and TPS games.</p>



<p>Choosing the best shooter of 2024 boils down to several key aspects: Gunplay, Story, Sound Design, and how much we rage when we play it—maybe not the last one. It’s easy to whip up a few levels or maps, stick some enemies in it, and declare it a shooter, but at the core of the genre is so much more than this.</p>



<p>A shooter needs to hit all the senses: It should look good, and feel good, and the intense sound of whirring bullets should instill uneasiness due to realism and authenticity. Every game I’m about to discuss for Insider Gaming’s best shooter of 2024 award hits this in droves, but only one can be king of the hill.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-shooter-of-2024-winner-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Best Shooter of 2024 Winner — Call of Duty Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of stopping power this time around. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> does what few CoD titles have done in recent years—innovates. Once you’ve dived (literally) into omnidirectional movement, it’s <em>impossible</em> to go back. Your Operator glides around with a buttery smoothness I’ve craved for so long and you quickly wonder where it’s been all this time. </p>



<p>The campaign is juicy and jaunty and features one of the most intense and exciting story missions in years. Zombies is back and better than ever, with a bundle of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapons</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-super-hero-easter-egg-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter Eggs</a>, and everything you could want from the undead merry-go-round of round-based Zombies. Finally, the multiplayer brings back the classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-level-is-prestige-1-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige System</a> we love so much, makes the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-black-ops-6-mastery-camo-in-multiplayer-zombies-warzone-all-camos-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastery Camo</a> grind the simplest and most accessible it’s ever been, and outside of the usual bugs, it looks to be a great year ahead.</p>



<p>The sheer mention of a new Call of Duty title is enough to give many players the ick. However, Black Ops 6 shouldn’t as it’s a fantastic entry, and I would argue it rejuvenates the long-running first-person shooter series for the first time in a long time. CoD has been in the doldrums for several years now with the lackluster (and recycled) Modern Warfare 3 feeling low-effort, Modern Warfare 2 feeling like a solid entry, and nothing more, and a dependable but forgettable Vanguard. </p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is the best iteration since Black Ops Cold War—also made by Treyarch and Raven Software—and I stand by this. It’s not a perfect Call of Duty, and very few are, but it’s the complete package we’re looking for in a shooter, and Black Ops 6 deserves the best shooter of 2024 recognition.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-shooters-of-2024-nominations">Best Shooters of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>We feel Black Ops 6 rightfully took the top spot. However, it might pique your interest to know who else we had up our sleeves for the best shooter of 2024 category. Everything is subjective at the end of the day, so let’s see if your favorite shooter was among our honorable mentions.</p>



<h3 id="h-xdefiant">XDefiant</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It was onto something. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ubisoft’s XDefiant started the year as one of the most hyped titles of 2024—dubbed the “Call of Duty killer.” It does a lot of what FPS fans are asking for: Gets rid of SBMM, actively listens to and acts on player feedback, tracks XP properly, and tries to avoid bugs. Fast forward to the end of the year, and suddenly years of development are up in smoke as Ubisoft announces <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant is shutting down</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s take nothing away from XDefiant though. I loved my time with it, and it possesses some of the snappiest and most engaging shooting mechanics from a newcomer in years. However, it still doesn’t feel like a massive step away from CoD, and its hero abilities and microtransactions were too much for many in the community—possibly contributing to the FPS title’s quick downfall.</p>



<h3 id="h-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl</h3>



<figure><figcaption>As eerie as ever. Credit to GSC Game World</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl is one of two single-player-focused nominations in this category. We head into the Zone to uncover the mystery behind anomalies, and artifacts, and do our best to survive. Ukraine’s radiation-plagued world is a magnificent, mysterious, and mortifying world, unfortunately, marred by questions about its quality. </p>



<p>If you read almost any <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl review</a>, one theme is prevalent throughout—technical issues and bugs. Stalker 2 seems to be in a better state post-launch compared to its hampered debut; nevertheless, we need to stamp out giving games free passes with the allure of fixing them later. That being said, Stalker 2 is the perfect example of how shooters can be original, why single-player titles are needed, and not everything needs to be online multiplayer with live-service elements.</p>



<h3 id="h-helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Buggy, in a different way. Credit to Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>The biggest surprise hit of 2024 easily goes to Arrowhead Game Studios and Helldivers 2. A live-service shooter not immediately sentenced to purgatory like some of its other contemporaries around the same time—<em>you </em>were thinking Suicide Squad, I said it. You’re tasked with saving and protecting Super Earth using an array of weapons and fun Strategems that can either scurry a turret to your location or drop a devastating bomb and kill everyone.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was a huge success <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling 12 million units in 12 weeks</a>, but its reputation was soured somewhat by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Account controversy</a>. This isn’t why we didn’t give the win to Helldivers 2 though; it gets a ton of credit for its world-building and marketing, and rightly so. But the gameplay itself can get repetitive—even with friends—and the thrill of annihilating Automatons feels like it has an expiry date. Still, plenty to build on here for Helldivers 3, and it’s great to see a new multiplayer game smash it.</p>



<h3 id="h-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Classic gameplay. Credit to Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>My goodness, I miss single-player-driven shooters. Like Stalker 2, the main emphasis for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is its story, dramatic events, riveting visuals, and epic battles. As an almighty Space Marine with unreal strength and combat abilities, you tussle with Tyranids&nbsp;throughout a several-hour-long campaign. This is one sticking point for Space Marine 2—its campaign length—but it has plenty of replayability, and I understand the comparison to Black Ops 6’s story length.</p>



<p>Space Marine 2 compares favorably to the over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter style of fan favorites like Gears of War. It’s somewhat of a niche by today’s standards, and I’m keen to see more of this. Overall, a minor lack of originality and a less-than-stellar multiplayer component edge Warhammer’s newest shooter out of the top spot.</p>

With discounts on everything from massive open world RPGs to pixel-art platformers, it can be tough to limit yourself to just a few games. While I'm all for splurging on 2024 releases, if you're looking to maximize bang for your buck, you could also pick up a solid bunch of slightly older (but still amazing) PC games. For example, right now you can get over 10 copies of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/Fallout_New_Vegas/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout: New Vegas</a> for the price of one <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A starting point for Steam sales should always be checking your Wishlist, but if you're looking for something new (or want to make sure you're not missing an obvious deal), I found 33 of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-games">best PC games</a> for $10 or less. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Complete Edition of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for $10</strong></h2><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213711"><div id="213711" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher 3's massive open world, compelling characters, and meaningful approach to player decision-making raised the bar for RPGs back in 2015.

I recommend Little Nightmares to any horror fan, while the 2020 Ori sequel offers particularly creative puzzles. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Civilization VI for $2.99</h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213739"><div id="213739" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sid Meier’s Civilization VI</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Civ VII</a> set to release in just a couple of months, most of the Sid Meier franchise is on sale. While I prefer Civ V's map mechanics, Civ VI, in my experience, is better optimized for setting up multiplayer lobbies. Convince your friends to drop a couple of bucks, and you can all lock into an empire-building marathon that will most likely end in some form of betrayal. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>More Strategy and Simulation Games Under $10: </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Most Total War games and DLCs are discounted, though one of the best deals is the Warhammer base game for $6. And if you've ever wanted to travel across the entirety of Europe for $5, now you can (with Euro Truck Simulator 2). </p><h2 data-cy="title2">75% Off Overcooked 2</h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213745"><div id="213745" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Overcooked 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something cheap you can convince your friends to pick up and play with you, look no further than Overcooked 2. The cooperative cooking game allows up to four players to hop into a campaign that, with arcade-style levels and goofy physics, will probably lead to some screaming. But, as IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/07/overcooked-2-review">Overcooked 2 review</a> describes, this "frantic and inventive co-op game... manages to turn frustration into charm."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Co-op Games Under $10: </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">For larger groups, I also recommend For the King and Castle Crashers. It Takes Two is one of the best games for two-player co-op, and only one person has to buy the game courtesy of Hazelight Studio's "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2995920/It_Takes_Two_Friends_Pass/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Friend's Pass</a>." And, of course, Portal 2, down to just $2, will always be a co-op classic. </p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 23, 2024 10:37 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-holiday-break-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s the end of the year as we know it, and we’re feeling fine – largely because we are all blessedly taking a soft break and have already begun to regenerate the many cells we obliterated in the course of running an independent video game website for just over 365 days. In the short term, this means there will be fewer blogs on the site as we rest and recuperate for the next couple weeks. But! We’ll still be running stories here and there.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, we’d like to thank all of you for the incredible support you’ve shown this past year. Aftermath – and the many fun, interesting, and occasionally indulgent pieces we’ve been able to write – wouldn’t exist without you. Independence is empowering but also terrifying; there’s no institutional safety net to catch us when we fall (and then unceremoniously lay us off about it). By subscribing, you’ve provided us with assurance that you, our readers, have our backs and value what we do. We plan to continue making it worth your while. We’ve got big plans for next year, and we hope you’re as excited as we are to see what’s to come.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, though, if you need some holiday reading – or if you’re just joining us, as many of you did during our anniversary sale last month – here are some of our greatest hits:</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/how-a-leftist-meme-account-accidentally-fooled-everyone-into-believing-a-famous-quote-came-from-final-fantasy-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How A Leftist Meme Account Accidentally Fooled Everyone Into Believing A Famous Quote Came From Final Fantasy</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/making-a-skating-game-set-in-palestine-has-become-an-act-of-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Making A Skating Game Set In Palestine Has Become An Act Of Resistance</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It's Exhausting To Read Video Game Website Headlines</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/the-worlds-best-stereo-system-what-happened-ken-fritz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Happened To “The World’s Best Stereo System?”</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/dry-january-sober-curious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You Could Just Keep Doing Dry January</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games Journalism: An FAQ</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why So Many Games Journalists End Up Going Into Game Development&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-fandom-parasocial-heartbreak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Very Dumb Reason Why I Can’t Play Final Fantasy VII</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nobody Needs To Know How Many People Are Playing A Singleplayer Video Game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This year saw a lot of majorly successful games on Steam, with the best sellers being revealed based on total gross revenue earned in 2024. Although these are the top-selling games, the revenue for the titles hasn't been revealed, and they are separated into categories. If you want to see what games are in each category, you can check out the official list on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/bestof2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Steam page</a>. The categories are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platinum: 1st-12th</li>
<li>Gold 13th-24th</li>
<li>Silver 25th-50th</li>
<li>Bronze 51st-100th</li>
</ul>
<p>As there are a lot of games, we won't be discussing every single one that has made it onto the top charts. There are also sub-categories into which the games are organized. On the Steam page, you'll see there are categories for Top Sellers, New Releases, Most Played, Steam Deck, Controller, and VR. This allows you to see what statistics they are measured by, which includes top concurrent players as well as top-grossing revenue for the year.</p>
<p>In the platinum category for top-grossing revenue, live-service games like Apex Legends and Counter-Strike 2 continue to be on top, alongside games like PUBG Battlegrounds and Destiny 2. When it comes to premium titles, it's no surprise that award-winning titles like Black Myth: Wukong, Baldur's Gate 3, and Elden Ring are on the list. This year saw Black Myth: Wukong win <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">multiple awards</a> at various ceremonies, with Shadow of the Erdtree raking in a couple, too. Despite being released last year, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to be majorly successful, and Larian Studios is dedicated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/">providing consistent updates</a> and new content for players to dive into.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at the New Releases category, titles like Path of Exile II, Heldivers 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and, of course, Black Myth: Wukong are all in the platinum category. When it comes to how they decide which games go into the platinum category, they look at the first two weeks of the game's revenue after its released, and that is the deciding factor as to which game is best-selling and is deserving of being in the platinum category.</p>
<p>When it comes to peak concurrent players, most of the games are live-service titles that have been out for a while. Specifically, the top-played games with over 450,000 peak players are in the category, which consists of games like Apex Legends, Counter-Strike 2, and the newly released title Marvel Rivals. However, there are some premium games on there, such as Helldivers 2, Black Myth: Wukong, and Elden Ring.</p>
<p>While 2024 has felt like a bit of a quieter year for gaming, there have been some majorly successful releases, with some of them going on to win multiple awards.</p>
<p>What has been your top game of 2024?</p>

The series is returning with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in 2025, ending a drought of 26 years without a new title. It will feature the return of characters from past games, most notably series star Terry Bogard and his protege Rock Howard. Other fan favorites, like Mai Shiranui and Billy Kane, will also be included and get updated designs.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/mai-shiranui-1734114693442.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">City of the Wolves will act as a continuation of the previous game in the series, Garou: Mark of the Wolves. The T.O.P. system, now called the S.P.G. system, makes a return. It allows you to pick a section of your health bar (either the start, middle, or end), and when your health is in that range, your S.P.G. will activate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When your S.P.G. is active, you’ll regenerate health, have boosted attack power, your power gauge will fill faster, your REV Meter will fill slower, and you can perform REV Blows. Those last two points are part of an important new mechanic in City of the Wolves called the REV System. REV Blows blend together offense and defense, allowing you to strike hard while also shrugging off enemy attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can combo into these after REV Arts, which can be used after a special move to perform a stronger version of said move. And REV Guard is a unique type of block that creates more space between you and your opponent than a regular block and also eliminates chip damage from special attacks.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/rev-arts-1734115338277.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these actions build up the REV Meter in the bottom left corner of the screen, and once the meter is full, you’ll become overheated. While in this state, you won’t be able to use REV actions anymore and your guard gauge will decrease whenever you block attacks. If the gauge runs out, your guard will be crushed and you’ll take longer to recover from being hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your REV Meter slowly reduces as time passes, as well as when you walk or dash toward your enemy, land an attack, or successfully use Just Defense or Hyper Defense. The former happens when you block an attack at exactly the right moment, while the latter happens when you do a forward input at exactly the right moment of a multi-hit attack.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/just-defense-1734114814867.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This REV System adds a strategic layer to each fight, since you can’t simply use powerful REV actions over and over. You need to keep an eye on your REV Meter and balance aggressive offense with well-timed defense to avoid overheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first time in the series, you’ll also be able to choose between two different control schemes that will determine the button inputs needed to execute each of these moves. Known as Arcade Style and Smart Style, they’re designed to provide options for players experienced with the series as well as newcomers diving in for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re excited to dive into Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, it’s available to pre-order and wishlist now ahead of its release date of April 24, 2025 on PC, PS4/5, and Xbox Series X/S. Pre-order bonuses include Terry’s classic costume from Fatal Fury 2 and early access to the game on April 21, three days before release.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/rev-meter-1734115446297.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The base price of $59.99 also includes Season Pass 1 and five DLC characters. We already know who two of those characters will be: Ken and Chun-Li from Street Fighter, the first non-SNK collab characters ever featured in a Fatal Fury game. This marks the continuation of a collaboration between the two franchises after Terry and Mai were featured in Street Fighter 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d like to pre-order, you can visit <a href="https://www.snk-corp.co.jp/us/games/fatalfury-cotw/index.html#product_unchor" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official website</a> to pick the platform you’d like to play on.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-is-leading-mufasa-the-lion-king-in-the-box-office-race-after-one-lap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3">Sonic The Hedgehog 3</a> is off to a fast start at the domestic box office, pulling in $62 million during its opening weekend. That’s significantly more than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/mufasa-the-lion-king">Mufasa: The Lion King</a> managed — Disney’s live action prologue made $35 million during the same time period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an early victory for Sonic, then, but there's a slightly different story globally. Mufasa: The Lion King opened to $87.2 million internationally, which, combined with its domestic haul, is enough to make it the number one global release of the weekend with $122.2 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Sonic The Hedgehog 3 is yet to launch in all international markets, so a proper global comparison won’t be possible until next weekend’s numbers are in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Paramount be pleased with Sonic 3's performance so far? Sonic the Hedgehog 3 opened above the original 2020 Sonic the Hedgehog’s $58 million and just below 2022’s Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ($72 million). Both films will hope for stickiness over the holiday period and into the New Year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like a positive picture for Sonic, but a disappointing one for Mufasa. <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/box-office-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-starts-strong-mufasa-lion-king-misfires-opening-weekend-1236257432/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> called it a “terrible” start domestically, given Mufasa cost more than $200 million to produce and roughly $100 million to promote. Sonic the Hedgehog 3, on the other hand, cost $122 million and still has its international release to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no surprise, then, that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-is-officially-in-the-works-at-paramount-for-spring-2027-release">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is already confirmed</a>.

IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-beyonce-donald-glover-barry-jenkins">Mufasa: The Lion King review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Barry Jenkins’ Mufasa is a strong, uncomplicated effort that should charm kids. The Moonlight director's involvement in a CGI-heavy Disney prequel caused serious film lovers to wring their hands, but the results speak for themselves: This is simply a lovely movie.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

In breathtaking fashion, 60 seconds of Season 1‘s final episode ask a terrifying question: What if the war with thinking machines isn’t over yet?</p><p>In the season finale, Sister Tula (Olivia Williams) and Sister Nazir (Karima McAdams) discover that the virus Hart has been whistling into people’s bodies, like a maniacal Pied Piper, feeds off of people’s fear. The virus burns the infected from the inside, attacking the amygdala, its power increasing as the victim succumbs to more fear. It’s still unclear how it may spread, or why nearly all of the Bene Gesserit in training were able to all have the same nightmares in past episodes. But, when we do find out what it is they’re seeing, the entire <em>Dune</em> universe is flipped upside down.</p><p>After confronting Hart near the end of the episode, Mother Superior Valya Harkonnen (Emily Watson) is able to fend off the virus, preventing it from feasting on her fears, and finally sees those glowing eyes shrouded in darkness that everyone infected were seeing. She, and everyone else, saw Hart’s traumatic experience of being swallowed by Shai-Hulud and then having the virus implanted into his right eye by a thinking machine while being watched by a shadowy figure. Unless Hart was devoured and then transported elsewhere, or never truly devoured at all, this would all but confirm that thinking machines had put Shai-Hulud under their control. </p><p>Their collaboration would make a lot of sense. When, in the penultimate episode, the spirit of Mother Superior Raquella Berto-Anirul (Cathy Tyson), in control of the body of her descendant Lila (Chloe Lea), examines the brain of Sister Kasha—Hart’s first Bene Gesserit victim—she sees a resemblance to a bioweapon used by thinking machines to kill humans by attacking their livers. Also, in the series premiere, Mother Superior Raquella, while on her deathbed decades before the events of <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>, saw a vision of the same burning flesh that resulted from anyone infected by Hart’s virus. She had that vision right after seeing Shai-Hulud devour Wallach IX, the home of the Sisterhood.</p><h2 id="h188055"><a id=""></a>This Changes A Lot For Season 2 And Next <em>Dune</em> Movie </h2><figure id="" data-id="5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-recommend-id="image://5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three people walking into Arrakis" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three people walking into Arrakis" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Courtesy of HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-recommend-id="image://5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three people walking into Arrakis" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a good thing HBO let the world know the series was renewed for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-season-2-hbo-bebe-gesserit-news-1851725756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-season-2-hbo-bebe-gesserit-news-1851725756">second season</a></span> before the season finale aired, because there would’ve been online riots demanding more episodes after the cliffhangers it leaves us with otherwise. In the season’s final moments, Tula reveal to Valya that Hart is the child whose death she lied to her sister about, and Valya embarks on an expedition trip to Arrakis with Princess Ynez Corrino (Sarah-Sofie Bousnina) and Kieran Atreides (Chris Mason). Those moments, in conjunction with the Shai-Hulud twist, show that <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>’s next season could be what sets up the Fremen being included in the show after an entire season of their absence. It also sets the stage for the next season to begin explaining how the Harkonnen and Atreides went from mortal enemies to collaborators in birthing the Messiah to lead humanity. </p><p>But this revelation of the thinking machines’ integration with Shai-Hulud also means the next season will likely see a showdown between the Bene Gesserit and the thinking machines. Valya remarks that the sisterhood came to Arrakis because “the path to our enemy begins here,” foreshadowing future conflict. As for the next <em>Dune </em>movie, the <em>Prophecy </em>season finale opens the door for the possibility that the sandworms that govern Arrakis in the films could still have a connection to thinking machines that has either been neutralized over the last 10,000 years, repurposed for their own benefits, or a combination of both. The prospect of thinking machines operating on humans inside of Shai-Hulud, not unlike the Fremen using the sandworms as transportation, opens the door for the possibility of some entity controlling those sandworms for their own motive. That person could possibly be Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) when he fully becomes the Messiah.</p><p>It also can’t be a coincidence that the first person used by Shai-Hulud and thinking machines to bring Mother Superior Raquella’s destructive prophecy to fruition is the son of a Harkonnen and an Atreides, just like Paul Atreides is in the films. That, and Kieran embarking on an expedition with the current Mother Superior and the Bene Gesserit’s selection for ruler of the Imperium, could ultimately end up being footnotes in a long Atreides history that is glossed over in blood by the events of the next <em>Dune </em>movie. But the <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> season finale could foreshadow the lasting effects of the thinking machines’ virus, including it being genetically passed on in some fashion. </p><p>Does it sound far-fetched that thinking machines would embed a dormant contingency plan in the bloodline of a family set to birth the Messiah? Sure. Does it sound more far-fetched than thinking machines operating on a human being inside of a giant sandworm, infecting that person with a virus that feeds on fear? Absolutely not. We’ll just have to wait and see what <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> has done to the <em>Dune</em> universe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/retro-gamers-save-one-of-the-last-45-inch-crt-tvs-in-existence/</link>

          <p>At this point, any serious retro gamer knows that a bulky cathode ray tube (CRT) TV provides <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/10/11/are-crt-tvs-important-for-retro-gaming/">the most authentic</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/video-demonstrates-the-marvel-of-crt-displays-at-380000-frames-per-second/">lag-free experience</a> for game consoles that predate the era of flat-panel HDTVs (i.e,. before the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 era). But modern gamers used to massive flat panel HD displays might balk at the display size of the most common CRTs, which tend to average in the 20- to 30-inch range (depending on the era they were made).</p>
<p>For those who want the absolute largest CRT experience possible, Sony's KX-45ED1 model (aka PVM-4300) has become the stuff of legends. The massive 45-inch CRT was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/xuhbb9/biggest_trinitron_ever_the_kx45ed1_it_was_sold/">sold in the late '80s</a> for a whopping $40,000 (over $100,000 in today's dollars), according to contemporary reports.</p>
<p>That price means it wasn't exactly a mass-market product, and the limited supply has made it something of a white whale for CRT enthusiasts to this day. While a few pictures have emerged of the PVM-4300 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/liyitz/the_picture_of_kx45ed1_aka_pvm4300/">in the wild</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/444560212348840/posts/2936345963170240/">in marketing materials</a>, no collector has stepped forward with detailed footage of a working unit.</p>

In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZxOuc9Qwk">a fascinating 35-minute video</a> posted this weekend, he details his years-long effort to find and secure a PVM-4300 from a soon-to-be-demolished restaurant in Japan and preserve it for years to come.</p>
<h2>A confirmed white whale sighting</h2>
<p>Shank Mods' quest started in earnest in October 2022, when the moderator of <a href="https://consolemods.org/wiki/CRT:PVM-4300">the Console Modding wiki</a>, Derf, reached out with a tip on a PVM-4300 sighting in the wild. A 7-year-old Japanese blog post included a photo of the massive TV that could be sourced to a waiting room of the Chikuma Soba noodle restaurant and factory in Osaka, Japan.</p>
<p>The find came just in time, as Chikuma Soba's website said the restaurant was scheduled to move to a new location in mere days, after which the old location would be demolished. Shank Mods <a href="https://x.com/ShankMods/status/1583261045316993024">took to Twitter</a> looking to recruit an Osaka local in a last-ditch effort to save the TV from destruction. Local game developer <a href="https://x.com/Bebetheman">Bebe Tinari</a> responded to the call and managed to visit the site, confirming that the TV still existed and even turned on.</p>
