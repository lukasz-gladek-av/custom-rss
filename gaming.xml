How did we end up with a full-length film about a hunter with daddy issues before Doctor Octopus, who has been terrorizing Spider-Man on film for 20 years, got a starring role? Why waste Donald Glover on a glorified Easter egg version of Prowler? Why are we acting like Kingpin doesn’t do more than fight the blind lawyer dressed up as a demon? We need answers, but we’ll take feature films instead.</p><p>To make our case, we’ve rounded up the nine best candidates for their own time in the spotlight, along with some ideas about what <em>kind</em> of genre movie they should star in. If you’re familiar with Spider-Man’s foes, you’ll know a lot of these—and likely agree with us.

An approach that leans into what Sam Raimi brought to the character in <em>Spider-Man 2</em> would work, which is to say, making him an aspirational scientist whose ambition goes past his reach, resulting in a flawed yet deeply human character.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-recommend-id="image://227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Lizard yelling at Spider-Man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Lizard yelling at Spider-Man" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-recommend-id="image://227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Lizard yelling at Spider-Man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Dr. Curt Connors’ story could come across a bit like the plot of <em>Morbius—</em>a tortured scientist is looking to science to fix a tragedy, only to have another tragedy befall him. There’s a way to play the story as a “creature feature” genre piece that mixes horror and pathos by having Connors be both Frankenstein and his misunderstood monster. Either way, it can’t be any worse than <em>Morbius</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-recommend-id="image://37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mister Negative staring menacingly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mister Negative staring menacingly" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-recommend-id="image://37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mister Negative staring menacingly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not dissimilar to Lizard’s, Mister Negative’s story is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde situation that would naturally lend itself to a riff on that narrative format. Have Martin Li do good by day as the head of charity org Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter and Training (F.E.A.S.T.), and try to take over New York’s criminal underworld by night. That tension is a tried and true recipe that always works, allowing for a compellingly rich story.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0d6d906520a7f0831e2ae5467b8abc74" data-recommend-id="image://0d6d906520a7f0831e2ae5467b8abc74" data-format="png" data-width="1537" data-height="824" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Cat preparing to strike" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Cat preparing to strike" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d6d906520a7f0831e2ae5467b8abc74" data-recommend-id="image://0d6d906520a7f0831e2ae5467b8abc74" data-format="png" data-width="1537" data-height="824" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Cat preparing to strike" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, if Catwoman can get a movie, so can Black Cat. As one of the few female anti-heroes in the Spider-Man rogues’ gallery, this one feels like low-hanging fruit. Think of it now: a charming, roguish young Felicia Hardy is hired to pull off a heist that no one else is capable of doing. It’s <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> meets cape stuff.

An ancient primordial deity, he’s one of Marvel’s most powerful villains, a being of pure evil. <em>Last Dance</em> saw him send some of his monsters after Venom, but what if his solo film focused on the Symbiotes and how they trapped him in the first place? Or an old cosmo society coming across him for the first time and having a horrific, <em>Alien</em>-like experience? Just make it scary as hell, and we’ll be in a good spot.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-details-assassins-creed-shadows-combat-including-wandering-ronin-katanas-and-hidden-blades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has shared a deep dive into combat in the Feudal Japan-set <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, detailing enemies such as wandering ronin and weapons such as katanas and the iconic hidden blade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> from Ubisoft promised a huge amount of variety in Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was originally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">due out in November before being delayed to February 14</a>. "The protagonist you're playing as and the weapon you're using dramatically alters combat," the developer said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has already outlined the two different characters playable in Assassin's Creed Shadows, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-brings-back-double-assassinations">stealthy assassin Naoe</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">savage samurai Yasuke</a>. Putting different weapons in their hands will change the playstyle, though Naoe only has three options while Yasuke has five.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows - Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Assassin's Creed Shadows Weapons</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe's standard weapon is a katana, a slim sword with a good balance of speed, damage output, and defense. Correctly timed attacks stagger enemies and the katana also allows a nasty takedown through folding doors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When stealth goes wrong and full combat is required, Naoe may prefer to use the Kusarigama, an extendable ball and chain attached to a scythe which can reach enemies a a distance and push back multiple at once. Once some distance is created, players can use the Rush Assassinate attack to close the distance and take down an enemy up to ten metres away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, for pure stealth approaches, the Tanto and Hidden Blade combo allows for lightning fast stabs, dubbed "the ideal weapon for that strike-and-retreat, death-by-a-thousand-cuts playstyle." This option unlocks Double Assassinations, the iconic takedown method finally returning in Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuke's weapons are fully catered to cutting down enemies in open combat, as his basic weapon is a long katana equally efficient in attack and defense. Also capable of fighting multiple enemies at once is the Naginata, a two metre long pole with blade on the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft deems the Kanabo the deadliest weapon possessed by Yasuke, however, as this long wooden mace of sorts can break through enemies' defenses with ease, at the cost of speed and mobility, of course. Yasuke also has two ranged weapons, the long range yumi bow and destructive teppo rifle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Assassin's Creed Shadows Enemies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will have plenty of opportunities to use these weapons as Assassin's Creed Shadows features "numerous and varied" enemies. These include outlaws, ashigaru soldiers, ronin, samurai, samurai daisho, and guardians.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outlaws and ashigaru soldiers are the meekest among them, the former being regular bandits roaming Japan and the latter being standard foot soldiers who are trained in the basics but no more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Samurai are a harder chalenge. "Superb warriors, well-trained and fierce in combat, samurai can carry a wide variety of weapons, from their trusty katana to the mighty kanabo; they can also wear an impressive selection of armor sets, including some very high level end game ame sets, and employ a surprising number of attacks and counterattacks in a fight," Ubisoft said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These offshoot in three different ways too. Ronin are paradoxically described as "masterless samurai" but "in the employ of Naoe and Yasuke's enemies," so will wander the land and attack the player on sight. Samurai daisho go the other way, as these enemies are only found in military castles and usually defend some serious loot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, guardians are an elite group of samurai used as reinforcements when the alarm is raised in any given province. "With their unmistakable white manes and facemasks, Guardians aim to strike fear in their opponents, and offer some of the most difficult combat you'll find in Assassin's Creed Shadows," Ubisoft said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Assassin's Creed Shadows Combat</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of more modern Assassin's Creed games will be familiar with the Dark Souls-esque combat returning in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Players can once again deploy simple light attacks and heavy attacks alongside what's called a posture attack: essentially a charged version of either basic move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mixing light, heavy and posture attacks is the best way to build up different types of complex combos," Ubisoft said, and players should look to put enemies in a vulnerable state. This is a short window where devastating damage can be dealt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can once again dodge to avoid incoming attacks, plus deflect and parry with their own weapons. Blocking is a mechanic unique to Yasuke, allowing him "to turtle up behind his weapon and withstand attacks including incoming arrows or kunai."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Familiar combat actions including flurry attacks, unstoppable actions, and defensive actions are also making a return, alongside typical skills and ability mechanics.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is changing up a handful of practices behind the scenes of Assassin's Creed Shadows despite bringing back old mechanics. It's ditching its main paid content model of releasing a Season Pass with two main, paid expansion drops in the year after launch, for example. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-price-drops-50-amid-cancelled-season-pass-and-early-access">The faux "early access" period</a> that sees publishers charge players more to play on the actual release date instead of three days later has also been scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Releasing myriad pieces of downloadable content for free will perhaps bring some Assassin's Creed fans back on-side in what's otherwise been a particularly rough pre-launch campaign for Ubisoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Issues began as some fans expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make Shadows as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes as fans are already frustrated by the delay to the game, which puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>. This is also expected in 2025 and is another open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>BioWare has released a free timed trial for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, allowing anyone with an EA Play subscription to check out the game for a limited time at no extra cost. EA Play is included with Game Pass Ultimate, so subscribers to that service get this, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The timed trial lets you play the full game, but only for a period of five hours. Time spent in the in-game character creator counts toward the five hours, but you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-celebrates-dragon-age-day-with-free-veilguard-character-creator-and-retro-armor-set/1100-6528234/" data-ref-id="1100-6528234">use the standalone character creator tool</a> to create a hero outside of the game and then import them from the same device/console.</p><p dir="ltr">EA Play by itself costs $6/month or $40/year. EA Play Pro, meanwhile, costs $17/month or $120/year. EA Play Pro members get all manner of extras for The Veilguard, including cosmetics and armor sets.</p><p dir="ltr">After the five hours is up, players can purchase The Veilguard outright to keep playing. Currently, the game is marked down to $50 on Amazon--you can use the link below to learn more.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="113807316" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

However, BioWare is planning another update for early 2025, though it's unknown what this patch might include.</p><p dir="ltr">It was about a decade between Dragon Age: Inquisition and The Veilguard, and due in part to this extensive gap, BioWare admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-was-never-going-to-live-up-to-fan-hype-dev-says/1100-6528238/" data-ref-id="1100-6528238">The Veilguard was never going to live up to the hype.</a> GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a> scored the game an 8/10.</p>

That’s a lot of cool features for PC players--and at this rock-bottom price, it’s an easy recommendation for anyone seeking a family-friendly platformer.

"It's a fun little romp of a platformer, with lots of interesting moments. At times, the visual design can look a bit flat. Even in those moments, though, the tight controls and interesting level layouts create gameplay challenges that make those flaws easy to overlook."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4413102-sackboy-ps4-special-edition-game.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4413102" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4413102-sackboy-ps4-special-edition-game.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4413102"></a><figcaption>Sackboy: A Big Adventure Special Edition with Plushie</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4413102-sackboy-ps4-special-edition-game.jpg"></figure><p>This isn’t the only version of the game getting a price cut ahead of the holidays, as you’ll also find <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%2F%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-games%2Fsackboy-a-big-adventure-special-edition-ps4&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsackboy-for-pc-is-only-12-59-at-amazon-ps5-special-edition-with-plush-is-50%2F1100-6528342%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sackboy: A Big Adventure Special Edition for PS4</a> discounted to $50 (was $90).

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a> developer People Can Fly has announced its second round of layoffs in less than a year, this time affecting "more than 120" people. The move accompanies the cancellation or downsizing of several projects, with the studio blaming "external market pressures".

</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/people-can-fly_important-update-from-sebastian-wojciechowski-activity-7272297186732769281-1zXp">statement announcing its latest layoffs</a>, People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski wrote, "Today, we made a very difficult decision to reduce our self-publishing strategy by suspending Project Victoria, scaling down our team on Project Bifrost and restructuring some of our supporting teams at People Can Fly."
</p>
<p>
"We are deeply saddened by the fact that this situation means suspending or parting ways with more that 120 talented Aviators," Wojciechowski continued, "colleagues who we enjoyed having as part of our team... This action became necessary as external market pressures persisted beyond our forecasts. The video game market is still evolving, and we have to adjust with where things are today. We are doubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game.
</p>
<p>
"We believe in our teams, games and their potential, and we remain extremely committed to continuing that journey, but we need to tailor our plans to our financial capacity... We are deeply grateful for the contributions of every team member impacted by this turn of events; their talent and dedication have helped shape our company and our games. These changes are deeply felt by all." Wojciechowski added the studio is providing "resources and assistance" to those impacted by the job cuts, and remains "equally committed to caring for those staying, who are managing the challenges of losing coworkers and friends."
</p><p>
People Can Fly's latest round of layoffs follows the studio's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-developer-people-can-fly-reportedly-lays-off-over-30-employees">cut "over 30" jobs</a> in January this year. Those layoffs followed reported changes to the budget and scope of Project Gemini - a collaboration with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> that the studio had previously admitted was facing challenges - and Take-Two's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-publisher-pulls-out-of-people-can-fly-project-after-two-years">pull out of publishing People Can Fly's Project Dagger</a> in September last year. Alongside several other unnannouced games, the studio continues work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-working-on-new-project-based-on-microsoft-ip">Microsoft-funded Project Maverick</a>, based on one of the latter's IP.
</p>
<p>
Today's news continues a devastating 2024 for the games industry, with <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">more than 14,600 industry employees</a> believed to have lost their jobs since the start of the year - and that's in addition to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">10,500 workers laid off in 2023</a>. So why are these layoffs occurring? GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">shared his thoughts</a> earlier this year.

<p>VALORANT Patch 9.11 has just gone live, and the long-awaited nerfs to the game’s most overpowered agent have finally arrived. Neon has been running wild across VALORANT competitive queues, and her over-tuned abilities have even drawn complaints from many pro players.</p>



<p>At long last, the Neon nerfs have arrived, but how impactful are they really going to be?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-slide-cancel">Slide cancel</h2>



<p>The most impactful change made to Neon is the nerfs to her sliding ability. While her High Gear sprinting ability is active, Neon can right-click to slide, temporarily increasing her speed. With the <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-9-11/">release of Patch 9.11</a>, Neon now only have one Slide charge instead of two. Additionally, accuracy while sliding has been reduced from “full” accuracy down to the consistency of crouch-walking accuracy.</p>



<p>These changes walk back the buffs Neon received back in June 2024. In Patch 8.11, Slide was granted two charges and “all weapon movement error” was removed while sliding. This resulted in Neon retaining precise firing accuracy even while sliding around a corner or angle at an alarmingly fast pace. Neon and her Slide became the default agent/ability combo for entry players. In the second half of the 2024 VALORANT Champions Tour season, Neon was a go-to for pro teams on maps like Sunset and Haven.</p>



<p>The Patch 9.11 nerfs to Neon’s Slide accomplish two things. First, they prevent Neon from using two charges to just slide into an area, get a kill, and slide away safely without getting traded. Secondly, the changes to movement accuracy will deter Neon players from winning long range duels while sliding against stationary opponents. The Slide is still deadly at close range, but it’s no longer a broken ability that lets Neon get free kills at long range.</p>



<p>In addition to the Slide nerfs, Patch 9.11 will nerf Neon’s ultimate ability, Overdrive. The deadly lightning beam now lasts only 10 seconds instead of a full 20, and players need to earn an additional eighth ultimate point in order to activate it. Patch 9.11 also gives some minor buffs to the newest agent Vyse, and changes the in-game pinging system. Pings are now blocked by smokes, and pings made using the map will stay on the map and not appear in the world.</p>



<p>Still planning to use Neon despite her nerfs? Tell us why in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>People Can Fly has announced that it is the next studio to hold layoffs as 2024 winds down. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1866531267464007759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said that the company is making changes throughout the studio that will impact over 120 employees.</p>



<p>“Today, we made a very difficult decision to reduce our self-publishing strategy by suspending Project Victoria, scaling down our team on Project Bifrost, and restructuring some of our supporting teams at People Can Fly,”  Wojciechowski said.</p>



<p>He said that the moves come due to “external market pressures” that were beyond what they had expected. Moving forward, they are focusing on the development of a single game as opposed to multiple projects, and are “redoubling our efforts with new work-for-hire engagements”.</p>



<p>The layoffs at People Can Fly puts the games industry at nearly <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">15,000 known jobs lost</a> in 2024. When taking into account unconfirmed  numbers, the real total is over 16,000 jobs. </p>



<p>“We recognize this is a profoundly challenging time for our team members, as we say goodbye to valued colleagues who have contributed so much,” Wojciechowski said.</p>



<p>“Our priority is to approach this moment with compassion and to ensure our team feels supported as we work together to build a stronger future.”</p>



<p>You can read Wojciechowski’s full statement below. Let us know what you think of the state of the games industry and the latest layoffs down below or in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1313/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the free-to-play hero shooter from NetEase, launched late last week and is exceedingly popular. It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.
</p>
<p>
But perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here's what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.

To begin with, there are fixes for more general bugs, including crosshair deviation when playing highlights and recordings, equipped costumes disappearing when joining a match-in-progress as a replacement, and some crash and freezing issues. There are also fixes for collision problems on certain maps, including Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface, that would cause people to get stuck or clip through the scenery.
</p>
<p>
There are fixes for a few individual characters, like Winter Soldier's ultimate ability not dealing damage, and Hela and Storm being able to see through fog when using theirs. And there are some tech fixes for PC specifically, such as blurry models due to a memory leak when using FSR 3 to modify the resolution.

As <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-patch-notes-doctor-strange-portal-ult-1851717418">Kotaku</a> points out, the headline tweak is for Doctor Strange. He has the ability to summon portals, whether to provide allies with a shortcut or trick unwary adversaries into walking off the edge of the map. Slap a portal on the enemy's safehouse door, pop another on the cliffside, and hey presto, instant teamwipe. Hitherto, pulling off these terrain KOs has also helped Doctor Strange players charge their ultimates faster, making the game's Cumberbatchian conjurer something of a monster. No longer.
</p>
<p>
"When Doctor Strange's portals triggered terrain KOs, they would mistakenly restore Doctor Strange's Ultimate energy," explain <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/541091377173234484?l=english">the full Steam patch notes</a>. "For now, we have disabled the portals' terrain KO attribution to temporarily fix this issue (i.e., terrain KOs will not count toward Doctor Strange's own KOs). Rest assured, this bug will be resolved in a future update, at which time we will restore the portals' KO attribution."
</p>
<p>
I've seen a fair few excitable clips of Strange portal mischief on the socials. Funny stuff, though it certainly underlines the Overwatch influence: Symmetra was doing this kind of thing in 2016. Portal was doing it in 2007. Honestly, kids these days need to read more and mind their elders. Have you had a chance to play Rivals, and do you think the love for this latest live service shooter will last? I suspect the Marvel brand will save it from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">the fate of Concord</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-patch-22-fully-revealed-and-its-out-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch 2.2, which significantly expands the game’s customization options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed in partnership with support developer Virtuous, 2.2 is called ‘Express Yourself,’ with the idea that players can express themselves more in-game. The update launches today, December 10, with <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51028/update-2-2-is-live" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a> below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gets-surprise-update-22-cd-projekt-still-has-some-gas-in-the-tank">CD Projekt had previously clarified</a>, 2.2 does not add a new game plus feature to Cyberpunk 2077, nor PlayStation 5 Pro support. 2.2 does, however, let players change the colors of more cars in a more detailed way, with an upgraded vehicle customization user interface. The new TwinTone feature lets you scan any car in Night City and add its paint job to your car. The idea is if you’re driving around and see a cool car, you’ll be able to save its paint job in a database and from there apply it to your cars. This adds a paint job collecting and exploration aspect to Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are gameplay implications, too - if you change the color of your car while you’re being chased by the police, you’ll fade out your heat level. So, you can escape into an alley, change your color, then drive away Scott free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">10 cars previously unavailable to buy or own will be added to the Auto Fixer website, eight to the base game and two to the Phantom Liberty expansion. Sticking with cars, Johnny Silverhand, played by Keanu Reeves, will now spawn next to you in the passenger seat around 25% of the time. The idea here is to increase the presence of Johnny while playing, reinforcing the fact he’s stuck in V's brain. He’ll make comments, too, some of which are insults. Johnny will not spawn when you’re in combat, when another NPC is sat in the passenger seat, or when you’re on main story quests (since he’s usually involved in those) but CD Projekt said you’ll see him quite a bit. You’ll be able to use photo mode when Johnny is sat next to you, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/46ded1252b3630bb68a6c94e3dffc2e7f9a8070f-1733852649358.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Expect Johnny to pop up while you're driving around Night City. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of photo mode, the camera is much improved. It now has a drone mode letting it fly around farther due to a bigger range. You can disable collisions, too, to help nail that perfect shot. The new aspect ratio feature is PC only, unfortunately, due to limitations with the consoles. There are new lighting options, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2.2 will let you spawn up to three NPCs from a list of 20 characters taken from the base game and Phantom Liberty in photo mode. Smasher is one of the NPCs you can spawn, complete with unique poses, so you’ll be able to have your revenge on him if you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, photo mode has a reworked user interface, with additional depth of field options. CD Projekt hopes that the improvements to photo mode will mean players won’t need to rely on mods or other external software to take their in-game pictures.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/a60c7f9aa43a5da541ff4f592c5b0aae5a13364e-1733852711059.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Photo mode is expanded with 2.2. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a new gallery you can display in your apartment to show off your snaps. So you can hang a picture of your date with Panam up on the wall for… future reference, if you fancy it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to the character creator, there are 112 new assets available for customization of V. Eight new face plates are available, so you can make your character look like they’re a member of The Mox if you’d like. New nail and even lip designs are in there, too, lifted from the various corporations in Cyberpunk 2077, and loads of new eyes (including double eyes). There’s a new randomizer, too, with a ‘plain to punk’ slider to influence what it might spit out. You can lock specific assets, too, then continue with the randomizer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/c68a06b50462354026e633910bdc9ea36855844a-1733852807659.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Character creation is much improved. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During a <a href="https://youtu.be/MIlOthAEggI?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community broadcast</a>, game director Paweł Sasko teased additions CD Projekt will let fans discover for themselves. There are a “bunch of new things that happen in the city,” which will no doubt set players on a hunt throughout Night City. There are a couple of secrets Sasko has yet to see appear online even from the base game, so there’s plenty to work towards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this the true end for Cyberpunk 2077? CD Projekt has yet to say. 64 staff at CD Projekt are working on Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-enters-full-scale-production-cyberpunk-2077-hits-30-million-copies-sold">but most are working on The Witcher 4</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077 update 2.2 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 2.2 for Cyberpunk 2077 is being rolled out on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this patch you’ll be able to express yourself like never before — it includes over 100 new customization options for V, adds CrystalCoat™ compatibility for select vehicle brands, introduces a brand-new TWINTONE™ color scheme feature for CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles, and more!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review.1057095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Undaunted: Normandy was a surprise smash hit back in 2019 thanks to its novel marriage of building a deck of action cards in-game that you then played to command squads of soldiers on a board. It spawned several spin-offs with the same World War II theme, including the aerial Undaunted: Battle of Britain and the stupendous campaign version <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-stalingrad-board-game-review"><u>Undaunted: Stalingrad</u></a>. (Those games are so exceptional, by the way, they landed on our lists of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">best war board games</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">best deck-building games</a>.)</p><div catalogid="28c1399f-0d35-4a4d-8f76-2c41ce739634" id="213093"><div id="213093" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted 2200: Callisto Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, right back to the original, some players who were uncomfortable reducing real-life conflict to a game wanted a sci-fi version. Now their wish has been granted, as the same systems have been ported to the fight for an icy, mineral-rich moon between miners and their corporate overlords in Undaunted 2200: Callisto</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s in the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Undaunted 2200: Callisto arrives in a very heavy box, and those familiar with the previous entries in the series may be surprised to find the weight is mostly down to four double-sided, fold-out boards, replacing the modular board tiles of the original.  While this reduces the number of maps you can fight on it is, for the most part, a positive change making setup easier and the boards better looking, with clear space demarcations and helpful information printed around the edges. The board art is suitably dark, cold and futuristic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some other surprises await. Alongside the 10-sided dice that the series has always used are a collection of eight- and 12-sided ones, used with one of this entry’s new rules, shooting at different elevations. This is also the first entry to contain a dedicated solo rule book, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solitaire play</a> being available only via an expansion previously. There are also game rules and a scenario booklet which are clear and concise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beneath these are more familiar components. There are a couple of sheets of punch-out tokens and standees, which represent foot units and vehicles, respectively. There are also two large decks of cards, one for each faction, which you’ll use to command your troops. The art on these is detailed and atmospheric but has one problem: most of the figures depicted are in space suits, which makes them feel weirdly anonymous and identikit, despite efforts being made to visually differentiate the two factions. This, alongside the black-on-yellow and white-on-blue of the counters, can also make it a little awkward to tell at a glance exactly what unit under your command is what.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How it Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The core gameplay remains unchanged, so veterans of the series can dive right in. Each scenario gives you a list of cards for your starting deck, and a bigger pool of cards you can incorporate into your deck during play. At the start of each turn, both players draw four cards and pick one to bid for initiative, with more powerful cards having a higher bid value. Going first can have a huge impact on how the turn unfolds, and the loser’s card is wasted, so this is a rapidly repeating dose of tension. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your other cards can be a mix of combat and command cards. Playing the former allows you to activate the corresponding counters on the board to do things like move and attack. The latter let you either choose new cards to add to your deck, or sometimes to draw more cards or re-activate units for a second action in the same turn. How you choose to use command cards is a fascinating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic</a> puzzle that depends on the scenario and the state of your forces. The more cards you add, the slower your deck will cycle and the less likely it is you’ll get complementary cards in your draw, but it also gives units more staying power in a game where eliminating enemies is often a victory condition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to activating troops, you can’t just rush for objective spaces, or into combat with foes. Before most counters can reach a space, it has to be marked as scouted, which is the preserve of cards with the matching action, generally recon and navigation units. Once scouted, heavier units can move in and use an action to control the space, which is the other key victory condition in most scenarios. This sets up a constant stress over how to most effectively move and utilize the forces at your disposal. Each space has a defensive bonus, and the need to scout often leaves counters in vulnerable positions before they can creep into safely. Similarly, you often want your soldiers to be attacking, not spending precious actions to take control of spaces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the new game aspects add pieces to this tactical puzzle. Most noteworthy is a simple elevation system, where clearly marked spaces and platforms are treated as one level above standard spaces. Firing up a space means you’re rolling an eight-sided <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">dice</a> against the target number of the counter’s defense, plus the range, plus the bonus printed on the space they’re in. Firing down gets you a 12-sided dice, whereas the same elevation uses 10-sided dice. When target numbers are generally six or more, that variation makes a huge difference, meaning the fight over elevated spaces can be vicious, diverting your attention away from the objective spaces that can win you the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major change is the addition of space-specific actions, which are also printed on the board. Most commonly these are doors which you can spend an action to open, or to attack, removing them permanently, although some scenarios have laser turret spaces you can use to make a powerful attack. Between these action spaces and the elevation rules, Undaunted 2200: Callisto answers another common request from fans of the series for more interactive terrain rules. Like everything else in the game, the designer’s solution is streamlined yet effective, adding variety and depth to play with minimal extra rules overhead.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Undaunted 2200: Callisto answers another common request from fans for more interactive terrain rules.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Vehicles are another example of this thought process at work. They have a shield printed round their defensive values, which essentially means they’re immune to small-arms fire. Some attack options have values to use against soft foot units, while others can attack these armored targets: often the ranges and values are different. A mining Ripper unit, their standard troop, rolls one die at any range against soft targets, but gets two dice against armored targets in the same hex, for example. Vehicle units can be very powerful, not only in terms of firepower but also flexibility, and so become yet another move in the interlocking circles of prioritization that bedevil all your choices in this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Units also get plenty of variety. In addition to the standard scouts, solider and machine-gunners that you meet in the first scenario, later units add additional effects such as area attacks and suppressing fire, or the ability to transport other troops with them for fast deployment. It’s also noteworthy that there’s more asymmetry in the units available to both sides than there were in earlier Undaunted games. The scouts available to the corporate player, for instance, move faster but have more limited attack options compared to their mining counterparts. This minor asymmetry is a welcome addition, making trying out each side in a scenario a much more interesting prospect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the sci-fi trappings, and the presence of mechs and laser turrets, this still feels like a pre-modern skirmish game. There are no awesomely powerful sci-fi weapons to leverage on either side, no cool technologies to harness, just re-themed rifles and machine guns. This, of course, betrays the roots of the game in World War Two. It doesn’t really spoil the game – getting up close and personal enhances the tactical options available, and you could make the same arguments about perhaps the most popular sci-fi tabletop game around, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-fireteam-review">Warhammer 40k</a> – but some players may find it disappointing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> version plays well, although the overhead in following simple flowcharts for each unit, specific to each scenario, is a bit of a pain. The payoff is a mute enemy that makes tactically sensible choices, often offering clues as to the best way to approach any given scenario. There’s also a new team game for four which works surprisingly well, in which the troops on each side are subdivided into two decks, with teammates swapping the lead role in bidding for initiative each time. Splitting forces like this makes the chances of piecing together combos you might need in any given turn less likely, can be frustrating but also very exciting, and leads to emergent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-operative</a> decision-making.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6b1M2?object_uuid=54e9ca3c-ed76-4467-bbc5-168d41d55d88&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 10, 2024 3:38 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Undaunted 2200: Callisto is the fifth full game in the series, and veterans of the entire franchise are going to be on the fence about the new aspects on offer here. There is enough novelty to get jaded fans excited about another entry, but only just. The core gameplay of exciting tactical encounters wrapped in a lightweight layer of strategic deck management is very much the same. The good news is that those attracted to this series for the first or second time thanks to that sci-fi makeover will discover that that core gameplay is fantastic, a seamless blend of layers that even manages to conjure theme and narrative from its simple rules. Each scenario presents new challenges to overcome, feels different from each asymmetric side, and different again with two or four players. It’s an impressive achievement to have squeezed this much originality out of an old series, and you suspect this dynamic design duo will have more tricks up their sleeve to propel it even further into the future.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
