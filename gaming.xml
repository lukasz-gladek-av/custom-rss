            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/who-is-the-700-ps5-pro-for.978171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/who-is-700-ps5-pro-for<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony announced the long-awaited PlayStation 5 Pro this week, and with it came an onslaught of discourse about one particular point: the PS5 Pro price. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november">Retailing for $699 this November</a>, the PlayStation 5 Pro is the most expensive console of the modern gaming age, pricing out fans who might have considered buying it.</p>
<p>So, who is the PlayStation 5 Pro for? The 60 million players who have already spent up to $500 for the base PS5 won't exactly be eager to shell out another $700 after only four years. And those who haven't bought into the PlayStation ecosystem may be hard pressed to pay the premium price for what the PS5 Pro promises.</p>
<p>I've written before about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/who-is-audience-for-sonys-project-q-streaming-device">who the PlayStation Portal was meant for</a>, and now I'm having similar questions about this new console. Who is willing to pay this high price, and will the product's performance be worth the cost of admission?</p>

<h2>Does the Performance Boost Justify the PS5 Pro Price? </h2>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8&amp;t=467s&amp;ab_channel=PlayStation">PS5 Pro presentation</a>, PlayStation 5 architect Mark Cerny said that 75% of players prefer playing their games on Performance mode, prioritizing 60 FPS over 4K visuals. The PS5 Pro is supposed to bridge that gap and add in better fidelity options with advanced ray-tracing while maintaining 60 FPS. </p>
<p>Games like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> </i>and <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part 2</a> </i>look genuinely better, creating some excitement over what the PS5 Pro is capable of. Other games, like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart</a> </i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2"><i>Marvel's</i> <i>Spider-Man 2</i></a>, looked less impressive.</p>
<p>During the PS5 Pro showcase, Cerny was zooming in on leaves in&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em><i>&nbsp;</i>to show how much sharper the pixels are. Is this something the average gamer will notice when viewing from several feet away on a large TV, often while quickly zipping through the environment? </p>
<p>A console that can handle 4K/60 FPS has been something the PlayStation community has wanted for a while, but it's also something many agree that the console we got four years ago should have been able to deliver on this. Plus, even with the higher PS5 Pro price, we're missing some key elements that are sure to be missed.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-pro-price.jpg?itok=lVmtzGj1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-pro-price.jpg?itok=-tealOaX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At least they're up front about the vertical stand being sold separately?&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>PS5 Pro Shortcomings: No Disc Drive &amp; No Stand <span>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>As hefty as the $699 price tag is, the PS5 Pro comes in a digital-only configuration with no disc drive and no vertical stand. These accessories are priced at $80 and $30 respectively, bringing the total PS5 Pro price to $910. Want an extra controller or even a <a href="https://techraptor.net/platform/playstation-vr-2">PS VR2</a> peripheral? We're looking at well over a thousand dollars. </p>
<p>This pricing is extremely reminiscent of the PlayStation 3 launching at $599 back in 2006, but even the PS3 came with a Blu-Ray player, an expensive device that had yet to become a mainstream media player. By not including a disc drive or even a stand, Sony is rolling back some of the things we used to expect as standard features in our consoles. </p>
<p>The three selling points are all internal upgrades: </p>
<ul><li>A larger GPU with 45% faster rendering than the PS5</li>
<li>Advanced Ray-Tracing</li>
<li>AI-Driven Upscaling with PlayStation Spectral Super Sampling (PSSR)</li>
</ul><p>And to be fair, there are impressive improvements, and I'm curious to see what new PS5 games will look like and how they'll run when they fully take advantage of the PS5 Pro architecture. I just don't think it justifies a $699 PS5 Pro price tag, especially considering it only feels like we just recently moved on from games being cross-gen with PS4.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A PlayStation 5 Pro Isn't a Big Enough Jump for the Price</h2>
<p>The PS5 Pro is a great showcase of why mid-gen refreshes have diminishing returns in the modern era. While the PlayStation 4 Pro offered the jump from 1080P to 4K, the PS5 Pro improvements feel more nuanced for those seeking faster framerates and better ray-tracing. </p>
<p>There is, without a doubt, a population of gamers who celebrate these improvements, but those same players likely already have a PC that offers the performance they desire. For the average PlayStation fan who enjoys gaming on a user-friendly console in their living room, I think they're having too much fun with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> on their existing $500 system to consider that an upgrade is needed. </p>
<p>The reality is, we're likely within four years of the next generation of video game technology. So it feels like a weird time to make a $700 investment for what doesn't feel like a commensurate return. We're really just starting to see what the base PS5 is capable of, so it would make sense that many are happy with their current console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, Play Has No Limits, but bank accounts sure do. </p>

            <p>Earlier today, Nic did me a great injustice by waving aside my suggestion that he write about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shroom-and-gloom">Shroom And Gloom</a>, because "I want to read you describing mushrooms in interesting ways". Nic, I have no interesting ways to describe mushrooms right now. I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/morels-2-sure-has-a-lot-of-unicorns-for-a-mushroom-collection-game">Morels 2</a>, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.</p> <!--more-->

<p>The aforesaid mad human (that's your character, yes) does not even bother to finish murdering the fungus folk before dining out on their butchered brethren. Slay a mushroom with a fireball, and you'll render the corpse "Toasty" enough to consume, stuffing its portly, seared body into your mouth even as you slice another mushroom with a wavy dagger. If this were an actual foraging expedition you'd at least want to count the spots and gills before sinking your teeth in.</p>
<p><a href="https://teamlazerbeam.itch.io/shroom-and-gloom">Find a fleshy prototype for Shroom And Gloom on Itch.io</a>. It's certainly got atmosphere, with a soiled 3D parchment world of unpleasantly nested 2D rock and vegetation. Moving along the branching path feels like crawling down somebody's intestine. Somebody who's been eating a lot of mushrooms, and treasure chests. Gangs of pugnacious toadstools pop up at intervals, ranging from tiddly, er - <em>consults <a href="https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780746095898/Mushrooms-Funghi-Usborne-Spotters-Guide-0746095899/plp">Usborne Spotter's Guide</a></em> - Puffballs to rampaging Stinkhorns. Is this interesting yet, Nic? When I used to write for Edge, they'd chop your commission in half for calling things "interesting". It was one of those banned Edge words, like "wowza" and "ginormous".</p>
<p>You'll massacre the mycelium using ability cards, the mushroom's traditional foe. After 20 minutes with the demo, the card-battling is notable for a couple of reasons: firstly, the absence of conventional healing skills in battle means you'll want to devour at least half of the enemies you kill, and secondly, there's a "mood" system whereby you generate cards for "repressed rage", "impatience" and other states of mind, unlocking buffs and special attacks. Yes, this is a game in which victory may be achieved by tactically driving yourself nuts. In addition to your combat deck, you've got an exploration deck of cards that include various types of lockpick and shovel. I say "lockpick" - one of the "picks" is the ability to throw up corrosive goo. Ah, if only Thief's Garrett had thought of that one.</p>
<p>"Our dream version of this game features hundreds of cards, deep metaprogression and scores of unique enemies, spread across a dense network of caves and tunnels to explore!" explain developers Team Lazerbeam, who are being funded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anger-foot">Anger Foot</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-nil">Terra Nil</a> developers Free Lives. "This prototype offers a taste of what that experience could be.</p>
<p>"We've shot for the stars with what we tried to cram into this prototype over 3 months of development, and we're really proud of what we pulled off," the blurb continues. "That said, please note that this is a prototype. Expect rough edges and some jank. Keep in mind this is all a work in progress." I hope they make it all the way to the finish, because Shroom And Gloom is my kind of desperately grim. One of the later-game card options lets you turn mushrooms into soup. I wonder if we'll get to hear mushrooms scream. That would be interesting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A union within Call of Duty developer Raven Software is claiming that that Activision is “discriminating against” union employees and failing to negotiate in “good faith”.</p>



<p>That’s what the complaint against the company claims in the official charges filed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has received a copy of the complaint via FOIA request. Within the document comes the basis of the charge, which gives more information on claims of retaliation and discipline against members.</p>



<p>“In the six months prior to the filing of this charge, and on an ongoing and continuous basic, the Employer [Activision] discriminated against bargaining unit employees on the basis of their union membership concerning several terms and conditions of employment (e.g., pay treatment, hiring, work assignment and tasking, promotions, permanent work-from-home),” the charge reads.</p>



<p>“The Employer also engaged in surface bargaining, failed to engage in good faith on any economic proposals and on other mandatory subjects of bargaining (e.g., discrimination and harassment at work), and failed to meet at reasonable times and places for bargaining.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has once again reached out to Activision and Microsoft for comment on the claims. This story will be updated should a response be received. The last comment from Microsoft was a message to Stephen Totilo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/raven-software-union-files-complaint-against-microsoft-and-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in August saying</a> that it will “negotiate in good faith.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-echoes-zelda-and-assassins-creed-with-its-action-packed-open-world<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last month I went <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-is-like-god-of-war-and-dragons-dogma-had-a-baby-gamescom-2024">hands-on with Crimson Desert</a> to try out some of its brutal boss battles. I left the demonstration impressed by its fast combat system and spectacular monster designs, but curious as to what the wider world and gameplay of Crimson Desert looks like. What happens between those epic clashes? Now, thanks to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crimson-desert-exclusive-gameplay">53 minute gameplay video</a> from developer Pearl Abyss that’s available to watch here on IGN exclusively, I have a much clearer picture. If Crimson Desert’s combat is a mix of God of War and Dragon’s Dogma, then its wider gameplay is more reminiscent of modern Assassin’s Creed and other quest-driven open world adventures. </p><p>The gameplay video introduces us to Kliff, Crimson Desert’s protagonist who sports a gruff Scottish accent and a no-nonsense attitude. After a prologue establishes a bloody conflict between the Greymanes and the marauding Black Bears, Kliff’s major goal is made clear: explore the continent of Pywel in search of his surviving Greymane allies who have been scattered following the battle. Kliff also presumably wants revenge against Myurdin, the demo’s first boss fight, considering the Black Bear chief seemingly murdered him. Quite how Kliff remains alive after having his body filled with arrows and his throat slit is a mystery left for the full game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p> The bulk of this preview demonstration is set in Hernand, a medieval town populated by a fun range of fantasy races that wouldn’t look out of place in any Tolkienesque fantasy story (look out for the giants and the antlered elf-like beings among the crowds). Similarly, Kliff’s interactions around its beautifully rendered streets are very much what you’d expect of a modern open world adventure game – there’s a horse you can whistle for, NPCs to be spoken to (via cutscenes, there's no dialogue options here) and hostile regions to infiltrate. That last one is where Crimson Desert has a little fun, as the demo shows Kliff changing into Hernandian Banquet Attire in order to walk past a castle’s guards unnoticed, much like how you can wear disguises in games like Hitman and Kingdom Come: Deliverance. I hope there are plenty of opportunities to do this, and various outcomes to your trickery; it would be fun if you could use disguises to open up new conversations as well as gain entry to forbidden zones.</p><p>Inside the castle, Kliff pilfers an ‘Abyss Artifact’, which is where Crimson Desert gets a little more unusual. The device opens up a pixelated portal in a wall, and walking through it transports Kliff to a digital-like realm (reminiscent of the Animus in Assassin’s Creed) that leads to the Library of Providence. There, an alchemist called Alustin reveals that the Library is at the centre of all worlds and that there are beings who plan to bring “everything to nothingness”. While I can’t say I’m impressed by Crimson Desert’s writing in this demo – this exchange and others feel cluttered and wrapped up in themselves – it does point to a much grander, more mythical plot beyond Kliff’s hunt for his allies. That ambition of something larger is made abundantly clear when Alustin’s ally, White Crow, gives Kliff the glider-like ‘Crow Wings’ ability, which allows him to leap off the Library’s floating island and reenact Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s title sequence. It’s a little bold to use this motif – can Pearl Abyss really craft something that lives up to the wider meaning of that iconic visual? – but even if it falls short, the magnificent view and subsequent glide to earth is a thrill all the same. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Crimson Desert - Open world exploration and questing screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Back on the ground in Hernand, Kliff soon finds himself in a duel with a local knight. It’s another good example of Crimson Desert’s fight mechanics (more on that in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-is-like-god-of-war-and-dragons-dogma-had-a-baby-gamescom-2024">gamescom preview</a>), but it also triggers the start of the demo’s major questline. Impressed by Kliff’s combat prowess, a local peacekeeper tasks him with finding and eliminating some local bandits who fight using a red mist. Heading out in search of such villains, Kliff comes across a burning house and throws nearby vases of water to save the clergyman trapped inside. It’s not clear from the demo if such objectives organically occur around the map, Red Dead Redemption 2-style, but what is soon clear is that this blaze is the work of those aforementioned bandits. The local church says one of their men, Hubert, fled the scene in an attempt to bait the enemies away and asks Kliff to find him.  payment is another one of those Abyss Artifacts, once again suggesting the worlds-beyond-worlds are of high importance to Crimson Desert’s story. I hope this results in a decent amount of weirdness that helps set the largely typical setting apart from other fantasy games. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pearl Abyss is making good progress in its transition from Black Desert Online’s MMORPG into single player territory.</p></div><p>Hubert is found at a bandit camp that allows the demo to show off Kliff’s stealth abilities. It’s pretty classic stuff and looks very reminiscent of silent takedowns in the Assassin’s Creed games – not particularly challenging, but an alternative option to Crimson Desert’s more publicised melee brawls. Hopefully when we go hands-on again, stealth will prove a worthwhile addition rather than a shallow tacked-on extra. </p><p>With Hubert freed, Kliff is approached by the goblin Shakatu, a merchant of the Goldleaves guild. He explains that the Goldleaves are currently under the command of the evil Split Horn, someone Kliff must now kill. In return, Shakatu offers money and his services, things Kliff believes will be helpful in finding the missing Greymanes. </p><p>Arriving at the Goldleaf camp, it quickly becomes clear how all these quests are linked. The goblin guards use red mist as part of their battle tactics, and so reveal themselves as the very same miscreants that were causing trouble for the people of Hernand. And so Split Horn’s death not only allows Shakatu to take over and help Kliff, but also fulfils the task set by the peacekeeper back in town. I hope Crimson Desert features plenty more of these overlapping goals and storylines, and forms a wider narrative that feels enjoyably interlaced. That would certainly make up for the uneven quality of the writing shown in the demo.   </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/crimson-desert-kliff-shakatu-1725975076438.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kliff makes a deal with the goblin merchant Shakatu.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Split Horn (who, amusingly, looks more like a bobblehead elf than any of his goblin brothers) acts as the culminating boss fight of the demo. He’s as agile and aggressive as Crimson Desert’s speedy combat demands, wielding a sword that emits blasts of wind in vertical and horizontal patterns, forcing Kliff to dodge and block as he attempts to close the distance. Unlike the bosses featured in the gamescom demo, though, he has just one health bar and doesn’t put up quite as much of a fight. It’s over soon enough, further suggesting that the game will feature a variety of challenges big and small – add ‘small windy Joffrey’ to a list that already contains ‘mega wrestler with stag antlers’, ‘the abominable snow deer’ and ‘a literal mountain’. </p><p>This new look at Crimson Desert continues to show that Pearl Abyss is making good progress in its transition from Black Desert Online’s MMORPG into single player territory. I don’t think anything shown in this demo particularly breaks new ground – much of it is very familiar if you’ve played the likes of modern Zelda, Assassin’s Creed, or The Witcher 3 – but it nonetheless looks largely well put together. While I do hope that the Abyss Artifact storyline goes suitably off-the-wall, I’d like to see the more typical fantasy storylines find suitable hooks to ensure regular gameplay feels more varied and creative than what we’ve seen so far. With a combat system that shifts from classic sword-and-board action to slingshotting Spider-Man-style around a walking mountain, the questing and exploration side of Crimson Desert ideally also needs to aspire to that kind of diversity. But even if it doesn’t, this latest slice of gameplay certainly suggests that the bridges between epic boss battles will be solid, if not the most memorable aspect of the experience.  </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The focus here is on the Halloween aesthetic, with reprints like Pikachu and Gengar looking extra spooky with their new stamps. However, you'd be surprised at how many of the cards still have solid abilities for casual play. Plus, you've got new cards from the Scarlet &amp; Violet set, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti, to add a fresh vibe.</p><p>Each set is packed with 35 mini boosters, containing 3 cards in every "mini-booster". The entire set of 30 cards can be completed by grabbing just one bundle. Unlike regular packs, these cards aren't about <em>game-changing pulls</em> or competitive play but more about celebrating Halloween with a collectible twist. The nine Cosmo holo cards add a bit of shine to the whole experience, making cards like Pikachu and Mimikyu even more special. We love the 2024 set, and highly recommend it for anyone Pokémon fans getting into the Halloween spirit.</p><div catalogid="3520d4d6-aea6-42cb-a703-ebd423387efd" id="207021"><div id="207021" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Pokémon TCG Booster Bundle - Trick or Trade</h3></p><div><p>"Spooky Surprises Lurk Inside!

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">the official reveal of the PlayStation 5 Pro</a> earlier this week, the majority of the conversations about it have centered on its $700 price rather than its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">advanced PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution technology</a>. This is understandable, since $700 is a lot of money to put down on a new version of a console that's only been out for four years. But as noted by former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, there's at least one way to get that price down. Or as they say in the spam ads, "one weird trick."</p><p>Ybarra pointed out a tactic that many fans had already thought about--namely trading in their existing PS5 models and effectively cutting the cost of a new PS5 Pro in half.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833527742534500820" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Think of this a bit differently. Pro models, or any in-generation upgrade, is about existing users upgrading. So when teams evaluate the cost - they don't want to lose money on each console as that puts pressure on other parts of the business. And they think about how they can…</p>  — Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833527742534500820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>GameStop is offering between $350 to $385 in store credit for used PlayStation 5 consoles, with the higher prices for models with the disc drive. But if a significant number of gamers pursue that strategy, would GameStop keep that trade in value or lower the amount that it offers? Just because GameStop is offering those rates now doesn't guarantee that it will in November. That would throw a wrench in this strategy, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-makes-a-surprise-profit-warns-of-impending-store-closures/1100-6526415/" data-ref-id="1100-6526415">GameStop is facing more store closures</a>. Additionally, the PS5 Pro doesn't come with a disc drive, with the optional add-on costing another $80. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">it's already selling out across multiple retailers</a>.</p><p>That strategy also runs into a problem if gamers haven't upgraded to a PS5 yet. Without a modern console to trade in, getting a PS5 Pro remains prohibitively expensive for some fans. But if a lot of used PS5 consoles suddenly hit the market--even with GameStop's markup--then perhaps that's a solution for anyone who hasn't joined the current console generation yet.</p><p>Sony will release the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorder-guide-price-release-date-amazon-best-buy-walmart/1100-6526406/" data-ref-id="1100-6526406">PS5 Pro</a> on November 7.</p>

                <p>Honkai: Star Rail is a free-to-play game, but if you're a big fan who wants to show off their love for the popular RPG, a physical edition for PS5 is now available to preorder at Best Buy. Priced at $40, <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1853347803757836957%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhonkai-star-rail-is-getting-a-ps5-physical-edition-with-collectible-art-cards-and-cute-keychains%2F1100-6526416%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Honkai: Star Rail Trailblazer Edition</a></strong> includes the base game on a disc and the following bonus content: nine gilded holographic cards, two holographic character keychains, an exclusive postcard, and a game redemption code with exclusive in-game items. Best Buy lists the release date as March 31, 2025, but this date is sometimes used as a placeholder for Q1 (first three months of the year).</p><p>It's not unheard of for a free-to-play game to receive a physical edition. Fortnite has received multiple boxed releases over the years, each of which <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fortnite-Transformers-Pack-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CCSNDXT9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">contains exclusive in-game cosmetics</a>. The difference here is that you're actually getting a disc. This is a bit unusual, especially since Honkai: Star Rail requires an internet connection and you'll need to download the game regardless. From a practical gaming perspective, the disc is useless, but it could make for a cool drink coaster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4365440-honkai-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365440" data-ratio="0.56264066016504" data-width="1333" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4365440-honkai-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365440"></a><figcaption>Honkai: Star Rail Trailblazer Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4365440-honkai-1.jpg"></figure><p>Developed by Hoyoverse, the same studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genshin-impact/" data-ref-id="5000-500614">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/zenless-zone-zero/" data-ref-id="5000-564645">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, Honkai: Star Rail is a free-to-play game with Gacha elements in its design.

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are quite excited about The Plucky Squire's release, which is arriving on day one on Sony's PS Plus subscription. This is the upcoming storybook adventure game from All Possible Futures, which flits brightly between 2D and 3D realms.</p>
<p>"I'm still early on in the game, but in both of its worlds, I want to see what comes next," Christian Donlan wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-plucky-squire-offers-familiar-ideas-in-a-lovely-new-arrangement">Plucky Squire preview feature</a> last month.</p>
<p>"I want to see where the adventure in the children's book leads, and I want to know what else awaits me out on that expanse of child's desk. I'm in. And I can't wait for more.</p>
<p>As for games that have already been released, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/night-in-the-woods">Eurogamer's review called Night in the Woods</a> a "witty smalltown adventure with light puzzle-platforming elements", but one which "walks the line between nostalgia and nihilism".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-5-review">Far Cry 5</a>, meanwhile, Eurogamer dubbed a "competent yet conflicted open worlder".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-qa-with-keiichiro-toyama-discussing-gameplay-mechanics-old-gen-release-and-silent-hill-series-revival/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Keiichiro Toyama is a name that horror games fans know rather well, having directed and written the very first entry in the Silent Hill series, but that isn't the only game the Japanese developer created, as he was also the man behind Sony's Siren series. Moving away from horror games, Toyama-san created and directed the Gravity Rush series, which, surprisingly enough, had the same impact on the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-gets-gameplay-trailer-pc-specs-and-november-8-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slitterhead</a> as the horror games the legendary game director created before it.</p>
<p>During Gamescom 2024, we had the chance to talk with Toyama-san about his next game, the unique mechanics that set it apart from similar titles, and his feelings regarding the return of the Silent Hill series. You can find the full Q&amp;A session below. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>The Q&amp;A session was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Where does the name Slitterhead come from?</strong></p>
<p>The project was, in many ways, going back to my roots, so I wanted to keep the SH initials while having a new name. As such, I worked with English-speaking staff to come up with the Slitterhead name.</p>
<p><strong>Possession mechanics seem to be central to the experience. How did they come about?</strong></p>
<p>The possession mechanics in Slitterhead are the modern reconstruction of one of the mechanics seen in Siren. In that game, there was a mechanic called sight jacking, which allows the player to borrow someone else's sight. In Slitterhead, we went further with this concept, allowing the player not just to borrow someone's sight but their entire bodies, letting them move around while controlling these NPCs. So the possession mechanics in the game are effectively an evolution of similar mechanics seen in Siren.</p>
<p><strong>Slitterhead has deeper combat mechanics than other horror games. Why did you go in this direction?</strong></p>
<p>I am aware of how much survival horror fans are passionate about the genre, but I wanted to offer something different from past games. In this regard, the Seinen manga genre has had a big influence on Slitterhead. The genre combines elements such as action, battle, horror, and dark themes well and is quite popular with young players. I felt the combination of these elements would be a better way to introduce the game to a young audience and people who play action games. It was also a combination of elements that I wanted to do for a while.</p>
<p><strong>In horror games, the player is usually powerless against everything they have to face, which contributes to the atmosphere a lot, but in Slitterhead, you can fight these horrors rather effectively. What has been done to preserve the "horror" feel while also offering these deeper combat mechanics?</strong></p>
<p>The horror elements are preserved in Slitterhead mostly by the narrative elements of the game, with a sense and fear of the unknown that is prevalent throughout the story that players will hopefully find and appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>Slitterhead features multiple characters with different skills. How does the game handle this so that it is not disorienting for players?</strong></p>
<p>We have been very precise in the development of different movesets and animations, making sure not to change the "rhythm" between different movesets. It was a lot of hard work.</p>
<p><strong>At the beginning of the game, you possess a dog. Are there other non-combat possessions?</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, I have focused mostly on the human aspect of the possession mechanics. I have found the idea of possessing the dog fun, and that won't be the only time you will see him, but I haven't focused on the aspect of possessing anything other than human NPCs.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Slitterhead won't offer any variety. Throughout the game, the player will be able to unlock new and rarer possessions, and all come with different skill sets and different moves. After the beginning of the game, players will be able to take two possession rarities to a mission, and I feel picking the best ones for the mission will be an entertaining part of the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Slitterhead features multiple difficulty settings. What's the difference between them?</strong></p>
<p>The difficulty settings influence the difficulty of combat. Higher difficulties not only increase the enemy's parameters compared to lower settings but also change how often they attack and use certain special moves. The highest difficulty, Nightmare, will be quite challenging and will require players to master all of the game's mechanics. I myself haven't completed the game at this setting. (<em>laughs</em>). Normal difficulty, on the other hand, will be more approachable. Its challenge level is far from being close to that of certain popular games where the player constantly dies.</p>
<p><strong>The game is also releasing on PlayStation 4. Why? And did launching on a previous-generation console limit the project in any way?</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to have as many players as possible to play Slitterhead, and this is why we are releasing the game on PlayStation 4. At the same time, this helped us keep the PC system requirements low, so even those players with middle-range systems can easily enjoy the game. Being the first game from Bokeh Game Studio, we really want as many players as possible to play Slitterhead, and I feel we made the correct decision, in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Hill series composer Akira Yamaoka has created the Slitterhead soundtrack. How did this collaboration come about? How has his work improved the experience?</strong></p>
<p>Having worked together on the original Silent Hill, Yamaoka-san and I have discussed working together over the years, and eventually going indie with my new studio made it a lot easier for this collaboration to happen. His works basically carried the development in many ways: the songs and the audio he implemented in certain areas made the design even better, giving the level designers more freedom with their choices. It was a very good collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about Silent Hill, the series is finally coming back after some years with multiple games after a long hiatus. How do you feel about having created something so iconic and its return?</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, Silent Hill was a small project compared to others in the works at the same time, and not many people, even at Konami, knew about it. A very young team worked on it, and when it was released, we were all surprised by how good it turned out to be. Konami was surprised as well by the reactions and the fan base that was created around it since they didn't think it would be so influential. Even though I only worked on the first game, I am happy to see it back. It was the first game I directed, and it has taught me many lessons in game development. And I'm thankful to see that the franchise continues to be popular nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for your time!</strong></p>

To accept it, talk to “The Well-Heeled Youth” which will also give you the Gold Airship Ticket. Then, go to the Ul’Dahn Airstrip and present the ticket to Elyenora. The game will then bring up a prompt asking if you want to go to the Gold Saucer. Select “Yes,” and after a short cutscene, you will be able to turn in the quest and arrive at the Gold Saucer with a notice that the Manderville Gold Saucer has been unlocked.</p><h2 id="h17046"><a id=""></a>What Can I Do In the Manderville Gold Saucer</h2><figure id="" data-id="29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-recommend-id="image://29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Manderville Gold Saucer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Manderville Gold Saucer" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-recommend-id="image://29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Manderville Gold Saucer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> As you might expect, <em>FFXIV’s</em> version of the Gold Saucer—titled the Manderville Gold Saucer—has a collection of minigames for you to play. In order to play these games and purchase many of the prizes available, you need Manderville Gold Saucer Points or MGP, just in case there weren’t already enough currencies in this game. One MGP can be purchased for 10 Gil, though it can also be obtained by winning these minigames. And it’s a good job too, as prizes can cost up to one million MGP, and you are limited to only being able to purchase 500! </p><p>I’d advise you to talk to the AirShip Ticketer, who offers a quest as soon as you land, entitled “World of Wonders.” This will have you talk to multiple NPCs and introduce many of the features and games available in the Gold Saucer. Below is a walkthrough of how to complete the quest, as well as a brief introduction on the feature that is introduced. I’d also suggest you interact with all the crystals, to open the many fast travel locations as you work your way through this quest.</p><figure id="" data-id="d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-recommend-id="image://d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Airship ticketer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Airship ticketer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-recommend-id="image://d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Airship ticketer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Talking to the attendant at the main counter will introduce the general concept of MGP, and how to obtain them. After that, you will talk to the Triple Triad Trader at the Card Square. The popular game from <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> returns here, and can be unlocked by speaking to the Triple Triad Master. He will also give you five cards for completing this incredibly fast quest, which can be added to a deck to play this minigame.</p><p>Before they can be registered to your account, they need to be used from your inventory. Once that is done, you can create a Deck by bringing up the menu, and under the “Character” tab, select “Gold Saucer.” Scroll down until you see the Deck Options and add your new cards there. You can also challenge the Triple Triad Master and he will explain the rules of the game. </p><figure id="" data-id="2ad5639c76af167c7822faf5803ff31f" data-recommend-id="image://2ad5639c76af167c7822faf5803ff31f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Valeda.

And a girl in her underpants." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You will then need to talk to Veleda at the Cactpot Boards. There are two Cactpot Lotteries, and by talking to the Jumbo Cactpot Broker, you can buy up to three cards per week with four digits of your choosing. Winners are revealed on Saturdays at a specific time according to your server, and if your numbers are drawn, you will win! Note that you actually need to check your numbers at the Cactpot Cashier (right next to the ticket vendor), as the rewards are not given automatically.</p><p>You have a week to do this, and if you don’t pick them up in time, you forfeit your winnings. Even if none of your numbers match, you will receive a consolation and you also gain a bonus if you check in the first hour after numbers are called, so always check the winners, and try to do it as close to the designated time as possible.</p><p>There is also a Mini Cactpot Broker that can be played daily. You can buy a card with a grid on it, with all spaces covered except one. You can then choose an additional three squares to reveal and then pick any row, column or diagonal you want to bet on. You can see the payout for each sum of numbers, so the goal is to get the three numbers that will provide the largest payout. Talking to the Broker for the first time also rewards you with a MGP voucher, which can be used from your inventory for 100 MGP to get you started on your first card. You can buy up to three per day, so you should take advantage of this relatively easy way to generate MGP.</p><figure id="" data-id="c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-recommend-id="image://c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="GATE Keeper." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="GATE Keeper." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-recommend-id="image://c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="GATE Keeper." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The last spot before we return to our attendant is a GATE Keeper. GATEs are basically minigames which rotate every 20 minutes. They are generally pretty short and different from most content in <em>FFXIV</em>, and are fun diversions even if you aren’t grinding for MGP. They can be anything from a platforming obstacle course to a shooting gallery, and worth checking out. You also don’t need to talk to this specific Keeper to partake in the events, as there are several Keepers scattered around the Gold Saucer, and speaking to any of them will teleport you to the location of the next event. </p><p> After speaking to the GATE Keeper, you can speak to the attendant to turn in the quest. You will be rewarded with five Gold Saucer Tickets. These are different from the MGP vouchers! This means they can generally only be used for the smaller carnival minigames scattered around the park, which only cost about 1 MGP and don’t offer very high rewards. </p><h2 id="h17047"><a id=""></a>Is There Anything Else?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-recommend-id="image://9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Passion for fashion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Passion for fashion." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-recommend-id="image://9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Passion for fashion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> While “World of Wonders” will show you a lot of the content the Gold Saucer has to offer, it doesn’t show you everything. There’s a NPC in the main area named Lewena who will offer you two quests that unlock additional games at the Gold Saucer. The first is a quest named “Passion for Fashion.” It will task you with talking to a character named the Masked Rose which unlocks Fashion Report. This challenge is available from Tuesdays to Fridays and requires you to equip a different piece of equipment in each slot that fits a given theme, and are then judged on your ensemble with a score from 1 to 100. If you receive a score higher than 80 you get MGP. </p><p> The other quest Lewenna offers is “Everything Little Thing She Does is Mahjong.” By talking to the Mahjong Tutor you can complete this quest and unlock Mahjong Duties, which allow you to play the famous game for MGP. They can be accessed from the Duty Menu. </p><figure id="" data-id="569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-recommend-id="image://569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobo Racing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chocobo Racing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-recommend-id="image://569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobo Racing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> In order to unlock the final two features of the Gold Saucer, you will need to talk to the Lift Operator, which will give you access to the Minion and Chocobo Squares. At the former, you can unlock and play “Lord of Verminion,” which pits your minions against others for MGP. At the Chocobo Square you can pick up a quest to unlock Chocobo Races. </p><p> To do so, talk to the Race Chocobo Registrar to unlock “So You want to Be a Jockey?” This quest will have you travel to Bent Branch Meadows (near Gridania) to speak to Katering. This completes the quest and you can choose a male or female Chocobo for racing as a reward. Talking to her again will accept the quest, “So You Think You Can Ride This Chocobo?” To turn it in, talk to the Chocobo Trainer to register your new bird, and then talk to the registrar to try out the training course. After you pass, you will have Chocobo races available in the Duty Finder. </p><figure id="" data-id="10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-recommend-id="image://10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Finalfantasiest lady of all time." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Finalfantasiest lady of all time." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-recommend-id="image://10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Finalfantasiest lady of all time." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> There are a ton of things to do in the Gold Saucer, and it’s incredibly easy to lose track of time. Whether you are there specifically to buy one of the awesome prizes, or just spend time mastering Triple Triad, it’s worth it to check out one of the coolest locations in <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>and see what it has to offer. You may just find yourself sinking hours acquiring the area’s unique currency. After all, the Fenrir Mount is only one million MGP. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/when-it-costs-700-who-exactly-is-the-ps5-pro-for<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">Sony finally announced the long-rumoured PS5 Pro</a> in a technical presentationn hosted by Mark Cerny. The console is a more advanced version of the PlayStation 5 that boosts its graphics capabilities, and even improves backwards compatibility with some PS4 games.</p>
<p>Yet the biggest catch of all is its £700 price tag. What's more, with this being a digital-only console, the £100 disc drive add-on is required for physical games, not to mention the additional £25 needed for the optional stand just to hold the console vertically. That's a total of £825 - without games, as well as the fancy TV necessary to really show off those extra pixels.</p>
<p>The reaction so far has been overwhelmingly negative, predominantly thanks to that audacious price. Indeed, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-700-ps5-pro-is-an-argument-against-pro-consoles-altogether">Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wrote</a>, the PS5 Pro is "an argument against 'Pro' consoles altogether". It certainly seems more in-line with the expectations of PC players than console players.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, then, what really are the benefits of this new console? Who is the target audience? And would we consider buying one ourselves?</p>
<p>Joining me to discuss all things PS5 Pro in this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a> are news reporter Victoria Kennedy, Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan, and managing editor Katharine Castle.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a> is getting a free update next month, which will include a new co-op horde mode known as Neighborhood Watch and New Game Plus.</p>
<p>"Taking place over the span of five fictional days, Neighborhood Watch sees a group of college kids - the Bobcats - defend their frat house from an approaching zombie horde," reads <a href="https://deadisland.com/patch-6">Neighborhood Watch's description</a>. "Initially, you and your friends complete a variety of missions, setting traps, and stockpiling weapons as you prepare your defences.</p>
<p>"Then, on the fifth and final day, the zombie onslaught begins! If your defences, skills, and teamwork are up to the task, you might just live to tell the tale." You can check out a trailer for Neighborhood Watch below.</p>

<p>In addition to this new horde mode, the forthcoming update will also include New Game Plus. This will allow players to head back to LA (or, Hell A, as the Dead Island 2 team call it) for another crack at the main story, but with an additional skill slot and an increased level cap.</p>
<p>In addition, there will also be some new skins, enemies, weapons and an increased difficulty level for players to hack and slash their way through.</p>
<p>This free update will be arriving on 22nd October, and will coincide with the release of Dead Island 2's <a href="https://deadisland.com/gb/ultimate-edition">Ultimate Edition.</a> This edition will include the base game, as well as both story expansions (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-roadmap-reveals-two-gore-ful-sounding-expansions">Haus and SoLA</a>) and a number of weapons and skin packs. It will also include New Game Plus and Neighborhood Watch on its release next month.</p>
<p>"If you've somehow yet to play an undead-themed action-RPG or you have an appropriately on-brand mindless hunger for the subgenre, Dead Island 2 might be worth your while," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-review-its-still-2011-in-los-angeles">Eurogamer's Dead Island 2 review</a> from last year. "It's certainly got the zombie disassembly part down pat."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>An early PlayStation 5 Pro comparison video shared online earlier today highlights the visual improvements the new console will bring to select existing titles.</p>
<p>The video, which was put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a>, is based on the footage shown during yesterday's technical presentation, and, as such, it may not properly represent how these games will run on the actual hardware. Even so, the comparison makes it clear that some games will benefit more than others, such as Hogwarts Legacy, which will use the console's capabilities to offer better ray tracing with more solid performance, and Gran Turismo 7, which will also feature ray tracing during races. Other games don't seem to benefit as much, sporting only marginal improvements to image quality.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro was officially revealed yesterday, following months of rumors and speculation. The biggest upgrade the new model launching in two months features over the base console is a more powerful GPU which offers <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/">45% faster rendering</a> thanks to 67% more compute units and 28% faster memory. The console will also feature the AI-powered <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-spectral-super-resolution-to-work-across-the-full-library-without-patches-will-also-support-ps-vr2/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a>, which will increase games' visual quality while offering smooth framerates. Enhancing the visual quality of Performance Mode was one of the main goals of the new system, as the vast majority of players preferred 60 FPS gameplay over higher resolution and visual quality over the course of the generation, as confirmed by Mark Cerny himself during the console's reveal.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th for the price of $699.99, £699.99, €799.99. Despite the high price, analysts expect the system to sell as <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">well as the PS4 Pro did.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241706/sony-ps5-pro-price-next-gen-consoles</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-ps5-pro-is-a-pricey-test-of-next-gen-consoles.978060/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241706/sony-ps5-pro-price-next-gen-consoles<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The PS5 Pro’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">announcement yesterday</a> wasn’t a surprise. What was a surprise was the price: at $699.99, it debuts as Sony’s most expensive console ever. It brought back memories of the PS3’s controversial price tag, a console that when adjusted for inflation is the same $779 price point of a PS5 Pro with the additional disc drive. It’s a very expensive PlayStation, and I fear it’s a test of what’s to come for next-gen console pricing.</p><p>For years, console gamers have been used to purchasing hardware at a significantly reduced price compared to what you could build yourself in the PC gaming space. Yes, you can find components that match the PS5 or Xbox Series X on paper, but it’s still difficult to hit the price points that consoles sell for, especially when they’re discounted during promotions. Besides, the easy plug-and-play model, simplified UI, and hassle-free warranty process are all big benefits over having to build or find a good prebuilt PC and then deal with Windows and driver updates. Consoles sell in their millions because they’re far more consumer-friendly than PCs.</p><p>It increasingly feels like that gap between console and PC is blurring, though. Microsoft and Sony both pushed this current generation in the direction of having the type of CPU, storage, and GPU power that you’d find inside a gaming PC. The PS5 and Xbox Series X / S have far more capable CPUs for gaming instead of underpowered laptop-like ones and improve the performance of your existing library of games just like a GPU upgrade would on the PC side. That’s why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">I called the Xbox Series X a next-gen PC</a> when I reviewed it in 2020.</p><div><figcaption><em>The PS5 Pro ships without a disc drive.﻿</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>The PS5 Pro demonstrates that trend even more clearly. Sony’s entire selling point is a $700 upgrade for existing and new games to hit better frame rates while maintaining visual quality. That’s been the selling point of GPUs for decades, and now Sony is about to test if console gamers are willing to upgrade their hardware in the same way PC gamers build entire new rigs.</p><p>The big difference this time is that Sony wants you to pay out for that upgrade in the same way that PC gamers have begrudgingly gotten used to GPU prices skyrocketing in recent years. Both Sony and Microsoft typically sell consoles at a loss initially to subsidize the hardware and grow the market for next-gen systems. These initial hardware losses are usually covered by digital game revenues and in-game purchases.</p><p>The PS5 Pro is all about digital sales, shipping without a disc drive. Sure, you can buy one separately ($79.99), but if you don’t bother, Sony will benefit from this digital sales push and the 30 percent cut it gets on most purchases. Microsoft and Sony are both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241265/sony-ps5-pro-game-console-disc-drive-end">pushing toward a discless future</a> for consoles, and it seems likely that next-gen systems won’t ship with disc drives as standard. Hopefully you’ll still be able to purchase one separately, though.</p><p>It also seems likely that next-gen consoles will be a lot more expensive than we’re used to. Component costs aren’t coming down, the console market isn’t growing, and Microsoft’s Xbox chief Phil Spencer admitted earlier this year that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108670/xbox-epic-games-store-phil-spencer-interview">subsidizing hardware is now challenging</a> because the price of components isn’t dropping fast enough.</p><p>Last year, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880635/microsoft-ps5-reveal-email-xbox-nadella-spencer">Microsoft document revealed</a> that the company had planned to subsidize the Xbox Series X and S to the tune of $1.5 billion in 2021 to hit its price targets of $499 and $299, respectively. “That’s our largest hardware subsidy ever” in Microsoft’s profit and loss for its gaming division, the document revealed. With Xbox Series S / X sales still lagging behind the PS5, it’s unlikely that Microsoft is going to gamble again on highly subsidized Xbox hardware for its next-gen consoles.</p><div><figcaption><em>The PS5 Pro promises better visuals at higher frame rates.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>Sony already appears to be at the point of not heavily subsidizing its PlayStation consoles. The lack of a disc drive helps drive console costs down for Sony on both the PS5 Slim and Pro models. The pricing of the PS5 Pro also looks like it’s designed to be profitable from day one, instead of months or years later. It took Sony nearly a year to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609150/sony-playstation-5-ps5-loss-profit">no longer sell the $499 PS5 at a loss</a>, and the company then hiked PS5 prices outside the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321301/sony-ps5-price-increase-europe-uk-japan-china-australia-mexico-canada">a year later</a> to cover inflation and component costs. In 2022, PS5 prices jumped by 10 percent in Europe, 12.5 percent in Japan, and by around 6 percent in the UK. Sony has hiked PS5 prices in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24229420/ps5-prices-are-going-up-again-in-japan">Japan three times</a> since the console’s launch in 2020.</p><p>Crucially, Sony hasn’t ever increased the price of the PS5 in the US, the one market where it still faces competition from Xbox sales. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-microsofts-claim-that-it-has-20-market-share-in-europe-vs-playstations-80-was-accurate">admitted last year</a> that it has a 20 percent market share in Europe, compared to Sony’s 80 percent share. When there’s no competition in Europe, Sony can adjust prices by 10 percent or sell a new PS5 Pro for €799.99 (about $884).</p><p>Pricing is even worse in the UK for the PS5 Pro. The PS5 originally launched at £449 in the UK and $499 in the US — a currency gap given the weaker value of the British pound over the past decade. After the price hike to £479 in 2022, the UK is now facing £699 pricing for the PS5 Pro compared to the $699 launch price in the US. If you want to purchase a PS5 Pro and the separate disc drive in the UK, it works out to a steep $1,045. In the US, it’s as little as $818 with sales tax in many states for the same console and disc drive, nearly a $230 difference.</p><p>Sony faces little competition in Europe and the UK from Xbox console sales, and Microsoft’s plans for an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880111/microsoft-xbox-series-x-new-design-refresh">Xbox Series X redesign</a> have been put on hold. It seems to be skipping a mid-generation spec bump in favor of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174793/microsoft-xbox-series-x-white-digital-edition">all-digital white version of the Xbox Series X</a> and a 2TB limited-edition model. Neither of these offers the improved GPU that the PS5 Pro includes, and it leaves a gap for Sony to set the PS5 Pro pricing around the world accordingly.</p><p>While I’m hopeful that the price of next-gen consoles won’t push close to $999, I can’t help but think that a $699 price tag wouldn’t be all that surprising by the time next-gen hardware arrives. Maybe we’ll all need to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2005-07-06-sony-wants-you-to-earn-that-playstation-3.html">work more hours</a> to afford one. We’re heading into uncharted territory for console generations, and Sony’s PS5 Pro pricing is about to test the waters for the decisions that Sony and Microsoft are making right now for their next-gen hardware choices. Hold on to your disc drives and wallets, because consoles are about to get expensive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Gold Gold Adventure Gold is a game that relies on raw enthusiasm and moxie to power you through a blizzard of confusing references. It boldly describes itself as a "Cult-of-the-Lamb-lite, Rimworld-lite, Majesty-like mixed with Black &amp; White with a pinch of Against the Storm". Whoa there, pardner, save a few subgenres for the rest of us! I think that's half the New &amp; Trending keywords on Steam in one sentence. If you're mystified, best watch the announcement trailer - it paints a clearer picture, though it does involve a startling amount of cartoon decapitation and dismemberment.

Still mystified? I guess I'd better write the rest of this article, then. In this "reverse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> / city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> / pet game", you must (deep breath) construct a settlement around a dungeon to attract adventurers who'll earn you gold with which to buy food for your horrible god-beast pet. 
</p>
<p>
Adventurers come in all shapes and sizes, from undead to mothmen, all represented as pleasantly laconic and fatalistic-seeming 2D anime sprites. You'll lure them to your town with promises of "gold or glory", and assign them quests such as exploration, defending areas, or going after specific munsters. You can let them battle the menagerie by themselves, or intervene and help them secure items and skills. It sounds like you shouldn't let them get too powerful, for "each level brings them one step closer towards a forbidden evolution". 
</p>
<p>
When not enticing and managing adventurers, you'll tend to a growing fantasy-medieval economy based on farming or monster-slaying. The blurb cautions that heroes might try to steer your town's direction, should you let up your Sauron-like surveillance for but a single moment. "Your units have a life of their own - they might form parties, fund their own buildings, or give each other quests," it warns. "Watch your dark alleys closely!" I always do, game.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the matter of your pet god-beast, which must be fed and pampered to stop it running amok. "It might be wise to teach it what is right and wrong, before it grows too big to care about your opinions," explains the blurb. "Raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary discipline it. You might find that it becomes a trusted companion upon your journey!" That "might" has a definite edge to it. I wonder if it'll be like in Black &amp; White, where you and your Creature could end up with opposing moral alignments. If necessary, you can kill two birds with one stone and feed misbehaving heroes to your god-beast.
</p>
<p>
Let me try for a different bundle of references and parallels: this is like you're actually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stay-awhile-and-play-this-free-diablo-inspired-indie-as-the-mayor-of-tristram">running Sanctuary in Diablo</a>, managing those rapscallion dungeon-delvers while also catsitting one of the Prime Evils. The cute-but-grisly visuals remind me of the nastier magic girl animes, like Madoka Magica. I'm quite interested, in short. There’s no release date yet, but you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3133650/Gold_Gold_Adventure_Gold/">Steam</a>.

A used PS5 with a disc drive is $400 instead of $500, and an all-digital one is $350 instead of $450 (the price of the slim which replaced the launch edition).</p><p>While the refurbished units might have scratches or dents, they’re supposed to function fine internally, with Sony providing 12-month manufacturer’s warranties on them. They’re not technically available to buy just yet—the listings still have “Coming soon” on them—but for someone looking to finally take the plunge four years into the current console cycle, it’s not a bad deal, especially when you consider the $350 model is <em>half</em> the price of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-everything-announced-specs-price-1851644090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-everything-announced-specs-price-1851644090">new PS5 Pro launching in November</a></span>. </p><p>Sony has pushed some pretty good PS5 deals from time to time as it tries to hit ambitious sales goals for the console, but there’s never been an actual price cut for the hardware, which is very unusual compared to the PS4 and PS3 generations. As a result, as recently as earlier this year there were roughly 50 million players still using PS4s. And even though Sony’s games are no longer cross-gen on the older machines, perennial blockbusters like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Madden NFL 25</em> are still available on the last-gen consoles. </p><p>Sony is also selling refurbished DualSense controllers, though at $65 that’s a much less appealing value proposition.
