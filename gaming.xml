            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plaion-koch-media-ceo-stepping-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Klemens Kundratitz, the CEO and co-founder of Plaion (formerly known as Koch Media), will step down from his role after 31 years and take an advisory role with parent company Embracer Group.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Kundratitz has decided that it's time to "take a step back and spend more time with his family", and so he's handing over the CEO reins to Phil Rogers, an exec who's "leading the creation of the new Middle-earth &amp; Friends operating unit".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Middle-earth &amp; Friends is one of the three companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">into which Embracer Group will be splitting</a>&nbsp;during this year, alongside tabletop division Asmodee and indie label Coffee Stain &amp; Friends.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/plaion-koch-media-ceo-klemens-kundratitz-kingdom-come-deliverance.jpg?itok=NU5JGk3e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/plaion-koch-media-ceo-klemens-kundratitz-kingdom-come-deliverance.jpg?itok=EbZDFiuL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Through its various divisions, Plaion has published a number of games, including&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Kundratitz, who co-founded Plaion as Koch Media alongside Franz Koch back in 1994, says he's "delighted" to be handing over CEO duties to Rogers, and that he believes Rogers will continue Plaion's "excellent momentum".</p>

<p>For his part, Rogers says he's "excited" to start building Middle-earth &amp; Friends as Plaion's new CEO, and that Kundratitz has built an "incredible legacy" over the course of his 31 years with the company.</p>

<p>Though you might not recognize Plaion's name, you'll probably know at least one of the publishing labels under its stewardship, namely Deep Silver, Ravenscourt, and Prime Matter.</p>

<p>Through Deep Silver, Plaion has published games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/payday-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Payday 3</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-island-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead Island 2</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metro-exodus" rel="nofollow"><em>Metro Exodus</em></a>, while the Prime Matter label is responsible for the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a>&nbsp;</em>(whose developer Warhorse Studios is also a subsidiary of Plaion) and 2023's&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-remake-plaion-koch-media-ceo.jpg?itok=1865tiQI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-remake-plaion-koch-media-ceo.jpg?itok=gCCB_aF9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many pies in which Plaion has its fingers.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Kundratitz himself, while he's stepping back from CEO duties with Plaion, he's not leaving Embracer entirely. He'll now serve as a "strategic advisor" for the group, which, given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow">recent financial woes</a>, I'm sure will be appreciated.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that Kundratitz's departure will have a material effect on Embracer or its companies from a public-facing perspective, but we'll have to wait and see whether anything changes as a result of this management shift. Stay tuned.</p>

Capcom said its running the additional betas to give more players a chance to try the game who might have missed the first test back in November.</p><p>But while the publisher said it learned a lot from that weekend in terms of player feedback and complaints, don’t expect anything different this time around. “Please bear in mind that these improvements, including performance, game balance, weapon mechanics, known issues and more will not be reflected in the OBT 2 build,” the company stated this week. </p><p>Those improvements, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlined by <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>director Yuya Tokuda in a previous video</a></span>, will eventually include monsters moving to new areas less frequently, and making “hitstop” more noticeable so smacking enemies with giant swords and axes feels more satisfying. The team announced several balance tweaks to weapons as well. It’s unclear why these couldn’t be added to the game for the new betas, which would no doubt have given Capcom even more time to gauge community feedback ahead of the game’s full release. That is, after all, what betas are supposed to be for.</p><p>Instead, fans will have to wait until February 28 to see the changes in action. At that point, anyone who participated in one of the betas will get their bonus rewards like a decorative in-game pendant and a starter item pack of meat, traps, and other monster hunting necessities.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next Pokemon Presents date has seemingly been leaked, and it comes from an unexpected source. </p>



<p>A keen-eyed <a href="https://x.com/mattyoukhana_/status/1876988464878567879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">user on Twitter</a> spotted metadata from Niantic that hints at the next Pokemon Presents taking place on February 27, 2025. In the data it shows a title of “Pokemon Presents 2025 x GO Tour: Unova Timed Research”. </p>



<p>The leaked date shouldn’t come as a surprise. Since 2021, there has been a Pokemon Presents on February 27 every year to coincide with Pokemon Day. If we are looking at when each of the last four events were announced, they usually didn’t come until just days prior. That means fans shouldn’t expect an official announcement on the next Pokemon Presents until around February 20 or so. </p>







<p>As far as what to expect during the showcase, it’s clear based on the title that a new timed research event for Pokemon Go will be shown. Also, with Pokemon Legends Z-A scheduled to launch this year, it could be assumed that the game will be shown in some way.  Elsewhere, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket is likely to see a solid presence after it’s successful launch late last year. There’s also a good chance The Pokemon Company has a surprise or two up its sleeve in honor of the 29th Anniversary of Pokemon’s 1996 launch.</p>



<p>Whatever The Pokemon Company has in store for fans, Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the broadcast.</p>



<p>What do you think we see during the Pokemon Presents on Pokemon Day 2025? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

                <p>Next month, Capcom will bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/" data-ref-id="1100-6526070">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to players just over seven years since the last mainline game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review-a-very-ice-ti/1900-6417288/" data-ref-id="1900-6417288">Monster Hunter: World</a>, debuted in 2018. There was an open beta for players in October, and now Capcom has announced that a second open beta in February. The news was accompanied by the following video, which features Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto using the create-a-character function to place himself in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXWAYmEQKso" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YXWAYmEQKso" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In terms of content, the new beta will be very similar to the one from last year. Players will still be able to use the character creator, try out the story trial, and complete the Slay Doshaguma quest. However, this version of the demo will also include Gypceros, a monster from the previous games who was absent in the first demo.</p><p>According to Tsujimoto, characters created in the first beta can be carried over to the second beta and to the final version of the game as well. However, game progress will not be transferable. The second open beta will be held over two weekends on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It will also be cross-platform, and the beta is open to all players regardless of whether they have Game Pass or PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Players who take part in the new beta will get bonus in-game rewards including a charm for a weapon and an item pack. The second beta will take place from February 6 at at 7 PM PT / 10 PM ET until February 9 at the same time. Then the beta will have another weekend preview on February 13-16, presumably during the same hours as the previous event.</p><p>Tsujimoto noted that the team has implemented changes based on feedback to the first beta test, which attracted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-begins-with-almost-500000-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6527527/" data-ref-id="1100-6527527">almost 500,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. Unfortunately, those changes will not be in the next beta. Instead, Capcom will likely wait until the game's February 28 release date to implement those improvements.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/freedom-wars-remastered-review-abductor-slayer.1077036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/freedom-wars-remastered-review-abductor-slayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In September of last year, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/freedom-wars-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">announced</a>. The circles I frequent online were quite enthusiastic about this, despite me having never heard of the game. I mean, I didn't even own a <a href="https://techraptor.net/platform/playstation-vita" rel="nofollow">PS Vita</a>, it seemed like a completely obscure title. Still, the excitement from my friends piqued my interest, so I had to see what <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> was all about.</p>

<p>It seemed like a weird choice to revive a dormant IP exclusive to the PS Vita, but I'm glad I took the chance to review it. Turns out, <em>Freedom Wars </em><em>Remastered</em> is a quirky and competent take on the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/monster-hunter" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter</a> </em>formula, and that makes for an addicting game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-screenshot-1_1.jpg?itok=BxiFgXLe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-screenshot-1_1.jpg?itok=2Nmk-fdF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I guess I'll take that as a compliment?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Freedom Wars Remastered,</em> a Decade After the Original</h2>

<p>As <em>Freedom Wars</em> is a remaster of a PS Vita title from 2014, you might expect it to look a bit dated visually. The smaller screen of a Vita means lower resolution, so obviously graphics aren't going to be on par with that of consoles.</p>

<p>Still, developer Dimps Corporation makes a commendable effort to revitalize <em>Freedom Wars</em> with this remaster. With upgraded textures and running a higher resolution, <em>Freedom Wars</em> <em>Remastered</em> looks very good considering its origins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=AD2jGueH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=1iW1Ohiw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The squad's here!</figcaption></figure><p>Supposedly, it can run on 4k resolution. I couldn't find any way to tweak graphics on the PS5 version of <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>, so I'll just have to take the developer's word for it. I presume PC versions will have more options to adjust visuals. At the very least, I can say <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> runs at 60 FPS, so it's a smooth ride.</p>

<p>Really, the only issue is some animations look a little janky, especially during dialogue. There's a lot of talking in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered, </em>and facial animations are super rudimentary. It's nothing that'll detract from the experience; in fact, it's usually the only <em>visual </em>reminder that this was once a PS Vita game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay.jpg?itok=nxl8UtQJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay.jpg?itok=8fGmfn3e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's satisfying to drag down a big ol' monster!</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting For the Cause in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>To put it simply, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> takes the <em>Monster Hunter</em> formula and gives it a gratifying hook (as if <em>Monster Hunter </em>wasn't already addicting). Not only are you acquiring new materials to upgrade equipment, but you also have a million-year prison sentence. As a sinner, you're tasked with working off that sentence by taking on various operations.</p>

<p>Your player character's prison sentence literally looms over your head, and just about every action you do either contributes to or diminishes said sentence. Stand around in one place too long? The game will give you a few decades to think about your ungodly crime.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-sentence-2.jpg?itok=5K79MwUD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-sentence-2.jpg?itok=5slMXScb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just a drop in the bucket.</figcaption></figure><p>And so, that's where these operations come in. Completing various missions, ranging from extermination of "Abductors" (<em>Freedom Wars' </em>version of monsters), rescuing citizens, and donating valuable resources to the cause, all help diminish that prison term.</p>

<p>Watching the prison sentence deteriorate over the course of the campaign and into the endgame is a very satisfying feeling, even if it's an arbitrary number. It's a way to catalog your rank among other players and track your progress. Having this little way to measure your efforts encouraged me to do "just one more mission."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-dragon.jpg?itok=viEelOT3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-dragon.jpg?itok=35ppx2Ns 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We got Rathalos at home.</figcaption></figure><p>This progress is also tracked via online leaderboards. It's a multiplayer game with other sinners, and each sinner belongs to a Panopticon. Think of a Panopticon as your home base. You choose this at the beginning of the game when you're customizing your character, and each Panopticon represents a prefecture of Japan.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this will change once the public has hands on it, but the original version of <em>Freedom Wars</em> split Panopticons as cities around the globe. Though, as far as I know, the only choice now is Japan's prefectures, so I went with Hokkaido.</p>

<p>The leaderboard tallies your contribution both within the Panopticon and against other prefectures, so it's again, a very neat little measure to see how everyone's progressing and incentivizes some friendly competition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-anductor.jpg?itok=PnRJ97GW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-anductor.jpg?itok=3xdoBSgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, guns are the best option!</figcaption></figure><h2>On the Hunt in<em> Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>It's in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s combat that many players will find some sort of familiarity with. I don't like to draw comparisons to other games if I can help it, but it's hard to ignore the fact that<em> Freedom Wars Remastered</em> plays a great deal like <em>Monster Hunter</em>.</p>

<p>The whole routine of fighting giant monsters (Abductors), severing parts, upgrading your equipment from said parts, and going back into the fray is the general gameplay loop here. Though, on its own, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> is a competent action game, even if it's a bit light on game mechanics.</p>

<p>There are several different weapon types to choose from, each with its own skillset, as well as firearms. You can equip yourself with two different weapons at once, so that gives room for some versatility. You're also given several AI companions if you're playing solo, as well as your own customizable Accessory -- this is a robot companion that helps you out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-combat-2.jpg?itok=4jYnJyuJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-combat-2.jpg?itok=1BcP709u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once they're on the ground, it's time to lay on the hurt.</figcaption></figure><p>To top it all off, you have a thorn, which makes <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s gameplay quite enjoyable. By shooting a thorn onto a wall or enemy, you can launch yourself to that location and pull off some cool air attacks. It's especially useful against Abductors so you can sever parts that are higher up.</p>

<p>Thorns are super fun to use, launching yourself around gargantuan foes like you're from <em>Attack on Titan</em>. It adds just a bit of extra oomph to the gameplay, though the rest of <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> could do with either new weapons, a few new attacks, or just something else to help it stand out.</p>

<p>Enemy variety, too, is just a bit repetitive. Most enemies come in the form of Abductors, and they increase in power as you progress through the campaign. The thing is, most of them follow the same template of being bipeds, quadrupeds, and the like, and they don't look or act all that different as time goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story.jpg?itok=PPPqQDfj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story.jpg?itok=zdJCpUkl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aries, one of the story's several key characters.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Story That Never Reaches Its Potential in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>My thoughts on <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s story are conflicted. On one hand, I really like its premise and setting, but on the other, the way the story is told is not all that great. The setting is, you're in this resource war, as presumably the world's resources are sparse in that day and age.</p>

<p>As such, Sinners are required to gather resources. Regular civilians are kidnapped by rival Panopticons' Abductors, and Sinners have to go save them. Meanwhile, there are various factions working within and outside of your Panopticon with different agendas and motives, most of which remain vague throughout the duration.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story-2.jpg?itok=KXrymuDK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story-2.jpg?itok=Rsv1EFyt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most of the characters are likable enough.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> ends on an absurdly disappointing note. There are some post-game activities, but as I understand it, the story was supposed to continue in a sequel that never was. It leads to some mysteries that are never solved, which is a shame.</p>

<p><em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> also presents its story in a sloppy way. The start of the game is front-loaded with a ton of dialogue, so it's super slow-going at first and really could do better with its pacing. On top of that, walking around your Panopticon to continue the story is pretty sluggish and doesn't make for exciting gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-customization.jpg?itok=WuNewecB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-customization.jpg?itok=ybAIuWRi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You get to create and customize your own Sinner!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Freedom Wars Remastered </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1OD00IBWxM" rel="nofollow">a few enhancements</a> that returning players will enjoy. Apparently, upgrading weapons has become a more seamless experience. They've added subtle improvements to combat overall, and even a new difficulty mode. These are additions that I initially took for granted, but when I learned about how <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> changed for the better, I was very appreciative of these tweaks.</p>

<p>Despite some problems with <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s story and the lack of depth in its gameplay, I still had a lot of fun with this title. Seeing your sentence diminish as time goes on is a gratifying feeling. Moreover, once it launches for players worldwide, I imagine the conflict amongst other Panopticons will lead to some exciting rivalries.</p>

<p>Who knows, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> might even lead to the long-awaited sequel. I'd absolutely love to see <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s formula expanded upon. More depth in its gameplay and a more developed story in a sequel would make it a strong rival to <em>Monster Hunter</em>.</p>

Other new events include Locked Chests, for which you'll need Keys, and the Sacrificial Idol, which lets you give up health for damage.</p>

<p>New NPCs have also been added in the form of the Refugees, a small group of unfortunate souls who will ask for your help if they encounter you. Passtech says they either represent "a glimmer of hope in your journey, or a bad decision around the corner".</p>

            <p>The more I tell you about <a href="https://neal.fun/stimulation-clicker/">Stimulation Clicker</a>, the less funny it will be, so let's keep this brief. It's an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more "stimulation" you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer's processor. After 30 minutes, I was huffing and hooting like a drunken horse to a soundtrack of disintegrating laptop fans.</p><!--more-->
<p>Stimulation Clicker angles forward and backward through the history of the internet. On the one hand, it's a merciless piece of trolling that tramples all over nerve endings worn to the hilt by the web 3.0 era of hyper-velocity enshittification. On the other, it's a testament to the expressive power of HTML, a reminder of those glory days 20 years ago when every website was a wishing well full of elusive or hidden moving parts and connections, including digital will-o'-the-wisps called "pop ups" that, back then, were a source of wonder and curiosity. You'd even click on them, occasionally! Awwwwww. I miss the internet being good.</p>
<p>Thanks to reader jamhandy for spotting Stimulation Clicker and chucking it into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-26">the latest Maw liveblog</a>.

But Ronald appears to want to make a distinction, suggesting the goal of creating a handheld would be to use the company’s expertise gained over decades of making consoles, and bring that to a portable PC. “I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together,” the VP said told <em>The Verge</em>, “because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console.”</p><p>The goal, it seems, is to bring the two together. Or, perhaps more frankly, to make Windows less of a pain in the ass to use on a small screen. It’s something Microsoft hasn’t traditionally been great at. Did you ever own a Windows-based cellphone? I did! Haha! It was so bad. Then remember Microsoft’s last big attempt, with Windows 7's abysmal attempt to become tile-based, compromising its entire UI for the desktops everyone was using it on for the sake of portable devices on which no one was?</p><p>With every tech firm under the sun attempting to ride the success of Valve’s Steam Deck device and launching their own handheld PCs, Microsoft clearly wants a slice of the pie, but perhaps knows that Windows 11 wouldn’t cut it, and that it’d never be able to show its face again if it used a Linux-based interface. That’s likely driving Donald’s declarations of bringing the simpler UX of an Xbox to a Windows-powered portable. However, he’s being coy, telling <em>The Verge</em> “we’ll have a lot more to share later this year.”</p><p>However, what he has to say just now sounds awfully familiar. “I think,” Donald says, “at the end of the day our goal is to make Windows great for gaming on any device.” Which is a refrain we’ve heard countless times across countless iterations of the operating system. Each major new release comes with a major new push to make Windows so great for gaming, and none ever catches on. (Remember when Windows Vista launched, trumpeting a feature that would score your PC’s hardware out of 10, and believed the industry would publish games with a matching score so you’d know if it worked? No? Exactly.) And yet, bizarrely, Windows has <em>always</em> been the default OS for PC gaming, inevitably working far better the less Microsoft has tried to get involved.</p><p>But, as Donald points out, the Xbox OS is sitting on top of a lot of Windows’ code, so it shouldn’t be a herculean task to bring its tiled world across to a handheld device. Obviously it needs to be reworked for a PC such that it never needs a cursor input or a taskbar to be clicked, and sure, the Xbox already manages this, but that’s largely thanks to all the ways it’s defiantly <em>not</em> behaving like a PC, with its incredibly limited settings and locked-down nature. “There’s fundamental interaction models that we’re working on,” says Donald, “to make sure that regardless of the operating system details, it feels very natively like a gaming-centric device and a gaming-centric experience.”</p><p>So, the real message here is, forget about a possible portable Xbox for now, we could well be seeing a portable PC that <em>feels </em>like an Xbox within the year.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Amidst several announcements of new handhelds powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-apus-gaming-handhelds-z2-extreme-strix-z2-hawk-z2-go-rembrandt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's Ryzen Z2 processor</a>, Microsoft also talked about its upcoming highly anticipated Xbox handheld at CES 2025.</p>
<p>The Verge was able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discuss the subject with Jason Ronald</a>, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem at Microsoft. Ronald, who previously led the development of the Xbox One X and Xbox Series S|X console launches, promised that the Xbox handheld would offer users the best of console and PC put together.</p>
<p><em>We’ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it’s really about how do we bring those innovations that we’ve incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space.</em></p>
<p><em>I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together,because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console. What we’re doing is we’re really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re focused on really simplifying that and making it much more like a console experience. Our goal is to put the player and their library at the center of the experience and not all the Windows work that you have to do today.</em></p>
<p>The launch of the Xbox handheld isn't quite imminent, but Ronald teased that Microsoft would share a lot more later this year.</p>
<p>There have been rumors about Microsoft's handheld projects for years. Head of gaming Phil Spencer finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed it</a> with his recent comments but also said the handheld is still 'a few years' out. Putting two and two together, it sounds like late 2026 could be a likely release window. The new Xbox home console is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to debut in late 2026</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-lands-later-this-month-beta-28-out-now.1076997/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bay 12 Games and publisher Kitfox Games have announced that the&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>Adventure Mode will be launching out of beta later this month.</p>

<p>In an update on Steam, Bay 12's Tarn Adams and Kitfox's Alexandra Orlando reveal that Adventure Mode will arrive on January 23rd, having been available as part of <i>Dwarf Fortress</i>' beta branch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/4186734162819864096" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">since April</a> last year.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not aware of Adventure Mode, it's effectively a roguelike-style RPG gameplay mode in which you can explore the worlds you've generated as part of&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>' main colony management gameplay, taking on quests and discovering all manner of exciting things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date-exploration.jpg?itok=yKUTx2CM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date-exploration.jpg?itok=rEgyJLzA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adventure Mode officially lands in&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>on January 23rd.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Adams and Orlando say that focus will shift "back to Fortress Mode very soon", they also promise that Adventure Mode's full release is "not the end" of development for the feature.</p>

<p>Rather, there will be "many updates" for both Fortress Mode and Adventure Mode in future, and the two say there's "more to add" to the roguelike mode as well, so you'll be getting extra features in the months to come.</p>

<p>As well as the Adventure Mode release date announcement, a new&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>beta update has also arrived today. Beta 28 adds tons of new features including new graphics, changes to character creation, and tons of gameplay tweaks.</p>

<p>If you want to read the beta update's full patch notes, then you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/530961267633946651" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here via Steam</a>. It's well worth checking them out if you want to see some of the super-granular changes Kitfox and Bay 12 have made to the game's beta branch.</p>




<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, it's a colony management sim in which you must oversee a colony of dwarves attempting to survive in a hostile procedurally-generated world.</p>

<p>The game is well-known for its emergent gameplay; the procedural generation and multiple interlocking systems of&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>often allow amusing things to happen, many of which will be unique to each player's playthrough.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>was released all the way back in 2006, but the version being updated today is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-steam-release-date-unleashes-chaos" rel="nofollow">the 2022 paid version</a>, which updates the game's presentation and makes various other quality-of-life improvements.</p>

If you’re among the new PlayStation VR2 owners, you might feel overwhelmed looking at the over 300 games that are compatible with it. Where should you start?</p><p>There are many gems available via PlayStation VR2, ranging from VR-exclusive games to regular games with immersive VR modes. We could sit here all day listing everything worth playing on the console, but for people who just want to see what Sony’s headset can do, these eight games will offer you some of the best experiences the system has to offer. </p></div></div><div><p>It is literally impossible to make a list of the best VR games without starting with <em>Beat Saber</em>. It is the <em>Wii Sports </em>of VR gaming; it’s easy to learn, hard to master, and is a perfect use of motion-controlled technology. Even those who normally don’t take to VR games can enjoy <em>Beat Saber</em>’s straightforward gameplay, and it’s a surprisingly good workout to boot. I mean, it’s dancing with swords, what’s not to like?</p><p>Alternatively, if you like the idea of <em>Beat Saber </em>but don’t have cash to spend now, <strong>Synth Riders offers a similar rhythm game experience</strong> and is included with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. So if you have Sony’s subscription service and need something to tide you over, be sure to give that game a look.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-call-the-mountain-review-ps5-ps-vr2-forbidden-1850121501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-call-the-mountain-review-ps5-ps-vr2-forbidden-1850121501"><em>Horizon Call Of The Mountain</em></a></span><em> </em>honestly feels like a PlayStation VR2 tech demo, but it’s still really fun to play. As the name suggests, this is more a mountain climbing simulator than a VR-ified version of Sony’s flagship <em>Horizon </em>franchise. However, mountain climbing works <em>very </em>well in VR, especially since you can take in all the beautiful AAA-quality sights and get those tingles in your feet when you look down. I’m deathly afraid of heights and still enjoyed my time with this one.</p><p>It’s not a game that’s worth the standalone price of $60, in my opinion. However, since many Sony PlayStation VR2 headsets currently include this game as a pack-in at no additional cost, you’d be silly to pass it by. I liked it a heck of a lot for free.</p></div><div><p>Look, I get it, not everyone is necessarily chomping at the bit to play racing games unless there are red turtle shells involved. Despite that, you really have to give <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> a try if you’re looking for an immersive VR experience. It’s exhilarating to feel yourself in the driver’s seat as you race at 100+ MPH, and the Dualsense controller makes for a great motion-controlled steering wheel with its haptic feedback.</p><p>There’s never been a better time to try <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstations-gran-turismo-7-is-basically-getting-a-free-1851713486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstations-gran-turismo-7-is-basically-getting-a-free-1851713486">Sony recently released a free VR2-compatible demo of the game called <em>My First Gran Turismo</em></a></span>. Even if you just play it for ten minutes for the sheer novelty, you’ll enjoy your time.</p></div><div><p><strong>Currently available with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</strong></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401"><em>Before Your Eyes</em></a></span><em> </em>is more of an interactive movie than a game, but it’s a journey well-worth taking. Controlled entirely with your eyes and head movements, <em>Before Your Eyes</em> is both a celebration of life and a somber reflection about how we move forward in the face of tragedy. All I’ll say is that I had to clean the tears off my headset’s lens after I was finished.</p><p>It’s a good experience worth its asking price, but if you can get it for free via PlayStation Plus, this is a no-brainer.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a></span><em> </em>is already an incredible audio and visual feast for the senses, so you’re doing yourself a disservice if you haven’t played this one in VR. Also, I mean…it’s <em>Tetris</em>. You know you like <em>Tetris</em>, I know you like <em>Tetris</em>, so trying to explain why <em>Tetris </em>is great is like trying to explain why sunrises are great. <br></p></div><div><p><strong>Currently available with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</strong></p><p><em>Synapse </em>asks the question “what’s the most fun thing someone can do in VR” and lands on the answer “do cool telekinesis stuff with one hand while you shoot bad guys with the other.” It’s an incredibly playful use of the technology, and it innovates with its motion controls beyond the usual point-and-shoot antics of other games. This one’s a roguelike too, so even if you have a rough time getting the hang of it, you’ll at least enter your next run stronger.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Synapse </em>lacks a bit in content. That might make this one a tough sell for $34.99, but it’s a perfect grab for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers.</p></div><div><p><em>Resident Evil 4 </em>is one of the most replayable games ever made, so it was no surprise that 2023’s <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> would go down as one of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">the year’s best games</a></span>. And now, thanks to a free downloadable update that reimagines the game in VR, you can experience this all-time classic horror adventure in a brand new way. The motion-controlled aiming made me recall fond memories of playing <em>Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition</em>, and parrying attacks with your knife is so, <em>so </em>satisfying in VR.</p><p>You will be regularly reminded that <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> was not originally designed for a first-person perspective. Cutscenes will play out as they did in the original flat screen version of the game, and actions like melee attacks will occur in third person (which is probably for the better, just thinking about Leon’s roundhouse kick in first person makes me motion sick). Regardless, if you need a reason to dive back into the world of survival horror, this is it.</p></div><div><p>I typically don’t double-up on games in the same franchise on lists like this, but <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a></span> are both so uniquely good as VR experiences that it’d be an injustice to not include both. Especially in this case, because <em>Resident Evil Village </em>actually <em>was</em> designed with a first-person perspective in mind. Key cutscenes will play out in VR, the combat feels simultaneously scary and enthralling, and the interface looks surprisingly natural. I’ve actually never seriously played <em>Resident Evil Village </em>until I tried it in VR, and even people watching me playing asked if the game was VR exclusive. It’s that good!</p><p>I will say the VR mode isn’t a perfect conversion. For example, you can twist your head around during cutscenes and view character models floating around that the player clearly was never meant to see. Still, <em>Resident Evil Village </em>reigns as my favorite experience with the PlayStation VR2, and it’s an incredibly easy recommendation if you want a bonafide adventure in the virtual world. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-reveal-new-parkour-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has just released a new blog post detailing the parkour systems for Assassin’s Creed Shadows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parkour has always been an integral system for every Assassin’s Creed title, and it seems to be a handy tool in Shadows. Parkour will be an excellent feature for exploration and a key tool for stealth and combat. Naoe is the parkour master, and she can quickly scale castles, leap across rooftops and surf the crowds in the streets of Kyoto thanks to her speed and agility. Check out how parkour works in Assassin’s Creed Shadows below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-parkour-inputs-for-assassin-s-creed-shadows-nbsp">New Parkour Inputs for Assassin’s Creed Shadows&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The upcoming game has changed specific inputs to add more mechanics. The crouch and dodge buttons have switched places to add the ability to go prone and let dodge mechanics lead directly to parkour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will see that dodge and parkour down mechanics have merged thanks to the new input mapping. The new mapping will also disable the stance switch so that you can use any stance when going down from a rooftop. Players will also see new moves with the dodge button, such as acrobatic dodges over railings, jumping out of windows, or new silent drop-downs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-parkour-moves-nbsp">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Parkour Moves&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-parkour-up">Parkour Up</h3>



<p>Players who have played previous Assassin’s Creed games will know that this mechanic lets players hold a button to scale any building or structure they want, and the same parkour system will make its way to Shadows, too. The mechanic works while running up walls, jumping across gaps and leaping into the void. Naoe is better at jumping further and reaching higher than Yasuke.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-recovery-roll-nbsp">Recovery Roll&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When jumping from a distance, players can use the Igan Recovery Roll by pressing the dodge/parkour down button, considerably softening the blow and reducing the noise.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Parkour Up &amp; Recovery Roll" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/33Yq6RcLE8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down">Parkour Down</h3>



<p>Here’s where the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows parkour system comes into play. As dodge and parkour mechanics have blended, players can press dodge near a ledge to transition into a parkour down traversal. Naoe will have acrobatic descents, while Yasuke will have heavy drops. Parkour down will let you access the safest lowest point below your character and avoid the player needlessly jumping into the void.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Dodge to Drop Down" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZMKe8NZBTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-sprint-mechanics-nbsp">Sprint Mechanics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A new system unique to Naoe, the fastest assassin in the franchise, has been introduced. This mechanic allows players to trigger an extended dive roll over smaller objects such as fences, crates, rails, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows also includes two more systems: automated passovers and shoulder tackles. Automated Passovers allow the characters to jump over smaller objects acrobatically. On the other hand, automated shoulder tackle is exclusive to Yasuke, allowing him to bash through enemies or destructive objects while sprinting. If there are non-destructible objects, Yasuke will use automated passover, but it won’t be as clean as Naoe.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Sprint Dodge to Escape" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fm0OssNa4eI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-grappling-mechanics">Grappling Mechanics</h2>



<p>Apart from sprinting and parkour, Assassin’s Creed Shadows players can also access a grappling hook. With this tool, players can perform vertical ascents and hook swings. Naoe can also scale unclimbable walls by wall running and using the grappling hook on a ledge.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Wall Run to Grappling Hook" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/obO-PMO1Tfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-advanced-parkour-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Advanced Parkour in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<h3 id="h-stance-dodges">Stance dodges</h3>



<p>There are three types of stances: standing, crouching, and prone, and each stance has its own way of dodging for Naoe. Yasuke can dodge directionally while standing and crouching; however, only Naoe can dodge directionally while prone. This prone dodge will allow her to move side-to-side, roll forward, or slide backwards.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Prone Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-wall-run-eject">Wall Run Eject</h3>



<p>Thanks to her acrobatic skills, Naoe can run up any wall. The Wall Eject tool allows her to perform an incredible jump off the wall by pressing the parkour button at the top of the run. If her hands and feet are connected to a surface, Naoe can also use this move while climbing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down-backward-dodge-and-high-structure-safety-nbsp">Parkour Down Backward Dodge and High Structure Safety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Parkour Down Backward Dodge is a new move that allows the character to move while their back is facing the edge. In this position, the player can tap the parkour down button without directional input to cause their character to perform a backward dodge, rolling over the edge and down on the ground with a “muffled landing.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Backward Drop Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXehGq8UkuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Parkour Down High Structure Safety is a new system that provides safety for the character at heights where fall damage could occur. In this situation, using parkour-down transitions would cause the character to hold on to the edge and hang there. You must press an additional button to make the character drop-down or climb up.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-unclimbable-surfaces">Unclimbable Surfaces</h2>



<p>Lastly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have surfaces that Yasuke and Naoe <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd/assassins-creed-shadows-parkour-system-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cannot climb</a> with the help of parkour, as they do not have any physical handholds to grab on. The associate game director, Simon, shared that this move is a big deal for them as they must be “more thoughtful about creating interesting parkour highways.” Additionally, this allows them to have “more control about where Naoe can go and where Yasuke can’t,” adding more contrast to the play style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the developers have assured that most Assassin’s Creed Shadows areas are “very much climbable,” and even more so with the grappling hook. Players must look for “valid entry points from time to time.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>AT CES 2025, Microsoft VP of Next Generation Jason Ronald teased a refreshed user experience for Windows handheld gaming PCs: one that could combine the best aspects of its operating system and Xbox. While Windows 11 allows for more choice--users can access Steam, Epic Games Store, and several other marketplaces--it can be a chore to use because it is natively designed for PCs and laptops--not handheld systems with much smaller screens.</p><p>"We've been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it's really about how do we bring those innovations that we've incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space," Ronald said an AMD and Lenovo event (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>). "I would say it's bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together, because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it's really locked to the console. What we're doing is we're really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem."</p><p>Ronald explained that Microsoft aims to bring a console-like experience to handhelds and "make Windows great for gaming" on any device. Microsoft will have more details to share later in the year, Ronald said, adding that the idea is to move away from a Windows desktop setup on handhelds and toward a "gaming-centric" experience.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox chief Phil Spencer has candidly spoken about the idea of a Xbox handheld device for several month, and it has been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">Microsoft is currently working on a prototype</a> that is still years away from being released.

                <p>Final Fantasy VII is among the most beloved entries in the series, but could there one day be another film adaptation? Final Fantasy producer Yoshinori Kitase said in an interview recently that, although nothing is "officially planned," he's aware of the game's appeal in Hollywood.</p><p>Kitase told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFpVyK1mOF0&amp;list=PL6131eG2y0-DzWByPNNy2G8sLe2EL12os&amp;index=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Danny Pena</a> that he's "seen and heard about various Hollywood directors and actors playing Final Fantasy VII, and many creators respect the title."</p><p>Kitase added: "I've been hearing things about creators out there who are very interested in the property who love the Final Fantasy 7 universe. And so, yeah, personally, I would love to see something come out of these creators in terms of a cinematic or some kind of visual piece."</p><p>However, he confirmed "no talks have been had" about making Final Fantasy VII into a Hollywood movie.</p><p>Square Enix has already launched a Final Fantasy VII movie, having released the 2005 anime Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Directed by veteran artist Tetsuya Nomura, the straight-to-DVD film takes place a couple years after the events of the game.</p><p>Before this, actor Robert Pattinson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tenet-stars-robert-pattinson-john-david-washington/1100-6481355/" data-ref-id="1100-6481355">Final Fantasy VII was one of his favorite video games, pointing out how it made him cry</a>.

            <p>
Arcane fans have a five-minute animated treat to enjoy today, in the shape of a new story cinematic released by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> maker Riot Games. 
</p>
<p>
The video is primarily designed to showcase Noxus, the setting for League of Legends' new season which begins tomorrow, and the home of prominent character Mel Medarda.
</p>
<p>
But the video is simultaneously also a continuation of Mel's storyline from Arcane itself, and seems to set up what we may see next in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-cinematic-universe-to-expand-with-three-more-league-of-legends-animated-series">Arcane's upcoming Noxus-based continuation</a>. And if you need further reason to watch, the cinematic was created in partnership with Fortiche, the talented French animation house behind Arcane. Here it is:
</p>

<a aria-label="Welcome to Noxus - Bite Marks (ft.

<p>
First off, we can tell this is absolutely set after Arcane's second season due to Mel's new golden tattoos she acquires during its storyline. 
</p>
<p>
Here, we also get a proper look at LeBlanc, leader of the Black Rose group, who popped up within Arcane's second season but stayed largely disguised. She's seen here chatting with Vladimir, another League of Legends champion, about some unscrupulous-sounding plans for the Noxian empire.
</p><p>Following the conclusion of Arcane, showrunner Christian Linke confirmed the series would be followed by three additional shows featuring other locations within the League of Legends world. The first, set in Noxus, began production a year ago - and today's cinematic almost feels like a first trailer for that. Other series will then feature the regions of Demacia and Ionia.
</p>
<p>"We're really going wide, we're looking at every region and we really now have the ability to build a slate to tell many more stories - and continue some of them," Linke said previously.</p>
<p>If you haven't watched Arcane yet, it remains one of the best video game adaptations of all time and requires zero prior knowledge regarding League of Legends itself. Its first season is flawless, while its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">second was marred slightly from pacing issues due it cramming so many story threads in</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-film-gets-positive-update-more-than-10-years-after-its-director-was-first-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>10 years after he was first attached to the project, It and The Flash director Andrés Muschietti says he still has plans for Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> film adaptation.</p>
<p>The Shadow of the Colossus film has been, it is fair to say, a long time coming. We first got wind of an adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-in-works">all the way back in 2009</a>, when it was suggested that creator Fumito Ueda would be involved in some capacity. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-developing-shadow-of-the-colossus-movie">Chronicle director Josh Trank then joined the project in 2012</a>, but this still didn't seem to kick the film into any sort of gear. The following year, Sony then hired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-hires-hanna-writer-for-shadow-of-the-colossus-film">Hanna writer Seth Lochhead to pen the script for the adaptation</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, it was then revealed Trank had left the project to head to a galaxy far, far away instead (nothing sinister, just Star Wars). At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-now-helmed-by-mama-director">Muschietti was announced to be taking over the reins from Trank</a>. But, like I said, that was in 2014. So, it has been over a decade since Muschietti was first brought on to direct the still non-existent Shadow of the Colossus film.</p>

</figure>
<p>And yet there is still hope, despite a very long period of absolutely no news whatsoever. Muschietti has now said he still has plans for the adaptation, and there is a script. In a conversation with programme <a href="https://youtu.be/Tugk5mzMHqM?t=2670">"La Baulera del Coso"</a> on Radio TU, Muschietti assured listeners the film was not "an abandoned project by any means" (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-is-alive-and-has-a-script/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>"I'm not a big gamer, but Shadow of the Colossus seems to me a masterpiece and I played it several times," Muschietti said. "The film has been in development for 10 years and now the possibility of making it is opening up."</p>
<p>Muschietti stated he likes the project's script "very much", but admitted there were still a number of hurdles that needed to be sorted before the film could really get going. Namely, the financial side of things.</p>
<p>"Shadow of the Colossus is a cult game, but to make a good film, there is a studio that puts the numbers and says how much it is worth to give the director $200m, $150m, or $100m," he said. "There are different versions of the film, and obviously, I want them to give me $200m, but this is another factor to take into account."</p>
<p>So, I guess with this update, it is now a case of once again waiting to see if Muschietti gets the funds he hopes for, and then perhaps the Shadow of the Colossus adaptation will finally begin filming.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Colossus is not the only PlayStation IP currently slated for a film release. Just yesterday, the company announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">adaptations of both Helldivers 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn</a>. Meanwhile, its Until Dawn film is set to release this April, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">new cast of characters taking center stage in a brand new story</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first open beta <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">took place in November</a>&nbsp;and was so popular that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam player count records</a> for the series, despite essentially being a playable demo. No wonder Capcom wants to hold a second beta test.</p>

<p>According to Capcom, this second beta is for players who "were unable to participate the first time or simply wish to play again", so if you did miss the first open beta, now's your chance to check it out once more.</p>

The first starts on February 7th and ends on the 10th, while the second runs between February 14th and 17th.</p>

<p>This second beta will contain all of the content featured in the first test, as well as the chance to take down the returning Gypceros monster, which made its last mainline appearance in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Generations</em>.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to create your character, remake it "as many times as you like", and even design your Palico companion. Naturally, character creation data will also carry over into the full version of the game, and you can use the character you made in the first beta as well.</p>




<p>If you take part in the beta, you can also net yourself some unique rewards for the full game, including a bonus pendant and some extra items.</p>

<p>The second beta period will be held not long before the main game releases;&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th.

            <p>Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ryzen-9000x3d-processors-with-their-fancy-pants-cache-are-launching-november-7th">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series">Core Ultra</a> chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2025">CES 2025</a> hardware announcements.</p>
<p>No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t bet against the Ryzen 9 9950X3D nabbing the Ryzen 7 9800X3D’s crown as the king of gaming CPUs, though whether it (and the Ryzen 9 9900X3D) are actually worth buying will surely come down to price. The 9800X3D is already a super-duper-premium part, and won’t stop bossing games just because something with 24MB more cache comes along, so it could feasibly remain the one to upgrade to if you don’t do the kind of multitasking or media work that would benefit from the added threads.</p><p>AMD’s new handheld processors, also unveiled at CES, are a more diverse bunch. In addition to the Ryzen Z2 and Ryzen Z2 Extreme – direct replacements for the Z1 chips powering handhelds like the Asus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">ROG Ally</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> – there’s also a Ryzen Z2 Go designed for cheaper portables. It’s this modest, 4 core/8 thread part that forms the brain of the $599 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-the-steamos-handheld-pc-that-isnt-a-steam-deck">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> that also got a CES reveal yesterday.</p>

<p>Curiously, these are a mishmash of various generations of AMD Zen CPU and RDNA graphics tech: the Ryzen Z2 Extreme combines Zen 3 and Zen 5c cores, as well as RDNA 3.5 integrated graphics, while the standard Z2 is built around RDNA 3. The Z2 Go relies on the even older RDNA 2, much like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s custom AMD APU, so it’ll be interesting to see how the three compare when actually running games. Just don’t expect that to happen on a new Deck version, as Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lf36y66ggs2b">Bluesky</a> to shut down rumours of a Z2-powered Steam Deck successor.</p>

<p>Also curious was the lack of detail AMD gave their other 'big' announcement, the first RDNA 4 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">GPUs</a>: the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. No specs, price, release window, nada. They exist. That’s your lot. It took a since-deleted Asus post (well caught, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amd-might-have-told-us-little-about-its-rdna-4-graphics-cards-but-at-least-we-know-the-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-have-16-gb-of-vram/">PCG</a>) to even let slip that they’d come with 16GB of VRAM.</p><p>And yet, this dearth of info didn’t stop AMD from letting our Ziff cousins at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-9070-benchmark">IGN</a> from testing out the RX 9070 on the show floor. In an Extreme-quality <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> benchmark at native 4K, it averaged 99fps, which IGN reckon puts it roughly on par with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review">GeForce RTX 4080 Super</a>. Not bad going, except the latter is being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-1999-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-makes-the-rest-of-the-rtx-50-series-look-suspiciously-sensible">replaced by the RTX 5080</a> at the end of this month, seemingly without significant price bump. As with pretty much of all of AMD’s CES reveals – interesting on paper yet light on performance specifics – we’ll have to wait and see how they do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In the UK today, McDonalds is finally launching its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> themed Happy Meals.</p>
<p>Though available already in other regions prior to the film's release in December, in the UK the meals will be available from today until 18th February.</p>
<p>The included toy also differs. In the US the meals include a plastic character figure in a rolling wheel, while in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHenBg5IGyg">UK it's fabric balls with character faces</a>.</p>

<p>Those characters are Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Shadow, as well as (<em>slight </em>spoiler!) Super Sonic and Super Shadow.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/mcdonald-s-plastic-toys-happy-meal-b1924440.html">McDonalds is phasing out plastic toys</a> by the end of 2025 to focus on eco-friendly toys made from renewable and recycled materials.</p>

</span></p><p>Of course, this is far from the first time McDonalds has featured Sonic-themed toys in its Happy Meals.</p>
<p>In 1995 a promotion was launched to celebrate Mega Drive game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 - I distinctly remember never receiving a Sonic toy and instead repeatedly getting a terrible Tails that wouldn't fly.</p>
<p>Other collaborations include mini handheld games in the 00s made by Fisher-Price, as well as a set of toys in conjunction with the previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a> film.</p>
<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film has been a huge success for Sega over the Christmas period. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-film-franchise-surpasses-1bn-in-global-box-office-revenue">film franchise has now surpassed $1bn at the global box office</a>.</p>
<p>"Sega and Paramount more closely align game and film worlds for an authentic Sonic romp with added Keanu cool," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
