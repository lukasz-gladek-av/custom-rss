            <p>Dont Nod's studio creative director has hit out at "hateful" comments about Deck Nine's take on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> franchise.</p>
<p>Talking on X/Twitter, Michel Koch said that whilst he hadn't played the game yet and "have no idea where [Deck Nine] are taking the story", "nothing justifies hating on people".</p>

<p>"You can be disappointed, you can want other narratives for those characters you love, or different stories… but ultimately creation is hard and very subjective and if [Double Exposure's] story does not please you, it does not erase what you imagined."</p>
<p>When challenged by someone insisting it should be okay for players to feedback "healthy criticism", Koch agreed that whilst "constructive criticism and civil disagreement is good", he was specifically "talking of violent messages and harassment I've seen".</p>

<p>Wonder Weapons are bonafide difference makers in Black Ops 6 Zombies—and most installments of game mode. Some classic Wonder Weapons return, but there is also some fresh blood added to the mix, making for both a familiar and refreshing Zombies experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a fun and fresh Campaign, another exhilarating multiplayer marathon to embark on, and the return of Zombies. It’s proper Zombies though: Round-based, Easter Eggs, different maps, and Wonder Weapons.</p>



<p>As usual, Wonder Weapons are quite hard to get in Black Ops 6. But when you get one, the feeling is unmatched, and they’re well worth trying to track down.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-wonder-weapons-are-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How many Wonder Weapons are in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Zombies currently has <strong>four Wonder Weapons</strong>: The Ray Gun, Beamsmasher, Thrustodyne Model 23 AKA Jet Gun, and the Wunderwaffe DG-2.</p>



<p>You might recognize the Ray Gun, Thrustodyne Model 23, and Wunderwaffe, but give a warm, undead welcome to the <strong>Beamsmasher</strong>—a new, mega-powerful weapon of mass destruction.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-wonder-weapon-in-black-ops-6">Every Wonder Weapon in Black Ops 6</h2>



<h3 id="h-ray-gun">Ray Gun</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hello, old friend. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Ray Gun is surely bound for the gaming Hall of Fame as it’s one of the best weapons in history. Its design is iconic, and the engineering is likely complex, but the end result is a satisfying, striking, nuclear bolt of deadly energy. It’s akin to classic alien death rays from B-movies of a bygone era, but it still works in 2024—trying to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get a Ray Gun in Black Ops 6 Zombies</a> is as tough as ever though.</p>



<h3 id="h-beamsmasher">Beamsmasher</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No-nonsense death beam. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As far as I’m aware, the Beamsmasher can only be obtained on the Terminus Zombies map—so bear this in mind when you’re trying to obtain one. Other than this, there’s not much else to say about the Beamsmasher that the above screenshot doesn’t already tell you about the new toy. It fires a single, devastating, zombie-eviscerating beam and is great for concentrating on bringing down Elite Zombies.</p>



<h3 id="h-thrustodyne-model-23-jet-gun">Thrustodyne Model 23 / Jet Gun</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s obnoxiously big, and I love it. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would say “Thrustodyne Model 23” doesn’t quite roll off the tongue like “Jet Gun” does—so I’m going to refer to it as the latter. The Jet Gun gives off an evil cartoon vibe (you can’t tell me those dials aren’t deliberately evil-looking eyes) and it’s making its first appearance since its debut in Black Ops 2. It sucks up Zombies and recycles them into a fine paste—and I feel it delights in doing so. </p>



<h3 id="h-wunderwaffe-dg-2">Wunderwaffe DG-2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A classic returns. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, another legendary Wonder Weapon comes back with a vengeance, and it’s none other than the Wunderwaffe DG-2. Apart from the Ray Gun, the Wunderwaffe DG-2 has featured about as much as any Wonder Weapon down the years, and Black Ops 6 is very accommodating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-wonder-weapon-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Wonder Weapon in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>There are various ways to get Wonder Weapons in Black Ops 6 Zombies: Get lucky with the <strong>Mystery Box</strong>, get them as loot from <strong>Armory Lockers or Safety Deposit Boxes</strong>, use <strong>Legendary Gobblegums</strong> for lucrative rolls, and you can also <strong>craft the Beamsmasher</strong>.</p>



<p>Using 950 Points on the Mystery Box is the easiest way to get a Wonder Weapon—and the odds increase the higher the round count you reach—in Black Ops 6 Zombies. You can also secure Loot Keys from Elite Enemies and open Lockers and Safety Deposit Boxes to see if they contain a Wonder Weapon.</p>



<p>Furthermore, certain Gobblegums can reroll Mystery Box drops—the Wonderbar! Gobblegum guarantees a Wonder Weapon—and the Beamsmasher can be crafted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4s-creator-explains-what-makes-a-good-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game remakes are everywhere these days. We’ve just had a new version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">Silent Hill 2</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy</a> is in full swing, and a recreation of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview">Metal Gear Solid 3</a> is on the horizon. But few people know remakes quite as well as Shinji Mikami. The co-creator of Resident Evil has watched teams craft highly-successful recreations of his own games, and back in 2001 even helmed the remake of the first project he ever headed up - making him the director of both Resident Evil <em>and </em>Resident Evil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, if there’s anyone who knows what makes a good remake, it’s Shinji Mikami. “I think the comprehensive and fundamental understanding of what it was that made the original work in the first place is probably the most important point of a good remake,” he tells me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everything from the ground up, basically,” he explains. “There's a few examples of that with certain series that Capcom has put out.” He is, of course, talking about the recent run of Resident Evil remakes, the most recent of which is the almost universally-celebrated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-review">Resident Evil 4</a>. Mikami has played it and offers glowing praise for the team at Capcom. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I thought that it was really well-made,” he says. He’s particularly impressed by how the remake handles the more nuanced details of combat, such as the timing between aiming and shooting, which in the original was finely balanced to ensure mounting pressure and tension. “I thought that they showed a really good understanding of that element,” he tells me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Another thing I thought was really well done was the way they took the half-assed scenario that I just wrote up in two weeks and really built up on that and really fleshed it out,” he adds. “They showed that they really understood the characters and their interactions. They showed a good understanding of the backbone of each character. And they took not just the scenario itself, but even the dialogue, and they improved all that stuff so that was really great.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The comprehensive and fundamental understanding of what made the original work in the first place is probably the most important point of a good remake.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My conversation with Mikami was part of his promotional work for Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered, a spruced-up version of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/21/shadows-of-the-damned-review">cult classic he produced back in 2011</a> (amusingly, Mikami notes that “I personally don't really have any interest in remasters” during the chat, so a passion project to revive Shadows this isn’t). We were also joined by Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), Shadows of the Damned’s writer and CEO of developer Grasshopper Manufacture. Suda has more interest in remasters than Mikami; alongside this new version of Shadows, Grasshopper has also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-the-first-13-minutes-of-gameplay-4k-60fps">remastered Lollipop Chainsaw this year</a>, and had previously restored No More Heroes and Killer7 for modern platforms. But Suda varies his approach when returning to his old games. Sometimes a remake is needed.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One thing that really stands out about remaking The 25th Ward was, at the time when we did the remake, it was completely unplayable,” Suda explains. “It was originally only available on Japanese flip phones. And, on top of that, it never actually ended. The original version didn't have a proper conclusion or ending to it.” These factors ensured that, instead of a remaster, The 25th Ward was totally remade in 2018 to both suit the PlayStation 4 console and to finally provide players with a conclusion to the story. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For Shadows of the Damned, Mikami and Suda have chosen to remaster rather than remake. Instead of expanding and reinventing aspects of their 2011 game, which sold poorly but garnered a cult following, the duo have stuck closely to the original version. The approach allows modern audiences to experience the game as it was released back on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Nevertheless, there are some new elements to ensure long-term fans are rewarded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I wanted to keep the game as close to the original as possible, but there were definitely things that I wanted to add on and emphasize or accentuate this time around,” says Suda. “For example, there's some new costumes for the main character, there's the new game plus mode. There's a few things that we wanted to use to boost the experience a bit. But yeah, we certainly wanted to keep it as close to the original as possible.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Personally, I'm more interested in remaking Killer7 than I was in remastering Shadows of the Damned.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, as noted earlier, Mikami isn’t all that interested in remasters. That’s not to say he’s not interested in revisiting the past, though. “Personally, I'm more interested in remaking Killer7 than I was in remastering Shadows of the Damned,” he tells me. “If I got to choose, I'd rather do a sequel to Killer7 or something.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in 2005, Killer7 was an incredibly stylish action thriller. Its complex story, following the exploits of an assassin with multiple personalities, was co-written by Mikami and Suda. It’s another project from the duo with a cult following, and one that has largely been lost to time: aside from a 2018 PC remaster, Killer7 was only ever made for the GameCube and PS2, with no modern console re-releases available. As such, the game’s small but loyal following has long cried out for a sequel or remake.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/killer7-1728568546687.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Killer7 had stylish art direction and a unique approach to action game mechanics.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on the original, Suda says “I was constantly really, really conscious of the fact that I was making an action game together with Mikami, the guy who made the Resident Evil series. And with that, [he] revolutionized the way action games are made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Another thing that I was constantly conscious about was the fact that we were trying to make a game to put out to the whole world, not just domestically. All the new ideas that we had, for example, controller inputs and the gameplay and the action itself, we tried to make this stuff as new and original as possible. If we were to do another Killer7 thing, that's something that I'd like to return to. Making something completely new and original and putting a bunch of revolutionary stuff in it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Mikami likes the idea of returning to Killer7, he feels that his vision for the game’s art may clash with modern expectations. "I feel that, at the time, the art that we used for Killer7 matched really well with the specs of the time,” he says. “And if we were to make a new version of it nowadays, people would probably be expecting something a lot more realistic. And that would just feel funky and weird. That's not really what the game was about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we were going to redo it, if we were going to do something new with it, there would be a whole lot that would have to be changed,” he theories. “Everything from background settings and the art itself, it would have to be pretty much redone from the ground up.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This isn't any kind of promise that we're going to be making a sequel or a remake or anything,” he quickly adds. “It's just two dudes shooting the shit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though it’s just two dudes shooting the shit, the conversation gives us a good insight into what one of the most celebrated directors in gaming thinks makes a good remake. The best are ground-up recreations that study and dissect the components that made the original game work so well, and then use that understanding to expand on the good and enhance any weaknesses. It’s a simple recipe that requires a deep, intricate understanding of the original game in question.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/27/24278619/wilmot-works-it-out-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used to hate jigsaw puzzles. I thought they were frustrating, messy, and took way too long to solve. But my wife showed me how those parts of jigsaw puzzles can actually be fun: there’s something satisfying and meditative about working through those frustrations, sorting through the mess, and putting a picture together, one piece at a time, over the course of a few hours. (Or days.)</p><p>The makers of <em>Wilmot Works It Out</em>, a new puzzle game, understand this, and everything about the game is designed to make solving puzzles fun instead of annoying.</p><p>In the game, you play as Wilmot, an adorable white square with a face who has a puzzle-by-mail subscription. (He’s the same smiley square <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F839870%2FWilmots_Warehouse%2F">from <em>Wilmot’s Warehouse</em></a>, a 2019 puzzle game also made by developers Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg and published by Finji.) Every time you open a new package delivered by Sam, your mail carrier friend, the pieces appear in a jumble on the floor so you can match them together into a picture to put on the wall.</p><p>When you’ve put up a completed puzzle, Sam typically comes knocking with a brief conversation and a new box of pieces to sift through. After you finish a bunch of puzzles, you’ll complete a “season” and can move on to the next, which amps up the difficulty.</p><div><figcaption><em>It’s fun to sift through the pieces scattered about.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Finji</cite></p></div><p><em>Wilmot Works It Out</em> has a few clever ways to iron out the process of putting pieces together. Unlike every jigsaw puzzle I’ve done in real life, the puzzle pieces in <em>Wilmot</em> are all square. That sounds annoying, but because you don’t have to rotate the pieces to match them, it’s much easier to compare pieces side to side to see if they might fit together. When you slide a piece next to its correct counterpart, the piece you’re holding flashes once, and you’ll hear a soft but satisfying chime. I <em>loved</em> chasing those chimes.&nbsp;</p><p>Those design choices make it much easier to quickly assemble puzzles. But the game’s best trick is that puzzle packages typically contain a few pieces that connect to a puzzle you can’t finish yet. Because of that, you’re constantly trying to figure out which pieces fit a puzzle you can solve now and which pieces are supposed to be set aside for later.</p><div><p>Some puzzles are quite tricky</p></div><p>In the early seasons, I didn’t find this to be too difficult. That changed in the later seasons, though, as the developers have some devilish tricks to make you really work to figure out which pieces belong with which puzzles.</p><p>One season, for example, featured pieces that seemed to assemble into a peacock with big colorful circles on its feathers. Then, I started matching pieces with more colorful circles, but they turned out to be owl eyes. I tried to find a way for the owls and peacock to connect for longer than I care to admit — until I eventually realized that they were <em>two separate pictures</em>.</p><p>Two of my biggest problems with jigsaw puzzles have been how long they take and how messy they are. They can take what should be a fun activity and turn it into a chore. But <em>Wilmot Works It Out</em> fixes both, highlighting what I love about jigsaw puzzles in a delightful video game.</p><p><small>Wilmot Works It Out<em> is out now on PC and Mac.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>This week the Tomb Raider franchise turned 28 years old, first introducing Lara Croft to the world in 1996. Earlier this month, we saw the release of Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft on Netflix, an animated show set after the events of 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Now. Crystal Dynamics has confirmed that the show has been confirmed for a second season.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft | Official 'Danger' Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JNouqX9P14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A short blurb for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft season two has been released by Crystal Dynamics, giving us a short glimpse of what to expect. “<i>When adventurer Lara Croft discovers a trail of stolen African Orisha masks, she joins forces with her best friend Sam to retrieve the precious artifacts. Lara’s thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodges the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine.”</i></p>
<p>The announcement of Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft follows the reveal of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/11/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-announced-for-another-valentines-day-release/">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a>, which is going to be released on February 14th, 2025. This collection will include The Last Revelation, Tomb Raider: Chronicles, and Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness. Aspyr Media is developing this collection and, just like the first collection, players will the choice of both overhauled and classic graphics that can be switched between. There is a more modern control scheme inspired by later games to give camera controls, but the option to play with classic tank controls will also be included.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review-ps5-xbox-switch-pc/">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tomb Raider I-III Remastered review, Jim wrote, <em>“Lara’s original trilogy has been lovingly restored with the launch of these remasters, offering a definitive collection that bundles the core games and their expansions. However, dusting off these old relics in the name of nostalgia may come with a nasty surprise. Don’t worry, there are no mummy curses, snake pits, or swinging pendulum axes, though the clunky controls will definitely take some getting used to (again).”</em></p>

					<p>Horror has always been about the atmosphere created by eerie silences and the noises that break those up. Be it from the character, trying to be as quiet as they can to avoid alerting the big bad to where they are, or in some cases, the noises that the big bad makes as you know it's coming towards you. How else would you be able to identify <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XM7oCKC-L8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the scariest horror monster ever</a> without the distinctive sound of it on the tarmac? Though it must be said, A Quiet Place, led by the incomparable Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, also knew how to create that atmosphere. <a href="https://aquietplace.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a> looks to recreate that in game form.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/A-Quiet-Place-The-Road-Ahead-Review-02-Dont-Scream-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Let me start by saying I didn't use one of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead's touted features, microphone detection. Well, I should say that I simply flicked the mic on my headset to off mode because as much as it may add to the game, having to hold your breath or breathe lightly, my cats didn't get that memo. Also, I've seen A Quiet Place: Day One; the cat survived - spoiler alert -&nbsp; so the creatures shouldn't be killing me because my cats decided they wanted to get involved.</p>
<p>If that breaks this review for you, then off you pop because the reality is that the feature isn't something new or anything that adds to the game. If anything, it detracts from it because I don't live in that world. I want to immerse myself, but barricading myself in a sound and cat-proof room isn't reasonable or feasible. For those of you who are left and want to hear about the game, its mechanics, story, and everything else, let's carry on.</p>
<p>We'll carry on with sound. Naturally, the whole world of A Quiet Place revolves around sound, and as Alex, you're going to want to make as little sound as possible, with five different forms of movement - walking and crouching, both fast and slow, and sprinting. For most of the game, you will do the fast crouch because that's the optimal approach; it's quicker and quieter than the slow walk. You only need to go into a slow crouch over particularly noisy ground, such as broken glass or puddles.</p>
<p>This is the game's key selling point, though the mileage you get from it will vary. It does try to play around with it a little. At different points, you will find bags of sand, which you can pour out to create paths of silence. You can also find bricks and bottles to throw and distract the aliens, and towards the end of the game, you can give the alien a headache by triggering a feedback loop on the TV. Another thing that links to noise is using a tool to detect the sound you're making compared to the ambient sound.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/A-Quiet-Place-The-Road-Ahead-Review-03-Spaceship-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I said "towards the end of the game" for the TV thing. This is my first criticism: A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is too short for the mechanics it introduces. I get the feeling that this was meant to be a longer game than it was, with more puzzles about getting around the monster, but something happened. It was initially announced as being developed by Illogika and Ep1t0me, so the move to Stormwind games may explain this feeling, or I could be completely wrong. However, I'm not wrong about how the mechanics feel rushed and underutilised, except for one.</p>
<p>That one is doors. I'm unsure who made all the hinges in America, but they are atrocious, and the whole country needs a refund. The game's setting is only four months after the arrival of the aliens, and while I understand there are power issues, that roads will be littered with wrecked cars, and so on. What I don't understand is how <strong><em>every single</em></strong> door in the game squeaks like a mouse on meth. I get that it's the game mechanic; you have to slowly - and manually - open the door like that of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and avoid making noise, but it takes me out of the game, becoming tedious and having outstayed its welcome after the first twelve-million doors you've gone through</p>
<p>It also annoys me that the level layouts are absurd and just too "designed," for lack of a better word. A good level should feel like it could exist in the world you are in, not that somebody has created set twists and turns that would only impede people, not creatures. Far too often, you are sent to crawl through a vent to find a key and open a door locked from the inside just to open another door. Nothing in the game is an actual "puzzle" in any sense, and when you have to get around one of the monsters, the paths are minimal, as in there are two - towards the monster or take the path around it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/A-Quiet-Place-The-Road-Ahead-Review-04-Asthma-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>One of the most annoying aspects of the sound and level design is that it doesn't make sense when you die. If you hit the game's arbitrary "too much noise" level, a cutscene starts, and you die. It doesn't matter if you're behind five walls, in a small corridor, or a patch of grass in a field; the creature just appears out of the ether. Not once did I feel that the creature was this threat, simply because there was no agency once the noise threshold was met. You couldn't run away, you couldn't hide, you couldn't try to trick it by throwing a bottle; you had already lost because you hit the sound cap.</p>
<p>If there is one positive to bring from this, there is some success in level design in how Stormind games have laid things out. You do have to think about the path you take in the sense that there is glass on the floor, or do you walk over twigs or through a puddle? Can you sneak around the red cans that just happen to be inconveniently placed where you would need to walk in the middle of a forest? This part makes you think.</p>
<p>One thing I haven't mentioned yet is the other key noise-creator: asthma. Alex, the protagonist, has asthma. Also, she's pregnant, but the game ignores this apart from cheap "look, guys, she has a parasite growing in her" pulls. As you exert yourself by carrying extremely light wood planks, climbing up ledges, or going through places the game has deemed dusty, her asthma will start playing up. Once the level reaches its limit, you can either succeed in a quick-time event, or Alex will have an asthma attack, and you'll encounter <em>the cutscene</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead isn't stingy about giving you inhalers or leaving pills around for you to reduce your asthma meter. I found myself on my last inhaler only once or twice, more often than not, at the cap of five. Early on, the other usable items were batteries, which ran out more often if you weren't careful with your torch usage. I can't complain much about that since I imagine I would have used more if I weren't as willing to snail my way through the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/A-Quiet-Place-The-Road-Ahead-Review-05-Sand-Bagging-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To be honest, I didn't like A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. The films range from excellent to decent, but the game doesn't manage to capture that same sense of dread. Due to the convoluted level design, choices like a random rail-shooter section, and the ending, which quite literally becomes "press X to not die," it feels patchwork. The creature is annoying and not threatening because there is no threat from the creature except for a few patrol areas where you can get yourself cornered.</p>
<p>I couldn't also class it as threatening because it wasn't smart. As mentioned, you could get yourself cornered, where the creature would be right in front of you, but it won't know you're there until you make a sound or the somewhat vague hit-box collides with you (after passing through an object or two), and the cutscene starts. Despite knowing the inevitable outcome, those moments were the only time I felt tense in that game. Beyond that, the creature had no real direction; it would flit around randomly, though it still always happened to be following you when you got past it.</p>
<p>Again, it felt too forced, too convoluted. I tend to find a horror game—or any game—works best when it is organic. I want it to rest on me like a blood, vomit, and faeces-soaked shroud, and I want to feel like the game presented could exist in the world before us. Instead, I felt like this was a set of designed levels with precise routes and actions to take at set times, and the way to get through it was to do it all slowly, even when it comes to the easter-eggs and collectibles, like the space ship from the first film, or cassette tapes.</p>
<p>Maybe the hidden message of the game is "patience is a virtue", but I don't need five to six hours of trudging through extremely littered forests and streets telling me that. Maybe you will like A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, but I sadly didn't.</p>

</div>

<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a game with interesting ideas, looking to build on the success of the films, but falls flat with level design and certain mechanics breaking, rather than enhancing, immersion. With clear signs of what could have been really good, a few slips hold the game back.</p>

<div>
		<div>
		<h6>
			<span>Pros</span>
		</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Good use of stealth and noise avoidance throughout the game.
</li><li>Looks good, and has a good use of audio to add to the atmosphere it wants to build.</li>		</ul>
	</div>
			<div>
		<h6>
			<span>Cons</span>
		</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Poor world building and level design breaks immersion.
</li><li>AI that just doesn't seem smart or like the creature it's meant to represent.
</li><li>While sound is meant to be a key threat in the world presented, so is the creature, but the creature never feels like the threat it should be - only a consequence.
</li><li>Poor pacing, which never gives the different mechanics time to breathe.</li>		</ul>

            <p>Ys X: Nordics launched in Japan last year to some critical acclaim, and it has now made its way both west and onto PC. The PC version has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2731870/announcements/detail/4554919920318276609">bunch of graphical upgrades</a> and keyboard support, but also - unlike predecessor Ys IX: Monstrum Nox which got co-op as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-is-the-perfect-place-for-newcomers-to-take-a-vampiric-leap-into-the-series">a cheeky post-launch bonus on PC</a> - Ys X: Nordics has local co-op from day one.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ys X again stars pretty boy protagonist Adol, but this time is teamed-up with pirate Karja. Yes, that means there's ship-shaped exploration and combat. If you don't have a co-op buddy to play with, you can switch between both characters on the fly or control them together, and build their "Revenge Guage" to do combined attacks.

<p>The Ys series started all the way back in the '80, but it's been gaining in popularity in recent years, particularly on PC. Monstrum Nox was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/japanese-games-dominated-steams-july-top-sellers">a Steam best seller in July 2021</a>, and genre expert Nadia Oxford <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-is-the-perfect-place-for-newcomers-to-take-a-vampiric-leap-into-the-series">thought it was the perfect entrypoint to the series</a>. 
</p><p>I am yet to make my own entrance into the Ys series, and I confess, I've never fought a naval battle I've enjoyed. If I want to slowly circle an enemy I do not understand while taking potshots at it, then I will write news posts about RPG series I've never played, thanks. I do wish I had time to experience its blue skies and grappling hooks, though. Maybe if I ever finish Ni no Kuni. 
</p>
<p>Ys X: Nordics is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731870/Ys_X_Nordics/">available from Steam</a>. It's £55/€60/$60 and there's a demo where your save can carry over to the full game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This approach allows us to release some updates without compromising on either game."
</p><p>Cities: Skylines 2 launched in a rough state last year, beset by both bugs and performance issues. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">There have been improvements since</a>, but still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">the first DLC pack was so poorly received</a> that players were refunded and everybody had to apologise.
</p>
<p>For those reasons, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">Paradox's many other recent missteps</a>, I think it'd be easy to view a return to Cities: Skylines DLC as a kind of retreat. I actually think this is great, though. A lot of people own and love the first Cities: Skylines and many can't move to the sequel even if they wanted to, so why shouldn't a publisher continue to serve that audience. More folks should do the same.

<p>I spent much of my time in the late '90s and early '00s downloading user-made levels for first-person shooters like Half-Life and the Quakes. Sometimes from Fileplanet, sometimes directly from whatever random dedicated server I'd just selected from the browser. These levels almost always had an incomplete grasp of the affordances of the game - or even more charitably, were more interested in gimmicks than in balance.
</p><p>What-ifs, basically. What if the level was just a big room with sight lines divided by pillars? What if there were no weapons on the level except for crossbows? What if the players started at opposite ends of a corridor with a single weapon in between them, a shotgun, which both have to race towards? What if players could reach a raised platform via a teleporter, and that was the only way up there, and there was, like, respawning grenades? What if a level sort of looked like that curtain room from Twin Peaks?
</p>
<p>I'm talking about the brutal teenaged logic that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-legacy-of-fy_iceworld-counter-strikes-divisive-and-hugely-popular-custom-map">leads to fy_iceworld</a>. The answer to these questions is almost always: players will instantly find the unstoppable strategy, and the whole experience will become a race towards that unassailable position.
</p>
<p>Yet there remains an irresistible appeal to these levels. That's why they're gimmicks. 
</p>
<p>Straftat builds a framework around these sorts of levels that turns them effectively into Mario Party mini-games. Fights are always 1v1, two kills wins a round, and the first to five rounds wins the match. The levels are small and players are agile, able to perform bumslides, leans and mantling, meaning fights never last much longer than a minute. Being dominated in a fight? Don't worry, you'll be onto the next one in 90 seconds. Don't like a level? Don't worry, there are 70 of them and I'm yet to see the same one twice - and players can create playlists of their favourite maps.
</p><p>There's another experience from those halcyon days of server-hopping Straftat has recreated for me: that of making a single-server friend. I'm not going to lie, it takes some perseverence to find a Straftat match that doesn't immediately close when you join. (By which I mean, it takes a few minutes of clicking servers in the browser - and thus is still preferable to the oft-long queues of modern matchmaking.)
</p>
<p>When you do find someone to play with, I've often stayed with them for several matches in a row. There's proximity voice chat, but I'm yet to turn it on. Instead, when dumped into the post-match room in which a winner is declared, and in which music blares, every opponent and I have leaned and crouched at each other, in a celebratory manner I take to mean "Hello" and "Good game". 
</p>
<p>I've missed these dumb and oddly intimate moments with strangers, just as I've missed double-clicking on a server and excitedly wondering what daft .bsp world I was about to enter into. 
</p>
<p>You can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2386720/STRAFTAT/">Straftat from Steam now</a>. It's completely free, although you can spend a few quid on a DLC that doubles the number of maps and adds some cosmetics.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Obbe Vermeij, former Rockstar developer and sharer of secrets, has revealed an intriguing tidbit about Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the game’s 20th anniversary. The developer – who still works in the industry today – is known far and wide across social media for his insights and behind-the-scenes glimpses at the development of many Grand Theft Auto games.</p>



<p>His latest factoid about San Andreas is pretty interesting, and it comes as the game celebrates a major milestone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-20-years-as-the-goat">20 Years as the GOAT</h2>



<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is considered one of the best games of all time. It’s a memorable, expansive adventure that took players across a series of cities that made up ‘San Andreas’. It was one of the games that defined a generation, and for Rockstar, it was a dizzying success that served as a benchmark for things to come.</p>



<p>Recently, Obbe Vermeij, who worked on GTA 3, GTA Vice City, San Andreas, and GTA IV, took to social media to reflect on twenty years of San Andreas history.</p>



<p>He wrote that the original plan was to have the game map split up into three separate portions, only reachable by inter-city travel made up of trains and planes. This would enable the team to circumvent ‘tight’ memory restrictions, and it would be easier to differentiate between separate assets needed to make each city feel unique.</p>



<p>In the end, an executive meeting at Rockstar North changed the path of history and settled on one huge map that was tougher to develop but much more impressive overall.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>20 years ago we released Grand Theft Auto – San Andreas.</p><p>The original plan was for the 3 cities to be on separate maps. The player would travel between the cities using trains and planes.<br>(Gta 1 and 2 also had three cities on separate maps)</p><p>Memory was very tight on the ps2 and… <a href="https://t.co/kUMxR9Kt96">pic.twitter.com/kUMxR9Kt96</a></p></div>— Obbe Vermeij (@ObbeVermeij) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1849940437596787037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Vermeij then went on to reminisce about midnight launches and how impressive it was that San Andreas pulled in such massive crowds before the internet and social media allowed developers and publishers to generate much of a buzz.</p>



<p>Back then, it would have been a couple of TV spots, a trailer or two, and perhaps an article here and there in a magazine or one of the few websites around at the time:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The internet was crap and apart from a couple of trailers, gamers didn’t know too much about the game. </p>



<p>I went to the biggest store near the R*North offices, which was HMV on Princess Street, Edinburgh. Even though it was a drizzly night, the line meandered all through the store and spilled out onto the street.</p>



<p>It was mind-blowing to see all those people so excited, going home to play the game all through the night.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA: San Andreas was my first ‘launch day game’ back in 2004, and I poured thousands of hours into it over the years that followed. It’s a masterpiece, and it’ll always have a place in my heart.</p>

            <p>YouTube has denied Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm's appeal to monetise his channel for a further 60 days.</p>
<p>Addressing his audience in a livestream in a clip shared to X/Twitter, Beahm revealed YouTube had deferred his appeal "for another 60 days" after which he'd be eligible to re-apply.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Beahm cannot draw any revenue from subscriptions or advertisements on his channel, which has 4.5m subscribers.</p>

<p>"Actually Champs - unfortunately, they pushed it back another 60 days," Beahm said. "Believe it or not, they waited 'til the very last second last night to tell us, uh, 'we're going to, uh, extend, just for another 60 days, and then you'll be eligible to re-apply, and we'll review the application'.</p>
<p>"But you know what, though, Champs? Okay. Then let's just wait another 60 days."</p>
<p>He then said he had something "something much, much bigger" in the works - "one of the biggest opportunity to date" - but didn't elaborate (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dr-disrespect-guy-beahm-twitch-youtube-streamer-appeal-request-video-monetisation-denied/">TheGamer</a>).</p> <div>

<p>Back in June, Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>'s former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">claimed</a> an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm.</p><p>Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. But now, after a period away from the spotlight, an agitated Beahm returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Beahm admitted, came ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his channel… which we now know has been denied.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Copyright Office has determined that it <strong>will not </strong>alter existing DMCA rules to allow for the preservation of video games in repositories and archives across the country. This news comes following a three-year battle by the Video Game History Foundation to desperately find a path to preservation for games that are in danger of being lost forever.</p>



<p>Previously, the organisation revealed that around 87% of all games released before 2010 are ‘virtually inaccessible’ owing to changes in technology, consumer habits, retail operating models, and the simple passing of time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-remember-them">Remember Them</h2>



<p>Many gamers appreciate a blast from the past – it’s why some games do so well when they are remade, or when modern variants introduce elements from past releases.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG, I’m looking at you.</p>



<p>If we go beyond that and look at <strong>true </strong>nostalgia – retro gaming – we enter a vast world filled with consoles, games, and peripherals from yesteryear, all of which are steadily falling into an abyss due to a lack of <strong>official preservation practices</strong>. While books, movies, music, and the like are all preserved under DMCA law, video games have never fallen into a legitimate category.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-24563.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the retort</a> published by the US Copyright Office, which leant on comments made by the Entertainment Software Association, it was said that the petition from the VGHF was kicked because they:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… did not propose a clear requirement to know who the users are or why they want to access a game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier, the ESA said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Enabling widespread remote access to preserved games with minimal supervision would present a serious risk to an important market.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Video Game History Foundation insists it’s not finished with its crusade, but the rules are relatively black and white right now. In an ideal world, a digital repository of archived games would exist for users to check them out and access their contents through emulation platforms, but it admittedly becomes quite hard to police who is accessing them, and when, and <strong>where</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you think video games need to be preserved in this way, or should the retro collector market be enough to suffice? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>"Our biggest update of the 20th century arrives this December when Warframe: 1999 launches on all platforms!" the studio said, before inviting players to "get your account ready" for launch day… whenever that may be.</p>
<p>For anyone struggling to wait that long, don't forget that a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.warframe.com%2Fget-ready">playable demo</a> is still available.</p>
<p>"Get a feel for Arthur's Weaponry and turbo-charged Atomicycle as you battle Scaldra through the streets of Hӧllvania," DE teases. "December just can't come soon enough…"</p>
<p>As our resident Warframe expert Matt summarised for us recently, we've known 1999 was likely to be an "odd 'un" ever since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-next-big-expansion-whispers-in-the-walls-gets-weird-with-necramechs-and-retro-earth-tech">tease at last year's TennoCon</a>.</p>

And that starts with 1999's new hub area: an abandoned 90s shopping mall full of artificial palm trees, arcade machines, and screens belching out cheesy infomercials.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
