There are over 100 Monsties--the name for monsters in these games--to join forces with in each game, and the majority of them are rideable.</p><hr><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-four-discontinued-donkey-kong-lego-sets-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6532560/">All Four Discontinued Donkey Kong Lego Sets Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/">Donkey Kong Bananza Game &amp; Amiibo Bundle Available At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Shadow Labyrinth is an enigma.</p><p>It should be simple enough to describe: It's a "2D action exploration &amp; combat platformer," or "2DAECP"--which is Bandai's Namco official description and its way of saying "metroidvania" without mentioning a word made by combining two rival games' names--in which a mysterious amnesiac follows a small yellow robot through a labyrinth of tough battles and tight platforming. Like other games in the genre, the path here is well-trodden; there's side-scrolling exploration across a big map that opens as you unlock new abilities, and lots of enemies to fight along the way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Shadow Labyrinth Maze Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>What you won't expect, however, is the story Bandai Namco is telling around the Metroi--sorry, 2DAECP--it has devised. It's known that this game directly ties into the Pac-Man-themed episode of Amazon Prime's animated Secret Level series, but it's the rest of the lore that turned my head during a recent virtual preview session. The 2DAECP space is crowded right now, but Bandai Namco may have found a way to rise above the rest with Shadow Labyrinth; you'll just have to brush up on your gaming history.</p><p>Before that, though, let's dig into the meat of what you're going to be doing in the game. My preview gave me access to a portion of combat and platforming challenges, with two boss fights waiting for me at the end. I began, naturally, with the exploration section, which dropped me into an area known as the Land of the Fugitives.</p><p>The core gameplay on offer here in Shadow Labyrinth is standard 2DAECP fare; I had multiple paths to explore, each with their own trials and tribulations, until I found what I was looking for and headed back to where I began. The demo gave me three different branches, each holding the piece to a key I needed to advance, but each also centered on one of three unique challenges: combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving.</p><p>The combat trial was a gauntlet of weird large-headed enemies wielding knives and swords. Shadow Labyrinth's combat is easy to pick up--one button delivers quick sword strikes, the other a more powerful move that briefly depletes a stamina bar--but far from simple to master. These enemies are devious, with some trapping me in a corner and whipping me to death, while others would aim to shoot not where I was standing, but where they predicted I would be; they were about 50/50 in that regard. I found the trial challenging without being frustrating, and it felt great to get through the final wave and get the key piece.</p><p>The environmental puzzle, while fine, didn't leave as much of an impression on me, but the platforming was the most challenging and rewarding part of the whole demo. It feels like the developers put a ton of thought into trying to predict how players would approach each level, and then they designed their obstacles around that, rather than just placing enemies and traps on each stage. This meant I had to strategize, think before moving, and approach each dangerous obstacle with care; the game actively punishes mindless traversal, and that's how a game like this should be.</p><p>I also enjoyed the "D-Line" parts of the stage--or when my traversal turned into a small game of Pac-Man, and I had to travel on lines of light in order to proceed. These provided a welcome shot of variety during exploration, with a chaser of nostalgia for classic Pac-Man gameplay to boot.</p><p>Nostalgia is at the heart of Shadow Labyrinth, and it's here that I'll now address the absolutely bonkers story framing all of the exploration and fighting. As the Amazon Prime show established, the small yellow robot named Puck is trying to escape the world it's trapped in, and he must recruit warriors to do so. I play as Swordsman No. 8, the eighth attempt at escape and victory, and together we explored and fought our way through.</p><p>That's only scratching the surface, though, as there are layers to this tale that I never expected. For example, were you aware, dear reader, that every classic sci-fi game Bandai Namco ever made was part of a <a href="https://ugsf-series.com/en/" rel="nofollow ">single canonical timeline</a>? Before this preview event, I knew nothing of it, but Bandai Namco claims it has always operated on this timeline in secret--the veracity of this claim is up for debate, but damn if it isn't interesting either way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519133" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519133"></a><figcaption>Meeting the Bosconians.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg"></figure><p>As Shadow Labyrinth sits toward the end of this potentially-decades-old story, it is filled with references and allusions to games that came before it. A few examples:</p><ul><li>The tribe of friendly human characters I encountered are called the Bosconians.</li><li>The queen refers to my character, whose identity is still a mystery at this point, as a Galaxian.</li><li>She also references a potential foe named Emperor Galaga.</li><li>The Pac-Man robot's name, Puck, is a reference to Puck-Man, which was Pac-Man's original name.</li><li>Enemies encountered during the demo included Pookas and Fygars from Dig Dug.</li></ul><p>These are the less overt examples that some may not pick up on, while other references are much more obvious. I fought two different bosses during this demo, one at the end of the exploration part and the second from the specific save file provided by Bandai Namco. Both of them directly referenced a previous Bandai Namco project; first up was G-HOST, a small pink ghost-looking creature stuck to a machine controlling massive hooks that crashed on top of me. Pac-Man is pretty important to the lore, of course, so it's not surprising to see one of his ghostly enemies appear here.</p><p>The other boss, meanwhile, blew the "self-referential" concept wide open. This was a hulking beast of a humanoid monster wearing a distinct Jason Voorhess-esque white mask and named Jen. If your horror bells are ringing, that's because Jen was the damsel-in-distress of the Splatterhouse franchise, and her hero, Rick Taylor, wore a distinct Jason Voorhees-esque white mask as he tore demons and humanoid monsters in twain. Splatterhouse doesn't appear on the timeline I shared earlier, so how deep into the Bandai Namco vault is Shadow Labyrinth planning to go?</p><p>There is no shortage of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-metroidvania-games/2900-4005/">metroidvania games</a> out there at the moment--and there are more coming with both Hollow Knight: Silksong and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond set to launch new entries this year. How, then, can a game enter this crowded space and stand out? Bandai Namco may have cracked the code with Shadow Labyrinth: Make the story so incredibly wild that it can't be missed. It helps that the 2DAECP surrounding this bonkers tale is fun and challenging, so you'll be encouraged to keep traveling deeper down this Pac-rabbit hole.</p><p>I didn't know what to expect when dropping into Shadow Labyrinth for this preview event. After my time playing, I still don't know what's coming, and the game is all the more appealing for it.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> team has delayed its upcoming 2.3 update.</p>
<p>This update was casually announced earlier this month, when CD Projekt revealed  "we are planning another part for the game". At this time, the update was slated for a 26th June release, with more details to come closer to that date.</p>

<p>However, with three days to go before that aforementioned release, CD Projekt has said it needs "more time" to make sure it is totally happy with it.</p>
<p>"We're aiming for a scope similar to Update 2.2," the Cyberpunk 2077 team <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1937135894978253112">wrote on social media</a>. Thanking the community for its patience, the developer said it will "update [us] further as soon as we can", so stay tuned.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-22-adds-new-secrets-expanded-customisation-options-and-more">Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update was released towards the end of last year</a>, and included various new features and quality of life improvements, as well as what the developer teased as "secrets". These, it turns out, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">included a little nod to Balatro</a>. I wonder what the team's next update will include…</p>
<p>Rumours that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-cdpr-isnt-actually-finished-with-cyberpunk-2077-announces-another-update">Cyberpunk 2077 would be getting more content started making the rounds earlier this month</a>, when a LinkedIn post from a developer at Virtuous was circulated online. This post said the developer was working on Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, something that hadn't been announced yet.</p>

		<div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>With the Switch 2’s launch came <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-join-nintendo-switch-online-exclusive-to-switch-2/">a new library of games for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a>, Nintendo finally bringing GameCube games to the subscription service in a way that is honestly pretty great. And with a new generation of console has come a new generation of recreation controller from Nintendo, a thoroughly authentic GameCube controller that’s been updated and&nbsp;kitted out with direct support for the Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>It honestly looks fantastic, a true GameCube controller in all its multi-coloured glory, and with modern innards it can be wireless without a double AA battery bay, and still have a thick rumble motor. Putting it side-by-side with an original controller, the sticks feel nigh on identical in use, there’s the same internal springy twang from the chunky analogue triggers, but there’s also the tightness of a new controller for things like the D-Pad (which is still small and impractical, but slightly less mushy). It’s very nice.</p>



<p>And for the GameCube library that will gradually grow on Switch Online, it’s perfect. It’s things like having analogue triggers for air braking in F-Zero GX, like having the Y button right next to A so you can boost without employing some bizarre claw grip on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/16/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review/">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> (or more likely modifying the button layout in the emulator).</p>
<p>But that’s its one and only real use on Nintendo Switch 2. Perhaps the most disappointing thing with this recreated GameCube controller is that controllers have moved on so much in the last 25 years. There’s a standardised form with triggers and shoulder buttons on both sides, with multiple menu and system buttons, with clicking analogue sticks… and the GameCube controller just cannot keep up without some hefty modification.</p>

<p>Nintendo goes halfway. There’s the Switch Home, Capture and the new C button, as well a sneaky little ZL button, all flush and colour matched on the top side of the controller where you can’t normally see them while playing.</p>

<p>That helps with using the Switch 2 system, but not far enough that this is universally compatible with modern games. So many games use stick clicks these days, and this would absolutely affect how the GameCube sticks feel were it implemented here. More annoying is that there’s no – button, which is so commonly used for a game menu or map alongside the + or Start button. That tiny ZL could easily have been made to match the Z button on the right side, as well. Additionally, outside of games that support a traditional game rumble – namely the Switch Online library and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate – the way that HD Rumble is transmitted to controllers is incompatible with this gamepad.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s just as Nintendo said it would be. This is almost exclusively useful for Nintendo Switch Online’s new library of GameCube games, where it will be the best way to play thanks to the quirky face button layout. It’s just less expected when the GameCube pad looks much more like a modern pad, compared to the funky tri-point N64 controller.</p>
<p>And that’s what dramatically shrinks the gamepad’s value, in my opinion. You can find cheap GameCube-like controllers from the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate craze that don’t adhere so strictly to the design and have all the system buttons. Sure, they’re bound to feel cheaper, they’re less accurate to the original design, but they also don’t cost £59, and can be used more properly for more Switch games.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 GameCube Controller is a great-feeling recreation of a classic gamepad, furnished with some extra hidden buttons to make it a shade more modern, but it’s too limited to use outside of the Switch Online game library.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 biggie may be leading the pack once again, but its supporting cast still follows closely behind it, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> all landing in the top 10. Oh yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is still putting in a strong performance too, moving up to fourth and proving no other pesky series entry will be enough to harm its seemingly endless sales pull.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">RAIDOU Remastered</a> makes its chart debut at eighth, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> continues to climb back towards the top 10 ahead of its Switch 2 expansion arriving next month.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the full top 40 for this week, with platform breakdowns for all of the titles available on other consoles as well as the Switch and Switch 2:</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/343?utm_source=MergeMail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=mergemail-campaign-439411">latest patch</a> for <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-controversial-267-pve-mode-will-at-least-be-given-for-free-to-edge-of-darkness-owners/">Escape From Tarkov</a> adds plenty of fixes and improvements based directly on feedback from players, addressing several highly requested quality of life features, fixes for enemy AI in both PvE and PvP, and audio.</p>
<p>Developer Battlestate Games says that the "<em>audio engine systems and its individual subsystems have been significantly expanded to provide a more immersive Escape from Tarkov experience.</em>"</p>
<p>Battlestate Games warns that while the patch "<em>has gone through several stages of testing,</em>" it still isn't the final version, so players could still experience "<em>unexpected audio behavior in various situations</em>."</p>
<p>The studio is releasing this patch as another stage in its testing for these fixes, adding that "<em>this stage is necessary to collect feedback and do more tests on a diverse variety of players' hardware and software. We are already preparing a set of fixes for the upcoming updates and your feedback and detailed issue reports will help us in refining and stabilizing the system for all players</em>."</p>
<p>Here's the full list of fixes coming for audio, AI, and the quality of life improvements for Escape from Tarkov from the latest patch notes:</p>

            <p>Ashly Burch has played numerous video game characters, one of her most famous being Aloy in Guerrilla's Horizon series. Earlier this year, footage leaked showing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-experimenting-with-ai-powered-playstation-characters-ironically-chooses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate">Sony employee engaging with an on-screen AI version of the Horizon lead</a>. The employee asked the AI Aloy a number of questions, such as "how are you", to which the character replied she was ok, before she shared some Horizon lore. </p>
<p>The whole thing raised a few eyebrows, especially considering Aloy is a character growing up in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by rogue AI-controlled machines.</p>
<p>Burch herself released a video following this leak, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-actress-ashly-burch-responds-to-sonys-controversial-ai-aloy">developer Guerrilla had been in contact with her to say the "demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development"</a>. She additionally added Sony "didn't use any of [Burch's] performance" for the demo. But, how would she feel if AI <em>was </em>used in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-casually-confirms-horizon-forbidden-west-sequel">the next Horizon game</a>?</p>

<p>"For me, I think that AI as a tool to make things easier on devs would be a great thing. Like, I think I've heard someone say before something like, 'oh, if we used artificial intelligence to help with clean up between the mo-cap stage and importing it into the actual game engine, that could be amazing'. So, things that help streamline the development process [and] help make people's jobs easier, I think is great," Burch told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>That being said, for Burch, "in terms of if someone asked me 'can we make a replica of you that players could interact with ad nausium'," she would "<em>really</em> have to know how [the developer] was going to protect against me saying something awful". This is, of course, something Epic got into hot water with earlier this year, when its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-now-lets-you-chat-with-darth-vader-using-generative-ai-speech">use of AI to recreate James Earl Jones' voice for Fortnite's Darth Vader saw many using the technology to get the Sith lord to cuss</a>.</p>
<p>Burch believes the use of AI "would have to be a conversation" with those involved. "It's such a new technology, so it's difficult to know what applications developers would want to use it for," she said, before adding: "Guerrilla really cares about performance in its games, and I think a universe where Guerrilla just replaces every single actor they have with a robot is not going to happen."</p>
<p>However, Burch says there are some studios who do want to use AI to "generate what they want when they want".</p>
<p>"So, it becomes a conversation of 'what do you want to use this for, what are you trying to get out of this technology. Are you trying to <em>replace </em>my performance? Or are you trying to streamline your process or trying to find out in the pre-production phase how things would sound in my voice?' I think it becomes a 'use case' thing for me."</p>
<p>Burch additionally wants others to get the chances she did when she was starting out as a video games actor. She says she wants others to be able to have this same experience as she has, to say "I want to be a games actor" and to then be able to develop their skills and do just that.</p>
<p>"A lot of those characters that I cut my teeth on, like doing callouts in a MOBA, those things are at risk of being replaced," Burch said.</p>
<p>"I think that kind of work is essential for people to be A) able to make rent, and then B) be able to hone their craft and get better. It's important to me that actors continue to have the opportunity to act," Burch closed, although she appreciates that as a "tool devs can use", AI could have its place.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-confirms-it-will-be-at-gamescom-2025.1225767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has confirmed through <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1937133550869876827">a post on X</a> that it will be attending Gamescom 2025, which likely means another showcase from the company sometime between August 20 and 24.<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1937136830014754891"> Bethesda</a> and the <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24215994">World of Warcraft team at Blizzard</a> will also be attending the event.</p>
<p>We've had a Gamescom showcase from Xbox each year since 2021, with last year's attendance including <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-3-days-of-livestreams-for-gamescom-2024/">multiple livestreams for Xbox games</a>. While we don't yet know what we'll see at this year's show, there are a few games we should look forward to seeing.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> event the company hosted, we now have a clearer idea of what's due out in the fall from Microsoft, meaning there's a good chance we'll learn more about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, which is currently set to release sometime before the end of the year. It could also be where we get the official announcement of the recently leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-leaked-ahead-of-announcement/">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition</a> VR headset, and potentially some VR ports of Xbox games.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> could very likely get one more big marketing push before its October 29, 2025, release date. The same is likely for the recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle DLC</a> that's due out on September 4, 2025.</p>
<p>There's also a strong chance we'll see more of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Black Ops 7</a>, after Xbox capped off its Summer Game Fest showcase with this year's entry in the Call of Duty franchise. Each game in the series is usually out sometime between October and November, so it's likely we'll get a release date reveal during whatever showcase Xbox hosts.</p>
<p>There's also a chance we see a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, which was also featured during the SGF event that Xbox hosted. We got a release window with its SGF trailer, so it's possible we'll get a proper release date with a new trailer for Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>And now that we have a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, it wouldn't be a surprise if Team Ninja and Platinum Games have a new gameplay trailer set for Gamescom 2025, and potentially a show-floor gameplay demo for those in attendance.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that even if Xbox doesn't host a livestream event, however unlikely that may seem, its attendance at Gamescom 2025 does make it likely that anything we've seen from the company that we know is coming this fall will likely be available to demo ahead of that fall release date.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll find out more official information soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Funcom has announced that the game has reached a major sales milestone since its release earlier this month, and the studio has also shared some fun stats to commemorate said milestone.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>&nbsp;has sold a million copies since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june" rel="nofollow">its launch on June 10th</a>. This figure also makes the game the fastest-selling Funcom title; as the studio points out, it took&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s spiritual predecessor, around a year to reach the same figure.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s peak player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">189,333</a> on Steam has easily outstripped&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/440900/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">53,402</a>, and&nbsp;the newer game also has a 24-hour player peak of 174,003, so there are still plenty of people interested in it almost two weeks after launch.</p>

Next time, you'll know to pack a sturdier umbrella.</p>

<p>Players have crafted 517,585 ornithopters between them, and over 6 billion grams of spice have been consumed across&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s player base as well, proving the franchise's age-old adage true.</p>

<p>It's worth checking out the full infographic to see some other fun&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>numbers, so here it is in all its glory!</p>



<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>is, it's a survival game set on the desert planet of Arrakis, which is central to the plot and setting of Frank Herbert's influential&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>series (as well as director Denis Villeneuve's movies, of course).</p>

<p>The game takes place in an alternate timeline in which messiah figure Paul Atreides was never born and in which a civil war between the Atreides and Harkonnen factions rages. You play as a Bene Gesserit agent searching for the nomadic Fremen, who have disappeared in this timeline.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. The game is also due to come to consoles at some point in the future, although we don't know exactly when just yet.</p>

            <p>Blood. Blood. Bloooooooooddddddd. Sorry, I've just watched Rebel Wolves show off the first look we've gotten at someone playing vampire RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, and I think it's rubbed off on me a bit.</p>
<p>To be fair, you can't blame the group of ex-Witcher 3 devs for having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-the-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-a-trailer-looks-witcherish">put together a game</a> that looks to use the B word more often than someone who's just gotten a nasty paper cut while handling some packets of the red stuff at a blood bank.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>During a livestream this weekend just gone - June 21 to be exact - the devs delivered about 21 minutes of design director Daniel Sadowski demoing a "work-in-progress" pre-beta build of The Blood of Dawnwalker. He spent most of that time showing off a mid-game quest in the game's biggest city, Svartrau, which boasts four boroughs. Also, in true medieval European fashion, it's got a castle so big that even William the Conqueror would say 'phwoar'.</p>
<p>Rescuing your family from that fortress, dubbed Griefberg and currently ruled by a powerful vampire called Brencis, is the key to the game's main quest. You'll need to recruit help or find ways to make it easier to storm, while a timer ticking down in days next to the objective, showing you how long you've got left to plan before it's too late.</p>

<p>As for the quest Sadowski was showing off here, the main point of emphasis was the game's calling card - a day/night cycle that changes gameplay, with Coen's half-human/half-vampire nature making missions play differently depending on the time of day. For example, if you've got to get into a cathedral to look for clues, you might waltz in and meet a priest during the day, while at night, you'll have to use your sneaky vampire roof jumpy powers to break in and find spooky people up to no good.</p>
<p>I'm interested to see which I'll prefer when I get my hands on the game, but Sadowski was keen to emphasise that the choice and consequence goes beyond just having two options for each mission, with various paths depending on what you do and how exactly you opt to approach the scenarios the game lobs your way. One thing I am pretty sure of is that I'll be pretty bad at Dawnwalker's Kingdom Come Deliverance 2-ish sword combat at first, given fiddly directional attacking and blocking tends to really expose my unfortunate inability to press parry exactly on cue.</p>
<p>The demo ended with Coen getting into a boss battle with an elderly vampire called Xanthe and her blood guards, and towards the end of it, he just goes pop. No, seriously, Xanthe has a skill called boiling blood, and if you don't beat her quickly enough, Coen gets blood explosioned. As in, he explodes into a big splatter of blood. Clean up on aisle seven.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker's still on for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-the-vampire-rpg-from-former-cd-projekt-folks-is-coming-out-2026">a 2026 release</a>, so you've got a bit of time to mentally prepare to face the Dracula version of being Thanos snapped.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-former-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-shows-off-a-guy-being-blood-explosioned-by-a-flying-old-lady]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Actor Ned Luke, who played Michael in GTA 5 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-trio-want-fans-to-petition-for-one-last-dlc-story-together/1100-6532595/" data-ref-id="1100-6532595">wants to come back in a new DLC for GTA Online</a>, has revealed the one mission in the game that was "hands down" the worst to perform.</p><p>Responding to someone online who posted a clip of the yoga mission from GTA 5's campaign, Luke said he <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1935524554127945819" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">agreed</a> with the commenter and that it was "hands down the worst to shoot." Luke added that he "sweated my ass off for eight hours" during the filming process.</p><p>The <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Did_Somebody_Say_Yoga%3F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Did Somebody Say Yoga?"</a> mission in GTA 5 has Michael joining his wife Amanda and yoga instructor Fabien for a yoga session at their home. The player must match button presses in time and order to complete the objective; failing triggers a fail screen telling you that "Michael failed to achieve enlightenment."</p><p>While Luke might not have enjoyed this one scene, he's previously spoken positively about his experience making the game overall. He's asking fans to petition Rockstar to bring him and his co-stars Steven Ogg (Trevor) and Shawn Fonteno (Franklin) back for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-trio-want-fans-to-petition-for-one-last-dlc-story-together/1100-6532595/" data-ref-id="1100-6532595">another heist mission in GTA Online</a> featuring all three of them.</p><p>Many have theorized that Michael may appear in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-actor-from-gta-5-also-be-in-the-new-game-ned-luke-weighs-in/1100-6520046/" data-ref-id="1100-6520046">Luke himself dodged the question</a>. "I'm not in... we don't... GTA 6 is unknown things right now. Just to make that clear," he said when a host introduced him as "Michael from GTA 5 and GTA 6."</p><p>Luke has also told fans that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-will-be-worth-the-wait-so-just-be-patient-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6529201/" data-ref-id="1100-6529201">GTA 6 will be worth the wait</a> and that fans can trust that Rockstar Games will deliver something impressive when the game finally launches in May 2026.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-3-delayed-beyond-this-week-no-new-date-revealed.1225728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has announced that the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>Update 2.3 will be postponed, and no new release date for the update has been announced.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberpunk.net/post/3lsbnqkiohc2h" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bluesky, the studio says that while the update was intended to be released on June 26th (that's this Thursday at time of writing), more time will be needed for the developer to "make sure we're happy with [the update]".</p>

<p>The extra time will be used to implement features that will bring Update 2.3 closer in scope to Update 2.2, the studio says. More information will be provided as soon as it's available, according to CDPR.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-update-2.3-delayed-smoking.jpg?itok=OseBe83H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-update-2.3-delayed-smoking.jpg?itok=-sKiDTGW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s next update has been delayed indefinitely.</figcaption></figure><p>While we know what kind of level CDPR is aiming for when it comes to Update 2.3, we don't yet know exactly what will be in it. The patch was only announced <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1930657862054707704" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earlier this month</a>, and since then, speculation has been rife, but concrete information from CDPR hasn't been forthcoming.</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red community director&nbsp;Marcin Momot said at the time of the patch's release that the team would "start spilling the beans closer to the release of patch 2.3", so it sounds like we'll have a little longer to wait for more info.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>news, CDPR revealed back in May that a sequel to the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production" rel="nofollow">has entered pre-production</a>, although that might be a little less exciting than you'd think; it essentially means the studio is currently prototyping the game's skeleton and creating its foundations.</p>

<p>Additionally, in November last year, the studio announced that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">surpass 30 million sales</a> around the world, so if you're wondering why CDPR is so eager to get a sequel underway, now you know.</p>




<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>is also one of the third-party games chosen to launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2, and while <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report" rel="nofollow">reports claim</a> that third-party launch numbers for Switch 2 games aren't looking so great, those reports also point to&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>as the Switch 2's best-selling third-party title.</p>

        <ul><li><strong>Welcome to the Midnight Murder Club</strong> – You’ve been invited to the Midnight Murder Club, an elite group that gives you nothing but a gun and a flashlight before sending you into the darkened halls of a mansion. Conceal your identity behind a mask and join your friends in a game of perception, deception, and sharpshooting. In the darkness, every decision counts.</li><li><strong>Six Guests. One Deadly Game.</strong> – The difference between light and dark is important as the Midnight Murder Club’s members are forced to choose between the safety of darkness and the risk of clicking on a flashlight.

Rely on your other senses to navigate the mansion and find your opponents.</li><li><strong>Whispers in the Dark</strong> – Full proximity chat leads to tense and hysterical moments as you feel your way through the mansion’s dark corridors. Hear muffled footsteps as someone runs down the hallway above you, then creep toward gunshots bleeding through the door to the next room. Hear your rivals’ laughter echo through the tall ceilings after you emerge victorious from a gunfight.</li><li><strong>The Devil’s Toys</strong> – Hidden around the mansion are traps, weapons, and other equipment to help you survive the night. Take night vision pills to see in the dark. Don a bulletproof vest to defend against your foes. Immobilize your enemies in a bear trap or light them ablaze with a molotov cocktail. The variety of items makes every match unique.</li><li><strong>A Game of Choice</strong> – What game does the Club have in store for your group tonight? <em>Midnight Murder Club</em> has multiple ways to play ranging from classics to objective-based modes that require more thought and strategy as you explore the secrets hiding inside Wormwood Manor.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club - Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOPh52i_vgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/midnight-murder-club-launches-august-14]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Seoul-based game development studio Shift Up has finally released Stellar Blade for PC earlier this month. The game, originally codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-eve-looks-stunning-in-first-playstation-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project EVE</a>, was actually supposed to launch on PC right away alongside PlayStation 4 and even Xbox One.</p>
<p>However, when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-new-name-project-eve-visually-stunning-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resurfaced</a> in September 2022's State of Play stream as Stellar Blade, it did so as a PlayStation 5 exclusive with Sony Interactive Entertainment set to publish. Back then, the developers still hoped for a 2023 launch, but the launch had to be delayed until April 2024, when it became <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> for the PS5.&nbsp;<span>Shift Up&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a PC port and a sequel only a month later</span>, although this version of the action game took over a year to be released.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, quality is all that matters, especially given the current state of the games industry. Therefore, I'm happy to say that Stellar Blade on PC is a very solid port on all accounts. It doesn't even seem like Shift Up got any help from Sony's dedicated PC porting team, Nixxes Software, which makes the port's quality all the more impressive.</p>
<p>First things first. This PC version includes most of the technical bells and whistles we expect from a 2025 triple-A launch, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full support for Ultra-wide and Super Ultra-wide display (21:9 and 32:9), cutscenes included</li>
<li>Support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution (with the latest transformer model), AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation, AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation, NVIDIA DLAA and FSR Native AA</li>
<li>Support for the DualSense controller's haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and controller speaker features</li>
<li>Support for High Dynamic Range displays</li>
<li>Six predefined frame rate limiter options (30 FPS, 45 FPS, 60 FPS, 120 FPS, 144 FPS, 240 FPS, and of course, unlimited frame rate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, a few things are missing, like Intel XeSS, a 165 FPS frame rate limiter option, better HDR calibration options (they're the same for SDR: brightness, contrast, and UI brightness), and possibly a field of view slider, although the latter isn't really standard for third-person games.</p>
<p>Overall, though, there's more than enough here to be satisfied, especially since the game itself runs very smoothly. Powered by the Unreal Engine 4, Stellar Blade can run <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-gets-added-to-marvels-spider-man-2-mecha-break-rematch-and-dragonkin-the-banished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at an average of 540 frames per second</a> on a GeForce RTX 5090 with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade PC 4K Gameplay Max Settings, NVIDIA DLAA" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T3gCmP8DXyI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this case, however, there's little reason to use Performance Mode when the frame rate is already so high. In our testing, we used NVIDIA DLAA while also maxing all the graphics settings and still registered a maximum frame rate of 423 FPS, an average frame rate of 377 FPS, and a minimum frame rate of 313 FPS, in a custom benchmark run of the Wasteland level seen in the video above.</p>
<p>Being an Unreal Engine 4, Stellar Blade on PC is not entirely devoid of the all-too-familiar stuttering we've unfortunately come to expect from the technology. When analyzing the data captured with FrameView, nearly 12% is labeled as stuttering. On the other hand, the rest of the gameplay is buttery smooth, delivering a great action experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Stellar-Blade-PC-Benchmark-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Sure, the game isn't the most visually demanding in 2025. It doesn't have path tracing, or even just ray tracing, or UE5's Lumen global illumination. Even so, the art style goes a long way toward delivering an aesthetically appealing experience.</p>
<p>The upside of launching one year later is that the game has been improved through several updates. Furthermore, there are two expansion packs (one themed around NieR: Automata and another around Shift Up's first big hit, the gacha Goddess of Victory: Nikke) that can be purchased separately or as part of the Complete Edition.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm having a lot of fun playing Stellar Blade. While it is a fairly straightforward experience could certainly have used more complexity (and more narrative, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> recently by Shift Up's CEO), it understands the core of what's entertaining about an action videogame, and that's why it has reached so many players.</p>

        <p>With a focus on ultra-realistic simulation, deep emotional connections, and limitless interaction, <em>Starsand Island</em> aims to become a “The Sims of the farming genre”, breaking new ground in how players build relationships with NPCs in a rural life sim.</p><p><span><strong>I. Intertwined interactions</strong></span></p><p><strong>1. Lively, Authentic NPCs</strong></p><p>We’ve infused our NPCs with lifelike memory, perception, emotions, and independent decision-making; every character on Starsand Island even has long-term personal goals.</p><p>Players can help them achieve these dreams, growing together along the way. NPCs will give you context-sensitive requests based on their progress, and they actively respond to what’s happening around them. For example: snap a photo and they’ll strike a pose; pass by, and they’ll greet you; animal lovers will go out of their way to pet any stray cat or dog they spot. The islanders feel truly alive and are proactive.</p><p><strong>2. Unique, Rich Interactions</strong></p><p>Most farming sims offer NPC chats and gift-giving, but <em>Starsand Island</em> goes further: every key character has signature interactions reflecting their personality. Maybe you’ve started a friendship with an islander who <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>lights as a fortune teller? You can join them for a reading, complete with a touch of mysticism—sometimes with real-life advice!</p><p>Plus, the island is packed with interactive objects, so you can ride bikes together, swing side by side, have sleepovers, even binge-watch TV.</p><p><strong>3. Realistic, Gradual Relationship Growth</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Organic, Repeatable Bonding</strong> – Build rapport through daily chats, gifts, invites, and teamwork—not just scripted story beats. Relationships feel genuine and continuous, rather than “checklist” moments.</li><li><strong>Responsive Dialogue</strong> – As bonds deepen, NPC conversations and reactions evolve, showing off unique quirks and gestures. No more cardboard cutouts—your new friends feel real.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Deep Immersion in Daily Life</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a title="Genres > Action [2,829 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>-Driven Events and QTEs</strong> – Key moments blend quick-time events and animation, with realistic details and true-to-life NPC responses, so you feel right in the heart of the story.</li><li><strong>Dynamic <a title="Series > Persona [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>l Events</strong> – Get surprise gifts, receive heartfelt letters, accept special requests, and unlock unique storylines for each NPC. Every friendship grows like a “life tree,” branching in new directions.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Customization and Growing Together</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Relationship-Driven Gameplay</strong> – Your bond impacts everything, from how well NPCs help you collect resources to the rewards they give for completing jobs. The closer you are, the more they’ll pitch in and the better your rewards.</li><li><strong>Personalized Nicknames</strong> – Customize how you and your friends address each other. Unique relationship labels and emotional replies from NPCs help you feel truly connected.</li></ul><p><strong>6. Integrated Social and Homebuilding Systems</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Islanders, Not Tools</strong> – NPCs aren’t just quest-givers, they’re genuine friends with dreams, moods, and personalities. Their lives intertwine with yours, shaping the island’s entire community and how your home evolves.</li></ul><p><strong>7. Heartfelt Stories and Everyday Warmth</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Heart Stories, Side <a title="Platforms > Quest [144 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s, and Banters</strong> – Each “heart level” unlocks new story chapters and slice-of-life side quests. Main plots and daily moments blend seamlessly, for a world that feels alive.</li><li><strong>Surprise Rewards and Easter Eggs</strong> – Hidden events, Kabedons, rare items, and special animations keep things fresh and full of emotional payoffs.</li></ul><p><span><strong>II. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Overview—“It’s More Than Just Romance in Dialogue”</strong></span></p><p><strong>1. NPCs Grow and Remember</strong></p><p>Every conversation, gift, or invitation leaves a mark. NPCs remember your habits and preferences. How often and how you interact shapes the future, creating shared memories unique to you.</p><p><strong>2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Gearbox Software has released the first story trailer for its upcoming looter-shooter, Borderlands 4, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/19/borderlands-4-is-coming-to-game-informers-cover">which is also the game gracing the next issue of <em>Game Informer </em>magazine</a>, and it highlights the new setting of Kairos, the four new Vault Hunters, the villainous Timekeeper, and more. Plus, it ends with details about the bonuses you'll get for preordering Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</p><p>"Get a glimpse of the Timekeeper's cruel reign, including the disturbing process of being implanted with a Bolt – a spine-grafted cybernetic device used to dominate the populace," the trailer's description reads. "Soon after crash-landing, the Vault Hunters are arrested and forcibly affixed with the device, trapping them on Kairos."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Borderlands 4 story trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Timekeeper and his Order rule over Kairos from the impenetrable fortress location of Dominion City. When Elpis arrived in Kairos' orbit and unleashed cataclysmic destruction, the Timekeeper locked Dominion City down and sent in his commanders to handle the fallout. Today, the Timekeeper watches over Kairos from the safety of his tower, letting these Commanders maintain his Order, Gearbox says.&nbsp;</p><p>"From humble beginnings, you'll need to travel across Kairos and ignite the revolution against the Timekeeper," Gearbox says. "People all across Kairos have begun to rise up, and this powderkeg is set to explode.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.pl/games/peak">Peak</a> has sold one million copies in six days, following a steady day-by-day launch on Steam.</p>
<p>Developed by Landcrab (a collaboration between Landfall and Aggro Crab), the title initially launched to just over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/">11,000 concurrent players on 17th June according to SteamDB</a>. This grew daily, eventually breaching the 100,000 concurrent milestone on Sunday.</p>
<p>As of writing, the game is at the top of Steam's Top Sellers list, following the well-trodden path last walked by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> earlier this month. By all accounts a great success, especially considering this is Landcrab's first release.</p>

<p>In response to Peak passing the million-sales mark, Aggro Crab posted a very snarky and on-brand reaction <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1936733984635179247">on social media</a>: "why did this stupid jam game sell more copies than another crabs treasure im gonna crash out".</p>
<p>The positive reception comes at a good time for the Aggro Crab team, who collaborated with Landfall after funding for Going Under 2 was pulled from beneath the developer. As for Landfall, that team has a rich history of releasing smaller games that make a massive impact. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/content-warning-tops-one-million-sales">Content Warning topped one million sales</a> fairly quickly, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/extremely-silly-battle-royale-game-totally-accurate-battlegrounds-is-an-unexpected-steam-smash">Totally Accurate Battlegrounds</a> was an April Fools Joke that morphed into a surprise hit.</p>
<p>If you were curious as to Aggro Crab's previous work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-crabs-treasure-feels-a-natural-evolution-for-an-underwater-soulslike">Another Crab's Treasure is <em>fantastic</em></a>. It's well worth your time, and it's going cheap these days too! Get your pincers round it, if you can.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/charming-co-op-climbing-game-peak-takes-steam-by-storm-selling-one-million-copies-in-six-days-and-mounting-the-top-sellers-page]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The officially licensed EXG Pro Astro Bot Cable Guy will soon be available for pre-order, and it looks like a must-have for fans of Sony’s super-cute mascot.&nbsp; Designed to hold controllers, including the PS5 DualSense, Xbox Series X|S controllers, and pretty much any mobile phone, Astro Bot can sit on your desk and be, well,&nbsp; super cute.</p>
<p>It’s also rather reasonably priced, considering the detail on the model and will cost you £29.99 plus postage.&nbsp; You can read more and get ready to pre-order over at <a href="https://exgpro.com/products/playstation-astro-bot-cable-guys-controller-holder-and-phone-stand?_pos=1&amp;_sid=3caf0d721&amp;_ss=r">EGXPro</a>.</p>




<p>Astro Bot will be getting a fresh update in July with free content.</p>

<p>“5 brand new levels will make their way into the game as part of the Vicious Void Galaxy, bringing the total number of levels in Astro Bot to a whopping 90+! As with our last update, these 5 levels will require you to pull every bit of skill together to complete so hang on to your DualSense Controller and dive in!” <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/">commented</a> Nicolas Doucet, Studio Head at Team Asobi.</p>
<p>“The 5 levels available will be:Twin-Frog Trouble, Suck It Up, Handhold Havoc, High Inflation and… well. You’ll have to play and see. And who knows? Maybe completing all Vicious Void might lead to something really cool?”</p>
<p>The levels will come with new collectable Special Bots including one that is a “revengeful newcomer”. Also, an updated version of the Astro Bot Limited Edition DualSense wireless controller is launching later this year with a new twist on the touch pad.</p>
<p>Astro Bot cleaned up at this years<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/astro-bot-wins-five-baftas-still-wakes-the-deep-claims-three/"> BAFTA awards</a> winning five of the seventeen awards that were available.&nbsp; We gave the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">10/10 in our review,</a></p>
<p>“Astro Bot is a game that absolutely celebrates all things PlayStation, aimed at anyone and everyone who loves this console and the games that have made it what it is. Whether you’re an old timer or a young kid with their first console — or better yet, a combination of the two — there are dozens of hours of fun to be mined here. It’s a fun, easy-going romp through PlayStation history, and absolutely impossible to play without a smile plastered to your face.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Co-op Climbing Game Peak Hits 1m Sales in Less Than a Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-1m-sales-first-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/co-op-climbing-game-peak-hits-1m-sales-in-less-than-a-week.1225662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Peak</em>, a physics-based climbing sim created by Aggro Crab and&nbsp;<em>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator&nbsp;</em>developer Landfall, has reached a major sales milestone within just a week of its release.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1936734056089100646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Landfall X account,&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>managed to sell a million copies within its first six days, which is particularly impressive given that the game isn't currently available anywhere outside of Steam.</p>

<p>On that note, in the replies to the post, a user asks Landfall whether&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>is coming to consoles as well. The studio says it's "too early to say", but that the game will "hopefully" be released on consoles. I'd imagine sales numbers like this won't hurt on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/peak-sales-1m-climbing.jpg?itok=z8JP2tqJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/peak-sales-1m-climbing.jpg?itok=EKqsPnsy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Peak&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell a million copies in its first week.</figcaption></figure><p>As for the reason behind&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>'s success, it's likely tapping into the same streaming-friendly approach espoused by the likes of horror game&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company&nbsp;</em>or fellow climbing sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit" rel="nofollow"><em>Chained Together</em></a>.</p>

<p>Per&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>'s Steam page, the game is one in which "the slightest mistake can spell your doom", and it should be fairly obvious how that translates to streaming appeal; watching streamers gleefully fail to climb a mountain time and time again is exactly the kind of entertainment many stream viewers are looking for.</p>

<p><em>Peak</em>'s map also rotates every day, which means that even if you manage to conquer today's mountain, you'll have another one waiting for you and your friends tomorrow, adding replay value.</p>

<p>All told, it looks like Landfall and Aggro Crab have a hit on their hands. It just remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>can remain at the top of its particular mountain, or whether it'll be shunted off by another flavor of the month soon.</p>




<p>If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>for yourself, you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here on PC via Steam</a>. Hopefully, the game will come to consoles soon as well. Stay tuned for more.</p>
