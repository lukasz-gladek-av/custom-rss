<div><p>Back in January, Gehenna Games launched a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/eldritch-automata-combines-mecha-with-cosmic-horror" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> for the cosmic horror mecha TTRPG <em>Eldritch Automata</em>. Ultimately, the campaign fell short of its funding goal. Now, the studio has relaunched the campaign on Backerkit, where it reaches its funding goal in 36 minutes.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/gehenna-gaming/eldritch-automata-action-horror-ttrpg">Backerkit campaign page</a>, <em>Eldritch Automata</em> is a high-octane TTRPG set in a dark and dangerous setting. It is set in a recent-apocalyptic world packed with body horror, man-eating eldritch Horrors, and angelic Seraphs with mind-control powers. Your only weapon against them is your Automata, a monstrous mecha that slowly kills you.</p>

The campaign cites Guillermo del Toro's <em>Pacific Rim</em>, Sunrise Studios' <em>The Vision of Escaflowne</em>, and Hideaki Anno's iconic <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>.</p>
<p>The inspiration for the latter is explicit in <em>Eldritch Automata's</em> character archetypes. Based on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-year-zero-engine-ogl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Year Zero Engine</a>, the game features twelve archetypes such as The Bound, The Control Freak, The Hedgehog's Dilemma, The Manufactured, and The Thanatos.</p>
<p>Players can customize their pilot and one of twelve different Automata. In addition to different attributes and skills, players manage their Ego. This represents the pilots consciousness and identity. It fuels your Automata's special abilities. If your Ego is fully depleted, it will cause you and your Automata to go berserk.</p>

They include additional customization options, a physical deluxe edition core rulebook, as well as official enhanced support for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alchemy RPG</a>, Its various pledge levels are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Civilian for $35:</strong> A PDF copy of the core rulebook and Alchemy RPG access</li>
<li><strong>Automata for $55:</strong> A physical hardcover copy of the game and everything in Civilian level</li>
<li><strong>Horror for $100:</strong> Everything in Automata level, a quick launch guide, official dice, GM Screen, and Horror Dossier Pack</li>
<li><strong>Seraph for $200:</strong> Everything in Horror level, a Deluxe Edition physical copy, official metal dice, and Seraph Dossier Pack</li>
<li><strong>Architect (All-In) for $300</strong>: Everything from the Seraph level, Equipment and Armor cards, Seraph and Automata Metal Dice, and Legends Never Die Dossier Pack</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Eldritch Automata</em> campaign has raised $55,609, more than five times its initial funding goal. The campaign concludes on July 25.</p>

            <p>
Remember Microsoft's Xbox cloud gaming device, codenamed Keystone? The one that got announced in 2021, was cancelled in its original form a year later, then showed up on Phil Spencer's shelf after that, bamboozling everyone? Well if you've ever wondered what it could have looked like in more detail, a newly surfaced patent might have some answers.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/D1009161">patent in question</a> was originally filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office in June 2022 - several months after Microsoft announced it would no longer be proceeding with Keystone in its existing form - and features designs for a proposed machine only referred to as an "electronic console device". There's nothing explicitly linking to the document to Keystone, but <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-that-never-was-our-first-detailed-look-at-the-keystone-cloud-streaming-console-design">Windows Central</a> claims that's precisely what it is.
</p>
<p>
A side-by-side comparison with the "old prototype" version of Keystone that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-phil-spencers-shelf-is-teasing-the-xbox-game-pass-streaming-box">appeared on Phil Spencer's desk in October 2022</a> also supports that claim, with both the patent and prototype version featuring the same front panel.
</p>

<p>
The patent, however, reveals a lot more of the design Microsoft was at one point apparently considering for its cloud streaming games console. It bears much in common with the current Xbox Series S, albeit with that machine's horizontal footprint compacted into square. It's also pictured with an Xbox Series X-style "Hello from Seattle" plate on its bottom.
</p>
<p>
As for the ports on this proposed form - attributed to principal Microsoft designer Chris Kujawski - there's an Xbox button and USB port on the front, a controller pairing button one one side, plus HDMI, ethernet, and power connectors to the rear. And aside from a whole bunch of heat-dissipating holes, that's your lot - no details of the machine's innards are revealed in the patent.
</p>
<p>
When Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-decides-to-pivot-away-from-xbox-game-pass-streaming-box-for-now">addressed the progress of Keystone</a> back in May 2022, it said it had "made the decision to pivot away from the current iteration" of the device, and would refocus its efforts on a "new approach". Xbox boss Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23460485/microsoft-xbox-streaming-console-keystone-delay-price">later confirmed</a> the project had been canned because it was "more expensive than we wanted it to be when we actually built it out with the hardware that we had inside" - and that Microsoft's "new approach" was its Xbox TV app, enabling users to stream Xbox Cloud Gaming titles at 1080p and up to 60fps.
</p>
<p>
So while Xbox's square-shaped dreams of a dedicated cloud gaming console are perhaps long dead, its ambitions in the game streaming space are far from over.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wyrmspan-review-takes-wingspan-to-new-heights<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You hear the bellowing roar of a creature in the distance, above you the looming shadow of a huge pair of wings blots out the sun as a sudden gust of wind announces the presence of, you guessed it, a dragon! Do you have the resources to entice these majestic creatures to live in the habitats you’ve created for them? Find out in our review of <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wyrmspan/"><em>Wyrmspan</em></a>, based on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wingspan-review-pleasant-from-beak-to-tailfeather">monumentally popular <em>Wingspan</em></a> - both by <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stonemaeir games</a>!</p>
<h2><em>Wyrmspan -&nbsp;</em>The Basics</h2>
<p><em>Wyrmspan&nbsp;</em>is a tabletop board game for 1 - 5 players, where you take on the role of an amateur dracologist in a realm where dragons of all different shapes, sizes, and personalities rule the skies. In this strategy board game, you'll manage resources and plan your actions carefully to lure dragons to your personal board, scoring points in a variety of ways. In the end, the player with the most victory points wins!</p>
<p>The game contains 183 dragon cards, each vastly different from one-another (and none of these cards are direct copies of&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>&nbsp;cards, which I'll speak more about momentarily). In the game, your goal is to lure these dragons to roost on your land by excavating cave spaces on your board (of which there are 75 cave cards), using resources to pay for dragons, and moving your little meeple dracologist around the board to trigger special actions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wyrmspan-review-full-table_0.jpg?itok=9hBHL4vO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wyrmspan-review-full-table_0.jpg?itok=kZihf_EM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Though there are many elements to the game, two players can cram everything onto a mid-sized coffee table!</figcaption></figure><p>Our first game took us a little under two hours to play (with two players), and we're&nbsp;<em>very</em> familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wingspan.&nbsp;</em>But subsequent plays got us right down to the 90 minute game time as advertised on the box.</p>
<h2>How is&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan&nbsp;</em>Different From&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>?</h2>
<p>In many ways,&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan&nbsp;</em>follows a similar game flow and much of the same core rules with&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, but these are two completely different, stand-alone games. The base game of&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em>&nbsp;is slightly more complicated and strategic compared to the core base game of&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>&nbsp;(though it feels close in levels of complexity when you add in expansions like&nbsp;<em>Oceania</em>). Here are some of the ways that <i>Wyrmspan&nbsp;</i>is different from&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>:</p>
<h3><em>Wyrmspan </em>introduces the concept of the Dragon Guild&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan,&nbsp;</em>there's a new board set to the side of the game called the Dragon Guild board. There are four different guild cards you can place on this board, and it essentially creates a circular track that players can move around to gain additional resources, benefits, and points.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wyrmspan-review-dragon-guild-board.jpg?itok=vC1CT7Hs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wyrmspan-review-dragon-guild-board.jpg?itok=awFAbFHl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's a mad dash around the Dragon Guild Board!</figcaption></figure><h3>You have to excavate your spaces in&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, when you want to play a bird in a space you simply have to pay the cost (and additional egg costs) and place them. With&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em>, you first have to excavate that space on your board (you start with three pre-excavated spaces).</p>
<p>You do this by drawing and playing a Cave card. And while this is an added step in the process, these Cave cards are some of the most fun aspects of the game, as they bestow immediate "When Played" benefits, some of which are incredibly powerful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wyrmspan-review-dragon-and-cave-card-board.jpg?itok=lbJLXC-7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wyrmspan-review-dragon-and-cave-card-board.jpg?itok=XPPa-r2a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dragon and Cave cards now coexist on their own board, each with their own unique powers!</figcaption></figure><h3>Actions can carry over in&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em></h3>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, actions you played were tracked with action cubes, and your turn ended when you used up all your cubes. In&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em>, actions are tracked by spending coins (you start with six), and some special effects give you extra actions&nbsp;<em>plus</em>&nbsp;you can always end your turns in a round before using all your coins -- meaning you can carry them over for a very impactful next round!</p>
<p>These are the three largest differences between&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em>, but the <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wyrmspan/rules-faq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stonemaier&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em> FAQ</a> has a really nice rundown of all the differences - big and little - if you're curious.</p>
<h2>But do all of these rules changes over-complicate <em>Wyrmspan</em>?</h2>
<p>In my opinion, absolutely not! What you get from these added elements isn't an over-wrought game design, but instead a lot more player agency and choice. There are also more moments for surprise in this game, as you never know what powerful Cave cards you'll flip into the display.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wyrmspan-review-card-closeup.jpg?itok=wcpAJMqm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wyrmspan-review-card-closeup.jpg?itok=LzE3WefP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hatchlings need milk (??) to grow, but will eventually give you a powerful reward!</figcaption></figure><p>Being able to gain more actions and hold actions from one round to the next left me feeling very empowered in our games. I was able to play the game at a cadence that worked for me, and suited my play style well, as I like to hold my actions in the early game and go for a big mega-round in the second half.</p>
<p>The race around the Dragon Guild board also provided way more of a sense of tension than I was expecting in my play-throughs.</p>
<p>What I thought would just be an add-on that we didn't pay much attention to turned out to be one of the main focuses of our gameplay, and a source of friendly competition.</p>
<h2>Wyrmspan Review - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>When it was first announced that Stonemaeir Games would be releasing <em>Wyrmspan</em>, a new interpolation of their blockbuster birding hit <em>Wingspan</em>, I have to admit - I was left scratching my head.</p>
<p>What made <em>Wingspan</em> such a masterpiece, in my opinion, was the wonderfully “normal” theme of the game: birding. Along with Audubon Society-style illustrations, the game eschewed wizards, aliens, and, well… dragons for a topic much more down to earth.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wyrmspan-review-final-game-board.jpg?itok=Ua7OrZoA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wyrmspan-review-final-game-board.jpg?itok=o_SAmy7j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A finished board at the end of the game, look at all these gorgeous dragons!</figcaption></figure><p>But the core engine of the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>is so strong, and so damned fun, that I knew I immediately wanted to see how&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em>&nbsp;ideated on the original. And besides, it's not like I&nbsp;<em>don't love</em>&nbsp;dragons! As soon as I started reading the rulebook for&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em>, and began to get a sense of the changes it brought to the game engine, I knew I'd be hooked.</p>
<p><em>Wyrmspan</em>&nbsp;is a game that takes something incredible and perfects upon it further, pushing the design right up to the limits to create a bold, inviting, and strategically rewarding experience. I think&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan&nbsp;</em>may be one of the most engrossing gaming experiences I've had this year, and fans of the original&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em> absolutely need to check this game out as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Even if the birding aspect is what initially drew you into&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, rest assured that this game - full of its own swath of gorgeous illustrations - will completely sink its talons into you and your gaming group!</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Wyrmspan is a triumph of game design, taking a near-perfect blueprint from Wingspan and enhancing it. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186714/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-moore-npc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="mvUlqZ">I accidentally killed my favorite NPC in <em>Elden Ring</em>, and my life as I know it is over. Here’s how you can avoid making the same mistake.</p>
<p id="6NOTG8">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This article contains spoilers for Moore’s storyline in <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.]</p>
<p id="C1Ms3C">Early in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, if you ride toward the legacy dungeon of Belurat, you encounter two NPCs at the Main Gate Cross. One is Ansbach, a retired old warrior. And the other is Moore, a rotund and soft-spoken merchant knight, who will sell you useful consumables, as well as a note about unlocking sealed spiritsprings.</p>
<h3 id="qyolYH"><strong>Who is Moore in Shadow of the Erdtree?</strong></h3>
<p id="d14eKm">Moore is adorable, crouching over his little pot, and he tells you in a halting way that he likes finding things for the rest of Miquella’s followers. I immediately fell in utter love with him. We have so much in common: I also love things, and finding things. And he’s so cute and round. Wow, a beacon of light and hope in the darkness of the shadow realm!</p>
<p id="FXcGH9">You can ask Ansbach what Moore’s deal is, and he’ll warn you that Moore has been working with the forager brood, and not to harm the brood if you come across them.</p>
<p id="W6r7jB">What this dialogue doesn’t spell out for you, which I will, is that the forager brood are the Kindred of Rot, centipede-like creatures that you might recognize from the base <em>Elden Ring</em> game as <em>really obnoxious enemies that shoot strings at you.</em></p>
<p id="9PghqE">You see where this is going.</p>
<h3 id="z4PDf6"><strong>Why does Moore fight you?</strong></h3>
<p id="U4iRUr">It was late at night. I was tired, on autopilot, and I saw a Kindred of Rot just lying on the ground outside the Church of the Crusade, and I thought, <em>What the hey!</em> and gave him a whack with my sword. The poor guy died, and immediately I was invaded by Moore. He told me to stop hurting forager brood. Before I knew it, we were dueling to the death.</p>
<p id="mjV3xu">Moore is a beefy but honestly pretty tame enemy. He throws big pots that inflict scarlet rot, but they’re easy to dodge. He also crouches behind his shield and rushes you. He’s got a lot of health but, well, I do a lot of damage. I traveled back to the Main Gate Cross after killing him, hoping that it was all just a bad dream, and found his bell bearing in the place he used to sit.</p>
<p id="YVe5mA">I’m devastated!</p>

<p id="aW7lor">Based on a quick poll of my colleagues who are also playing the DLC, we’re not sure if killing this specific Kindred is the only trigger for turning Moore hostile. I heard from some colleagues that they had killed the Kindred and not been invaded — so it’s possible that triggering Moore’s invasion is more complex than smashing one bug. Only time will tell.</p>
<h3 id="F9GRvY"><strong>Why you shouldn’t kill the Kindred of Rot</strong></h3>
<p id="19UXVH">But there’s no point in killing the Kindred of Rot anyway! If you see one in the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC, know that they’re apparently friendly and you can talk to them and they’ll give you foraged items. In fact, healing the Kindred at the Church of the Crusade will give you a Forager Brood cookbook that isn’t available anywhere else in the game.</p>
<p id="GMDaGv">More importantly, you won’t have to kill sweet, round baby boy Moore, and get his really good verdigris armor. (But at what cost?!?!?!)</p>
<h3 id="siWY5l"><strong>What if I’m a sicko and want to kill Moore?</strong></h3>
<p id="AHUGCC">If you are indeed a sick bastard and want Moore dead for whatever reason, make sure you do it after meeting Thiollier at the Pillar Path Cross Grace. Speaking to Moore after meeting Thiollier will give you the option to get Black Syrup from Moore. Giving this to Thiollier will unlock Thiollier’s Concoction, a critical and powerful poison that you can use later in the game.</p>
<p id="8MfiqS">After this, I guess you’re free to kill Moore if you want. But please, let my baby boy live!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Steam has just introduced a new feature for players called Game Recording. Though still in the beta-testing phase, Game Recording is exactly what it sounds like: a built-in feature that allows users to record and share gameplay footage.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can use Game Recording to record a quick clip of a particularly impressive 360° no-scope kill in a live-service game, record an entire RPG campaign playthrough, and everything in between. Clips can then be edited as needed (for instance, cutting out all the shots you missed prior to an impressive headshot) and then uploaded for the world to see.</p><p dir="ltr">Game Recording has two modes: Background Recording and On Demand Recording. In Background Recording mode, gameplay is continuously saved to the player's preferred drive (never exceeding the player's specified recording duration or storage limits). On Demand Recording mode can be used at-will, stopping and starting via manual input from the player. Steam's new Game Recording tool also allows players to use the Steam Timeline and Event Markers included in the mode to locate and mark high-intensity moments in the recording.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a Replay option, which can be used to get a better idea of how your character inexplicably died during a fight, or replay NPC dialogue you may have missed the first time around.</p><p dir="ltr">"In addition to being able to record any game you’re playing, timeline-enhanced games are games that can proactively notify Steam when relevant events happen," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/gamerecording" rel="nofollow">Steam's official Game Recording</a> webpage. "These events are represented along the timeline with details specified by developers."</p><p dir="ltr">Game Recording works with any and all games on Steam, and is also compatible with Steam Deck, allowing players to record and share clips from their Steam Deck to their PC or phone. Additionally, Game Recordings can be exported in .MP4 format for editing outside of Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">The new tool also has privacy settings, which allow players to select options that will prevent Game Recording from capturing footage of their desktop and other parts of the screen that aren't part of a game. According to steam, more features are coming to Game Recording, including "individualized game settings" which are reportedly "coming soon."</p>

The new controller is made by Hori, and it’s only coming to Japan (at least for now).</p><p>Dubbed the <a href="https://horistore.com/shop/g/gHPC-055/">Wireless Horipad for Steam</a>, the PC-centric controller matches the Steam Deck’s menu buttons and has similar touch sensors atop its sticks to activate gyro controls. It also supports Bluetooth wireless and USB-C wired connections as well as a whole bunch of custom programmability using Hori’s software. But while it shares a lot with the Steam Deck, it’s not a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022#:~:text=Valve%20wants%20a%20Steam%20Controller%202">Steam Controller 2</a> — it lacks rumble, a matching set of four back buttons, and the handheld’s signature trackpads.</p><p>The new controller is set to launch in Japan on October 31st in four colors (black, white, neon yellow, and violet), selling for 7,890 yen (about $50).</p><p>There’s no word yet if this new Steam controller is coming to the US or elsewhere, but the Wireless Horipad bears a striking resemblance to the <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/horipad-pro-designed-for-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one/">wired Horipad Pro</a> that’s currently available for Xbox consoles. I tested the Horipad Pro for our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s">Xbox controller buying guide</a> and found it to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s#:~:text=mentioned%20above%2C%20the-,Horipad%20Pro,-has%20one%20of">serviceable with fine ergonomics and a great D-pad</a> — though it was somewhat outclassed by other options that run cheaper. </p><p>However, the Wireless Horipad seems to have a whole lot more going on. For starters, it’s actually wireless, albeit limited to Bluetooth, which is usually less reliable than a USB wireless dongle. The Steam version also has four programmable buttons, although, unlike the Steam Deck, there are only two on the rear — the other two are on the front directly below the D-pad and on the right thumbstick.</p><div><p>It certainly looks familiar if you squint</p></div><p>While it seems long overdue for Valve to once again have a branded go-to gamepad for Steam and docked Steam Deck use, we’ll have to wait to see if or when it becomes more widely available. Hori’s decision to start sales in its home country makes sense, but it may also speak to the rise of PC gaming in Japan, with handhelds being such a popular choice there that Valve spun up a partnership with an entirely different company for <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/">Steam Deck distribution</a> (including <a href="https://boilingsteam.com/steam-deck-launches-in-stores-in-japan-full-coverage/index.html">in-store availability</a>). </p><p>In general, gamepad usage in Steam is on the rise — as Valve’s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4142827237888316812">just-released statistics</a> show. Those numbers also come with a summary of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4142827237888316812#:~:text=Here%20are%20some%20of%20the%20new%20features%20we%E2%80%99ve%20shipped%20for%20Steam%20Input%20and%20controller%20users%20recently%3A">new controller optimizations</a> Valve has recently implemented in Steam. Perhaps this is setting the table for a wide swath of licensed Steam controllers from a variety of manufacturers like we see on Xbox consoles — with more wireless options, I hope. One thing I know is I’m now dying to try this Wireless Horipad.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186512/past-lives-overwatch-zenyatta-screenplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="lz4i87"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23767663/the-sims-4-past-lives-celine-song-the-seagull-interview"><em>Past Lives</em></a> was one of my <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23597815/best-movies-2023">favorite movies of 2023</a>. It’s a heartfelt, funny romantic drama; a nuanced depiction of grown-up love; and a remarkable first feature from writer-director Celine Song, a playwright and dedicated gamer. Before <em>Past Lives, </em>Song previously staged a production of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/29/21540644/sims-4-chekhov-the-seagull-new-york-theatre-workshop">Anton Chekhov’s classic play <em>The Seagull</em> within a Sims game</a> and <a href="https://www.lecinemaclub.com/journal/qa-with-celine-song/">regularly plays <em>Valorant, Overwatch</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Fortnite</em></a>.</p>
<p id="qyiSQR">Turns out <em>The Sims</em> isn’t the only video game franchise present in Song’s work: <em>Overwatch </em>makes a brief appearance in <em>Past Lives. </em>The level of detail in the script caught me by surprise. After meeting up with her childhood sweetheart Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) for the first time in years, Nora (Greta Lee) returns home to find her husband Arthur (John Magaro) playing <em>Overwatch</em>. <em>Overwatch </em>isn’t terribly relevant to the scene – it’s just the activity he’s doing when she comes home, but <a href="https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Past-Lives-Read-The-Screenplay.pdf">the Oscar-nominated script</a> is quite specific about who he’s playing and what happens in his game.</p>

<p id="ENYhn5">The <em>Past Lives </em>script specifies Arthur plays <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/13/8601353/overwatch-gameplay-video-zenyatta">Zenyatta</a>, and even adds some information about who Zenyatta is and what he’s all about. It’s also a great character detail for Arthur, a sweet man who absolutely would play a support character in a team game, and is relatively understanding about the love of his life’s childhood sweetheart suddenly entering the picture. </p>
<p id="PAfuEN">A character’s choice of who they play in a game like <em>Overwatch </em>is an under-tapped mine of personality-building in fiction. There’s also a bit of comedy in here: “DEFEAT” showing up in all-caps immediately after Nora reveals Hae Sung did indeed come to New York to see her is great stuff. (And as a coworker joked: “This is why no one wants to play support. There’s always the concern that your wife is gonna leave you.”)</p>
<p id="4ccCKw">Song’s next project is the rom-com <em>Materialists</em>, starring Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal. Like <em>Past Lives </em>(and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24127886/challengers-review-zendaya-luca-guadagnino"><em>Challengers</em></a>, written by her husband, Justin Kuritzkes), it reportedly focuses on a love triangle. But I know what I’m most focused on: which video game will get an unexpected mention. </p>

  <p id="NGFY2l">Assassin’s Creed is the latest <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23925728/magic-the-gathering-marvel-crossover">Universes Beyond</a> expansion for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and will be popping out of an unsuspecting haystack near you starting on July 5. The new set features a total of 100 mechanically unique cards inspired by the stealthy, stabby franchise. </p>
<p id="ZmArMx">While these new cards won’t include characters or settings from the recently announced <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, you can expect appearances from virtually every other corner of the Assassin’s Creed universe, including Altair, Ezio, Eivor, and more. If you’d like to add any of these new cards to your existing collection, the new expansion is available to pre-order in a variety of formats from Amazon and GameStop, which we’ve linked out to below, along with a list of their contents.</p>

Here’s the content creator <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/dansgaming&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/dansgaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DansGaming</a></span> bumping into an “NPC making some very weird sounds” that turns out to be none other than Igon, a drake warrior on his final mission.</p><p>When you chance upon Igon, he’s been beaten down and scarred. He can’t really use his arms, and it seems like his legs have failed him too. For all intents and purposes, Igon is dragging himself across the Land of Shadow to kill Bayle the Dread, a traitorous dragon who wounded Placidusax—a name you might remember as the crazy dragon boss you fought in Farum Azula in <em>Elden Ring</em>—and struck Igon with a crippling fear that’s kept him from partaking in Dragon Communion, which gave his life worth.<br></p><p>Talking to him in this state provides a lot of anguished cries and repeated calls for “vile Bayle,” and kicks off a quest line following Igon’s journey. When he’s not growling every other line he utters, he’s deeply wounded and scared of Bayle, who’s inflicted a horror on Igon that literally still haunts him, and the way that voice actor Richard Lintern zips between these extremes is nothing short of impressive. He comes across like two distinct characters rather than dimensions of the same man, and people are already hailing Lintern’s full-throated performance as Igon.</p><p>Following up with Igon provides ample opportunity to continue hearing his rantings and ravings, but before long, he realizes that his body’s failing him, and he won’t physically make it to Bayle. At this point, he does the craziest thing yet and <em>gives </em>you his finger in order to summon his spirit to fuck Bayle up when you eventually get to the boss fight. And then the boss fight happens and Igon reaches hater levels previously thought unattainable.<br></p><p>The moment you summon him, Igon immediately shouts “Curse you, Bayle,” and launches into the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Bri4nF/status/1805475033998852302&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Bri4nF/status/1805475033998852302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mother of all tirades</a></span>.

Considering that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>’s author George R.R Martin worked on the lore of <em>Elden Ring</em>, it probably shouldn’t come as a surprise that both names take inspiration from his main body of work. Bayle is a reference to a literal dread dragon named Balerion in <em>ASOIAF</em>, who’s ridden by the phonetically similar Aegon Targaryen. And so it all comes full circle. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-secret-identity-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Secret identity board games, or social deduction games, are incredibly popular among casual and hardcore audiences, and it isn’t hard to see why. Perhaps it is the thrill of lying to your friends' faces and knowing that everything will still be okay between you when the game ends, or maybe it’s the excitement of learning that the quiet one in your group secretly harbors an excellent poker face. Either way, these titles often make for some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups"><u>best party games</u></a>, thanks to the memories they frequently create.</p><p>Most already know about genre staples like Mafia and Werewolf, but the category is incredibly deep, with diverse games for various audiences. The secret identity genre features longer epic experiences as well as quick playthroughs – games for large groups and titles for just two players. Regardless of skill level and general interest in the hobby, no matter what you’re in the mood for, social deduction games are a surefire hit to break out at your next get-together.</p><h3>TL;DR The Best Secret Identity Board Games</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#blood">Blood on the Clocktower</a></li><li><a href="#deception">Deception: Murder in Hong Kong</a></li><li><a href="#res">The Resistance: Avalon</a></li><li><a href="#night">One Night Ultimate Werewolf</a></li><li><a href="#fake">A Fake Artist Goes to New York</a></li><li><a href="#spy">Spyfall 2</a></li><li><a href="#inhuman">Inhuman Conditions</a></li><li><a href="#feed">Feed the Kraken</a></li></ul><h2 id="blood">Blood on the Clocktower</h2><div id="202425" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Blood on the Clocktower</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 15+</li><li>Player: 6-21</li><li>Play Time: 30-120 mins</li></ul><p>While Blood on the Clocktower isn’t quite as accessible as some other titles on this list, its additional rules aren’t simply bloat, either. Instead, Blood on the Clocktower adds new wrinkles that often solve problems some players have with other games in the genre. It requires a larger group and a bit more time than some other recommendations in the space, but if you can find the time and the players, Blood on the Clocktower is easily one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games"><u>best board games</u></a> money can buy.</p><p>The core mechanics of Blood on the Clocktower play out in a manner that those familiar with the genre will immediately grasp: players each receive a secret role with accompanying abilities, the demon kills another player during the nighttime phase when players’ eyes are closed, and during the daytime phase the townsfolk get together to try and deduce who the villains are and ultimately sentence someone to death. The goal of the good team is to execute the demon, and the goal of the evil team is to survive until the end. However, things get truly interesting when Blood on the Clocktower deviates from classic secret identity games like Mafia and Werewolf.</p><p>One notable difference is that executed players remain in the game. They lose their various abilities, but they can still contribute to the deduction and even retain one final vote on who to put to death. Additionally, players can share their secret identities, but this is a double-edged sword as it will also give the demon valuable information. It’s also challenging to know who to trust because the demon gets to see three different unused identities at the beginning of the game, meaning they can pretend to be one of these characters. Blood on the Clocktower is one of those games that your group will have just as much fun discussing afterward as they did actually playing it.</p><h2 id="deception">Deception: Murder in Hong Kong</h2><div id="202426" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Deception: Murder in Hong Kong</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 14+</li><li>Player: 4-12</li><li>Play Time: 20 mins</li></ul><p>Players take on the roles of investigators hoping to solve the titular murder in Hong Kong. However, one of the investigators is secretly the murderer. As a twist, one player knows the killer's identity but cannot say it. Instead, they are only allowed to give clues concerning aspects of the crime, such as the cause of death or location. In front of each player are cards with potential murder weapons and clues, leaving the investigators to solve the rest. There is still enough ambiguity within the cards that players are left to discuss who they believe the culprit is, resulting in some classic moments of deduction and a mountain of lies. In a sense, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong plays out as a hidden identity version of Clue, making the stakes feel much more personal as a result.</p><h2 id="res">The Resistance: Avalon</h2><div id="162037" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Resistance: Avalon</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 13+</li><li>Player: 5-10</li><li>Play Time: 30 mins</li></ul><p>The Resistance: Avalon is a team-based social deduction game set against the backdrop of Arthurian legend. It’s a classic good versus evil showdown but with hidden identities. Players work to get elected to positions of power to advance their team’s goals, but they attempt to do so without revealing their alliances. Only the player taking on the role of Merlin knows who is who, but disclosing this information risks losing their team the game, meaning there are layers upon layers of deception going on simultaneously. Fans of the Secret Hitler board game will recognize many of the rules and mechanics in The Resistance: Avalon, but the latter title is far less likely to offend anyone at your next get-together.</p><h2 id="night">One Night Ultimate Werewolf</h2><div id="162031" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Player: 3-10</li><li>Play Time: 10 mins</li></ul><p>One Night Ultimate Werewolf has cemented itself as one of the most accessible party games, thanks mainly to an excellent audio app that walks players through each phase. It’s so easy to pick up and play that One Night Ultimate Werewolf has become a favorite among nongamers as well as more serious hobbyists. This bluffing game offers players a single card, each with a different role. Some are villagers, some have special abilities, and some are the titular werewolves. For the most part, the villagers want to identify the werewolves, and the werewolves want to remain anonymous.</p><p>One Night Ultimate Werewolf has two phases: night and day. During the nighttime phase, players put their heads down as the app narrates them through various card-swapping, identification, and general trickery. In the day phase, players open their eyes and attempt to deduce what happened the night before. Following the thread of who had what card at what time can get quite confusing, helping to cloak the deceit in uncertainty.</p><h2 id="fake">A Fake Artist Goes to New York</h2><div id="202427" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Player: 5-10</li><li>Play Time: 20 mins</li></ul><p>A Fake Artist Goes to New York is a fun twist on deductive games and drawing-based titles like Pictionary. Players take turns collectively drawing a single picture one line at a time. The twist is that every player except for one knows what the final drawing is supposed to look like. The fake artist must guess what the image is supposed to be and add a line to the drawing when it is their turn, using only a vague category and the picture forming in front of them. After each player draws two lines, the group can guess who they believe the fake artist is. Identifying the phony artist may seem simple, but as many people are simply bad at drawing, it is more challenging to decipher who the trickster is than you might think.</p><h2 id="spy">Spyfall 2</h2><div id="202428" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Spyfall 2</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 13+</li><li>Player: 3-12</li><li>Play Time: 15 mins</li></ul><p>Spyfall 2 is an ingeniously simple game where players try to deduce who the spy is with only a card and a location. Each player receives a single card, all of which, except for one (or two if you’re playing with multiple spies), has a location on it. The outlier card simply says the word “spy.” Players must discover who the spy is among them by asking questions about the listed location. The key is to pose questions and give answers that won’t reveal the setting so the spy doesn’t catch on. Unless you're the spy, then the goal is to bluff your way to victory. After just a few minutes, the group concludes the interrogation process and votes on who they think the spy is. Not only is the game fun and addictive, but it's also simply a joy to locate the cartoon spy lurking in the background in each card’s artwork.</p><h2 id="inhuman">Inhuman Conditions</h2><div id="202429" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Inhuman Conditions</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 12+</li><li>Player: 2</li><li>Play Time: 5 mins</li></ul><p>A true rarity in the secret identity space, Inhuman Conditions is a social deduction game for only two players. It’s not just the player count that makes Inhuman Conditions unique; it’s also that this Blade Runner-inspired bluffing game is centered around a five-minute conversation. In each game, there is one investigator and one suspect. The investigator's goal is to identify whether the suspect is a human or a robot, and the suspect's goal is to pass as a human. However, this is easier said than done, as robots are given specific prompts to follow. The trick is to naturally work these prompts into the conversation, which can quickly become tricky when every word you say is being analyzed by the other player. As Inhuman Conditions’ writing can be a bit wacky, it is best suited for two players who can embrace its sillier role-playing elements.</p><h2 id="feed">Feed the Kraken: Deluxe Edition</h2><div id="202430" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Feed the Kraken</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 12+</li><li>Player: 5-11</li><li>Play Time: 45-90 mins</li></ul><p>While most social deduction games omit the board altogether, Feed the Kraken: Deluxe Edition brings players to the figurative and literal table surrounding a beautifully constructed board and stunning minis. Players in Feed the Kraken are split between three secret roles: sailors, pirates, and cultists. The players’ goal is to simply move the ship from one side of the board to the other, but each team is secretly working to navigate toward a different game-ending location. Each game starts with one player selected as the captain, and that player chooses their lieutenant and navigator. This trio ultimately decides the direction the ship will head for that turn, but opportunities for mutiny ensure fate isn’t always left in their hands.</p><p>Along the way, the ship might move to spaces with icons that enable the captain to perform various tasks, such as seeing another player’s role or even keeping someone from talking for the rest of the game. If the ship reaches a Kraken tile, the captain will fulfill the title by feeding the sea beast a crew member. However, feeding the cult leader to the Kraken will result in victory for the cultist team, so players should tread carefully.</p><p>If you’re looking for more great titles to play with larger groups, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games"><u>best six-player board games</u></a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players"><u>best four-player board games</u></a>.</p><p><em>Bobby Anhalt is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering board games and LEGOs.

                <p>Actor Hayden Christensen, who is best known for playing Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader in the Star Wars series, has revealed his favorite video games. Speaking to Wired, Christensen said he doesn't play as much these days, but has fond memories of a few franchises in particular.</p><p>"I used to play a lot of video games. Not so much any more, ever since I became a dad. I was big into Call of Duty, Halo, and then FIFA. FIFA was kind of my go-to. Manchester United was the team I usually played with."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-364q3clqn0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="183">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-364q3clqn0?start=183" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Christensen has one child, a daughter, whom he co-parents with his former partner, the actress Rachel Bilson. Christensen became a father in 2014, so people are theorizing what specific Halo and Call of Duty games he might have been playing before he became a father. We don't know for sure, but fans are having fun <a href="https://x.com/HiddenXperia/status/1806012436090167617" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">joking that they might have been matched up with Christensen in Halo 3 back in the day.</a></p><p>The Star Wars prequels featuring Christensen were not received very positively when they were released in the early 2000s, but Christensen and others have said fans have come around more to them in recent times. Christensen came back to play Darth Vader again in 2023's Ob-Wan Kenobi TV series and 2023's Ahsoka show.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186503/super-monkey-ball-hack-gaming-controller-tom-tilley<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamers could get an edge in Sega’s<em> Super Monkey Ball </em>with the help of a unique DIY controller: a <a href="https://x.com/DrTomTilley/status/1805790393927450683">literal monkey in a ball</a> that can be physically rolled around instead of mashing a joystick on a gamepad.</p><p><em>Super Monkey Ball</em> requires players to tilt and roll a series of complex floating platforms to control the monkey’s movements, so Sega designed the original arcade versions of the game with an oversize trackball controller.</p><p>That wasn’t carried over to the console versions of the game, and since arcade machines typically cost thousands of dollars, developer <a href="https://tomtilley.net/">Tom Tilley</a> decided to design and build a much cheaper solution made from recycled and 3D-printed materials. “I am a software developer, but I worked for about eight years as a fax and cellular phone technician in the late 80’s, so I have some small amount of electronics knowledge that comes in handy with this sort of thing,” Tilley told <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Tilley, now a software developer in Australia, spent almost 10 years lecturing at a university while living in Thailand, where they also ran a class that challenged students to come up with unique alternatives to game controllers.</p><p>It was there that the idea for a giant trackball made from random recycled parts, an optical mouse, and a basketball, came to fruition. A base made from cardboard holds the basketball in place and allows it to freely roll in all directions with the help of three salvaged roll-on deodorant containers that serve as plastic bearings. Beneath the ball sits an inverted optical mouse upgraded with another deodorant bearing that rolls whenever the ball does, making it easier for the mouse’s sensor to detect its movements.</p><p>The original version of the trackball was built to play a 1986 Japanese arcade game called <em>Armadillo Racing</em>, but it has since been modified by Tilley to play other games, including <a href="https://x.com/DrTomTilley/status/1613846131175469057"><em>Katamari Damacy,</em> with a soccer ball</a>. Using it to play the Nintendo GameCube version of <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> through emulation required an additional modification, Tilley told <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>A 3D-printed recreation of the game’s main character, a monkey named AiAi, rides inside a transparent plastic sphere on a weighted wheeled base that keeps him upright at all times. It’s a charming upgrade, but the clear plastic created a new problem. The sphere’s smooth finish didn’t offer enough friction to move the deodorant roller on the mouse. To fix that, Tilley had to swap that part out for a small rubber ball rolling on metal bearings so the mouse’s optical sensor could detect AiAi’s movements.</p><p>To make the GameCube version of <em>Super Monkey Ball </em>work with a DIY trackball, Tilley uses a scripting tool called <a href="https://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/">FreePIE</a> (Programmable Input Emulator) that inverts the signals coming from the mouse and maps them to a virtual joystick that’s compatible with the emulator software.</p><p>The first new game in the <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> series in a decade releases on the Nintendo Switch this week. If Tilley can make the DIY trackball work with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/27/24142562/cant-wait-to-be-top-banana"><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em></a>, he just might dominate the game’s multiplayer mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> consultant and former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah has published a Youtube video addressing the question: "why do AAA games take so long?" It's a tidy 25 minutes or so, and gets a fair way into the weeds of a variety of topics, from the current enthusiasm for live service "forever games" over 'finite', narrative-led affairs, to the "misleading" announcement of highly-demanded sequels years before they enter full production, in order to pump up a publisher's brand during a dry spell.</p>
<p>One thing I wanted to fish out and drop on your plate is Darrah's discussion of what he terms "the fidelity death cult" - that is, the desire for ever greater levels of lifelike visual detail and "intricacy".</p><!--more-->

<p>"We are also in a period of something I've called the fidelity death cult,"  Darrah explains in the vid, around the eight minute mark, "where a lot of games are trying for hyper-realistic art styles, hyper-high fidelity, hyper-customisation, hyper-intricacy. These things, while they don't contribute to a larger size, while they don't help you make a forever game, they still take a lot more time. When you are concerned about the way people's hair moves on their back, that's going to take time that you in the past wouldn't have done. You would have just spray-painted their hairdo on, or given them a hair cap, or something pretty static. Now, you're introducing new avenues of complexity."</p>
<p>He extends the point to encompass player dislike of things in games they consider to have been "recycled", from chunks of recurring environment to animation systems. "Similarly, we currently see from players quite a bit of pushback on the reuse of systems and assets, so even though I might be making a sequel to a game that came out just a couple of years ago, I might feel within the dev team that we can't reuse any of our assets, because we're going to get pushback from the players. And so while I might have been able to reuse some of those animations, or some of those models, or some of those areas, I might feel the need to recreate them to avoid that backlash. So I'm introducing additional time into the development process that otherwise would have allowed the game to come out sooner."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Darrah notes that while the emphasis on giving players endless things to do, access and consume in "forever games" reflects audience research showing that this makes the game more enticing, the "fidelity death cult" and avoidance of asset reuse comes "more from a fear of backlash, as opposed to any more specific research that says that this is necessary". He suggests that prioritising original asset creation and fidelity is "a trap that dev teams are kind of laying upon themselves", pointing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> as the "perfect example" of a game that has gotten away with downplaying "minor visual fidelity things that at the end of the day, often don't matter that much".</p>
<p>That the creed of ever-quantifiably-higher fidelity sponges up a lot of time and energy without really adding anything to games is a familiar argument, but always worth repeating. To slide into a bit of journalist navel-gazing, I'll add that games that valorise fidelity for its own sake can be boring to write about, albeit partly because enthusiast readerships tend to want us to write about them in a certain way.</p>
<p>The associated traditions of realism and photorealism are, in themselves, complex, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/photorealism-is-crucial">exciting</a> and evolving, but within video game culture, those traditions are typically boiled down to numbers and buzzwords - higher polygon counts, more animated objects per scene, more lens flare per NPC tear, with a corresponding need for more potent, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/examining-the-game-industrys-hidden-impacts-on-climate-change/">dirtier</a> pieces of hardware to run games on. Mind you, if there's a preference for interpreting realism and photorealism this way, that reflects the audience tastes that both "AAA" developers and journalists have cultivated for themselves over the decades, by consenting to the whim of the marketing machine. I've written my share of articles about higher resolutions and posh new species of shader. One thing I'd like to ask Darrah is: how exactly should blockbuster game developers unravel the "fidelity death cult"? How should they persuade more tech-devoted players to get over the sight of some sprayed-on hair?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186644/dead-rising-remaster-capcom-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9ZEfZk">Capcom is giving the original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/1/5/14178650/dead-rising-dead-rising-2-off-the-record-guide-strategy"><em>Dead Rising</em></a> a new remaster, the publisher announced Wednesday in a surprise teaser trailer for <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> — or <em>DR DR</em>. The remastered version of <em>Dead Rising</em> will be available for “the newest generation of platforms,” according to the trailer, likely meaning PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.</p>
<p id="Nc0n0y">Details on <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> are scant, but the remastered game will launch sometime this year, Capcom says in the trailer. The teaser promises an “updated release with a brand-new look.” Indeed, freelance photojournalist Frank West looks completely remodeled — and sounds like he’s sporting a new voice actor. The town of Willamette, Colorado looks much crisper, more detailed, and more overridden with zombies.</p>
<p id="wet5lh"><em>Dead Rising</em>, like the original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/19/7550887/resident-evil-hd-remaster-review-pc-xbox-one-ps4-playstation-4-360-3"><em>Resident Evil</em></a>, draws inspiration from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23784627/best-zombie-movie-george-romero-day-of-the-dead">George A. Romero’s zombie films</a>, specifically <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>. As Frank West, players spend three in-game days in the zombie-infested Willamette Parkview Mall, using anything and everything one can find in a shopping mall as a weapon to survive. As Frank investigates the outbreak and snaps photos, he comes to the aid other survivors, helping them escape while fending off hordes of undead and evil humans known as psychopaths.</p>
<p id="U1Y8C5">Created by longtime Mega Man creatives Keiji Inafune and Yoshinori Kawano, <em>Dead Rising</em> was lauded for its unique, real-time gameplay structure and campy combat scenarios. Frank could dispatch the zombie masses with a gun or chainsaw, or battle while riding on a skateboard or wearing a full Mega Man battle suit. Or he could beat zombies into submission with a flaming-hot frying pan from the food court while sporting a Servbot head as a helmet.</p>
<p id="PEKaym">The original <em>Dead Rising</em> was released for Xbox 360 in 2006. An HD re-release followed in 2016, for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. Capcom released three mainline sequels to <em>Dead Rising</em>, but we haven’t seen a new entry in the franchise since 2016’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/5/13797380/dead-rising-4-review-xbox-one-pc"><em>Dead Rising 4</em></a>, which also starred Frank West. The studio behind the Dead Rising franchise, Capcom Vancouver, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/19/17878380/capcom-vancouver-dead-rising-studio-closed">shut down in 2018</a>.</p>

One of these is Dagda, and… look, I didn’t play <em>Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse</em>, so I’m not going to pretend I can give a lesson on Dagda’s backstory. However, I’ve read enough comments that end with his catchphrase “kid” to get the picture. While Dagda does return in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, he’s locked behind the new Holy Will and Profane Dissent DLC. Let’s break it down.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Holy Will and Profane Dissent is a level 75 quest in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em></strong>. However, you don’t <em>have </em>to be level 75 to complete it, as you’ll meet the raw unlock conditions for the quest fairly early in your adventure. As long as you’re strong enough to defeat Dagda, your level is irrelevant. Much like the other quest you can purchase as DLC, Holy Will and the Profane Dissent adds 15 minutes of gameplay <em>at most</em>. The main reason you’d want to drop $5 for this is to use Dagda, who will join your party once the quest is cleared.<br></p><p>If you’ve purchased the Holy Will and Profane Dissent DLC, or you own the Digital Deluxe edition of the game, here’s how to access this extra boss fight.<br></p><h2 id="h127646"><a id=""></a>How to unlock the Holy Will and Profane Dissent quest in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</h2><p><strong>The unlock conditions for Holy Will and Profane Dissent are identical to </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-5-sakura-cinders-of-the-east-1851561744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-5-sakura-cinders-of-the-east-1851561744"><strong>Sakura Cinders of the East</strong></a></span>. In fact, if you’re purchased the two packs together, this quest is probably already in your quest list. However, in case you’re the world’s biggest Dagda fan and you purchased this pack a la carte, we can start from the beginning.</p><p>To begin the quest, you’ll have to return to the <strong>Tokyo Diet Building</strong>. If you haven’t gotten to the Tokyo Diet Building yet, then you’re <em>definitely </em>too low level to be doing this quest. Just keep playing and you’ll get there sooner than later.<br></p><p>Once you return to the Tokyo Diet Building, go through the exit on the south side of the Terminal Room. In the next room, keep running down the hallway and go down the staircase. Talk to the Head Researcher, and select the “Offer assistance” option. As long as the Holy Will and Profane Dissent DLC is registered to your account, the Head Researcher should point you towards a Researcher in the same area who will give you the titular quest.<br></p><p>After this, the quest directions become self-explanatory. Follow your quest marker back to the Shiba region in Minato, and ride the Magatsu Rail to where the demon Danu is. Long story short, Dagda did some dimensional hopping to come to this world, and he plans to become a god unshackled by responsibilities like taking care of humans. Danu doesn’t like that too much, and it’s your job to confront Dagda about it.<br></p><p>Follow the new quest marker to the north side of Minato, and you’ll find Dagda there. <strong>Approaching Dagda will begin the boss encounter against him, so make sure to save and finish your battle preparations first</strong>. Also, make sure you have an open slot in your party.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="dc5e51e853180a99960a5f19d30f5f43" data-recommend-id="image://dc5e51e853180a99960a5f19d30f5f43" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the Dagda fight.

That said, for as strong as Dagda is, it’s possible to clear him far below the recommended level 75. For example, if you’ve long since min-maxed all the challenge out of <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>on the Normal difficulty, and you only feel alive when solving turn-based battles above your level, you can easily clear Dagda before you hit level 60. </p><p>I, of course, don’t know anything about this. Don’t look at the screenshots.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="241a23446f60597d34ed5387743f1b33" data-recommend-id="image://241a23446f60597d34ed5387743f1b33" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagda's moveset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dagda's moveset." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="241a23446f60597d34ed5387743f1b33" data-recommend-id="image://241a23446f60597d34ed5387743f1b33" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagda's moveset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first glance, Dagda’s moveset looks <em>very </em>scary. <strong>Not only can he use physical attacks, he can exploit weaknesses to Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Force</strong>. <strong>Luster Candy </strong>and <strong>Debilitate </strong>also allow him to buff and debuff stats respectively. Even scarier is the <strong>Magic Harp </strong>passive ability, which effectively enables his <strong>Lost Hit </strong>and <strong>Power Punch </strong>attacks to sleep or instantly KO any party member if he’s charged Magatsuhi (and Lost Hit <em>already </em>has a chance to instantly KO). </p><p>That said, Dagda is very easy to exploit. <strong>His AI heavily biases him towards using Lost Hit and Power Punch</strong>, presumably because they inflict much more base damage than the elemental attacks. Because of this, <strong>the Phys Block spell and Phys Dampener items massively counter Dagda</strong>. His turn will get cut short whenever you nullify his attacks, potentially letting you go the entire battle without ever taking a single hit. That said, you should cover up weaknesses to the elements Dagda can target as a precaution.<br></p><p>To play it even safer, consider saving your own Magatsuhi skills for when Dagda charges <em>his </em>Magatsuhi. Holding abilities that remove a Press Turn icon from the enemy - such as <strong>Fountain of Chaos </strong>or <strong>Tides of Chaos</strong> - will completely prevent Dagda from landing a physical attack through a Phys Block barrier. This, in turn, will eliminate any chance of you getting defeated via an unlucky attack that activates Magic Harp.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="d03dbf82486d4be02a145493f3dd8158" data-recommend-id="image://d03dbf82486d4be02a145493f3dd8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the Dagda fight.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With the above strategy in mind, counter Dagda as you would any other major enemy in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>. Apply a suite of party buffs, keep Dagda’s stats debuffed, and <strong>exploit his weakness to Light attacks</strong>. Though he nullifies several elements, Physical attackers who can reliably land Critical Hits also excel in this fight.</p><figure id="" data-id="cf6706c298c5fc52312385fcd01dec74" data-recommend-id="image://cf6706c298c5fc52312385fcd01dec74" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice you face after the Dagda fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The choice you face after the Dagda fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf6706c298c5fc52312385fcd01dec74" data-recommend-id="image://cf6706c298c5fc52312385fcd01dec74" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice you face after the Dagda fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h127648"><a id=""></a>What happens if you finish off Dagda or stow your weapon?</h2><p>After the battle resolves, Danu will appear and celebrate your victory. After an exchange of words, you’ll be given the choice to either <strong>finish him off</strong> or <strong>stow your weapon</strong>. <strong>There are differences between the two choices, but the end result will remain the same</strong>.</p><p>If you <strong>finish him off</strong>, the Nahobino will deliver a killing blow to Dagda. Danu will approve of your choice, and you’ll find an <strong>Oak Staff </strong>on the ground. After you turn in the quest to the researcher in the Tokyo Diet Building, you’ll be told that the Oak Staff can be studied. The item will be removed from your inventory, but by talking to the Head Researcher afterwards, you’ll see a new menu option. Select this, choose to summon Dagda, and the fearsome foe will instantly join your party. You’ll also unlock the option to fuse him.<br></p><p>If you <strong>stow your weapon</strong>, Danu will explain that if Dagda can run free in this world, then the world will also reject her. Accordingly, Danu will leave, and Dagda will acknowledge that you’ve caught his interest. As a result, he’ll join your party on the spot, and the option to fuse him will appear as well.<br></p><p>In other words, <strong>Dagda can join your party regardless of which option you choose</strong>. The mechanics of how it will happen just differ between the two options. <strong>It’s unclear if this choice affects your alignment, so take that into consideration</strong>. If it does, “Finish him off” is presumably the Law-aligned choice, whereas “Stow your weapon” would be the Chaos-aligned choice.</p><h2 id="h127649"><a id=""></a>Dagda’s stats and abilities</h2><p>Unlike his in-battle counterpart, Dagda’s default moveset features no elemental coverage. Fortunately, that doesn’t matter in the face of Dagda’s sheer power. <strong>Lost Hit </strong>is his unique move, which inflicts severe Physical damage <em>and </em>has a chance to instakill foes. <strong>Hades Blast</strong> inflicts heavy damage to the enemy party, and <strong>Freikugel</strong> deals severe Strength-based Almighty damage with a high critical hit rate. This alone ensures Dagda won’t be stopped by an enemy with Physical resistance or immunity.</p><p>The <strong>Magic Harp </strong>passive ability works exactly as it did in the boss encounter, letting you potentially instakill common foes or put an enemy to sleep if an Omagatoki effect is active. <strong>High Phys Pleroma </strong>boosts his physical damage even further, and <strong>Null Phys</strong> combines with Dagda’s resistances to form a powerful wall of immunities. Luster Candy is a great party buff move, assuming you aren’t using the likes of Idun or Konohana Sakuya to fill that void.<br></p><p>Considering that it’s possible to grab him several hours before you’re intended to by cheesing his boss fight, Dagda offers a frankly insane power boost to your team.That’s good news if <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>is giving you trouble. The bad news is that he might make your team building less exciting when he clearly outperforms so many damage dealers. So whether he’s worth the $5 or not is ultimately up to you.<br></p><p>Personally, I can’t believe Atlus would paywall quality dialogue such as this:<br></p><figure id="" data-id="674480b2c8b7889e88062a69bf833108" data-recommend-id="image://674480b2c8b7889e88062a69bf833108" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A line from Dagda that reads, &quot;can't go calling youa kid.

        <p>The former Rockstar boss explains his plan for Absurd Ventures</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Former Rockstar Games head writer and co-founder Dan Houser says that the economics behind a Grand Theft Auto movie "never made sense."</p>
<p>Speaking in a <a href="https://theankler.com/p/dan-houser-absurd-ventures-hollywood-videogames">wide-ranging interview with The Ankler </a>(subscription required), the former Rockstar leader discussed the state of Hollywood and his new company's efforts to develop new IP that could eventually turn into blockbuster movies and games.</p>
<p>Houser <a href="https://theankler.com/p/dan-houser-absurd-ventures-hollywood-videogames">told the publication</a> that there were numerous conversations about turning Rockstar's games, such as GTA and Red Dead Redemption, into a movie.</p>
<p>He said: “After a few awkward dates, we’d ask [the executives], why would we do this?”</p>
<p>And those execs would reply that it would be an opportunity to make a movie, which Houser would respond with: "no, what you've described is you making a movie and us having no control and taking a huge risk that we’re going to end up paying for with something that belongs to us.</p>
<p>“They thought we’d be blinded by the lights and that just wasn't the case. We had what we considered to be multi-billion-dollar IP, and the economics never made sense. The risk never made sense. In those days, the perception was that games made poor-quality movies.”</p>
<p>However, Houser said "it's a different time now", which has led to the formation of Absurd Ventures.</p>
<p>The idea of Absurd Ventures, which also includes former Rockstar leaders Lazlow Jones and Mike Unsworth, is to build potentially major franchises via cheaper formats, such as audiobooks and graphic novels.</p>
<p>The firm's first project is the 12-part audio project A Better Paradise, which kicked off earlier this month and stars the likes of Andrew Lincoln and Paterson Joseph. Its second project is called American Caper, which will begin as a crime and political graphic novel. A third project will be 'lighter and more comedic', but little else was shared.</p>
<p>“If one of [these projects] just stops at the graphic novel or audiobook point, but it's still good and made with integrity, that's fine,” he said. “The end goal is always, always to make cool shit, make the next thing as good as it can be. It's only worth doing each bit if it doesn't feel like marketing.”</p>
<p>Of course, the view is that some of these will eventually lead into a video game project that can cross between interactive and linear entertainment.</p>
<p>"Part of why we’re doing the company this way is our belief that [gaming and traditional entertainment] are going to continue to meld and cross-pollinate,” he said. “The question is, can our business model and theirs collaborate?"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/26/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced-with-teaser-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dead_rising_triple_pack/b/playstation4/archive/2016/08/09/dead-rising-re-releases-confirmed-for-september-launch.aspx">the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017</a>. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches.&nbsp;</p>
