Some 13 years later, following numerous delays and botched half-launches, the game has finally arrived on Steam. And oh no, it’s so bad. But before we confront its awfulness, let’s take stock of how we got here.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194416" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch’s Sombra On Her New Film And Its Video Game Connections" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="408" data-playlist="194416,197298,197284" data-current="194416"><div><p>Overwatch’s Sombra On Her New Film And Its Video Game Connections</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194416/194416_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194416/194416_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194416/194416_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194416/194416_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19861.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Very old people will remember that in 1986, a game was released by Sierra Online called <em>Space Quest</em>. It was a low-fi parser-based graphic adventure, and it was really not very good. However, creators Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy (known, at their insistence, as The Two Guys from Andromeda) continued to make sequels, and eventually—I would argue especially with <em>Space Quest IV</em>—created something memorable and extremely funny. These games were spoofs of the science fiction boom of the time, in which you played space janitor and general loser Roger Wilco.</p><p>They were crude games in most senses of the word, but at this point the loveable loser hadn’t become the most overused trope in adventure gaming, and the series became known for its very funny ways to die, its incredibly convoluted spoofs, and the dulcet tones of narrator Gary Owens’ voice as he delivered withering one-liners for every thing you looked at, used, licked or combined. This eventually culminated in <em>Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in The Spinal Frontier</em>, released in 1995, just before Sierra’s first (and only good) iteration came to an end. <em>Space Quest VII: The Return to Roman Numerals</em> was in development when Vivendi bought Sierra and cancelled everything.</p><h2 id="h211679"><a id=""></a>The Kickstarter boom</h2><p>A few attempts were made over the years to revive the franchise, but none came to anything, although the games remained cultishly popular through frequent re-releases on PC. It also didn’t help that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-20-year-estrangement-of-the-two-guys-from-andromeda#close-modal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-20-year-estrangement-of-the-two-guys-from-andromeda#close-modal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crowe and Murphy hadn’t spoken to each other in 20 years</a></span>. And then, in 2012, the Kickstarter boom arrived. Tim Schafer’s fundraiser for what was then called “Double Fine Adventure” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised over $3.3 million</a></span>, and every single person from the same era of classic point-and-clicks reappeared to try the same. The Guys from Andromeda managed to put their decades of hostility behind them for this gold rush, and riding the wave, secured over $500,000 from nearly 11,000 backers. It was close, the half-million target only being cleared at the eleventh hour, but they’d done it. This was June 2012, and the game was promised to be released in February 2013.</p><p>Keen chronologists will have noticed that 2013 was a very long time ago. Over the last 12 years, a huge number of delays, notes about family tragedies, and apologies have been issued, but nothing approaching a final game. I remember <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/much-delayed-two-guys-spaceventure-project-offers-cluck-yegger-minigame-to-backers&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/much-delayed-two-guys-spaceventure-project-offers-cluck-yegger-minigame-to-backers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing in 2015 about how long-delayed it had been</a></span>, and how frustrating this was for backers. At that point it was set to come out in November 2016. Come that month, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que/posts/1742324&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que/posts/1742324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another update went up</a></span> (the 112th by that point), explaining that it wasn’t ready, but “we are close, guys.” Narrator: they were not at all close.</p><h2 id="h211680"><a id=""></a>The endless delays begin</h2><figure id="" data-id="f6ed9382540b8129a5d3e8eae1b4a5c2" data-recommend-id="image://f6ed9382540b8129a5d3e8eae1b4a5c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1105" data-height="622" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An update page from Nov 2017, saying the game is almost done." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An update page from Nov 2017, saying the game is almost done." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kickstarter / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6ed9382540b8129a5d3e8eae1b4a5c2" data-recommend-id="image://f6ed9382540b8129a5d3e8eae1b4a5c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1105" data-height="622" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An update page from Nov 2017, saying the game is almost done." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every four or so months, another update would appear, almost all saying they were working on the “last scenes of the game.” During all this time, very sadly Gary Owens had died, notably years after the originally intended release date for the game. Two more years on, in April 2018 and after a six-month silence, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que/posts/2153918&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que/posts/2153918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was more of the same</a></span>. “We’re almost there!” The situation was endlessly farcical, with near-identical updates year after year, while the fanbase became angrier and angrier—some reasonably, some deeply unreasonably. From June 2019 to March 2020, there was nothing, and then the declaration that the game would be out in June.</p><p>Yes, like you already guessed, in June it was announced beta testing would begin in July. In August 2020, beta testing started. In February 2021 that was complete, the bugs were worked out, and release was imminent—they just had to fix their save/load system. Hold on to your hats, folks!</p><p>Yeah, in November 2021 they hadn’t managed to fix that save/load issue. Literally nine months and this Unity save system couldn’t be figured out. That update finished, “The next update WILL contain info about releasing the game.” Any day now!</p><p>It’s July 25, 2022. “Thank you all again for your patience,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que/posts/3565784&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que/posts/3565784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the next update began</a></span>, seemingly without irony. They were “very close to finishing.” The last eight months had been taken up with fixing bugs, despite their all having been fixed over a year earlier, and that darned save system! But, in August that year, they finally gave a proper release date. September 16, 2022.</p><p>However, for real, no jokes, no surprises, <em>SpaceVenture</em> was released to backers on that day. Ten years since the Kickstarter was funded, the game was in the hands of its supporters. They did it.</p><h2 id="h211681"><a id=""></a>They didn’t do it</h2><p>I was lying about no surprises. What was released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.timeextension.com/news/2022/09/10-years-later-space-quest-successor-spaceventure-emerges-from-development-hell&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2022/09/10-years-later-space-quest-successor-spaceventure-emerges-from-development-hell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was a broken, unplayable mess</a></span>, and obviously everyone was miserable. Astonishingly, it would be six months before the development trio would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que/posts/3771311&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que/posts/3771311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pipe up and acknowledge this</a></span> on the Kickstarter. At this point, former Sierra boss Ken Williams got in touch and offered to help with the project, and none of the people working on the game were getting paid. A fairly typical eight more months went by, when it was revealed they had spent the year trying to move the game to a new version of Unity.</p><p>This process stretched out yet again, the same six-to-eight months between updates, the same declarations that it was so very nearly almost ready, and then at the end of March 2025, it was announced that version 2 of the game was ready to launch on Steam! 13 years later, it was coming out to the public. In fucking Early Access.</p><p>Yup, as of the appositely chosen April 1 this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374960/SpaceVenture/?beta=0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374960/SpaceVenture/?beta=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can buy a copy of <em>SpaceVenture</em> for $15</a></span>. An unfinished version, with a promise to have it properly finished by this summer.

The game boots in fullscreen, but 1920x1080, and beyond alt-enter to put it into a window, there are no other options whatsoever. Pressing Esc while playing brings up a quit option that doesn’t take you back to the main menu, but the desktop. Admittedly, that’s a timesaver for everyone, but it doesn’t bode well. (Incredibly, when someone asked about this in the Steam discussions, the developers replied, “...it is something we are considering.”)</p><p>Even less impressive is the opening cutscene. Janky, atrociously lit, and barely textured, the shots of a space van docking at a space station appear like the sorts of blocky placeholders you’d put in at the start. It looks like the PC port of a 2002 PS2 game. We then cut to inside the airlock, where our defiantly unlikeable character, the gruff, taciturn Ace Hardway, again looks like a dreadful placeholder model, the rigging obviously unfinished, the animations haphazard and amateurish. I looked at a toolbox on the floor, and the very first description text in the game had a typo. Ho boy.</p><figure id="" data-id="bd7a3d930dd934710b3c4824767b96af" data-recommend-id="image://bd7a3d930dd934710b3c4824767b96af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ace stood next to an airlock, with what might be a cigarette hanging from his mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ace stood next to an airlock, with what might be a cigarette hanging from his mouth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Guys From Andromeda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bd7a3d930dd934710b3c4824767b96af" data-recommend-id="image://bd7a3d930dd934710b3c4824767b96af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ace stood next to an airlock, with what might be a cigarette hanging from his mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Moments later, I’m trying to walk down a corridor when a burst pipe blasts steam. I’m not going to repeat how bad everything looks throughout this, but know that everything looks <em>bad</em>, like 20 years ago bad. I walk through the steam, deliberately, as the game’s instructions encourage you to try to die for the gags, promising you’ll return alive immediately. Ace lies dead on the floor and I’m now playing as his robot dog/toolbox, Rooter. But when I “use” certain items, Ace’s lines of dialogue reply. Sigh. Also, why am I now playing as a toolbox? And why, now, out of nowhere, does a (decent) impersonation of <em>Space Quest</em>’s wonderful narrator, the late Gary Owens, pipe up at this point but not before? Why wasn’t there any narration during the opening, any explanation of who I was, why I was there?</p><p>So, it turns out, the tool-dog-thing has a cellphone in its possession? And that has an app on it that offers a defibrillator? And you revive Ace with that? Sure, OK.</p><p>You then make your way into a supply closet in an earlier location. You have to move some crates to do this, in a “puzzle” that involves dragging them to create a path. Except someone entirely forgot to implement the puzzle aspect, such that you just have to pull each crate in each direction, until you stumble upon the arbitrary direction in which it’s allowed to move, and then repeat that a few times. Get into the closet, and the stuff you need is blocked by…identical crates. But now you can’t move them, because that would be “manual labor.” What? The solution is to put Rooter on a shelf, such that he can crawl past the crates and then operate a forklift to move them. So you “use” Rooter to pick him up, and then click the resulting icon on the shelf, and…get an endless stream of “nope” messages. Because, of course <em>you idiot</em>, what you’re supposed to know to do is to “talk to” Rooter—who, by the way, you cannot even “look at”—which causes Ace to whistle, which causes Rooter to turn back into a toolbox, and then put <em>that</em> on the shelf. I feel so stupid!</p><p>Rooter can then interact with the forklift, which causes it to move forward and run over Ace, killing him. But no worries! We can just revive him with that defib app! Except, um, nope, you can’t, and this time the scene resets to when you entered the room and you have to start the whole fucking ordeal over again.</p><p>Let me stress, I have so far described <em>the first five minutes</em> of this godawful mess.</p><p>Ordinarily, I try to pick screenshots that are visually appealing when illustrating an article, and that’s obviously been tough here, but it’s important I also include what the game looks like most of the time. Like this extraordinary framing, complete with untextured model on the desk.</p><figure id="" data-id="fcabba2f19b2c231e82df62268ecfdd5" data-recommend-id="image://fcabba2f19b2c231e82df62268ecfdd5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hanger bay with the tiny character on the right side, in front of an untextured model." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hanger bay with the tiny character on the right side, in front of an untextured model." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Guys from Andromeda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fcabba2f19b2c231e82df62268ecfdd5" data-recommend-id="image://fcabba2f19b2c231e82df62268ecfdd5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hanger bay with the tiny character on the right side, in front of an untextured model." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Oh, and by the way, they never figured out that save bug! Saving to prevent unpredictable deaths doesn’t do anything, because when you reload, you start the scene over again anyway.</p><p>There’s no real point in continuing to list everything that’s wrong here. I’ve persisted on, and every single puzzle has been flawed, there’s no internal prompting about why you can’t just sodding well use an item in an obvious place, and most seriously of all, not one single line of dialogue has been faintly funny. I went into this ready to at least laugh. But it is worth noting what I believe is, aside from any of the technical issues, the game’s biggest, most damaging flaw: Ace Hardway.</p><p>Roger Wilco was a twit, often selfish but lovably goofy, and the <em>Space Quest</em> games hated him for it. He was treated with disdain, and his attempts to climb above the rank of janitor always failed. Ace Hardway isn’t a moron, but just a deeply unlikeable person. He’s rude, incurious, and most of all, deeply dull. But the game loves him. The narrator, despite sounding just like <em>Space Quest IV</em>’s disgusted commentator, constantly celebrates his benign actions, cheers him on. It’s just so weird.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4451eca343be19c2454b88db6dd6dd2" data-recommend-id="image://d4451eca343be19c2454b88db6dd6dd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sort of giant baby thing, again, textured as if on a PlayStation 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sort of giant baby thing, again, textured as if on a PlayStation 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Guys From Andromeda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4451eca343be19c2454b88db6dd6dd2" data-recommend-id="image://d4451eca343be19c2454b88db6dd6dd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sort of giant baby thing, again, textured as if on a PlayStation 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is a colossal disaster. And while those who backed the project 13 years ago, especially those who backed this at the $10,000 level (three people did!), have every right to be disappointed and frustrated, it’s hard not to also feel a sense of empathetic horror for the developers.</p><p>Clearly, the three main developers—Scott Murphy, Mark Crowe and Chris Pope—were out of their depth from the start. It’s obvious from the grim state of what’s been released that there was little understanding of Unity, nowhere near enough learned over the past decade-and-a-half, and no money to be able to address it. Both Murphy and Crowe have chronicled multiple personal struggles and family tragedies over the last decade, and this game must have been the most awful millstone around their necks throughout. I find I can’t shake off that sense of the burden as I play, a pact signed with the devil that they couldn’t escape, persisting for over a decade after they were meant to be freed. And god, they’re still not free. This is “Early Access,” and the prediction of completion by this summer is clearly as realistic as every other projected release date made since 2013. Honestly, I wish I could break this bond for them, give them permission to just say the game is finished, and garbage. They took an incredibly long time to make a shit game. Then they can move on. But I fear 10,000 backers might not all agree.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is changing everything after its reveal, Battlefield’s Battle Royal mode has been datamined, and there’s a game from a classic franchise being pitched. It’s Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast for <strong>April 3, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw, Grant Taylor-Hill, and Albert Perkins give their thoughts on Nintendo’s pricing decision for the Switch 2 and its games after the reveal event. There’s also a rumor about a beloved franchise getting a third installment that the guys just aren’t sure they want to believe is real. Also, why can’t Game of Thrones have good video games?</p>



<p>It’s Insider Gaming Weekly!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nothing brings momentum to a screeching halt quicker than legal action. This is the prospect Schedule 1 is facing as it’s being deemed too similar to Movie Games S.A.’s Drug Dealer Simulator 1 &amp; 2 franchise, prompting a full investigation into the game.</p>



<p>Whereas people were hyping themselves up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone’s Verdansk</a> or continuing to enjoy the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, Steam indie title Schedule 1 was out here dominating. The game is about making and dealing drugs and all the rigors that come with the crime life. This is apparently appealing as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 hit a peak of over 400,000 players</a> and continues to bring in wheelers and dealers each day.</p>



<p>Everything was going great, but on April 3, publisher Movie Games S.A. demanded an investigation into TVGS’ Schedule 1.</p>



<h2 id="h-steam-sensation-schedule-1-under-investigation-for-infringement">Steam Sensation Schedule 1 Under Investigation For Infringement</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is Schedule 1 in trouble? Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evidence on the investigation surfaced on the website <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes,</a> featuring a document entitled: “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>



<p>Movie Games S.A. has its own series of drug-dealing games: Drug Dealer Simulator 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator 2. While the name is more overt in its goal, both titles have attracted thousands of players respectively.</p>



<p>The legal document mentions: “Potential infringement of the Issuer’s intellectual property rights and activities that may bear the characteristics of unfair competition have been identified.” Ergo, Schedule 1 is too similar to the Drug Dealer Simulator series—similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s lawsuit with Palworld</a>.</p>



<p>Proceedings began as soon as Schedule 1 released on March 24 and featured: “A comparative analysis of the Company’s IP, which includes, m.in, Drug Dealer Simulator and Drug Dealer Simulator 2 and the Schedule 1 project.”</p>



<p>The investigation is strongly looking into: “Elements of the game’s plot, mechanics, as well as UI – User Interface.” It finishes by saying: “The Issuer will immediately inform about further actions related to the pursuit of claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and the act of unfair competition in subsequent current reports.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> is priced at $450 in the US, scaling to $500 for a bundle that also includes a copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>. Following Nintendo's announcement of the price during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Direct</a> this week, many people made their feelings known about it--and now brands have begun to weigh in.</p><p>Duolingo, the language-learning company, posted this week, "Gamers, learn Japanese to save $133!" This post is referencing how Nintendo will offer a "Domestic Only" console that will sell for ¥49,980, which is about $340. This console is region-locked and only features Japanese as the language default. Duolingo saw an opportunity for a joke here, and to promote its own services.</p><p>The first Nintendo Treehouse Live event this week for the Switch 2 kicked off with users spamming the comments begging the company to lower the price of the system. Nintendo is, of course, unlikely to do this, and some experts believe there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">won't be any price cuts until 2030 at the soonest.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 carrying a heftier price tag than the original Switch ($300 USD in 2017) was always expected, and the price point <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">reflects the impact of tariffs and more expensive component prices.</a> Nintendo might have also felt emboldened to go with a higher price after it saw Sony offer the PS5 Pro for $700, some believe. Another analyst believes Nintendo is charging $450+ for the Switch 2 simply because it can.</p><p>"Nintendo is charging this price because they feel they can and that people will pay," analyst Serkan Toto said.</p><p>The Switch 2 is likely to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">sell like wild in its first year</a> due to pent-up demand and based on how shiny new products historically start strong with a buying base that is price-insensitive. But in the second year and beyond, the Switch 2 might skew toward more older and/or more affluent people, experts believe, due in part to its price tag. Overall, the Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">not expected to sell as well as the first Switch</a>, which has sold more than 150 million units worldwide.</p><p>Switch 2 games are being called out for their price tags, too, with much of the focus on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>.

Nintendo has offered no explanation or defense for the increased price, but one retailer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-has-earned-a-shockingly-low-amount-after-first-month/1100-6526440/" data-ref-id="1100-6526440">video game prices need to go up to help offset rising development and production costs.</a></p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's hands-on previews with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World.</a> The Switch 2 launches on June 5.</p>

		<p>Lumo 2 has been announced by Numskull Games and developer Triple Eh?, with this sequel coming nine years after Lumo first came out. Lumo has been available on PC, PS4, PS Vita, Xbox One, Switch, and Xbox One. Lumo 2 will be released for PC, PS5, and Switch at some point in 2025, though a more specific release window is yet to be announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumo 2 Announcement Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFtJJv46jfI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lumo 2 has been inspired by the era of 8-bit games, with the levels being based on games from that period. Dimensions will shift dungeon to dungeon with perspectives and gameplay also changing. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/24/lumo-review/">review for Lumo</a>, I said, <em>“Lumo is full of well thought out puzzles, but it lacks certain gameplay touches that could have pushed it into being a great game. My main gripe is that the jumping feels awkward and, coupled with perspective issues, means you can fail a simple puzzle dozens of times. The game does have a certain charm to it, and I would recommend it as a nostalgia trip for players that grew up with similar games, but this will not be for those who aren’t fans of classic titles or puzzles.”</em></p>

			<p>Arguably, the most unexpected game announcement made during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FromSoftware's The Duskbloods</a>. Today, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a lengthy interview with FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki, revealing lots of information on the upcoming game.</p>
<p>The creator of Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Sekiro, and Elden Ring revealed that the project started on the original Nintendo Switch. When Nintendo reached out about the Switch 2, FromSoftware realized it would have been better off making it for the more powerful console.</p>
<p>Miyazaki confirmed it is a PvPvE game, which is a formula that the studio considers very interesting because 'it allows for a broad range of game-design ideas while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters.' However, the revered game designer also wanted to clarify in no uncertain terms that the Japanese studio is not at all abandoning single player games, despite The Duskbloods and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imminent launch of Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which is also focused on multiplayer:</p>
<p><em>Please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward.</em></p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.</em></p>
<p>Miyazaki then proceeded to reveal a few tidbits about the setting of The Duskbloods. Players will be able to pick from over twelve playable characters, all of whom belong to a group called Bloodsworn. These Bloodsworn attained superhuman abilities by drinking special blood in a manner not unlike vampires, although the creator said they focused on the romantic side of the vampire lore instead of the monstrous side. The Bloodsworn are reportedly competing for something called 'First Blood', being summoned to the 'Twilight of Humanity' across various places and times. That's why the trailer showed very different locations.</p>
<p>Given their background, the Bloodsworn will be able to pull off more dramatic moves than in previous FromSoftware games. Also, due to the setting, each character will be equipped with some sort of ranged attack (mostly firearms), in another distinction from the studio's usual melee focus. The characters can also be customized to an extent.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Duskbloods – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In The Duskbloods, players will first join a hub area before jumping into a match where up to eight players can participate at once. Usually, the victory condition is simply 'last man standing,' but in some cases, it may be required to band together and defeat a PvE boss. The game also implements Victory Points, which are not necessarily connected to direct combat, allowing for alternative playstyles. An event system was introduced to ensure matches would feature variations, such as a special enemy or bonus side objectives.</p>
<p>Lastly, Miyazaki-san outlined a role system that is still being finished. One player could choose the Destined Rivals role so that another player in that match would be designated as their rival; finding and defeating them would be a personal goal with its own rewards. On the other hand, Destined Companion requires a player to find another player who was randomly designated as their companion, which results in a special reward if they can form a bond.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that The Duskbloods sounds very interesting. It's just unfortunate that it'll be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2, similar to Bloodborne on PlayStation 4, instead of being available on all platforms like Dark Souls or Elden Ring. The game is currently slated for a 2026 launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fromsoftware-single-player-games-miyazaki-duskbloods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki has gone on the record to put fans' fears to rest following the announcement of multiplayer Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>earlier this week.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Creators' Voice interview</a> with Nintendo about the game, Miyazaki says that despite multiplayer experiments like&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, FromSoftware has no plans to abandon its usual fare.</p>

<p>According to Miyazaki, these games "[don't] mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction", and that the company "still intend[s] to actively develop single-player focused games" like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>"that embrace our more traditional style".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromsoftware-single-player-games-the-duskbloods-wolf.jpg?itok=x4o4FkYS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromsoftware-single-player-games-the-duskbloods-wolf.jpg?itok=NObJ1Ezw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>FromSoftware isn't abandoning single-player games, so don't worry.</figcaption></figure><p>Miyazaki says that&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>was designed as a PvPvE multiplayer game because he's "always found the PvPvE structure very interesting". He goes on to say said structure allows FromSoftware to "leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters" in new ways.</p>

<p>He also provides some more info about&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>itself; you'll play as a vampire-like creature called a Bloodsworn, and you'll be competing with other Bloodsworn for "First Blood" amidst an apocalyptic event known as the Twilight of Humanity.</p>

<p>That's why you'll see a range of different technologies and time periods in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>; you can think of the game's world as a sort of societal version of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s The Dreg Heap, with various different times and places collapsing into one another.</p>

<p>Over the course of a match in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, you'll fight both other players and enemies in the environment to accrue Victory Points, and the player with the most Victory Points at the end of the match wins.</p>




<p>Miyazaki says that because he's "not much of a PvP person", he wanted to design a multiplayer game that could be played by those who aren't keen on PvP without depriving those players of a fair chance at winning.</p>

<p>We don't yet have a release date for&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, but the game will be coming to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/The-Duskbloods-2789410.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> sometime in 2026, and it won't represent the end of FromSoftware's single-player catalog either. Stay tuned for more.</p>

They pointed to the lack of a price in the Direct itself as a "deliberate" omission that caused confusion and misinformation as fans scrambled to find out pricing confirmation elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 and Mario Kart World pricing was “intentionally omitted from the Direct for a reason,” Yang claimed, “but handled poorly in terms of the information being in all these different places and you’re expecting the fans or the consumer to piece it all together.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellis added: “It just shows some disrespect to the consumer, where, ‘oh, you just saw the Direct you’re so excited, you’re just gonna throw your money at us blindly, you’re not going to even ask the question of how much it cost because you’re so excited, aren’t you?’ "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s a little bit degrading almost to the intelligence of the consumer,” Yang said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The former NOA communications staff then went on to discuss Nintendo’s failure to address the pricing concern, either with a public statement or in interviews with the press. This, they said, was causing rampant speculation to fill the void with misinformation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They are enabling the story to get out of hand, out of control,” Yang said. “They have lost control of this,” Ellis added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what went wrong? Ellis and Yang suggested Nintendo now lacks the consumer mindfulness it once had, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/nintendos-reggie-fils-aime-retires-replacement-named">former NOA boss Reggie Fils-Aimé’s retirement</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/nintendo-ceo-satoru-iwata-has-passed-away">the tragic loss of former Nintendo head Satoru Iwata</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s communications team will now be recommending the company release an official statement, Yang said, but the approval process will be painful, with many people involved before it even gets to current Nintendo boss Shuntaro Furukawa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo will also be out of practice because it hasn’t spoken to its community or press in such a long time, the pair said, nor has it had to deal with this sort of negativity since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/03/nintendos-apology-for-3ds-price-cut">the Nintendo 3DS price debacle of 2011</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now there is concern for staff manning demo stations at the public-facing Switch 2 hands-on sessions. Fans will have reasonable questions at these public events and might put those to staff who are manning demo stations. If they respond with any sort of answer, that could end up online and framed as Nintendo’s official response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What happens next? It remains to be seen, but neither Ellis nor Yang expect a price drop of either the Switch 2 or its games before launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>what the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Elden Ring: Nightreign offers a co-op souls-like adventure, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-announces-the-duskbloods-a-new-rpg-exclusive-to-switch-2/1100-6530560/">The Duskbloods</a> is heavily focused on PvPvE gameplay. This has raised some concern amongst From Software fans that the studio will develop more multiplayer games in the future, but From Software boss and Duskbloods director Hidetaka Miyazaki says that the developer isn't shifting exclusively to online multiplayer games.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2051721737" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward," Miyazaki said in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/">Nintendo interview</a>. "The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single-player-focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style."</p><p>Miyazaki also spoke more about the setting, characters, and themes of The Duskbloods, explaining how players will control a group of characters known as the Bloodsworn. Starring a group of superhuman warriors that are similar to vampires, Miyazaki said that the game takes place during the end of human society and revolves around the Bloodsworn chasing after something known as First Blood. The Duskbloods--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fromsoftwares-switch-2-exclusive-was-originally-pitched-for-the-original-switch/1100-6530618/" data-ref-id="1100-6530618">which was originally pitched for the Switch</a>--will launch for Switch 2 in 2026.</p><p>While PC, PlayStation, and Xbox gamers won't get to play it unless they decide to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">purchase a Switch 2 console</a>, they can look forward to Elden Ring: Nightreign when it launches on May 30. "Nightreign looks to be very much a From Software game, and I'm more intrigued by it now than I was before getting some time with it," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-explores-exciting-and-unexpected-new-ground-for-from-software/1100-6529377/">Elden Ring Nightreign preview</a>.</p>

While some may have assumed that this new game was always meant for Nintendo's new console, a recent interview posted to the official Nintendo website reveals a different story.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo posted an interview with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/">From Software director Hidetaka Miyazaki to speak about The Duskbloods</a>, which is filled with more details about the game and its development origins. In Part 1 of the interview, Miyazaki confirms that From Software and Nintendo met regarding an exclusive project well before the Switch 2's details were completed, and that the project was kicked off with the original Switch in mind.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"At first, it was being worked on by a small team as a title for Nintendo Switch," Miyazaki says in the interview. "However, just as the game started to take shape, we were approached by Nintendo with talk of Switch 2, which led us to revamp our development path with this new hardware in mind."</p><p dir="ltr">Miyazaki also mentions that the Switch 2's more robust online offerings allowed his team to "stay as true to the original vision as possible." The interview then goes on to talk about the setting of the game, the characters players will be using, and more about what The Duskbloods is all about.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch 2 launches June 5 for $449, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders available April 9</a> at select retailers.

            <p>FromSoftware boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> has confirmed the studio hasn't shifted to focus on multiplayer games.</p>
<p>The studio is best-known for its single-player games, from its Soulsborne games to the hugely successful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>. Yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">that game's follow-up, Nightreign</a>, is an online co-op roguelike, while the studio's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> exclusive Duskbloods has been confirmed as a PvPvE game following its reveal earlier this week at the Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>"As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn't mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward," said Miyazaki in an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/">interview with Nintendo</a>.</p>

<p>"The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring</a> was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single-player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style."</p>
<p>However, he stated he's always found the PvPvE structure "very interesting", adding: "It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Miyazaki provided more details on The Duskbloods. At first it was designed for the original Switch, but development changed to the newer console as its "focus on online features allowed us to stay as true to the original vision as possible".</p>

</figure>
<p>As for characters and setting, player characters are known as "Bloodsworn" and have super-human abilities through the power of special blood.</p>
<p>"As a general concept, they're similar to vampires, but they are not portrayed as the horrifying monsters you might associate with traditional vampirism," said Miyazaki.</p>
<p>"We tried to extract the sort of romantic aspects we found interesting from concepts such as vampires and 'blood' and reinterpreted them as the Bloodsworn."</p>
<p>He continued: "In The Duskbloods, the Bloodsworn are competing for something known as 'First Blood'. As human society reaches an end, First Blood flows in an event known as the 'Twilight of Humanity'. The Bloodsworn are summoned to the Twilight of Humanity across a variety of different times and places in a bid to obtain First Blood.</p>
<p>"Due to this, there is no fixed era or location in which The Duskbloods takes place. There are more traditional Gothic- or Victorian-style maps as well as those depicting the closing years of the early modern period, like the one glimpsed in the trailer with the train running through it."</p>
<p>As a result of the special blood, basic actions are dynamic and superhuman, like sprinting, super jump, and double jump.</p>
<p>"Also, and while this isn't directly related to the Bloodsworn themselves, the setting allows for the depiction of firearms and such, and every character is equipped with some means of attacking from a distance," confirmed Miyazaki. "I feel this is one of the game's unique aspects when compared with our previous titles. I hope these new action elements are one area that players will enjoy."</p>
<p>Players will choose from over a dozen specific characters to play as, each with their own identity and unique weapons. As for the gameplay loop, Duskbloods has a hub area from which up to eight players can join a match. On their return, they receive rewards to customise their character further. Matches are generally last player standing, though victory conditions will differ in certain cases - taking down a boss, for instance.</p>
<p>Further, how players conduct themselves is as important as direct combat, Miyazaki explained. "The Duskbloods implements 'Victory Points', which are responsible for ultimately deciding the outcome of a match," he said. "To obtain Victory Points, direct combat is of course important, but it's not the only way. Some players may prefer to earn points by avoiding direct combat and instead engaging in more opportunistic behavior. How you earn points is entirely up to you.</p>
<p>"Additionally, each character can summon an entity to assist in combat, giving players a high degree of freedom when it comes to how they fight - and win."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>It's this enemy that intrigues me most... | <span>Image credit: <cite>FromSoftware</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's also an event system to dynamically alter the course of a match - something FromSoftware has similarly implemented in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>.</p>
<p>Another interesting addition are "roles"  for each player, outside of the main mission of obtaining First Blood. For instance, players may need to defeat a specific opponent, or seek another player as their companion. Roles are assigned by blood customisation.</p>
<p>Indeed, character customisation is also where players will find the typical lore fragments of Souls games. By customising a character, players will alter their "blood history and fate", slowly revealing their story.</p>

</figure>
<p>Oh and the winged rat from the trailer? That's your new hub friend, providing expert advice between matches. Miyazaki joked this is FromSoftware doing "something a little Nintendo-esque in the spirit of the partnership".</p>
<p>He added: "We tried something cute for a change. Although I will say this character is actually an elderly gentleman."</p>
<p>The Duskbloods was revealed at the Switch 2 Direct earlier this week, where it initially drew favourable comparisons to Bloodborne.

<p>While the Switch 2 will also provide us with new instalments of classic franchises, such as its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">open-world Mario Kart</a>, during its Direct earlier this week Nintendo confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">it'll be releasing special enhanced editions of original Switch games</a> featuring higher resolutions, improved frame rates, and more.

Nintendo has discussed why it decided to use an LCD screen within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> rather than an OLED display, as found in the premium Switch OLED.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to press at a developer roundtable event attended by Eurogamer, Nintendo Switch 2 hardware design lead Tetsua Sasaki suggested the decision had not been clear - and had required much consideration.
</p>
<p>
"You know, during development - and now - there's a lot of advancements that have been made in LCD technology," Sasaki said, "and during our development we took a look at the LCD technology that was available to us now.

<p>
"And after a lot of consideration, we decided to stick with LCD."
</p>
<p>
Sasaki then asked the audience of journalists what their thoughts had been after trying Switch 2 for themselves. Most responded positively. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking personally, as someone who plays on Switch OLED currently, I was impressed by how much closer to that device Switch 2's LCD display felt, compared to the one found in the aging Switch 1. A key factor there, I think, is Switch 2's LCD screen now supporting HDR.
</p>
<p>
"Even with the OLED version of Nintendo Switch, we didn't... have compatibility support for HDR, but that's something we have support for now," Nintendo Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto noted. 
</p>
<p>
Switch 2's display is "a significant upgrade to that of its predecessor, and far closer to the crispness of the Switch OLED than I was expecting, with the added bonuses of its larger size and HDR," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">Eurogamer's Switch 2 hands-on preview.</a>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cult-of-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cult of the Lamb&nbsp;</em>composer Narayana Johnson, who worked under the pseudonym River Boy, has passed away, leading developer Massive Monster to call for fans to give them "some space and some kindness".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1313140/view/524213474678538839" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's Steam page, Massive Monster says it's "impossible to describe how much of a void" Johnson's passing will leave at the studio. He was Massive Monster's audio director, but the dev says he was "more than" that; he was also a "creative powerhouse", a "friend", and "[their] silly little guy".</p>

<p>Massive Monster goes on to say that Johnson is "woven into the soul of&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>" thanks to his audio work on the game, and that both the game and the studio "won't be the same" without him.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cult-of-the-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies-game-shot.jpg?itok=DS4JjmvW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cult-of-the-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies-game-shot.jpg?itok=Eve1pUu8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cult of the Lamb&nbsp;</em>composer Narayana Johnson has sadly passed away.</figcaption></figure><p>No cause of death was given for Johnson, and no illness was previously revealed either, so it's not entirely clear how he passed away at present.</p>

<p>Massive Monster says it recommends that you "take a moment to look at nature" and "touch your feet to the earth" to celebrate Johnson's life, and that "he would want you to listen to his music and remember how much it meant to him to share it".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Johnson as a composer, he often worked under the pseudonym River Boy, and he was also half of the duo Willow Beats.</p>

<p>According to his website, Narayana Johnson made music that "draws extensively on his childhood and teenage years spent roaming creeks, forests and mountains in the Northern Rivers, New South Wales".</p>




<p>His work on&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb&nbsp;</em>feels very evocative of the game's tone; it's dark, eerie electronica, but there's a playful element to it as well, reflective of the game's mixture of sacrificial rituals and cutesy animals.</p>

<p>Casual Mode is another headline-making addition to Call of Duty in Season 3. Warzone players can benefit from this helpful new battle royale variation designed to help you and improve your Warzone skills.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-season-03-patch-notes-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 and Warzone 3</a> is a surreal content launch aiming to bring back players who loved the game years ago when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-verdansk-is-back-calling-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> was first around. Season 3 is also trying to rekindle weary Black Ops 6 players’ love for CoD. On top of this are brand-new players who never had the chance to play Verdansk when it was around.</p>



<p>Activision infamously took the game out of circulation once Warzone Caldera launched. The decision has been reversed in 2025 with Warzone Season 3, and Verdansk isn’t the only thing that’s landed—say hello to Casual Mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-warzone-casual-mode">What is Warzone Casual Mode?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not everyone is prepared for the pressure. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warzone’s Casual Mode is a semi-tutorial mode featuring Bots and real players designed to bridge the gap between the battle royale’s Bot-only Bootcamp game mode and the PvE nature of real-time battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The are four Warzone levels for players to choose: <strong>Bootcamp, Casual, Normal, and Ranked</strong>.</p>



<p>Bootcamp was first introduced for Urzikstan and features 20 real-life players in teams of four (yourself and three friends or randomly assigned teammates) against 24 Bots—also in teams of four. You drop into a small circle on the map and get to experience a bite-sized game of battle royale.</p>



<p>After this, players need to step up to a real lobby full of human players. This can be overwhelming, which is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-launching-battle-royale-casual-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Mode</a> has been introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-casual-mode-differences-compared-to-normal-warzone">Casual Mode Differences Compared to Normal Warzone</h2>



<p><strong>You get to experience a full-length game of Warzone featuring the entire map of Verdansk in Casual Mode, and the lobby consists of 28 Players and 120 Bots.</strong></p>



<p>This is a far greater number of opponents; you use the entire map, but the game is still largely Bots for the hand-holding experience. Many players might feel intimidated going into a proper game with human operators, so this is the perfect middle ground.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD Blog</a> introducing Casual Mode said: “This is designed as a stepping stone for players to go from the Warzone Bootcamp tutorial mode to an experience closer to our traditional, player-only, experience. Players can learn the game and hone their skills in a lower-stress environment while still embracing the core survival challenge of being the last squad standing among 148 players.”</p>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-casual-worth-playing">Is Warzone Casual Worth Playing?</h2>



<p><strong>Warzone Casual offers a slightly more stress-free way to play and enjoy CoD’s battle royale, but it still features players who can destroy you very easily.</strong></p>



<p>With a ratio of 28 players to 120 Bots, chances are the majority of your combat is against AI until you reach the final few circles. This gives you a chance to grind Camos, earn XP, and soak in the atmosphere of Verdansk.</p>



<p><strong>But be warned</strong>: The community has complained that <em>Ranked Warzone players with high skill levels</em> are hopping into Warzone Casual. This might be because they’re grinding Camos or putting together gameplay compilations. </p>



<p>I stress that even though Warzone Casual hits the nail on the head, don’t be surprised to see a sliding demon come out of nowhere and melt you before you even get a chance to aim your weapon!</p>



<hr>



<p>What do you think of Warzone Casual? Is this a stroke of genius to encourage both newbies and regular players to spend time with a more chilled Call of Duty experience?

I work at FromSoftware (1), and I am the director for <em>The Duskbloods</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>(1) FromSoftware, Inc.: A game development and publishing company.

The concept itself was different from anything we had done before, and Nintendo seemed very interested in helping make it a reality. So that’s when the project kicked off.</p><p>At first it was being worked on by a small team as a title for Nintendo Switch. However just as the game started to take shape, we were approached by Nintendo with talk of Switch 2, which led us to revamp our development path with this new hardware in mind.</p><p>The new hardware’s focus on online features allowed us to stay as true to the original vision as possible, which was very good news for us.</p><p><strong>It sounds like the game differs from most of your previous titles. Can you give us a little more detail as to what type of game it is?</strong></p><p>In terms of structure, we consider it a PvPvE (2) title. At its core, it’s an online multiplayer* focused game, with both player vs player and player vs enemy gameplay.</p><p><em>(2) An acronym referring to a style of fighting where, in addition to players fighting each other, players also fight enemies (CPUs) that appear in the game.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Did you always have some desire to make a PvPvE type game?</strong></p><p>Yes, I’ve always found the PvPvE structure very interesting. It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters.</p><p>As a side note, please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Elden Ring</em> (3) was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player-focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.</p><p><em>(3) Nintendo Switch 2 software planned for release in 2025. Elden Ring is a fantasy <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,558 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> set in a massive open world, where you develop your character according to your playstyle.</em></p><p><strong>Please tell us about the game’s characters and setting.</strong></p><p>The game’s protagonists, or characters controlled by the player, are known as “Bloodsworn.” The Bloodsworn are a group whose members have achieved super-human abilities through the power of special blood. As a general concept, they’re similar to vampires, but they are not portrayed as the horrifying monsters you might associate with traditional vampirism.</p><p>We tried to extract the sort of romantic aspects we found interesting from concepts such as vampires and “blood” and reinterpreted them as the Bloodsworn.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>In <em>The Duskbloods</em>, the Bloodsworn are competing for something known as “First Blood.” As human society reaches an end, First Blood flows in an event known as the “Twilight of Humanity.” The Bloodsworn are summoned to the Twilight of Humanity across a variety of different times and places in a bid to obtain First Blood.</p><p>Due to this, there is no fixed era or location in which <em>The Duskbloods</em> takes place. There are more traditional Gothic- or Victorian-style maps as well as those depicting the closing years of the early modern period, like the one glimpsed in the trailer with the train running through it.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you let us know the meaning behind the title <em><em>The Duskbloods</em></em>?</strong></p><p><em>The Duskbloods</em> directly refers to the Bloodsworn themselves. As mentioned earlier, the Bloodsworn are summoned to the Twilight of humanity in a battle for First Blood. “Duskbloods” is a collective term for these characters controlled by the player.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>It sounds like blood plays a pretty big role in the game.</strong></p><p>Yes. In the context of this game, blood is used more conceptually, as opposed to literal meanings like physical depictions of injury.</p><p>Blood symbolizes one of the game’s key themes—the history it holds, the power it passes on, the fates it weaves and the marker of those who have surpassed the limitations of their own humanity.</p><p><strong>■ Part 2: Superhuman Abilities and Opportunistic Behavior</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>What are some characteristics of the Bloodsworn?</strong></p><p>There are several reasons we put the players’ focus on the Bloodsworn, with one of those being character actions.</p><p>The Bloodsworn possess superhuman abilities thanks to special blood, so their actions are more dramatic than anything seen in our previous titles.</p><p>Even basic character actions in this game such as sprinting, super jump, and double jump are designed to be dynamic and stress free and are complemented by each character’s own unique weapons and abilities, allowing for a wide range of creativity.</p><p>Also, and while this isn’t directly related to the Bloodsworn themselves, the setting allows for the depiction of firearms and such, and every character is equipped with some means of attacking from a distance. I feel this is one of the game’s unique aspects when compared with our previous titles. I hope these new action elements are one area that players will enjoy.</p><p><strong>Earlier you referred to “protagonists” or “characters” as plural. Does this mean the player will be able to choose from multiple different characters?</strong></p><p>Yes, there are over a dozen characters for the player to choose from, each with their own identity and appearance. I think there are a lot of unique elements to the character designs and the weapons they use, so hopefully players can find one or two favorites among them.</p><p>Also, each character can be customized to a certain extent, allowing players the fun of building a character that feels like their own.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you provide some more detail on the general gameplay loop?</strong></p><p>The game has a so-called “hub” area, where players can choose their character, customize them and enter online multiplayer*. Online multiplayer supports up to 8 players. Upon concluding an online match, players then return to the hub, at which point they receive some sort of reward whether they win or lose. Using these rewards, players can further customize their character, and so the cycle continues.</p><p>Online matches are generally last player standing, however there are certain cases where victory conditions differ. For example, players may be tasked with teaming up to take down a powerful boss enemy, or find themselves in other special circumstances.</p><p><strong>So, victory conditions are influenced not just by PvP (4) results, but PvE (5) results as well?</strong></p><p>That’s right. Some victory conditions center around defeating a boss enemy.</p><p><em>(4) An acronym for the style of game where players fight other players.</em></p><p><em>(5) An acronym for the style of game where players fight enemies (CPUs).</em></p><p><strong>I can’t think of many examples with that ruleset. It sounds very interesting.</strong></p><p>I’m happy to hear you say that.</p><p>Regardless of whether it’s PvP or PvE, the idea is to provide players with an experience that allows them to learn and hone their skills as they play. We’ve therefore designed the PvE boss encounters to present a tough challenge and a sense of accomplishment upon defeating them.</p><p><strong>So players can also enjoy improving their own skills over time as they battle?</strong></p><p>Yes. Although there are a variety of elements in place that keep the game from becoming too stoic. For example, how players conduct themselves during the match is just as important as direct combat.</p><p><em>The Duskbloods</em> implements “Victory Points,” which are responsible for ultimately deciding the outcome of a match. To obtain Victory Points, direct combat is of course important, but it’s not the only way. Some players may prefer to earn points by avoiding direct combat and instead engaging in more opportunistic behavior. How you earn points is entirely up to you.</p><p>Additionally, each character can summon an entity to assist in combat, giving players a high degree of freedom when it comes to how they fight—and win.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><p>Another important aspect is match variables, such as the event system. This system has the potential to alter the course of the match, such as special enemy spawns and additional objectives with accompanying bonus rewards.</p><p>In the trailer, you may have noticed a giant stone face looming in the sky. This is one example of the events that can occur in a match. In this case, the appearance of this stone face affects the environment and changes match rewards, which can have an immediate impact on player motivations and objectives.</p><p>These events don’t happen all the time, and I hope discovering them gives players some incentive to keep coming back.</p><p><strong>It sounds like even those who tend to shy away from PvP can still enjoy themselves.</strong></p><p>That was the intention. I personally am not much of a PvP person, and I wanted to make something that’s satisfying even for players like me.</p><p>While the goal of a match is to obtain First Blood, there are personal objectives that provide separate rewards to the player as well, so I hope these add to the fun of each engagement.</p><p><strong>■ Part 3: Playing Roles and Altering <a title="Series > Fate [66 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>s</strong></p><p><strong>What other ways might players enjoy the game outside of combat?</strong></p><p>One thing I love doing in any game I direct is leaving fragments of lore and worldbuilding details, allowing the player the fun of using their imagination to make connections. <em>The Duskbloods</em> is no exception to this.</p><p>However, we’ve gone about it a little differently from previous titles. The fragments this time are found in the previously mentioned character customization items: their “blood history and fate.” Customizing a character will reveal a piece of information regarding the world and its unfolding story.</p><p><strong>You customize their “blood history and fate”?</strong></p><p>Yes. Analyzing and altering a character’s blood history and fate allows players to customize all sorts of things, from their abilities, appearance, and inner characteristics to the role they play in the world and relationships with other characters.</p><p>Focusing these elements on the concept of “blood” or “blood history and fate” allowed for a deeper exploration of customization and is another reason we placed the Bloodsworn as the protagonists.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Do you mind sharing any other points you personally find interesting?</strong></p><p>One area I haven’t talked about yet is “roles.”</p><p>In online play*, roles give players special responsibilities and objectives that often lead to unique interactions and relationships between players based on their corresponding roles.</p><p>That’s probably not much info to go on, so allow me to provide a few examples. But please note we’re still finalizing some of the naming and details.</p><p>For example, if a player possesses the “Destined Rivals” role, another player is designated as their rival, and they are tasked with finding and defeating that player. Doing so counts as achieving a personal goal, separate from the overall victory conditions.</p><p>Another example is “Destined Companion,” where one player is required to seek out another designated as their companion, which results in a special reward if they form a bond with one another.</p><p>Roles can be assigned to any character via blood customization, allowing players to enjoy role-playing in a literal sense and hopefully adding to the drama of these engagements.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Kind of like how players can pick their roles in a table-top RPG (6)?</strong></p><p>Exactly. While not entirely intentional, it may reflect my own interests a bit. It might seem a little unorthodox at first, but I hope players will give it a try.</p><p><em>(6) <a title="Genres > RPG [17,123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">Role-playing games</a> played with things like dice and player, with players interacting with each other while following rules described in a rulebook.</em></p><p><strong>That reminds me, I was curious about the winged rat character seen in the trailer. Can you provide some details as to what role this character serves?</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_012.jpg"></a></figure><p>That character shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the <em>Dark Souls</em> series. They remain in the hub area, providing the player with advice and guidance.</p><p>I suppose you could say we tried doing something a little Nintendo-esque in the spirit of the partnership.</p><p><strong>What do you mean by that?</strong></p><p>We tried something cute for a change. Although I will say this character is actually an elderly gentleman (laughter).</p><p>(Laughter) Is there anything else you’d like to say before we finish?</p><p>In addition to creating a PvPvE title, we’ve tried our hand at introducing a lot of new and interesting ideas with <em>The Duskbloods</em>.</p><p>From superhuman player actions, a free-form combat approach, and gameplay that’s dynamic and dramatic to the romanticized aesthetic of the Bloodsworn, deep character customization and fragmentary storytelling, I think there’s a lot to appreciate and enjoy in this title and I sincerely hope players look forward to it.</p><p><strong>Thank you very much for your time.</strong></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>One of the big draws of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> is that the console will be backwards compatible with the Switch games library, barring a few exceptions. Nintendo has also explained that not every game will operate smoothly at launch on the Switch 2, as the hybrid console doesn't natively run Switch games. Instead, Nintendo uses a workaround method involving hardware and software to get Switch games working on the Switch 2.</p><p>"When we first started Switch 2 development, the focus was on enhancing its performance as hardware, namely, expanding its capacity," <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's Takuhiro Dohta explained</a>. "So, compatibility was a lower priority. For example, Nintendo DS games were playable on Nintendo 3DS, and Wii games were playable on Wii U, but it was difficult to achieve the same level of compatibility with Switch 2, because the hardware-design approach was different from those systems."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1143041784" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

running out of battery power more quickly. "We did something that’s somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility," Dohta explained. Nintendo will still work to ensure that games run as smoothly as possible ahead of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2's launch in June</a>, but developers have cautioned that not every game will be ready when the console arrives.</p><p>So far, games like Alan Wake Remastered, Fall Guys, and Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection have undefined compatibility issues, while other games like Rocket League and Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus have what Nintendo calls startup issues. You can check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">games with Switch 2 compatibility issues</a> for more information.</p><p>This week has been an informative one for potential Switch 2 owners, as not only did we get an official release date--June 5--for the console, but also more details on its price and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">launch games</a>. Nintendo has also shown off some other interesting facts about the Switch 2, like its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-outlines-switch-2-accessibility-features/1100-6530598/">accessibility features</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-could-fix-two-of-the-biggest-issues-on-the-nintendo-eshop/1100-6530585/">changes to the eShop</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-main-menu-isnt-that-different-from-the-one-on-nintendo-switch/1100-6530604/">closer look at its user interface</a>.</p>

                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is poised to be 2025's biggest new game release, and so far we've heard sales projections of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">40 million copies in the first year and $3 billion in revenue</a>. Only one piece of work in history may end up outperforming it, according to Hollywood veteran Craig Mazin--the Bible.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/global/last-of-us-fallout-creators-tv-adaptations-bafta-games-awards-1236352651/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Variety</a>, Mazin said he expects GTA 6 to become the "largest-selling piece of media ever," with the exception of the Bible. As such, he expects Hollywood to "very carefully" watch how the game performs.</p><p>It's unknown how many copies of the Bible have been produced, but estimates suggest it could be <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-book-of-non-fiction#:~:text=AdvertisementsOne%20key%20milestone%20in,around%2080%20million%20per%20year." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as many as 7 billion.</a> Obviously, GTA 6 is not going to sell 7 billion copies. But the point Mazin is making is that he expects Rockstar to once again deliver a product in GTA 6 that smashes records and raises the bar.</p><p>"People are getting used to an interesting combination of handmade, super-attentive method of making things married to size, which again, makes things harder to do," he said. "And as the bar is raised with production, and as every episode starts to approach movie quality and movie intensity, it does take more time."</p><p>Mazin has worked in Hollywood for a long time and was best known for the Scary Movie and The Hangover franchises before a dramatic turn with HBO's Chernobyl and more recently The Last of Us. </p><p>Given the size and scale of the GTA franchise, many may wonder why there hasn't been a feature film or TV adaptation. To begin with, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-company-explains-why-its-franchises-rarely-get-made-into-movies-or-tv-shows/1100-6516697/" data-ref-id="1100-6516697">adaptations for film and TV simply do not make a lot of money</a>, and he would know, as Zelnick was previously an executive at Columbia Pictures and 20th Century Fox. Zelnick said singling out success stories like HBO's The Last of Us and Universal's The Super Mario Bros. Movie misses the point of how there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-company-explains-why-its-franchises-rarely-get-made-into-movies-or-tv-shows/1100-6516697/" data-ref-id="1100-6516697"> countless stories of failures where people lost money</a>. Given that, Take-Two has said it will be "very selective" when it comes to licensing its properties for film or TV.</p><p>Take-Two's Borderlands franchise received a feature film adaptation starring many famous Hollywood celebrities, but it tanked upon release in 2024, earning <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt4978420/?ref_=bo_se_r_1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only $33 million worldwide.</a> In fact, Mazin was originally involved with the Borderlands movie before parting ways, replaced by a writer named "Joe Crombie." Some people believe <a href="https://www.avclub.com/borderlands-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this person does not actually exist.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-has-earned-a-shockingly-low-amount-after-first-month/1100-6526440/" data-ref-id="1100-6526440">Lionsgate financed the Borderlands movie</a>, so Take-Two and Gearbox are largely unaffected by the major miss, apart from reputational damage and the possibility of movie studios looking to steer clear of any future partnerships.</p><p>Another Take-Two franchise set for a Hollywood adaptation is BioShock, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-boys-star-jack-quaid-wants-to-be-in-bioshock-movie-currently-obsessed-with-fromsoft-games/1100-6530154/" data-ref-id="1100-6530154">getting a movie at Netflix--however, the project has been scaled down.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive have released a new&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's ideal if you thought the base game wasn't quite roguelite enough.</p>

<p>The Endless Expeditions update is the latest in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">string</a> of post-launch&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-update" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, and its main feature is its namesake, the Expeditions mode, which Ironwood describes as offering "roguelite-style trips with unique routes and restrictions".</p>

<p>You'll start out from your garage "with an ever-changing set of challenges and restrictions", so if you feel like you've already seen everything&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has to offer, this update may give you pause for thought on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update-map.jpg?itok=OqAkxLnn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update-map.jpg?itok=ZQGC8PdZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s Endless Expeditions update should give you a few new challenges if you're a roguelite fan.</figcaption></figure><p>This update also introduces the ability to suspend your game no matter where you are, so you can suspend an in-progress run if you've got something else more urgent to do.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can look forward to "over an hour" of new radio music spread across 21 songs, created by "new and returning artists", as well as upgrades to the Plasma Scrapper and Thermal Vacuum tools to make them more efficient.</p>

<p>The new Ida's Exchange vendor will let you purchase new unique parts and resources for your car, as well as cosmetics to make it look a little nicer, and the route planning UI has been refreshed "for better readability" too.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about the Expeditions mode, be sure to keep an eye on Ironwood's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ironwoodstudios/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, where the developer will be releasing an in-depth look at the mode in the coming days.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's a survival-based driving game in which you must uncover the mysteries of a&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em>-style exclusion zone racked with anomalies and other dangers.</p>

<p>The game is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, as is the Endless Expeditions update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/assassins-creed-shadows-actress-masumi-on-naoe-challenges-of-acting-in-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-story-attempting-to-hit-word-limit" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a> often feels like two games in one. If you play as Yasuke, you'll mow down enemies like an indestructible tank. If you play as Naoe, you'll dance in the shadows, elegantly carving a path toward your goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They're opposites in so many ways. Yasuke is a gentle giant with strong convictions, while Naoe's petite stature contains a wealth of rage and fury. Over time, she hones this storm of emotions into a sharp blade, focused squarely on restoring freedom to Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actress behind this performance? Masumi, a Japanese American who previously starred in Netflix's <em>Yakuza Princess</em>. We interviewed her about her first major role in a AAA video game, where we learned about all the skills she brought to <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>



<h2>A Deep Dive Into Naoe's Traumas</h2>

<p>Players who have seen the moment where Naoe and Yasuke meet know about her initial character arc. She goes from grief to greatness, and in Masumi's words, Naoe finds her "true power in her own shadows."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All of the knowledge, skills, and wisdom that are passed down to her becomes almost like a curse because she doesn't know how to control her shadows made of trauma, anger, and pain," she said. "This story is about Naoe overcoming her inner demons and harnessing the true power of the shadows."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Naoe and Yasuke initially meet in an awkward position, but as Masumi puts it, they go from "enemies to lifelong friends." At first, they rely on each other because of their different talents, but throughout the game, you see more tender moments between them. These moments are courtesy of the acting work of Masumi and Tongayi Chirisa, who plays Yasuke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Working with him was a treat! It didn't feel like work because we had so much fun working together," Masumi said about her fellow protagonist. "I respect him so much as an actor and a senpai as well, so I got to learn a lot from working with him."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personally, I found that Yasuke brings out the best in Naoe, breaking down her trauma-built barriers with kindness. It adds emotional complexity to her character, which Masumi really related to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love how she takes in the moments of beauty when she notices them and lets the moments of sadness sink in when they come," she said. "She can be cool and calm like a ninja, or rage fiercely like a warrior! All while being the petite size that she is."</p>



<h2>The Hard Parts of Acting in a Video Game</h2>

<p>Masumi's previous experience on <em>Yakuza Princess</em> prepared her well for <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. She had training in Japanese sword fighting with actor Masa Kanome in LA because of the movie, and it came in handy for her role as Naoe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We practice coming up with a fight choreography within 5 minutes at the end of every class. We have to quickly memorize all the choreography parts and tape it," she said. "So that skill definitely helped me book the job and also add some movements to Naoe in the game."&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> presented Masumi with her first opportunities at motion capture and performance capture, both of which are common ways to record human movement and acting for games. In fact, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/obstacles-animal-motion-capture-video-game-development" rel="nofollow">these techniques can be used for animals</a>, too!&nbsp;</p>

<p>You've probably seen behind-the-scenes videos of people doing this in skin-tight body suits, often with markings for the cameras to track them. Needless to say, it's not the most immersive setting for an actor to perform in.</p>

<p>"You really have to tap into your imagination and trust your body to bring the character to life," Masumi said about the challenges of motion capture. "I also needed to ask questions about the weight or texture of the 'door' that I might be opening in a scene, to make it real for myself!"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As challenging as it was, it was also a rewarding experience. I learned so much." —Masumi, actress</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonetheless, motion capture still lets a person act with their entire body. With voiceovers though, all the perceived "output" comes through only in voice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You have to convey everything through tone, breath, and energy. And because it’s a game, you’re not always recording in sequence, which means finding the right emotional beats without the full context," she said. "I have such renewed respect for VO actors after being on this project!"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this wasn't an easy experience, especially with the volume of work that goes into acting in a video game. Story aside, actors have to record a lot of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interview/video-game-grunts-groans-and-screams-j-b-blanc-sheds-light-on-voice-acting" rel="nofollow">yelps and hints, along with combat grunts</a> and side quest musings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was a 'marathon' as [creative director] Jonathan Dumont advised me in the beginning. I've learned a lot about advocating for recovery time and taking care of myself," she said. "But honestly, as challenging as it was, it was also a rewarding experience. I learned so much."</p>



<h2>A Sense of Pride</h2>

<p>Masumi herself doesn't play too many video games, but she did check out some of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> recently—I mean, why wouldn't she, after all that hard work?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While it was beautiful and super exciting to watch Naoe and Yasuke's story, the fight scenes were a bit too violent for me to get through," she said with a laugh. "I can't watch bloody horror movies either, so I would just have to enjoy walking through the town with <em>Shadows</em>."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there's a lot she should be proud of. <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is arguably one of the best in the franchise, with a healthy player base that has grown a lot since release. Additionally, it adds an extra sense of weight and honor to Masumi, being part of a game that showcases parts of Japanese history and culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I feel so honored and grateful that people are interested in our culture," she said. "I hope this will entice people to come to Japan and explore the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/real-wabi-sabi-in-assassins-creed-shadows-open-world" rel="nofollow">beautiful cities and countrysides in Japan</a>!"&nbsp;</p>
