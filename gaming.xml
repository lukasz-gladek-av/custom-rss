            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It may be over eight and a half years since Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Scale</a>bound, the action game it would publish as a PC and Xbox exclusive from developer PlatinumGames, but Game Director Hideki Kamiya still hasn't let this go.</p>



<p>In the following years, the veteran game designer and director, whose works include Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Ōkami, Bayonetta, and The Wonderful 101 among others, often remarked on how disappointed he was in what happened with that project. Earlier this year, he even <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he'd love to resurrect Scalebound someday.</p>



<p>In a fresh interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/clovers-interview-kamiya-and-koyama-talk-okami-2-industry-layoffs-and-a-potential-future-with-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, he returned to the subject from another perspective: discussing the differences between Japanese and Western publishers.</p>



<p><em>What it feels like when working with Japanese publishers is that the development culture feels closer to mind, and they tend to be more understanding toward creators. On the Japanese side, my impression is that they see you’re trying to make a new invention. They understand the struggle of trying to give birth to something new, and they watch over the process with patience. That’s where I see there’s a difference with publishers.</em></p>



<p>When asked if Scalebound could have made it with a Japanese publisher, Kamiya answered that overseas publishers (like Microsoft in this case) tend to want a game done as quickly as possible. In contrast, Japanese ones might have been more understanding of the difficulties.</p>



<p><em>I do think it would’ve been different. I don’t mean that if it had been a Japanese publisher, the game would necessarily have been completed and released, but I imagine the process itself would have played out differently. Japanese companies tend to be more open to new challenges, and I think the conversations would have been more positive, like, “Okay, so how should we approach this together? For me personally, overseas publishers seem to have a much stronger desire to see a finished product as quickly as possible. If it had been a Japanese publisher, I feel they might have given us more leeway</em></p>



<p>As Kamiya had mentioned before, PlatinumGames did not have a frame of reference for a game where players controlled a dragon and a human character at the same time, which caused problems. Still, having said that, the game director maintains that the ultimate responsibility was his, and with Scalebound's experience, he might work better with a Western publisher in the future.</p>



<p>Kamiya is now working at Clovers, a new studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing an Ōkami sequel for CAPCOM</a>.</p>

			<p>The recent release of Chibi-Robo on the Switch 2 Online service was welcome news as the Gamecube title is one of my favourite games of all time. The adventures of a tiny robot whose purpose is to clean may not have sounded like the most exciting premise for a game, but the charm and design elevated it to a true classic. Misc. A Tiny Tale is very clearly inspired by the earlier game and offers a more linear and focused take on the gameplay elements while retaining the charm and humour in spades.</p>
<p><iframe title="Misc. A Tiny Tale - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlRa1fpf_d4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Whilst Chibi-Robo has a lot of interactions between Chibi and the humans in the house, Misc takes place in a posthuman world where all that is left is the remains of civilisation and a new world is being built by tiny robots. This seemingly grim future is not a depressing setting per se, and instead serves to provide an empty playground for the robots to take centre stage. There is the subtle suggestion that humanity has brought about its own downfall, but this is more of a context than a narrative point. The end result, however, is that a story devoid of humans is paradoxically filled with humanity.</p>


<p>You play as Buddy, a cute little robot with a basic range of platforming abilities and a seemingly bottomless capacity for trash (a trait I can certainly identify with). You can jump, both single and double, hover to reach distant platforms, and move and carry objects. Nothing revolutionary by any means but the tools at your disposal are well used to make each level feel developed and interesting. The biggest nod to Chibi Robo (aside from picking up rubbish) is the little brush you use to clean up stains and spills. This tiny mechanic feels far more satisfying than it should – especially when you’re sat in a messy room trying to avoid actual housework.</p>


<p>The world of Misc is wonderfully detailed and full of character. While it plays out in distinct levels rather than an integrated map this does help to give each area a feel of its own. You’ll travel through various different villages, desolate areas, a junkyard, and even an abandoned human-scale house. Along the way you’ll help a varied cast of other tiny robots and get to know more about your protagonist and his best friend Bag Boy. The latter is distinguished by wearing a paper bag for reasons that only become apparent in the later levels of the game. He is also constantly accompanied by a grumpy and eternally hungry robot cat – which is always a plus point.</p>
<p>The immediate backstory for Misc involves a mysterious explosion that is the catalyst for Buddy’s big adventure. The explosion leaves strange golden cogs scattered around the world – cogs that are needed to activate the doors at the end of each level. While there are ten to find in each stage, only eight are required to progress, whilst there are also incentives to clean all the stains and pick up every piece of rubbish. The levels are easily replayed through the map screen and it is clear what you still have to do in each – although there are times when you’ll need to scour the map to find the last piece of rubbish or spillage. Fortunately you can buy a radar tracker once you’ve found all the golden cogs on a level to help you track down any missed objects.</p>

<p>Some golden cogs are located in difficult to reach areas and require accurate platforming skills whilst others are rewards for helping out other bots. Requests range from watering all the plants in a garden to finding an accessory to make a staple remover hydra feel less intimidating. The main connecting tissue is Buddy, an endlessly optimistic (despite being voiceless) presence who is driven by a pure curiosity and desire to help.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Misc. A Tiny Tale is a real hidden gem. The quality of the level design, the amount of emotional heft in the narrative, and the sheer joy of exploration in the game make it feel like a true successor to Chibi-Robo. Even if it doesn’t quite have the scope of Nintendo’s title, it's a pleasure from beginning to end.	</p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/palword-launch-2026-pocketpair-polishing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-1-0-to-launch-in-2026-pocketpair-will-focus-on-polishing-for-the-rest-of-2025.1298817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, PocketPair <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEVIBHP37eM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in a video message that it aims to release Palworld 1.0 next year. To achieve that goal, they will focus on polishing, which means the rest of 2025 won't feature truly big updates to the early access version. Communications Director and Publishing Manager 'Bucky' explained:</p>



<p><em>We've reached a crossroads and need to decide what comes next. While we have a lot of ideas for where we want to take Palworld, we also need to start thinking about 1.0. Beyond just adding new content, there's a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access. It's no secret that it has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release Palworld next year in 2026. And we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game. So, what does this mean? It means that things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year. It also means our winter update won't be as big as Feybreak was. We hope our players understand that we're taking this extra time to improve the game overall. Now, that said, it doesn't mean there will be no updates. We still do have a few surprises planned for our winter update this year. We just want to be transparent about where we're headed and the development of Palworld going forward. It is not slowing down or scaling back; quite the opposite. Version 1.0 will be a major milestone for us, and we have a truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update. Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end.</em></p>



<p>Bucky also said that PocketPair is also doing other things, such as supporting other small developers through a publishing division and even starting to research other game ideas for future projects. Of course, Palworld is still what most of the company is concentrating on, and it couldn't be any different given the incredible success achieved when the game launched in early 2024, breaking <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-sold-3-million-units-in-40-hours-broke-1-million-concurrent-users-on-steam-surpassing-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record after record</a> for the first few weeks. To this day, PocketPair's survival action monster taming game is third on Steam's all-time concurrent player chart with 2.1 million players. Only Black Myth: Wukong and PUBG have done better. Overall, Palworld has surpassed 32 million players across all platforms earlier this year.</p>



<p>However, the Japanese developer also has to deal with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo lawsuit</a>, which was filed nearly a year ago for alleged patent infringement. PocketPair is fighting the lawsuit in court, but in the meantime, they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to introduce some changes to the game</a>.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>Sega has released a new trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and with it has reignited its rivalry with Nintendo (albeit in a cute, harmless sort of way).</p>
<p>In an effort to pay homage to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPJw4CfkhMU">Sega Genesis vs. SNES advertisement</a> from the early '90s, the new trailer highlights CrossWorlds' high-speed action, broad customisation, and cross-platform compatibility, all the while throwing <em>slight</em> shade at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer starts off with a heavily pixelated look at Mario Kart World (because no one wants to entice the wrath of Nintendo) while stating "We all know <em>that</em> kart racing game, it's great, we don't need to show it to you". A slightly positive note, you might think.</p>
<p>After showcasing Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, however, the trailer then goes back to Mario Kart World, which is represented by a grubby, struggling RV, all the while sarcastically exclaiming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, uhh, what if you wanna roam around the open world..?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like we said, it's cute, it's harmless, but it's nevertheless a fun way to look back upon Sega's heritage and reference that, yes, both Sega and Nintendo have major racing games launching in 2025.</p>

<p>Which will you pick up?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Infograph 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51611eee1fa26/nintendo-infograph-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct</a>, the company has released a handy new infographic showcasing every major game that cropped up during the hour-long broadcast.</p>
<p>Say what you want about the Direct itself, seeing all of these games on one page highlights just how impressive the upcoming line-up of games really is. We've got the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, and more. It's a lot.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Infograph 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38bcf2407ad39/nintendo-infograph-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1967619424455704975">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, questions <em>do</em> still remain, including why on earth Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/icymi-if-you-want-to-play-virtual-boy-classics-youll-need-to-buy-one-of-nintendos-accessories">isn't offering a way to play Virutal Boy games without the use of the headset</a> (or cardboard equivalent), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2-prices-are-live-and-its-sticker-shock-time">why the Mario galaxy games are so darn expensive</a> on the Switch. And let's be honest, neither of these will likely be answered.</p>
<p>But if you're wondering <em>"crikey, does the Switch 2 even have games?"</em>, we think the answer is yes, it definitely does. Not all of them will be to your taste, but we feel quite satisfied with the cadence in which new experiences are being released.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

It’s no secret that <em>Palworld</em> has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release <em>Palworld</em> next year, in 2026, and we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game.”</p><p>Bucky continued, “So, what does this mean? It means that things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year. It also means our winter update won’t be as big as [the] February [update] was. We hope our players understand that we’re taking this extra time to improve the game overall. Now, that said, it doesn’t mean there will be no updates, but we still do have a few surprises planned for our winter update this year.</p><p>“We just want to be transparent about where we’re headed and the development of <em>Palworld</em> going forward. Development of <em>Palworld</em> is not slowing down or scaling back, quite the opposite. <em>Palworld</em> 1.0 will be a major milestone for us, and we have a truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update. Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end. We’re really excited about this, and we hope our fans will be really excited about this too. We plan to share some sneak peeks about <em>Palworld</em> 1.0 in the very near future.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>After years of anticipation, Team Cherry only gave the video game industry and players two weeks notice that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was about to arrive on September 4. While a handful of indie games were moved away from that date, Rogue Factor had already staked out the same release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538">Hell is Us</a> six months earlier. Now, Hell is Us' creative director is sharing his belief that Silksong's shadow drop negatively impacted Hell is Us' sales, and he doesn't sound happy about it.</p><p>Jonathan Jacques-Belletête acknowledged that Team Cherry had the right to pick any date it wanted to during his appearance on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opeNl55y-0Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friends Per Second</a> podcast (via <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This Week in Video Games</a>). However, Jacques-Belletête feels that the decision to do so on such short notice was "a little callous."</p><p>"When you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like--'wow,'" said Jacques-Belletête. "As the 'GTA 6 of indie' ... to shadow drop something like this is a little callous."</p><p>According to Jacques-Belletête, discussions were held between Rogue Factor and publisher Nacon about delaying Hell is Us. But there were too many complicating factors, including the need to refund any pre-orders that had already been placed.</p><p>"We decided to keep the date, and I'm happy that we did," added Jacques-Belletête. "We're still much bigger than some of the smaller ones who would have gotten a lot more affected and who decided to change their dates. Changing the date of Hell Is Us would have been a pretty big [endeavor]."</p><p>Jacques-Belletête went on to note that he believes Silksong's release hurt Hell is Us' sales, but also acknowledged that he doesn't currently have the sales numbers available to illustrate that point.</p><p>As for Silksong, it debuted with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-had-a-massive-steam-player-count-over-its-first-weekend/1100-6534537/" data-ref-id="1100-6534537">a massive concurrent player count on Steam during its first weekend</a>. A common complaint about the game is that it's too difficult, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-a-bunch-of-mods-that-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534541/" data-ref-id="1100-6534541">mods designed to make Silksong easier</a> were released almost immediately. Team Cherry subsequently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">its own patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>.</p>

                <p>SpongeBob has gone on plenty of video game adventures, and on October 31, you can grab a physical edition of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Bundle-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FQGNGKZH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob SquarePants: Bundle</a> that collects two of SpongeBob's best games--Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated and The Cosmic Shake--into a single physical release. Preorders for the two-game collection are available at Amazon for just $35--that's a 50% price cut compared to the digital version of the bundle that's already available for $70 on the Switch eShop.</p><p>The Cosmic Shake is the better (and newer) of the two games, and it earned solid marks from critics.

"Despite a few hiccups and disappointing aspects of The Cosmic Shake design, at its core it achieves its goals," writes GameSpot reviewer James Carr.</p><p>The other game in the bundle, Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated, earned similar reviews, giving nostalgic fans a massive version of the underwater town to roam around as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566184-817zljshhpl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566184" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566184-817zljshhpl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566184"></a><figcaption>SpongeBob SquarePants: Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566184-817zljshhpl._sl1500.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566185-81wev8fdc2l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566186-81j4iyz4ifl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566187-81e2grgxz9l._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566185,1300-4566186,1300-4566187" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4566185-81wev8fdc2l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4566186-81j4iyz4ifl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4566187-81e2grgxz9l._sl1500.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566185-81wev8fdc2l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566186-81j4iyz4ifl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566187-81e2grgxz9l._sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>This new Switch physical edition bundle isn't the only way to get your SpongeBob fix.

		<p>Dying Light: The Beast is one of the most anticipated games of the year, with Techland’s iconic zombie saga continuing to capture fans’ imaginations. That’s never been more obivous than today, with the game hitting 1 million pre-orders. In return for this incredible milestone, Polish developer Techland are dishing out a bunch of free gifts for everyone that has pre-ordered the game. It’s not too late though, as they’re extending this offer to everyone who pre-orders before the game’s launch on the 18th of September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What are these free gifts? The first is the APEX Car Skin, featuring a striking glow-in-the-dark design that the team says, “Makes every ride through Castor Woods unforgettable”, on top of the Hero of Harran Bundle. The Hero of Harran Bundle will be available from launch, while the APEX Car Skin will appear a couple of days later on the 20th of September.</p>
<p>That’s not all, though! Players who pre-order before the launch will also receive the exclusive Kyle Crane skin, inspired by his iconic look from the original Dying Light. This tribute will be fully revealed before the game’s launch and unlocked shortly after the game goes live. </p>
<p>We got to check out Dying Light: The Beast just over a year ago at Gamescom, and we loved what we saw. The name might be a bit of a giveaway, but it’s become apparent that The Beast is actually you. Thanks to his incarceration and subsequent experimentation, Kyle Crane has developed a series of beast-like powers, coming to the fore when he’s pushed to the limit. These manifest when he’s angry – you wouldn’t like him when he’s angry – though in gameplay terms, that seems to be when he’s been taken and/or dished out a certain amount of damage.</p>


<p>The game takes place in a new open-world region that’s not appeared in the franchise before, with a central campaign that’s set to give you over 18 hours of standalone zombie action. Techland feel this is the sweet spot in terms of narrative and gameplay content, though as an open-world game, there’s undoubtedly going to be plenty to distract you from what you’re doing.</p>
<p>We can’t wait for Dying Light: The Beast, and it seems like neither can most of you!</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Destiny: The Taken King is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, September 15, 2025. Below, we look back at how it came to represent the years of Destiny, and live-service games more broadly, that would follow.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Ten years ago, Bungie performed a miracle. It also, unfortunately, invoked a curse.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2014, the studio renowned for the Halo franchise launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny</a>, which promised to blend its penchant for dynamic single-player campaigns and kinetic multiplayer gameplay with the framework and community-oriented features of MMOs. And while the game was released to an excited and impressionable audience, it floundered. Its opening salvo felt limp and incomplete--a sentiment that <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731" rel="nofollow ">later reporting</a> would confirm--but it maintained a playerbase through a spate of smaller middling DLC releases leading up to The Taken King, Destiny's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-the-taken-king-review/1900-6416250/">first major expansion and saving grace</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Taken King launched on September 15, 2015 and--I say this without exaggeration--revolutionized the game, which felt aimless till its arrival. Destiny's worlds, while large and beautiful, felt quiet and devoid of life. Its cast felt more like disparate archetypes thrown in a blender than a cohesive company. And its paper-thin plot...well, it was just that. Destiny wasn't without merit--it excelled in gunplay, boasted an art style that blended sci-fi and fantasy seamlessly, and the level design of its strikes and raids were still exemplary--but all of that felt pointed at nothing in particular. The Taken King whipped it into shape.</p><p dir="ltr">From its opening mission through to the riotous end of its raid, The Taken King was sharp in a way the initial release of Destiny could only ever dream of. For 10 years now, I've been struck by the construction of the expansion's first level, where the player must mount a defense of a besieged base on Phobos, and how much livelier it felt than anything Destiny had done in the year prior. Small touches, like an enemy ship cresting over a hill and shining its spotlight on the player, as well as the sights and sounds of explosions in the distance, finally broke up the almost glacial front that permeated Destiny's destinations. It was like throwing a rock into still water.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="991611077" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

It breathed life into characters that could've fallen by the wayside, like Eris Morn. It provided a bounty of secrets nestled in the crevices of the Dreadnaught. Hell, it even gave players a quest log! It cannot be overstated how amorphous Destiny felt before The Taken King's arrival, and how wonderful it felt to bask in it for the weeks and months to come. It hadn't just come to life, but become even larger in scope. At last, I felt like I was taking part in the epic struggle between light and darkness that Destiny had been billed as while I flitted through the cosmos and used my spectacular powers and weaponry to live out the adventures of my dreams.</p><p dir="ltr">For all intents and purposes, Destiny had mounted the comeback it needed. With some narrative direction and goodwill on its side, it had enough gas to continue its ascent. So what curse could I possibly have been referring to earlier?</p><p dir="ltr">The unfortunate problem with Destiny is that it never stopped needing saving. If you're at all familiar with the arc of the series, you may be tangentially aware of the bumpy road the games, as well as the company behind it, have been on ever since. For every high--every Taken King or Forsaken, which came at a similar time in Destiny 2's lifetime--there have been some standout lows. Unfortunately, while Destiny's history is marked by a long line of comebacks, it's just as stained by these immense valleys, brought on often by frequent retooling and reinvention that steadily eroded any ground which could provide it stable footing. And even though Destiny had proven, much like Rainbow Six Siege and No Man's Sky, that a live-service game could bounce back, it also stood as proof positive of how volatile ongoing games could be. It has typified the often harsh ebb and flow of the model.</p><p dir="ltr">You see, Destiny never really enjoyed a sense of stability. While Bungie devised a way forward for its ambitious series, the games suffered content droughts that turned its community against the game at several points in its lengthy lifetime. To solve this problem, Bungie figured out a cadence and template for content drops, like expansions, title updates, and seasonal events, that would supplement the community and feed the machine.</p><p dir="ltr">We often talk about the live-service treadmill from the perspective of the consumer, which is always a helpful viewpoint to contextualize its impact and potential harm. But what often feels under-discussed is the effect that this work has on the people who make the content for these never-ending games. And while some titles, like Epic Games' Fortnite, seemingly have the capital to throw armies at the thing, the same isn't true of every team.</p><p dir="ltr">The cadence of releases under the Destiny banner have seemed increasingly exhaustive on the workforce producing it, especially when factoring in the constant expectations for the next additions to the game to be bigger and better. The live-service treadmill isn't the only thing killing Destiny though. Paired with the mismanagement of the studio under <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/longtime-bungie-boss-pete-parsons-announces-departure-after-two-decades/1100-6534197/">previous leadership</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bungie-employees-claim-toxic-corporate-culture-is-killing-the-studio-from-the-inside/1100-6531737/">toxic workplace culture</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/">constant layoffs</a> and reinventions--some better than others--it's no surprise that Destiny's lineage is riddled with instability.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes that cadence of releases meant that game-changing updates like The Taken King would shake things up for the better. But just as often, it meant that the realities of developing such a big expansion for Destiny caught up with the team behind it. Things fell short. Other expansions like Rise of Iron or Beyond Light felt half-baked, even if they were well-intentioned. Seasons, which were introduced in Destiny 2, felt like a bit of triage that allayed many storytelling and content woes but opened up another can of worms entirely over the years due to repetitive tasks and the removal of seasonal content. Some system-level changes, like reworks to classes, were welcome while others, like the introduction of the Portal, were not. The gulf between Destiny releases has often left a lot to be desired and it has meant that for every two steps that Destiny appeared to take, it would constantly take one back.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4568253-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568253" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4568253-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568253"></a><figcaption>Destiny: The Taken King</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4568253-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Where does The Taken King fall into this, exactly? Well, it arguably set the bar pretty high for what Destiny releases should be, and though Bungie has lived up to that promise a few times over the 10-plus years it's worked on the series, these ambitions have made for just as many misses as there have been hits.</p><p dir="ltr">It established an unfortunate rhythm of Bungie amending its errors, showing unprecedented strength, and then showing how that hubris could just as easily be the studio's undoing. Like clockwork, Bungie has spent the last decade and change stepping on rakes and bouncing back better than ever only to further upset the balance of things in Destiny and inadvertently step on another five rakes, which only landed there by the studio's own actions.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unfair to place the blame for Destiny's unevenness on one its earliest and best expansions. It would be a mischaracterization of the DLC and the intent behind it. The Taken King isn't a stain on Destiny's legacy because it's too good. That's a ridiculous thing to propose. But it certainly did set the game and the team behind it on a trajectory that has, at the very least, proved untenable for the studio and the health of the game in the long term.</p><p dir="ltr">So for all the good that Taken King did Destiny by saving it back then, it's hard to deny that it has made for a tough act to follow, and chasing it after its highs has indelibly marked the studio. It is simultaneously emblematic of the best Destiny would offer, and the lows it would constantly have to recover from.</p>

It appeared again in Nepal in September, where, in a stunning display of Gen-Z political power, the country erupted in mass protests that culminated in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/young-anti-corruption-protesters-oust-nepal-pm-oli-2025-09-09/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resignation</a> of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—replaced, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/15/more-egalitarian-how-nepals-gen-z-used-gaming-app-discord-to-pick-pm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via a Discord election of all things</a>, by Sushali Karki, the nation’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5538411/gen-z-led-anti-corruption-protests-in-nepal-put-its-first-female-prime-minister-in-power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first female prime ministe</a>r. The Nepal protests, which started on September 8, were triggered by a social media ban on September 4, which escalated into nationwide demonstrations demanding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/12/nepal-appoints-its-first-female-pm-after-historic-week-of-deadly-protests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">government accountability</a> and an end to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkj0lzlr3ro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corruption</a>. Like many political protests, Nepal’s youth-led revolution sadly was not bloodless, involving deadly police force and reports of live ammunition, and has seen at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/death-toll-nepals-anti-corruption-protests-raised-72-2025-09-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">72 deaths</a>.

They are wrong. As someone <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-just-read-1-025-chapters-of-one-piece-and-its-a-damn-1847671952?utm_source=kotaku.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who read 100 chapters a week during covid</a>, finally getting caught up on the series, I can say without hyperbole that those people don’t know what the hell they’re talking about. The very fabric of <em>One Piece</em> is political, and it's a masterpiece of work fusing real-world political upheaval into its anatomically outrageous superpowers pirate odyssey.&nbsp;</p><p>While the rest of the pirate crews making up <em>One Piece</em> effectively act as the selfish pillagers found in pop culture folklore, Monkey D. Luffy, his crew, and their pirate allies in their vicinity stumble into political upheaval on the islands they visit. Instead of being opportunistic pirates who plunder the disenfranchised for treasure and go on their merry way, they become freedom fighters.&nbsp;</p><p>Each island the Straw Hats visit presents a unique political dilemma, often reflecting real-world issues. The Straw Hats don’t preach, but their presence sparks rebellion, liberation, and emotional reckoning for the oppressed they befriend on their journey for the series’ eponymous treasure.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Luffy Punches a Celestial Dragon | One Piece" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IX2EfnTc_Eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Throughout their journey, the crew has confronted:</p><ul><li><span>Institutional abuse perpetuated by the Marines, AKA the world’s in-universe cops</span></li><li><span>Fake news and propaganda used to discourage political revolutionaries and scholars from <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Void_Century" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempting to learn from the past</a>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>War crimes and systemic violence to force people to conform to the government’s rule lest they be on the receiving end of <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Buster_Call" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buster Call, </a>AKA a nuke.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span><a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Slavery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slavery</a>, <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Race#Racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">racism</a>, and <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Ohara_Incident" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genocide</a>, especially in arcs like <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Fish-Man_Island" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fishman Island</a> and <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Water_7_Arc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Water Seven</a></span></li><li><span>Religious authoritarianism</span></li></ul><div><figure><p><iframe title="Declaration of War | One Piece" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2mO_XFiXKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>One Piece</em> may wear the visage of a goofy pirate adventure for kids, but beneath the slapstick and camaraderie lies a sprawling, serialized rebellion against injustice. It’s a series where found family becomes a lifeline, where fans can see themselves reflected in its <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-piece-yamato-kiku-trans-wano-eiichiro-oda-chapter-1849053700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">queer revolutionary heroes</a> who laugh in the face of tyranny, punch fascists in the face, and shoot down the flags of oppressors with unflinching resolve.</p><p>So when young protesters in Nepal and Indonesia wave the Straw Hat jolly roger, it’s not cosplay—it’s canon. It’s the spirit of <em>One Piece</em>’s justice-hungry misfits made manifest, a fictional emblem retooled into a living, breathing symbol of resistance. And in that moment, art doesn’t just imitate life; it arms it with the will to fight for a better world.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-death-streamers"><h3>Why Republicans Needed Charlie Kirk</h3></a><p>"The purpose of Charlie Kirk [was] to conceal from the Republican base what their policies actually are"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces"><h3>Deahas thed Star</h3></a><p>Dorth Stor?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-ad-drone-scene-horrible-bad-review-2000614752">Amazon quietly released a new film version of H.G. Wells’ <em>The </em><em>War of the Worlds.</em></a> The movie, in which everything we see is happening on computer screens, stars Ice Cube and was a huge flop with critics. It featured a scene where the world is saved thanks to an Amazon drone driver. Seriously. Now, a month later, the rapper and actor has explained how the internet’s favorite bad movie of 2025 came to be.</p> <p>During a recent livestream marathon hosted by popular creator <a href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-ptsd-30-day-stream-no-break-hot-ones-twitch-1851786038">Kai Cenat</a>, Ice Cube dropped by to talk about his career, his future projects, and just shoot the shit with Cenat and his friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/4sVR6klSZyM?t=827">At one point during the stream</a>, Cenat asked Ice Cube about Amazon’s <em>War of the Worlds.</em> And while Cenat didn’t call it a terrible movie, it was clear that Ice Cube wasn’t particularly happy about the finished product, which apparently was shot half a decade ago in about two weeks.</p>  <p>“[<em>War of the Worlds</em> is a movie] I did in 2020 during the pandemic, five years ago,” Ice Cube told Cenat during the marathon stream. “We shot it in 15 days, and it was during the pandemic. So, the director wasn’t in there. None of the actors was in there. This was the only way we could really shoot the movie. [It was] pandemic time.”</p>

 <p>Ice Cube added that this is the reason <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-new-war-of-the-worlds-features-a-head-scratching-twist-2000636929"><em>War of the Worlds</em></a> is presented entirely as a series of computer screens. He then added: “But really, if shit went down, everybody would only have their screen to look at.”</p> <p>As for why the movie took five years to release, Ice Cube provided an odd answer, telling <a href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-streamer-university-tylil-james-twitch-1851783206">Kai Cenat</a> that after Universal sold the movie to Amazon Prime, it “took a minute to finish” the film because of “how it was shot.”</p> <p>“The movie is shot, the actors are shot, but all the footage is from real surveillance cameras around the world,” claimed Ice Cube. “And they had to build all that shit. So yeah, it took a minute.”</p> <p>As someone who has watched the movie and flipped through it a few times, I think a lot of the footage featured in it is actually stock footage or content licensed cheaply from some asset library.&nbsp; But hey, maybe they really did fly around the world collecting original security camera footage for this straight-to-digital low-budget adaptation of a classic novel. That’s possible, too, I guess…?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Genshin Impact – Best Lauma Build & Weapons Guide]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/genshin-impact-best-lauma-build-weapons-guide/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-%E2%80%93-best-lauma-build-weapons-guide.1298628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Genshin Impact is introducing a brand-new bloom support with Lauma, an important character in the new Nod-Krai region, as she serves as the Moonchant Envoy of the Frostmoon Scion faction. She’s also one of the most mechanically interesting characters released so far, and allows for two very distinct support playstyles depending on what team she’s in. This makes her a little trickier to build, but we’re here to help.</p>
<p><iframe title="Character Teaser - &quot;Lauma: Crown of Sacred Silver&quot; | Genshin Impact #GenshinImpact #Lauma" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gXRck6wMgyg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Build</h3>
<p>Lauma changes up the bloom reaction and causes the cores to become lunar bloom cores. This, weirdly, doesn’t change anything at all about the reaction, unlike how Ineffa affected electro-charged. However, these new cores do generate something called Verdant Dew, which Lauma can consume with her skill to buff it, generate Moon Song, reduce enemy resistance to dendro and hydro, and then if she uses her burst, she’ll change the Moon Song into Pale Hymn. Pale Hymn allows the bloom reactions to be buffed by a portion of Lauma’s elemental mastery. That all sounds complicated, but basically you want to make the bloom reaction with Lauma, then use her skill, then burst.</p>


<p>One key thing to note here is that one of her passive talents changes her playstyle dramatically depending on the team composition. If Lauma is the only Nod-Krai character on your team, she’ll allow bloom, hyperbloom, and burgeon to crit, with a fixed rate of 15% crit rate and 100% crit damage. This stacks with Nahida’s C2, but only the crit rate. If there are two or more Nod-Krai characters, then Lauma will buff lunar-bloom damage. At present, only Lauma can do lunar-bloom damage though, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Weapon</h3>
<p>This is the simplest part of the guide. Lauma’s best weapon is her signature weapon, Nightweaver’s Looking Glass, which boosts elemental mastery by a lot, and also boosts bloom damage and lunar-bloom damage even more. However, you can use any weapon with a lot of elemental mastery with Lauma and still get a lot out of it. The best of these is the event weapon for this patch, the Blackmarrow Lantern, which does a lot of what her signature weapon does, but with lower stats.</p>

<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Artifacts</h3>
<p>While Lauma always wants elemental mastery, the specific stats you want differ with playstyle as above. If she’s the only Nod-Krai character, you’re generally going to want all elemental mastery pieces on her, albeit with a decent amount of energy recharge, usually in the 150% range. Her set for this build can be anything really, but both Gilded Dreams and Deepwood Memories are good options.</p>
<p>If she’s one of two or more Nod-Krai characters, then you’ll want to swap an elemental mastery piece out for a crit damage or crit rate piece, and you’ll want to go with the brand-new Silen Moon’s Serenade set on her. This set boosts energy recharge, and also boosts elemental mastery and lunar reactions as well, and it works off-field. This set is likely to be good throughout the region of Nod-Krai, so farming it and the other new set will serve you well anyway. With that done though, you’re ready to get out there and bloom with the best Lauma build you can find.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-everything-pre-order-dlc-release-date-time-ps5-switch-2-crossplay-2000624090"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched last week to big numbers and mostly positive reviews on Steam. But there’s been a lot of chatter and debate online about the looter shooter’s performance. Some players aren’t happy that <em>Borderlands 4</em> seemingly requires DLSS and frame generation to run decently, even on the highest-end hardware. Meanwhile, Gearbox co-founder and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">CEO Randy Pitchford</a> has defended the game’s performance, calling it “<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424828975255865">pretty damn optimal</a>,” and suggested people need to use the “tools” provided by the studio and accept some trade-offs.</p> <p>On PC, many games can utilize real-time upscaling tech, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Learning_Super_Sampling">Nvidia’s DLSS</a> and AMD’s FSR. Nvidia and others have also created tools that allow your GPU to fill in the gaps between real frames rendered by the game with frames generated using deep learning tech. When this kind of tech was first introduced about six years ago or so, players complained that DLSS and other tools made games look blurry, even if it led to some performance boosts. As DLSS and similar tech have improved, the images produced looked have better and better. Today, DLSS 4.0 can produce some truly sharp-looking frames and provide some big performance gains, assuming you have a powerful enough video card.</p> <p>But some, myself included, have started to grow concerned that studios are building games around DLSS and other similar tech, and aren’t optimizing them in the way devs did in the past. When DLSS was introduced, it felt like a great tool for gamers who had a slightly older card but still wanted to play a newer game. It would let them squeeze out a bit more performance without shelling out for a pricey upgrade. Now it seems like newer games running on more advanced engines require users to turn on DLSS and frame gen to play. And so enters <em>Borderlands 4,</em> a game that has found itself at the center of this heated debate.</p>

 <p>Shortly after <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched, players on PC began to complain that the game didn’t run very well. Gearbox responded with some updates that, at least in my experience with the game on PC, helped a bit. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190?emclan=103582791474679148&amp;emgid=679602429802577921">The company also released a guide from Nvidia</a> for how to optimize the game based on your GPU and settings. And while that helped some reach better performance on PC, many others, myself included, were struggling to get the game to run well on powerful hardware. I’m rocking a 5080, and even playing the game at 1080p on medium settings led to tons of FPS drops, even while trying to play at 60FPS. That all changed when I did as Gearbox and Nvidia suggest and turned on DLSS and frame gen. Now, I can run <em>Borderlands 4</em> at a mostly locked 120 with most settings set to high and medium. It looks nice and plays fine, but many aren’t okay with a game in 2025 being unable to run on high-end hardware without some upscaling assistance.</p> <p>Not helping matters is the fact that Randy Pitchford posted, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">as part of a recent and lengthy thread on Twitter</a>, that people should use DLSS because it’s “great” and added: <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424849653236055">“The game was built to take advantage of it.”</a> That, and a different part of the thread claiming it was acceptable for devs to focus on “default settings” reaching only 30FPS, didn’t go over well with a lot of PC gamers who specifically buy new parts and upgrade their rigs to achieve high framerates at high resolutions. For many, Pitchford’s claim that <em>Borderlands 4</em> was developed to “take advantage” of DLSS was him confirming that it was built with the assumption that most users would use DLSS. And that, to some, sounds a lot like the game wasn’t properly optimized to run without help from DLSS and frame generation.</p>

 <p>While I do agree that newer DLSS and frame gen tools are powerful and impressive, it feels weird that<em> Borderlands 4,</em> along with other games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, demand that even users with the highest-end hardware lean on upscaling tech to play at decent settings and historically popular framerates like 120. In a recent video, the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting"><em>Digital Foundry</em> weren’t impressed with <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> on PC, with one even saying: “[<em>Borderlands 4</em>] does seem to be running worse than usual for an Unreal Engine 5 game. It is below where it seems like it should be given how other games using this engine perform.”</p> <p>Pitchford has promised on Twitter that more updates are coming, including some more improvements to how the game runs on PC. He’s also been spending a lot of time online <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967351908613665255">helping people improve how <em>Borderlands 4</em> runs</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187">claiming that performance issues are not as widespread</a> as some might make you believe. Personally, I just miss when games could run on a high-end computer packed with powerful hardware without needing four different upscaling tools. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/597391905481847754/?l=portuguese&amp;ctp=6">And it seems I’m not alone</a>.</p>
