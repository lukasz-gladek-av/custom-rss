<p>Recently, gamers were celebrating National Video Game Day, and a social media campaign saw many brands asking users what their favourite game of all time was. One unlikely Hollywood star popped into the trend to make his feelings known, revealing a title that’s not representative of the edgy, intimidating characters he’s known to play on the big screen.</p>



<p>Danny Trejo’s favourite video game of all time is Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wasn-t-expecting-that">Wasn’t Expecting That</h2>



<p>Danny Trejo is no stranger to the world of gaming. He has appeared in several roles over the years that have taken him from Far Cry to Call of Duty, and his acting career spans more than forty years. It turns out he’s partial to playing games, too – the  80-year-old star revealed that his favourite game of all time is Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>



<p>It seems bizarre to some that one of the toughest actors in Hollywood, who is partial to playing utterly badass characters, loves such a cutesy game.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch-exclusive title was released in 2020 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, with many users pouring onto the platform to create an ersatz life in place of the one they’d had restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It became a global sensation, with players worldwide using the freedom of New Horizons to create wonderful islands for others to explore.</p>



<p>Danny Trejo loves Animal Crossing, it seems. Fans of the game took to the comments <a href="https://x.com/officialDannyT/status/1810344789097000974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">under Danny’s post</a> to ask him a string of questions concerning his island, his favourite villager, or how many bells he’s amassed, but the actor hasn’t responded to any follow-up comments just yet.</p>

<p>BioShock 4 – which isn’t the official name of the developing title – is a long time coming. It has now been more than a decade since the last BioShock game hit the market, and fans of the franchise are <strong>hungry </strong>for something new. Ken Levine’s Judas should help fill the gap for a while, but a new BioShock game is long overdue – and 2K’s Cloud Chamber studio is looking to right that wrong by hiring en masse to flesh out the team working on the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-give-us-something">Just Give Us Something</h2>



<p>BioShock is a fantastic franchise beloved by millions, and the origins of the series stretch back almost twenty years. It’s a three-part franchise that toys with reality, giving players fantastical powers and presenting them with immersive stories that unfold in almost mythical locations: a city deep under the ocean and an entire civilisation living in the clouds on airships, for example. </p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was recently discovered</a> that work on the next BioShock game is ramping up, with 2K Cloud Chamber, the studio working on the project, posting 30 open positions covering everything from cinematics to narrative. With these positions opening up, it seems unlikely that the development of ‘BioShock 4’ is too far down the line, and last year, a report emerged suggesting that the game had found itself in ‘development hell’.</p>



<p>In May 2023, it was claimed that writing a ‘worthy script’ had been one of the biggest issues with the game’s development, but it was also mentioned that the game was ‘on track’ to release in 2025, which now seems unlikely. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-partners-sony-palworld/</link>

<p>Pocketpair has just made two announcements, the first of which concerns a partnership in the form of a joint venture with Sony Music Entertainment and Aniplex focused on the development of Palworld. It was revealed that through this joint venture, Palworld Entertainment Inc. has been founded ‘for the purpose of accelerating the multifaceted global development of Palworld and its further expansion.’</p>



<p>It was also announced that a line of Palworld merchandise is being created and will soon be available to pre-order from Aniplex Online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-bigger">Getting Bigger</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Pocketpair revealed the joint venture between itself and Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) that’s poised to ‘promote new developments of Palworld’. Presently, Palworld isn’t available on PlayStation, but recently, comments from the leadership team at the company suggested it’s only a matter of time before it comes to the platform. This partnership could be a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this joint venture <strong>specifically mentions </strong>that <a href="https://pwe.jp/news/?article_id=65765">game licenses aren’t included</a> as part of the deal – but that doesn’t mean there aren’t plans to align further down the road. It’s not like PlayStation and Sony Music sit under the same roof, but it’s the closest we’ve been yet to an announcement that Palworld is coming to PS platforms.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end with merchandise, either. Fans are expecting something like a Palworld anime to surface in the future, which would challenge the paradigm established by Pokémon to no end. Despite Nintendo not being bothered by Palworld’s existence, edging into the territory of merchandise could mean that trading cards, plushies, and other items emerge soon that start edging a little too close to Pokémon’s world for comfort.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Just as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-ffxiv">Endwalker</a> opened with you and the crew setting sail for the distant city of Old Sharlayan, Final Fantasy XIV’s Dawntrail expansion kicks off with a long cruise to a place we’ve never been before. But instead of connecting with a long-referenced society, you step into an entire region no one from Eorzea knows very much about. From the outset, venturing into the Mesoamerican and Latin American-inspired land of Tural might lead you to believe that this is a summer vacation for a band of heroes that has saved entire realms from calamity. However, I can assure you that whatever you thought Dawntrail was, that’s exactly what it’s not. It’s the start of a new era for the MMO, and the growing pains of that transition can be apparent at times – but Dawntrail manages to prove once again why FFXIV is the standard-bearer for the Final Fantasy series.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This latest expansion explores culture, family, and legacy in ways FFXIV hasn’t in the past – and before long, it begins to ask questions about the lengths we’ll go to preserve the things we hold dearest. On the surface, that will sound familiar to anyone who has stuck around all these years, but Dawntrail takes its own angle on these themes as to not retread well-worn territory. Instead, it offers new perspectives that, at times, hit just as hard as anything in the MMO’s 14-year history. The main scenario quest (MSQ) takes you in unpredictable directions, blending its deep real-world influences with high-tech sci-fi that incorporates concepts seen in the cyberpunk genre, and then manages to weave in the Final Fantasies of yore and have it all still make sense.</p><p>It takes some work to get there, however. I appreciate the groundwork Dawntrail lays in the first half of the main questline, painting such a vivid picture of Tural with all its cultural context at the forefront. Deep cuts are tucked underneath the more obvious references to the inspirations it draws from – we all know what tacos and mezcal are, but having a quest focus on the in-world cochinita pibil recipe is one example of several nice touches. From the architecture of the hub city of Tuliyollal to the vibrant environmental design of its early zones, Dawntrail wears its influences on its sleeve, naturally fitting those societies and the peoples who embody them into an already-rich fantasy world.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>At critical points, I was reminded that FFXIV always gets me in my feelings in ways no other piece of fiction can, game or otherwise.</p></div><p>But for as fascinating as the cultural exploration is, there’s a noticeable lack of momentum in the way you experience the story, which doesn’t surprise me given the nature of establishing a whole new story arc. For roughly the first half of MSQ, you travel across the lands of Tural alongside a new character named Wuk Lamat, a naive but always-optimistic female Hrothgar who has a heart of gold. She’s in the middle of an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-is-like-playing-a-great-one-piece-game">anime-like tournament arc</a> against her siblings in hopes of becoming the new Dawnservant, or ruler, of Tural. This leads you to gain an intimate connection with the region’s people and bridge gaps between the seemingly disparate societies of each zone. It's structured so that you go through similar motions for very long stretches, and the story itself in the early goings is written in a way that’s uncharacteristically surface-level. Not everything needs to be poetic and profound (and Dawntrail eventually gets there), but conflicts are brought up and resolved in a rather simplistic manner that isn’t as powerful as the story seems to want you to feel they are. Instead, I found unraveling the complicated relationships between the siblings to be one of the highlights in the front half, which is an interesting dynamic that remains consistent throughout.</p><p>Initially, I was quite surprised that Wuk Lamat is essentially the main character of Dawntrail while you, as the Warrior of Light, and your Scion friends are put in supporting roles. However, she <em>is </em>the link that connects you to the new region and having her as your lens while being part of her traveling band provides the necessary context as for why you’re involved in the first place (other than not having much to do back in Eorzea and seeking adventure for the sake of it). I like Wuk Lamat as a character since she has the heart to carry Dawntrail’s themes, but she isn’t really given the depth needed to be a de facto protagonist. FFXIV hasn’t really used this kind of approach to its characters before – even as the Warrior of Light, the supporting cast has always played their part in uplifting the story as a whole. The closest thing in past expansions is the Crystal Exarch from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/12/ffxiv-shadowbringers-review">Shadowbringers</a>, but his personality immediately shined and his impact was unmistakable whether he was on-screen or not. So, when Wuk Lamat extolls the virtues of peace without fully grasping the nuances that come with that, it tends to ring hollow.</p><p>With a tinge of shonen-style “power of friendship” energy, Dawntrail has its heart in the right place – and although it sometimes seems superficial, it’s nice to have a story that outright says that embracing our differences and engaging in an honest cultural exchange would make the world a better place, which Wuk Lamat does represents admirably. Its quest structure can sometimes be unexciting, but I’m hesitant to say that FFXIV is finally showing its limitations or anything because I’ve seen quests (main and optional) be truly creative within the confines of its MMO bounds over the years. Rather, it’s apparent that Dawntrail’s storytelling priorities mean it has a lot to get through while moving you along at a pace that tries not to drag on too much.</p><p>There were a few times where I began to question what Dawntrail was really building towards. Every expansion has a sense of momentum to it right from the beginning, and this one’s new start presents a challenge that FFXIV hasn’t really had to face since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review">A Realm Reborn</a>. However, some well-designed dungeons, engaging boss fights with fresh battle mechanics, and hype moments in story-based solo instances kept me engaged and invested – and if anything, I was just happy to be along for the ride. That’s also because I knew I would inevitably hit a turning point in Dawntrail, like all of FFXIV expansions tend to have – and when I got there, it left me floored with revelations that ripple throughout the MMO’s long history.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Michael Higham's Personal Final Fantasy Rankings</h3><p>To be clear, I do like every entry listed in here.</p></div><p>The switch flipped in the second half, which ushers you into FFXIV’s version of the old-timey American West. Hearing a Texan accent, let alone an American one, in FFXIV for the first time gave me whiplash on the same level as any plot twist. It’s charming as hell how another piece of the real world effortlessly blends into the rest of the expansion’s personality. That’s also to say that what it has up its sleeve deeper in creates a stark contrast that is both conceptually and aesthetically superb. The high-tech sci-fi aspect of Dawntrail is pretty well-known in the lead up to its release – the main city of Solution Nine was revealed well beforehand, but it’s the reasons for bringing you there that make for quintessential FFXIV storytelling. It goes for some wild swings, and in this second half, contains truly stunning moments I’m still trying to wrap my head around.</p><p>It fills me with joy to be genuinely surprised by a game I thought I’d known so well. Having been so invested in FFXIV for all these years and carrying many of my favorite story moments into my own life, I can’t always expect it to keep reaching those highs. Yet, Dawntrail does it again – perhaps not as consistently or elegantly, but it has left a significant impact nonetheless. It questions what makes family important, asks why we harbor such resentment for those different from us, and shows what’s possible when we work together. More effectively, it also builds on the questions posed in Shadowbringers and Endwalker, about how we handle loss, mortality, and the inevitable passage of time sweeping away the things we hold dear – and the uncomfortable truth that we ascribe value to life because it <em>will </em>end. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This expansion is a worthy extension of FFXIV, and it leaves a world of fascinating possibilities. </p></div><p>At critical points, I was reminded that FFXIV always gets me in my feelings in ways no other piece of fiction can, game or otherwise. Much of that can be attributed to the fact that certain characters I’ve loved continue to grow and be voices of reason to give clarity when everything else in my life feels like utter chaos. Yes, you are venturing into new and compelling beginnings in a land foreign to the characters you’ve been with for years, but Dawntrail is made stronger for the way it remembers where it came from.</p><p>Part of me feels like Dawntrail conjoins two very different halves, and I often imagine the depth to which FFXIV could have explored its larger themes had it dedicated more time to one or the other. But with just enough connective tissue for its hard-hitting moments to not ring hollow, it’s able to land with the same kind of impact that previous expansions have, and for its own reasons. If there’s one particular theme to point toward, it’s that peace isn’t just the absence of war but a two-way street that must be worked for – whether that be peace in the world or the struggle for inner peace amid indelible heartbreak and tragedy. </p><p>For all its shortcomings in the earlier hours, it certainly makes good on the ideas it tries to build. The way Dawntrail wields its final zone as a storytelling device, conceptually and visually, left me shocked and with my stomach in knots. The absolute onslaught of its last few dungeons had me on the edge of my seat frantically executing my attack rotation. The creative battle mechanics that even surprised me as a long-time Savage raider left me grinning as I took those Damage Down debuffs like a champ. And to have fought almost all those battles alongside my favorite characters through the Duty Support system let these gameplay sequences also shine as peaks in its storytelling.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The emotional core that always ushers FFXIV’s best moments is found in its music. Composer Masayoshi Soken alongside the sound team has broken new ground for the MMO, and for Final Fantasy as a series, here in Dawntrail. The Spanish and Latin American influences have been effortlessly woven into the songs that fill the new zones and towns with wonder and excitement, and the Flamenco-style battle theme is stuck in my head as I write this. The wistful melodies of the old western guitar riffs in Xak Tural standout as catchy tunes that set an unmistakable mood. Then you have synth-infused metal and trance tracks for pivotal battles that pack a punch unlike anything else in Dawntrail’s eclectic soundtrack. And yes, there are some really sweet lo-fi beats to chill or study to. Oh, and let’s not forget the jazzy swing theme of the new hub city of Tuliyollal. Regardless of style, Soken and company create incredible music that bends, fuses, and elevates genres while consistently incorporating the classical musical themes that naturally become part of the storytelling experience – just another common W for FFXIV.</p><p>Story may be at the forefront of Dawntrail’s launch, but with a new expansion comes tons of new content on top – most notably the two new Jobs: Pictomancer and Viper. After leveling Pictomancer and perfecting its attack rotation full of adorable painting abilities turned destructive, it’s become one of my all-time favorite expansion Jobs. Pictomancer is so cute, so unserious, and so much damn fun to play as. It finds a middle ground between its magic DPS counterparts Black Mage and Summoner; not so complex that you’ll struggle to learn but not so simple that you’ll mindlessly cycle through your rotation. Popping your paintings pre-pull is an adorable visual, as is dropping Moogle poms before whipping out a magic hammer to crush your foes. It’s satisfying when you line up all the cooldowns and casts while bouncing between the different spells you’re expected to execute, and as of now, it sits pretty high on the DPS charts (although some tweaks are planned to mitigate certain exploits).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pictomancer is so cute, so unserious, and so much damn fun to play as.</p></div><p>Viper on the other hand isn’t quite as exciting as I’d hoped – maybe it’s because I’ve played melee DPS for most of my time in FFXIV and have stuck with Ninja through every raid tier. But in contrast to Pictomancer, it lacks that rewarding buildup and burst window, or even a distinct personality to make it stand out within a crowded field of DPS Jobs. Don’t get me wrong, it looks cool as hell to see a Viper swap between dual swords and the double-sided blade, but when compared to Reaper (which shares similarities), the dynamic of Viper’s branching attack rotation doesn’t quite reach those satisfying heights. At launch, the development team even said that it’ll be reworking Viper, and although it’s impossible to say how that might change the core concept of the Job, there is certainly potential for it to grow into a better one.</p><p>As per usual, there are two Expert-level dungeons in the post-game, both of which make good use of the more whimsical settings of Dawntrail and experiment with a few new battle mechanics. And although I’m still progressing through them as of writing this, the Extreme trials currently available stretch the base-level boss fights into wild and chaotic battles. The other important piece of content worth mentioning are the role quests, which carry on the tradition of providing additional backstory based on the Jobs you have leveled up. They’re not quite as defining as the ones seen in Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but they are worth seeing through and add a nice touch to tie in other parts of FFXIV. The lasting legacy of Dawntrail also lies in future patch content – the Arcadion raid series, the Beastmaster special Job, Cosmic Exploration, and all the new things the FFXIV team will roll out over the next two years. I’ll be sat ready for them when they arrive, but for now, Dawntrail has earned its place in the pantheon of great expansions.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Dawntrail has some growing pains and notable lulls as it establishes a new era for Final Fantasy XIV, but the compelling cultures of the Tural region are strong enough to carry you to its greater moments – it’s also nice to see real-world influences near and dear to me represented so well in FFXIV. And though it takes a bit to get there, once the main story flips the switch and shows you what it’s really about, it hits the kinds of peaks we’ve seen from the MMORPG time and time again. Dawntrail left me floored with a unique sense of self-reflection and stunned by spectacular combat encounters, and to go through that journey with characters I’ve grown to love, both new and old, proves that this experience can only exist in the form that it does. This expansion is a worthy extension of FFXIV, and it leaves a world of fascinating possibilities for the future. Dawntrail doesn’t forget that this is a Final Fantasy story, and the way it ties in its past, present, and future makes for incredible moments that continue to uplift and define the series.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Xbox Game Pass service is undergoing, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-tier-changes-cod/">rumored</a>, some major changes, and some them will go into effect in just a few hours.</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft confirmed that from July 10th, the price for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Core, and PC Games Pass will be <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased globally</a>. In the United States, for example, the price for Game Pass Ultimate will be increased from $16.00 to $19.99 for the monthly subscription and from $59.99 to $74.99 for the 12-month subscription, while the Game Pass PC subscription will see a monthly price increase from $9.99 to $11.99. The price for recurring charges will be increased after September 12th to give users the chance to cancel their subscriptions before the price increase goes into effect for them.</p>
<p>In addition to price increases, Microsoft also confirmed today that Game Pass for consoles will no longer be available for new members starting tomorrow, and a new option called Xbox Game Pass Standard will be introduced in the coming months. This option includes Xbox Live Gold multiplayer and grants access to Xbox's back catalog, but it will not include day-one games and cloud gaming. Those already subscribed to Game Pass for consoles and have automatic renewal will be able to continue enjoying their membership.</p>
<p>Aside from the Standard option, console players will still be able to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Core, which grants access to multiplayer on consoles. Its annual price, as mentioned above, will increase from $59.99 to $74.99, but its monthly price will remain the same, $9.99.&nbsp; More information on the changes announced today can be found <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">here.</a></p>

<p>After months of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-to-make-changes-to-xbox-game-pass-tiers-because-of-call-of-duty-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors and speculation</a>, Microsoft <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is officially raising the prices</a> of its Xbox Game Pass Tiers. The price increase spans across every tier along with the addition of a brand new “Standard” tier.</p>



<p>Starting on July 10, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will jump from $16.99 to $19.99 per month, a $3 increase. PC Game Pass subscriptions will jump from $9.99 to $11.99 per month and continue to give you access to day one releases.</p>



<p>As mentioned, there is a new “Standard” tier coming to Xbox Game Pass for $14.99 per month that won’t include any Day One releases. That means games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 — <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-game-pass-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the big reasons</a> for this price hike and new tier — won’t be available to you if you subscribe to the Standard plan. </p>



<p>Those who are already subscribers to Xbox Game Pass for Console at $10.99 will continue as such with access to Day One titles as long as you keep auto renewal active. The new Standard plan is only available for new members.</p>



<p>As far as the lowest plan, Xbox Game Pass Core — the replacement for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-live-gold-is-going-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Live Gold</a> — that is jumping from $59.99 per year to $74.99. That’s a 25% increase in annual cost without the inclusion of any Day One titles. The monthly rate will remain $9.99.</p>



<p>Lastly, as far as subscription extensions are concerned, Microsoft is limiting them to 13 months.</p>



<p>These new prices will begin for existing members starting September 12.</p>

These tomes are great collector's items for hardcore fans, and thanks to <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/1804712/81938/2092?subId1=subid_value&amp;u=https://www.target.com/c/buy-2-get-1-books-movies-video-games-board-puzzles-and-activities-with-circle/-/N-w4m8m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target's sale this week</a>, for every two Destiny 2 books you buy, you can get a third for free.

It's due to be released on July 23 for PC (via Steam).</p><p>Pixelsplit suggests that "50% of the anomalies may be creepy, but easy to spot - the other 50% are more subtle and easy to miss." Check out the announcement trailer above, as well as the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Shift 87 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Gameplay-wise, the 2-3 hour runs look as follows: "Environment Familiarization: Navigate through each level and memorize it. Deviation Detection: Spot any deviations as you're sent through altered versions of the same environments. Anomaly Reporting: Use your designated device to report any anomalies.  Accuracy Required: Incorrect reports will lead to a reset of the sequence. Shift Completion: End your shift only after completing your run and reporting all anomalies. Workday Conclusion: Your working day ends once all scenes are reviewed and anomalies reported."</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's senior executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Xbox Game Pass Core is also getting a price increase, with its annual charge of $60 increasing to $75. However, the monthly price will remain $10. The price for PC Game Pass will increase from $10 per month to $12 per month, but will still have Day One releases. All of these price changes will take place starting on September 12.</p><p>Furthermore, Xbox Game Pass for Console codes will remain redeemable until further notice. On September 18, users will only be able to stack their subscriptions for up to 13 months. However, this won't affect any existing stacks that users may already have.</p><p>Microsoft recently revealed that this year's upcoming Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-leak-reveals-its-coming-to-game-pass-day-one/1100-6523742/" data-ref-id="1100-6523742">included in Game Pass on release day</a>. Microsoft also said that it won't be locked behind a new tier. Technically, Microsoft is staying true to its word since Ultimate is not a "new" tier.</p><p>So if you're already not subscribed to Game Pass for Console and grandfathered in by tomorrow, you'll have to be part of the Ultimate tier to play it on release day through the subscription.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has confirmed sweeping changes - including price increases - to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service in the run-up to October's launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which will include the removal of day one releases for its overhauled basic tier.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-major-changes-with-a-new-tier-without-day-one-games-and-a-range-of-price-increases">Windows Central</a>, which says Microsoft has now confirmed the details, the first big Game Pass change comes with the imminent closure of the $10.99/month Xbox Game Pass for Console. While this will continue to be available to existing members until their subscription expires (notably, from 12th September, Microsoft will only allow users to stack Game Pass for Console for up to 13 months), new users looking for a basic tier package will need to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Standard, which launches in September.
</p>
<p>
This costs $14.99/month and includes Xbox Live Gold for multiplayer gaming, plus access to Xbox's back catalogue - but not, crucially, access to first-party releases on day one. That means console players wanting to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 via Game Pass when it launches on 25th October will need to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

<p>
Ultimate, which will also remain the only Game Pass subscription tier offering access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, is getting a price increase too, with its monthly cost rising from $16.99 to $19.99. Things are a little bit different on PC insofar as PC Game Pass will continue to get day one games, but its price is also increasing - this time from $9.99/month to $11.99/month.
</p>
<p>
There's one additional price increase to note: Xbox Game Pass Core (formerly Xbox Live Gold) will see its annual cost rise from $59.99 to $74.99, but its monthly price remains $9.99. Recurring billing prices for all Game Pass offerings increase from 12th September, according to Windows Central.
</p>
<p>
All this follows Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">confirmation in May</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would be a day one Game Pass release when it launches in October. In response to reports that Microsoft was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-will-be-changes-to-xbox-game-pass-when-call-of-duty-is-added-says-industry-insider">planning "changes" to Game Pass</a> to take advantage of Black Ops 6's arrival, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-be-locked-behind-a-new-xbox-game-pass-tier">told Eurogamer</a> the game would be "playable on Xbox and PC for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass for Console members" at launch. And that still appears to be true - albeit now with an additional cost, and not if you're a new Xbox Game Pass Standard subscriber.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/homeworld-3-concept-art-making-of<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/homeworld-3-pc-review-impressions-blackbird-steam-rts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I reviewed <em>Homeworld 3</em> recently</a>, and while I had a great time with the game, my overriding emotion as the credits rolled was that it was just nice to be back. Back in the cold depths of space with some very familiar-looking starships that, for 25 years now, have been the most distinctive and <em>coolest </em>in all of video games.</p><p><a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/02/the-art-of-homeworld-enjoy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I've posted about the older games'</a> art a <em>lot </em>over the years, and one of the most reassuring things I remember about <em>Homeworld 3</em> when it was first revealed was that, yup, it looked just as good. That shouldn't have been a <em>huge</em> surprise--many of the team at developers Blackbird didn't just work on the 2016 prequel <em>Deserts of Kharak </em>but the original games themselves--but still. When such a huge part of your series' appeal is its iconic ship design, it was great to see that the new game's vessels were very much cast from the same mould.</p><p>Given how much I love these little (and very big) ships, I thought it would be neat for<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this instalment of Platform</a> to not only showcase a bunch of art from the game, but chat with some of the artists responsible for it about the pleasantries (and challenges) of adding to the legacy of such a hallmark series.</p><hr><figure></figure><h5><strong><a href="https://www.artstation.com/kpod">KARL GRYC</a></strong></h5><p><strong><em>Luke Plunkett: Hi Karl! What was your role on the game, and what did that involve?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Karl Gryc</strong>: I am the Art Director for <em>Homeworld 3</em>. My primary responsibility is to oversee the creation of all in-game art and ensure it is aligned with the franchise's established aesthetic and future. Initially I collaborated closely with Rob Cunningham and Aaron Kambeitz (<strong>Luke's note</strong>: both artists on the original game, and Cunningham is now Blackbird's CEO) to understand and absorb their vision for the game. From there, I worked with a talented art team to bring that vision to life. I split my time between guiding the art team and personally building many of the environment locations and lighting. Ultimately, the role requires wearing many hats and having fun while creating an incredible-looking game.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>LP: What's your history with the series as a fan?</strong></p><p><strong>KG</strong>: This might be a familiar story. My history with <em>Homeworld </em>dates back to the start of my career. I remember playing the original <em>Homeworld </em>and being blown away by its aesthetic. At the time, it was unlike anything I had ever seen in video games, and it inspired me to take an art career seriously. Relic Entertainment was my second job out of film school, and that's where my journey with the series truly began. In those early days at Relic, I would immerse myself in the concept art created by Rob Cunningham and Aaron Kambeitz, soaking up all their experience with the series. Decades later, I was fortunate enough to work with them directly, literally in Rob’s garage, crafting a small project that eventually evolved into <em>Deserts of Kharak</em>.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>LP: <em>Deserts of Kharak</em> itself is now somehow eight years old. How much of your work there influenced what you came up with for <em>Homeworld 3</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>KG</strong>: It's wild to think that it's been eight years. It's incredible how vividly I remember those early days on <em>Deserts of Kharak</em>. It doesn't feel that long ago, and the work we did on those vehicles is still very dear to my heart. We put a lot of effort into ensuring everything felt true to scale while also being aesthetically pleasing. The shape language we developed—how shapes feel and how lines flow—had a significant influence on <em>Homeworld 3</em>. It was less about adhering to tropes and more about bringing life and character to mechanical designs. This approach to visual design continues to shape my work to this day.</p><figure></figure><hr><figure></figure><h5><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/brennanpierre/?hl=en">BRENNAN MASSICOTTE</a></strong></h5><p><strong>LP: Hey Brennan. What was your role on the game?</strong></p><p><strong>BM</strong>: As a concept designer, it's usually the case at Blackbird that I hop in with Aaron Kambeitz to work on the art for the pitch and pre-production inspiration for our IPs. We had some big ideas to sell in <em>Homeworld 3's</em> pitch, like the flat flying wing mothership, the new stealthy ship language and space terrain. From there I mostly generated ship ideas and helped develop the fleets as they evolved over time.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>LP: What's your favourite piece of work you did on Homeworld 3?</strong></p><p><strong>BM</strong>: The Hiigaran Destroyers turned out really nice and mean looking. The basic hull has quite an aggressive stance which makes it feel authentically military to me. I've always been a huge fan of Aaron's older resourcer units so getting to put my spin on the new ones was a dream come true.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>LP: What was it like trying to balance the legacy of the series' art style with the need to create new units and settings for <em>Homeworld 3</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>BM</strong>: With the ships in particular it was important to preserve enough of the overall roles and stances players expect, but bring the designs forward a few decades. To do that we tried to take the older ideas and make them sleeker and more aggressive feeling. The Mothership is a great example because it retains so much of the core idea, but feels like a flying knife chiseled out of stealth angles. Aaron has been developing and refining the style of the <em>Homeworld </em>ships for decades and I think we had confidence that the direction was awesome enough people wouldn’t mind some creative divergence.</p><figure></figure><hr><figure></figure><h5><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/paulchadeisson/?hl=en">PAUL CHADEISSON</a></strong></h5><p><strong>LP: Hello Paul! When did you first come onto the project, and what kind of work did you do once onboard?</strong></p><p><strong>PC</strong>: I first came in the project during pre-production. My initial task was to examine what some of the different missions of the game might look like. Most of <em>Homeworld 3</em>'s levels already had some illustrations and designs done for them, but they also needed a slightly different look. It was awesome to be able to play with all of Blackbird's material, tons of concepts and designs had already been made so I just had to bounce off their existing ideas and experiment of combine with new stuff!</p><p><strong>LP: Were you a Homeworld fan when you were younger? If so, what was it like getting the chance to work on the game now?</strong></p><p><strong>PC</strong>: I knew about the game when I was in college, from people in my class, they just kept talking about this "Homeworld" game, but I had no idea what it actually looked like since I had no computer at the time! Years later, when I was working on my own video game <em>Strike Vector</em>, my friend and programmer Cédric Lecacheur started showing me some <em>Homeworld </em>games, and my memories connected when I heard the title, then finally got to discover all the games! To me, <em>Homeworld</em> has some of the most original visuals and design; it was amazing as an artist to join such a team, and learn with the best!</p><p><strong>LP:</strong><a href="https://aftermath.site/paul-chadeisson-solstice-5-short" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong> Like we've talked about previously</strong></a><strong>, you're a big fan of stuff that's BIG. What was it like working on <em>Homeworld</em>, where there's so much big stuff, but that scale can sometimes be hard to portray in space?PC</strong>: </p><p><strong>PC</strong>: Blackbird had already done a lot of visual research before I joined the project, and had found a very good balance on how to represent those megastructures in space. It was very refreshing, and opened a lot of creative gates in my own ideas for art direction. The ideas behind what you're trying to represent go on to influence everything else--the shapes, the scale, the texture--and you need to make sure everything makes sense. Focusing on just doing something at a big scale is not an easy thing to do; rather, you need to find the appropriate shape and scale to a specific design, try to have something that makes sense.</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ys-x-nordics-hands-on-adols-next-adventure-is-filled-with-action-vikings-and-boats<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Same ship, different day.</h2></div><section><p>Per the series’ longstanding tradition, Ys X: Nordics, the latest chapter in the long-running action-RPG saga starring Adol Christin, has left fans in the West waiting quite a long time before they can get in on the fun. Thankfully, that wait is about to end, and after an hour hopping between various sections of the game to check out its dual-combatant action, get a taste of its all-important story, and even try my hands at the new naval battle system, I’m inclined to think this seafaring tale might end up being worth the customary localization delay. By swapping out the usual larger party seen in recent Ys games for just two characters, Nordics benefits from a more focused experience, whether that be its action-packed combat or its seemingly more concentrated story. Those changes proved more than enough to reignite my interest in this longrunning odyssey.</p><p>If you’ve somehow managed to avoid Ys (pronounced like “ease”) for the past 37 years, this series follows the dramatic adventures of a young adventurer named Adol, most of which involve a whole lot of swashbuckling sword fights and larger-than-life stories. Ys X: Nordics brings him to the viking-inspired Obelia Gulf to fight against undead creatures called the Griegr, and make a new warrior princess friend named Karja. If you’ve missed some entries in the series though, fear not, as each adventure is mostly self-contained, and as this one takes place after Ys II from way back in 1988, you won’t be expected to learn too much anyway. I was basically caught up on everything I needed to know after a quick cutscene introducing a couple returning characters and ready to beat up a giant, evil salamander in typical Ys fashion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ys X: Nordics Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Each Ys game brings its own particular style, and Nordics is no exception. The biggest change is the decision to move away from the typical party system found in more recent entries, opting instead to focus on just two characters: Adol and Karja. This impacts everything from the combat, which has been tuned around these two mighty warriors, and the story, which even early on already felt like it would be much more focused than some previous Ys entries.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest change is the decision to move away from the typical party system found in more recent entries, opting instead to focus on just two characters: Adol and Karja.</p></div><p>Combat was smooth, quick, and even a little challenging, as I was expected to swap between Karja, whose nordic strength made it a breeze to peel off enemy armor, and good ol’ Adol, who I used to deal finishing blows once my opponents had been stripped of their defenses. There were far too many menus and upgrade options for me to get a good grip of things during my brief demo, but it was clear to me there’s quite a bit to master, like learning the joint attacks I was able to unleash after building up enough mana.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That focus on the story’s two protagonist has an impact on the plot too, as Falcom president Toshihiro Kondo told me, “By limiting it to only two characters that you do more with, it actually allowed [the development team] to do more with that because they knew that they could focus everything on [Karja].” As someone who can get exhausted by convoluted stories with too many characters to follow, that was music to my ears.</p><p>There’s a more practical reason too: the smaller scope. As Kondo-san told me, “We wanted to put this one on the [Nintendo] Switch, and when you have that many party members, there’s kind of a limitation on the console itself.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be an Ys game without some new mechanic to shake things up, and in Nordics, that mechanic – true to the viking vibes it's got going for it – is naval combat. In the short bit of it I played, I fought off waves of enemies with cannonfire, while targeting shield generators to power down a force field protecting an island. This goofy section definitely was amusing, with cannonballs cartoonishly homing in on their targets, but also a bit overly simplistic, feeling more like a minigame than something substantial, and I can’t really see myself enjoying too much more of it over the lengthy campaign. That said, it’s hard to say how much this will evolve over the 20+ hour runtime, and it’s quite possible it will build up into something with more meat on it.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Xbox maker has started emailing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers warning of a price increase to $19.99 a month that starts on September 12th, a $3 increase over the current $16.99 a month pricing.</p><p>PC Game Pass subscribers will also see a price hike in September, with the service moving from $9.99 to $11.99 per month and maintaining access to day-one titles. If you’re outside the US and wondering how the price increases affect your own subscription, Microsoft has a full list of all the <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf">worldwide price changes here</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">price increases</a> come just before Microsoft plans to add <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and other big first-party Xbox games to its Game Pass service later this year. The price increases will largely affect Ultimate subscribers who make up the vast majority of Game Pass subscribers and come just over a year after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">last Game Pass price hikes</a> raised rates by $1–$2 per month.</p><p>Alongside the Ultimate and PC Game Pass price hikes, Microsoft will also offer a new option of an Xbox Game Pass Standard subscription without day-one titles that will be priced at $14.99 per month for new users to the service. The existing Xbox Game Pass for console subscription will continue for existing subscribers, but new Game Pass subscribers won’t be able to select the console option starting July 10th until the new Game Pass Standard subscription is available. Microsoft says Xbox Game Pass Standard “will be available in the coming months.”</p><p>The new standard option also include online console multiplayer access, which is something that Xbox Game Pass for Console lacked previously. Existing Xbox Game Pass for Console subscribers will only be able to stack for up to 13 months from September 18th, but this won’t impact existing stacks.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158934/microsoft-call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-plans">I revealed in May</a> that Microsoft was considering raising Xbox Game Pass Ultimate pricing again, amid a debate around adding <em>Call of Duty </em>to the service. A price increase to the top tier will help offset Microsoft adding Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em> series to Game Pass, and it has been largely expected since Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">made the <em>CoD </em>addition official</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As is now pretty much tradition, Sony's latest batch of PlayStation Plus catalogue additions for Extra and Premium subscribers have been leaked ahead of an official reveal, with Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion, Remnant 2, and more all reportedly on the way.
</p>
<p>
That's according to ever-reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing for <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/playstation-plus-extra-premium-juillet-2024-voici-un-apercu-des-nouveaux-titres-qui-vont-bientot-rejoindre-le-catalogue-de-jeux-54974">Dealabs</a>, says Sony will refresh its PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue on 17th July, adding the following titles:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion</li>
<li>Remnant 2</li>
<li>Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord</li>
<li>No More Heroes 3</li>
<li>Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes Complete Edition</li>
<li>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – Enhanced Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>
Billbil-kun adds that Remnant: From the Ashes, the first game in developer Gunfire Games' Remnant series (unless you count Chronos), is also likely to be part of July's Extra catalogue additions, but says they're currently unable to confirm that with 100 percent certainty.

<p>
Additional July titles for Extra subscribers and this month's selection of Classic games for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers - which Billbil-kun has not yet been able to identify - should reportedly be announced by Sony this Wednesday, 10th July.
</p>
<p>
But while we're still waiting for official confirmation on this month's Extra and Premium catalogue additions, Sony <em>has</em> announced the titles it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-headlines-playstation-plus-games-for-july">making available as part of its basic PlayStation Plus Essential tier</a> in July. Borderlands 3, Among Us, and NHL 24 are all on that list and are available to download right now, until Tuesday, 6th August.

						<h5>QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox</h5></div></div>
					<p>When they started emerging on the market, leverless controllers were considered a niche option. However, they quickly gained a lot of popularity in the fighting game community thanks to some of the clear advantages they provide compared to traditional gamepads and arcade sticks, advantages that are balanced by the time required to become proficient with such an unconventional setup.</p>
<p>Following the release of multiple gamepads, including the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/qrd-spark-n5-controller-an-affordable-solid-choice/">QRD Spark N5</a>, Chinese manufacturer QRD has now launched its first leverless controller, the <a href="https://qrdgame.com/products/qrd-maestro-s3-all-in-one-wireless-arcade-stick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox</a>. Like the other controls it has released so far, this controller is a solid proposition thanks to its price and unique features.</p>
<p>At first glance, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox leaves an excellent first impression. The build quality is extremely solid, possibly even more than similar controllers in the same price range ($169.99). Coming only in an elegant black color, the controller features the standard 12 buttons seen in most hitbox-style controllers, six additional smaller buttons (share, turbo, options, q, which is used to switch between some of the controller's unique features, L3 and R3), a front USB Type-C port, and a side headphone jack, which, alongside wireless support, makes the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox rather unique, as these are niche features found in very few leverless controllers, and definitely not in this price range. With an 800g weight and an L300*W200*H31mm size, the controller feels very comfortable to use, whether placed on a hard surface or on the legs. The nine single-color LED lights are a nice touch, and they don't impact battery life too much, which lasts around 8 hours. Charging the battery to the fullest takes around 3 hours, which is in line with pretty much every wireless controller on the market. While having a wireless option is great, however, it is currently limited as Xinput is only supported via a wired connection, but this is unlikely to be an issue for most competitive players, as, while the wireless connection works quite well, a wired connection is always preferred to reduce input delay as much as possible.</p>
<p>What is definitely an issue for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players is the lack of support for these formats, as a converter is required to use the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox with current generation consoles. This is definitely the controller's biggest issue as, while PC is becoming the platform for fighting games, in-person tournaments still use the PlayStation 5 as the platform of choice, so those who purchase the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox will have to purchase an adapter to be able to use the controller in these situations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/QRD-Maestro-2-Fixed.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It is a shame the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox doesn't support PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S out of the box because it is, honestly, a pretty great controller. Both wired and wireless setup was painless on PC and Nintendo Switch, and even on an Android device. The controller is actually a pretty viable option for mobile gaming, thanks to the included mobile attachment accessory, although I can't think of a case where someone might want to play with a hitbox-style controller on mobile, with the exception of some retro gaming. The hot-swappable mechanical switch buttons are extremely accurate and much more silent than, say, the standard Sanwa buttons, which is a definite plus for late-night players such as myself. Despite being more used to arcade sticks and pads, it did not take long for the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox to click, and I expect the controller to become my controller of choice for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> once I feel more confident with it. The controller worked great in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/">Tekken 8</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/">Guilty Grear Strive</a> as well, with no noticeable input delay with both wireless and wired connections or any other sort of issue.</p>
<p>Much like other leverless controllers, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox comes with multiple SOCD cleaning modes. The first one, which is also the mode the controller has enabled by default, returns a neutral input when holding down left and right simultaneously and an up input when holding up and down. The second mode returns a neutral input with both opposite directions held down, which is the SOCD cleaning mode required to participate in any Capcom Cup event, so, primarily playing Street Fighter 6, it is the mode I am using and the one I suggest ever Street Fighter 6 player to use. The QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox also comes with unique latency settings - Automatic, Low Latency for older arcade games, Medium Latency for more recent arcade games and emulated games, and High Latency and Highest Latency for modern and future games. To give these latency modes a proper try, I have used the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection as well, and I felt that Automatic worked well enough and just as well as low latency, so it seems a solid option to start with before proceeding to switch between other modes in case there are issues. I haven't encountered any across all of the games included in the collection, and the aforementioned Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, and Guilty Gear Strive using Automatic mode, so I'll definitely stick with it for longer.</p>
<p>The QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox also comes with one more unique feature, EZ-Mode, which should clean up inputs for better execution. Despite having limited experience with leverless controllers, I noticed no real difference with Z-Mode, as I had no trouble doing consistent DPs and quarter-circle motions using any SOCD mode. This could possibly be helpful for players new to the genre as a whole, but for a somewhat experienced player, it did not make much of a difference, if at all.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox is an excellent leverless controller that is more than worth its price tag, thanks to its solid build quality, silent buttons, wireless support, and additional features like latency features. Sadly, the lack of support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S is a major issue that will prevent the controller from becoming a more popular choice, but if you primarily play on PC and want to try out a solid leverless controller without breaking the bank, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox is undoubtedly the controller to get.</p>

<p>With its ease of use, silent and accurate buttons, and unique features such as multiple SOCD cleaning modes, Latency Modes, wireless support, and a headphone jack, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox offers more than similar leverless controllers in the same price range. Unfortunately, the lack of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S compatibility prevents the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox from being a universal choice for fighting game players, as an additional purchase of a converter is required to use the controller with current-generation consoles</p>
