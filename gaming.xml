<p>We like having banger after banger after banger. Unfortunately, things don’t always work out this way, which is why we’ve had the difficult decision to pick our top six most disappointing games of 2024—stay tuned for supreme heartbreak.</p>



<p>It’s easy to talk about the best games of 2024, but many like to leave it there. No, we need to talk about these things and remind you it’s not all roses. 2024 has had stinkers too, and I’d rather forget about the outright worst games, and fixate on the releases people were excited about, but it left them down in the dumps.</p>



<p>Like a bed-ridden Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, here’s our carefully selected assortment of most disappointing games in 2024 that didn’t deliver.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-disappointing-games-of-2024">Most Disappointing Games of 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-concord">Concord</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What else is left to say? Credit to Firewalk Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel Concord’s significance will still echo a decade or two from now. When I first played the Concord beta, I genuinely thought to myself, “This is pretty solid, but nothing special.” I reiterated these comments to my peers, and I didn’t think Concord would last long, but I didn’t think I would be as right as I was. </p>



<p>Concord’s core gunplay mechanics are solid, but it didn’t do anything special that Overwatch, Valorant, or the now-released Marvel Rivals doesn’t already do. Its content was lacking—as most free-to-play, live-service titles seem to be on release—and the minimal interest in the beta was telling. People didn’t ask for Concord, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nobody-wishlist-concord-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nobody wishlisted it</a>, and their reluctance to invest time and money is why I now refer to Concord in the past tense—it’s dead.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation shut Concord down</a> within two weeks of its launch. Its reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-cost-over-400-million-to-develop-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$400 million budget</a> makes the shooter a catastrophic failure and one of the worst ever, and developers are likely to learn a lot from Concord’s mistakes for years to come.</p>



<h3 id="h-skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Trust me, this is a rare moment of exhilaration. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>I put around 20 hours into Skull and Bones, and the moments of genuine enjoyment were fleeting at best. Skull and Bones was first announced in 2017 to much hype and excitement, with players ready for a full-blown, pillaging, and pirating adventure akin to Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. Instead, Ubisoft ended up making a much more boring version of its own game.</p>



<p>You can’t fight other crews as the action is relegated to cutscenes, harvesting resources can be done from your ship via a simplistic mini-game, and everything about Skull and Bones is uninspired: The story, the gameplay, the lackluster visuals, and the progression. The ill-conceived fast travel system forces you to regularly travel enormous distances on your ship—where very little happens.</p>



<p>Skull and Bones had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-players-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than one million players at launch</a> and shows no signs of improving. It started a familiar trend of disappointing AAA games—or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-aaaaa-games-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAAA in Skull and Bones’ case</a>—with many games underperforming—such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Beauty with no brains. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, look, another Ubisoft game. The festering stink of a Ubisoft open-world lingers all over Star Wars: Outlaws. It looks pretty on the outside, but inside, a hollow, familiar journey awaits. It makes The Force Awakens’ derivative clone of A New Hope look faultless—I do love The Force Awakens, by the way, but still.</p>



<p>Outlaws promises a new story in which we get to be bandits. It’s a novel idea and a welcome one, but throughout Outlaws’ development, trailers, and gameplay reveals, it was hard to shake the feeling we were getting a reskinned Far Cry and Assassin’s Creed entry. Again, by nature, it’s a “good” game, but not one likely to live long in the memory.</p>



<p>Worse still, its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=outlaws" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lukewarm launch caused Ubisoft’s stock to plummet</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales underperformed</a> big time. Ultimately, it pales in comparison to EA’s Star Wars Jedi series and shows you need more than an IP to become a true Jedi.</p>



<h3 id="h-lego-horizon-adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures</h3>



<figure><figcaption>This hurts my Thunderjaw. Credit to Guerrilla Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LEGO video game franchise has sold millions of copies rehashing a successful formula. Take a popular film series or game, LEGO-ify it, turn it into a collect-a-thon with amusing cutscenes and basic gameplay, and it sells like hotcakes. LEGO’s Horizon Tallneck model is excellent, and little did we know this would prompt a crossover (like Concord) no one was asking for.</p>



<p>On paper, LEGO Horizon Adventures should be a success. I don’t think Horizon gets the praise or adulation it deserves, Aloy is a great hero to follow, and its world is captivating. But when it got the LEGO-ify treatment, people didn’t gravitate toward it. Its OpenCritic rating stands at a decent 71/100—with its “Critics Recommend” score plummeting to a lowly 53%.</p>



<p>This might be a lesson to not stick “LEGO” in front of a franchise and expect gold studs to spew out.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection">Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Lazy. Credit to Aspyr</figcaption></figure>



<p>I lost so many hours to Galactic Conquest and Hero Assault in Battlefront II, and when I heard it was getting newer and, hopefully, more polished ports, I was excited to revisit it in 2024—especially after 2017’s dismal reboot disaster. I was all ready to splash out the cash on the Classic Collection, only to study the vehement backlash to its release.</p>



<p>Currently, the Classic Collection has a “Mostly Negative” verdict under its 7,000 “All Reviews” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446550/STAR_WARS_Battlefront_Classic_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The Battlefront games launched with the smallest licks of paint to polish, broken servers, missing modes featured in the original, and sus AI. Curiously, despite the full-price tags, you can actually buy “STAR WARS Battlefront (Classic, 2004)” and “STAR WARS Battlefront II (Classic, 2005)” on Steam for far less than the disastrous collection.</p>



<p>The Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection has gone under the radar somewhat, but it can’t escape the grasp of our most disappointing games of 2024 list.</p>



<h3 id="h-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Justice League didn’t need to die for this. Credit to Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admit it, you were getting worried I wasn’t going to include this. How I could not feature Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League—the live-service atrocity <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-pulls-suicide-squad-just-one-hour-into-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled from Early Access barely one hour into its launch</a>. Suicide Squad was supposed to be the video game adaptation somewhat based on the movies, only, we have the fascinating plot about killing each member of the Justice League due to Brainiac’s evil influences controlling them and making them evil.</p>



<p>Instead, Kill the Justice League is full of copy-and-paste missions, painfully slow XP grinds, repetitive content, and heinous narrative decisions undermining and destroying Rocksteady’s beautifully molded Arkham universe. I also can’t forgive Suicide Squad for being the last-ever credited role of the legendary Kevin Conroy as Batman—truly lamentable in its own right.</p>



<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League bombed, and is another entry on this list <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling short of expectations</a>. Furthermore, it lost Warner Bros. over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$200 million</a>—resulting in many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady layoffs</a>—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 spells its end</a> within a year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-revealed-on-january-8th-alleged-first-image-of-the-dock-surfaces-online.1069311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could finally be revealed in less than two weeks, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hl5l1u/chinese_weibo_leaker_who_leaked_the_whole_june/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hlp8zn/the_chinese_weibo_user_has_deleted_all_previous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> subreddits, Chinese Weibo leaker 荷姆荷姆嗼, who previously correctly revealed all the June Nintendo Direct announcements before the presentation aired, recently started a countdown based on the Fibonacci sequence numbers that will end on January 8th, which could be when the Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed. Since having been discovered, the user deleted all of their posts, changed their profile pic, and said that the countdown was for something else, but this could be an attempt to cover things up and avoid getting identified.</p>
<p>The past few days have also heated up in terms of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks with the first alleged images of the system and the dock shared by a user going by the name of <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextHandheld</a>, who garnered increased attention following<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/"> a report</a> from The Verge, which believed the supposed leaker had indeed access to the yet to be revealed new system from Nintendo. After sharing an image of the<a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> system itself</a>, which doesn't look exactly legit, the leaker shared a <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1872092668551176251?t=BgCKgr3jtPRxnDOHi8Zfog&amp;s=19">second image</a> showcasing the dock, which definitely looks more believable. Still, given how wild the alleged leaks are getting, we must take everything with a huge grain of salt until Nintendo finally lifts the lid on its next-gen system.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but the moment we finally see the system may not be<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/"> too far off</a>. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Control Is Once Again Free to Grab on the Epic Games Store]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store.1069308/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games&nbsp;<span>Store's Christmas 2024 gift is&nbsp;<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy's Control</a>. At the time this post goes live, you have another six hours or so </span>to permanently add it to your library for free.</p>
<p>Granted, it's not the first time the game&nbsp;<span>has been offered through such a promotion. The Epic Games Store itself already&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/control-free-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it away for free</a> in June 2021; the following year, AT&amp;T subscribers could <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ultimate-edition-available-for-free-through-atts-streaming-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redeem the Ultimate Edition for free</a></span>. In that light, it might be a tad underwhelming. However, for anybody who still hasn't got the chance to play the game, it's absolutely worth taking up on the freebie.</p>
<p>Released in August 2019, Control was Remedy's return to owned IPs after making Quantum Break for Microsoft. It was developed on a €30 million budget, which is relatively small for a triple-A game, and published by 505 Games. The game was highly successful for Remedy (over 4.5 million units sold), not to mention an excellent action/adventure to play, as I explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review of the game</a> where I scored it 8 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>Control features Remedy's most original setting yet, the studio's most open-ended game environment yet and great action combat that makes you feel like a badass. The game also stands out on PC as one of the finest examples of real-time ray tracing to date. It shouldn't be passed upon by any action/adventure game fans, even if it's not quite a masterpiece.</em></p>
<p>Control is part of the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-qa-sam-lake-on-the-remedy-connected-universe-and-moving-toward-open-world-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy Connected Universe</a>, which includes Alan Wake. As such, protagonist Jesse Faden has appeared in the Alan Wake 2 DLC <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night Springs</a>. She is, of course, due to reprise her role again in the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">action RPG sequel</a>, which will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-financed by Annapurna Interactive</a>. The media production company is also going to adapt the universe to the film and TV series formats.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the IP will be expanded next year with the release of the cooperative multiplayer spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, where players take the role of Federal Bureau of Control first responders who get sent to defend the FBC's HQ, the eerie, ever-shifting Oldest House, from any kind of paranatural threats.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-has-released-stats-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-last-wipe.1069305/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has published a series of graphics on social media highlighting some of the key statistics from the last wipe, which ends today as the 0.16.0.0 patch is ushered in.</p>



<p>It reveals some of the most interesting tidbits of information about Escape from Tarkov on a global scale – and it gives us a neat representation of the number of people still playing the game late into the wipe. Recently, concerns about the game’s longevity have been raised, with numbers seemingly dropping worldwide. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games revealed some interesting factoids about the most recent wipe in Escape from Tarkov, which ends <strong>today</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>62% of players opted to represent the USEC faction this wipe</li>



<li>99,288 players maxed out their Metabolism skill, the most popular skill by far</li>



<li>876,328 players were killed by Partisan, the boss character introduced in this wipe</li>



<li>692,000 players accepted Mortar Strike, a special event quest that surfaced several weeks ago</li>



<li>188,514 players accepted ‘Dark Times’ a late-wipe task that rewarded 39,000 players with ‘Kappa’</li>
</ul>



<p>It was further confirmed that the most popular weapons in Escape from Tarkov haven’t changed in the last few months. The most popular assault rifle was the M4A1, which is a staple weapon in the scene. It was followed closely behind by the AKS-74U. </p>



<p>The Mosin was king of the ‘bolties’, while the SVDS was the top choice for those running marksman rifles. Bizarrely, the most popular armour was the PACA Soft Armor, but that’s only because <strong>everyone </strong>uses it at the start of a new wipe. </p>











<p>The next wipe, which is live today, introduces the 0.16.0.0 patch, which expands and enhances Customs, tweaks visual recoil, and adds a bunch of new weapons and other items to the game.</p>



<p>How was your last wipe? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The in-game image and abilities of the Human Torch in Marvel Rivals have leaked online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As revealed by reliable leaker RivalsLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871707483691245587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the Human Torch is one of the upcoming heroes Marvel Rivals developers seem to be working on. In-game images and abilities of the character have surfaced online, hinting that he might be arriving soon. The character is seen wearing his Fantastic 4 uniform, with his whole body engulfed in flames. Additionally, his hair, eyebrows, and eyes match the colour of the fire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same thread, RivalsLeaks has also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871707598703272309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> the in-game abilities page for the Human Torch in Marvel Rivals. The character’s primary attack is the Fire Cluster, the secondary attack is Blazing Blast, and his Team-Up ability with Storm is called Omega Fire. Other abilities include Supernova, Plasma Body, Pyro-Prison, and Flaming Meteor. Check out what each Human Torch ability does below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Fire Cluster (Left Click): Launches a splittable fireball at the enemy</li>



<li>Omega Fire (X): This team-up ability allows Storm to consume the Human Torch’s fire tornado and add it to her hurricane. Alternatively, the Human Torch can also consume Storm’s Hurricane to create a fiery hurricane that enlarges and intensifies all the fire tornadoes found while the ability is active.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Supernova (Q): The Human Torch will release a shockwave that damages enemies within a radius. During the activation of this skill, flame fields will turn into flame tornadoes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Plasma Body (L-Shift) This ability allows the Human Torch to enter a state of accelerated ascent.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pyro-Prison (E): Through this ability, players can connect flame fields to create a fire wall that can burn enemies to deal damage.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Flaming Meteor (F): This ability will make the Human Torch dive to the ground and stun nearby enemies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Blazing Blast (Right Click): Players can create a flame field in a targeted area by launching a fireball through this ability.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

                <p dir="ltr">Many of us have a game franchise that, despite liking everything we hear about it, we have never actually played any of the games. I have a few, but one notable blind spot in my gaming resume was Yakuza, or as it's called now, Like A Dragon.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd been told by many friends that the series has something for everyone, from heavy action scenes to lighthearted goofiness, all with real emotion at the center… and yet I still never found the time. This year saw the release of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and for a while I thought it would be just another game to add to my backlog. However, thanks to a freelance opportunity, I finally found my excuse to play a Like A Dragon game for the first time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415490" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415490"></a><figcaption>Listening to Orlando's story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Through the first few chapters, I was enjoying myself, but I wasn't yet seeing what others had told me about the series all these years. That changed in Chapter 4, when I approached a shaved-ice shop on the streets of Hawaii, and Substory 24: Let It Snow began.</p><p dir="ltr">Let It Snow begins with Ichiban finding a man in a plaid shirt buying shaved ice (also known as a snow cone) at a local shop. Curiously, the man asks for no toppings on his dessert, and then once he receives the treat, he throws it into the air. As the ice immediately melts--this is Hawaii, after all--the man screams in anguish and leaves distraught. Ichiban watches this happen, and other than feeling it's really strange, doesn't think much more of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Later, we find the same man being denied shaved ice at a second stand, as the proprietor had caught wind of his weird motives. Dejected, the man sits at a nearby bench, where Ichiban can sit with him and learn his story.</p><p dir="ltr">It turns out this man, whose name we learn is Orlando, is trying to fulfill his wife Ellie's dying wish: "I want to see the snow with you again." The couple, Orlando explains, have a lot of fond memories involving snow, including their honeymoon in Japan, and while he wanted to take her back, real-life responsibilities got in the way. She wants to see snow fall with her beloved one more time before she dies, which can be any time now. Ichiban agrees to help, and the two part ways for the moment.</p><p dir="ltr">So, uh, yeah…when I first saw a weird old dude throwing shaved ice into the sky, I did not think it would lead me to "super emotional story about a man trying to help his wife on her deathbed." This is exactly the kind of thing my friends have been telling me about, and I have to admit it's effective. That's the beauty of the writing at work here; just when you think you have it all figured out, Like A Dragon surprises you. And, as the Substory continued, surprise me it <em>absolutely did</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Later on in a nearby shopping center, Ichiban watches a woman lose a stroller down an escalator. Ichiban chases the stroller--the chase consisting of quick-time events to complete--until he catches it and brings it to a stop. Ichiban looks into the stroller, only to find <em>a grown man in a diaper staring back at him</em>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415492" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415492"></a><figcaption>Not what you'd expect to see in a bassinet!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is Susumu Gondawara, a yakuza boss from a previous game who veteran Like A Dragon players would know to expect, but I was completely caught off guard. This hulking baby man says his stroller got away from the "nanny" he hired, and he wants Ichiban to take him back to her. However, three of Gondawara's henchmen--also, inexplicably, in nothing but diapers--accuse Ichiban of kidnapping Gondawara, and the fight is on.</p><p dir="ltr">Once they're defeated, Gondawara asks for some milk--and the only place to find it is a nearby shaved-ice truck, which uses condensed milk as a topping. One of the henchmen gets in line, only for a man in a familiar plaid shirt to force himself into the front and ask for a shaved ice with no topping.</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Ichiban, Orlando, and Gondawara all speak together, and try to come up with a solution to the problem. Orlando worries they're running out of time, and Ichiban throws his shaved ice to the ground in frustration… however, the group notices that the ice didn't melt, and instead turned to a snow-like substance. How did this happen?</p><p dir="ltr">Are you ready?</p><p dir="ltr">You'll never guess…</p><p dir="ltr">It turns out that the absorbent of the diapers Gondawara and his men are wearing <em>mixed with the shaved ice</em>, and the combination created the "snow." I'd heard Like A Dragon could be wacky, but I don't think I realized just how wacky things could get. After Gondawara explains the difference between his group's "baby play" fantasy and real-world honor, the three agree to a plan.</p><p dir="ltr">The scene then shifts to the hotel where Orlando and Ellie are staying, where--and I cannot believe I'm typing these words--Ichiban, Gondawara, and the underlings mix diaper absorbent with shaved ice, then throw it off of the rooftop of the hotel. Orlando and Ellie, together in their room just below said rooftop, see the "snow" come through the window and are delighted.</p><p dir="ltr">Ellie calls Orlando a "magician," before asking for one more last wish: She wants to see Orlando smile one last time before she falls asleep. He obliges, tears welling in his eyes, and she eventually falls asleep for the final time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415493" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415493"></a><figcaption>Ellie's final moments.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So, to recap, in order to help a desperate man fulfill the final wish of his dying wife, our hero Ichiban:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Enlisted the help of a man who likes to act as a baby</li><li dir="ltr">Mixed absorbent from that man's adult diaper supply with shaved ice to create "snow"</li><li dir="ltr">Threw the mixture off of a roof, so the desperate man and his wife could see it fall from the room below.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">And yet, despite the sheer wackiness making this whole thing happen, the heart at the core of the scene cannot be denied. Ichiban stepped up to help a stranger, simply because he could, and he made a dying woman's final wish come true in the process. Once the "snow" started to fall, and the scene focused on Orlando and Ellie, I forgot about the absurdities of it all and focused on the relatable, human story at the center of the Substory, and it filled me with a warmth that most games aren't capable of creating… until the scene switches back to Ichiban and company, where Gondawara's henchmen are laying on the rooftop exhausted--and buck naked. It's a last bit of wackiness to send us off; this is Like A Dragon, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">After years of being told I would like this series, and never having time to check it out, Infinite Wealth was officially my first foray into what Like A Dragon/Yakuza has to offer. Thanks to Substory 24: Let It Snow, I've seen the light. I'm sold, and I plan to go back and see what I've been missing all this time as soon as possible--and all it took was a little "winter" magic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

			<p>While 2024 may have felt light in terms of new fighting game franchises, the past year still delivered plenty of excitement for fans of the genre, especially thanks to the release of new entries in some of the most celebrated series in gaming history, such as the Tekken and Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi series. Whether you prefer going head-to-head with your opponents using your iron fists, unleashing ki blasts, pulling off perfect piledrivers, or knocking them off platforms while wavedashing toward them, 2024 offered plenty of opportunities to unleash your fighting spirit against.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a></em></p>
<h2>Tekken 8 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tekken8-key-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The wait for a new King of the Iron First tournament has been long, but the wait has been repaid in full, as Tekken 8 is a game worthy of being part of one of the best fighting games series ever. While the game does leave something to be desired when it comes to single-player content, especially compared to previous entries in the series, and the netcode doesn't always deliver a smooth experience if both players don't have a flawless internet connection, the amazing learning tools it offers and the diverse character roster, which has started expanding beyond the boundaries of the franchise with the introduction of Final Fantasy XVI's protagonist Clive Rosfield, make it one of the best fighting games of the generation for the competitive-minded players. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review:</p>
<p><em>Featuring cutting-edge visuals for fighting games and exceptional learning tools, Tekken 8 stands out as one of the best releases in the fighting game genre over the last few years. While the netcode is generally acceptable, regrettably, it falls short of replicating the seamless offline experience, a drawback that significantly affects the overall experience way more than the limited amount of single player content and somewhat diminishes the effectiveness of the game's outstanding learning tools, particularly for those unable to engage in offline multiplayer matches.</em></p>
<h2>WWE 2K24 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/">8</a>)</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WWE-2K24.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>The WWE 2K series has had it rough in the past few years. After stumbling badly with WWE 2K20, the series by Visual Concept had to take one year off to find its footing again, which it somewhat did with WWE 2K22 and WWE 2K23, whose formula, while far from being the best, showed some promise. With WWE 2K24, however, the series finally made a proper comeback from its dark age, with fun new mechanics and match types and a great selection of play modes. The core action could still use some refinements, but it definitely seems like Visual Concept is on the right track to bring the series back to greatness, to the joy of all WWE fans all over the world. Here's what Nathan Birch had to say about the game in his review.</p>
<p><em>With the release of WWE 2K24 this series no longer feels like a carny outcast amongst the other big sports franchises. While the game’s core action could stand to be even further refined, fun new mechanics, match types, and a fully-developed suite of modes, including significantly improved Showcase and MyGM offerings, are worth cheering for. While maybe not quite the total package just yet, WWE 2K24 feels like it’s ready for the bright lights.</em></p>
<h2>Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">9</a>)</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>The Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series has long been left dormant, but it is still considered one of the best series based on the massively popular series created by Akira Toriyama. Topping the third main entry in the series was far from being easy to accomplish, but developer Spike Chunsoft outdid themselves with a game that not only feels great to play but also takes advantage of modern gaming technology and engines such as the Unreal Engine 5 to make players feel as if they were indeed part of the Dragon Ball universe. Sure, the game may be a little unbalanced, but it wouldn't be Dragon Ball if the power levels wouldn't range from 10 to over 2,000,000. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is undeniably one of the best games based on Akira Toriyama's series. With an engaging story mode that includes intriguing what-if scenarios, a combat system that's easy to learn but challenging to master, a massive character roster, and impressive attention to detail, Spike Chunsoft has created a must-have for Dragon Ball fans. If you've ever wanted to be Goku and scream your heart out before unleashing secret techniques, this is the game for you.</em></p>
<h2>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-review-taking-you-for-a-ride/">8</a>)</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MARVEL-vs.-CAPCOM-Fighting-Collection-Arcade-Classics.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM series took the world of fighting games by storm before it was actually called so with the release of the first tag fighter ever made by CAPCOM, X-Men vs Street Fighter, and seeing it end so ingloriously with the average Marvel VS. Capcom Infinite was truly a shame. Thankfully, it seems like the two companies are still open to working together, and released this year the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, a new collection that includes the first two main entries in the series as well as the other games made by the creator of Street Fighter featuring Marvel Comics characters like X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and the side-scrolling beat'em up The Punisher. While the collection highlighted how some of these games haven't aged as well as others have, it also highlighted how others, like MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2, are still a joy to play. Too bad for the lack of cross-platform play, especially on PC where there are more popular options to enjoy these classics. Here's what I said about the collection in my review:</p>
<p><em>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a fantastic celebration of the series, showcasing some of the best fighting games released by the Japanese publisher in the late '90s and early 2000s. Although the lack of cross-platform play reduces the collection's appeal, the additional options and extras are welcome enhancements that make playing these timeless classics on modern hardware even more enticing, especially on consoles.</em></p>
<h2>Rivals of Aether II</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rivals-of-Aether-2.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>With the latest entry in the Super Smash Bros. series having been released six years ago, many other platform fighters got their chance to shine, filling the void left open by the series that essentially created a whole new sub-genre. Among the few platform fighters released since, Rivals of Aether II is the one that capitalized the most on this situation, becoming the go-to game for those who cannot live their gaming life without dash dancing, wavedashing, shield dropping, and so on. Instead of attempting to do things differently, which doesn't always lead to the best results, the game developed by Aether Studios went all in on the formula made popular by Super Smash Bros. Melee, making it easier to perform some of the advanced tech listed above to allow players to focus on the fun. While on paper, this may detract from the game's identity a bit, the developer masterfully weaved together these elements with the cast's diverse moveset to provide a game that will only grow in popularity as time goes on.</p>
<p>Sadly, the lack of single-player content prevents Rivals of Aether II from being a must-buy right now for those looking for some casual fun, but hopefully, this issue will be addressed as the game expands in the future.</p>

<p>Okay, so you thought January would kick off 2025 with a slew of new video game releases, right? Well, it’s a generally quiet time for the industry, though we are receiving a few big titles, like Spider-Man 2 and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PC. But it’s February that will really jump-start gaming in 2025. Here’s a look at the biggest video game releases in February 2025!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-february-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of February 2025</h2>



<p>I really cannot understate how massive the month of February 2025 is for game releases. It’s overloaded with some truly epic titles, the kind of games you could spend hundreds or thousands of hours playing without looking at the release calendar again. But they come one after another this month, which will take a toll on our sanity and wallets.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 4, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Civilization VII</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – February 11, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Nintendo Switch) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Avowed </strong>(PC/Xbox Series X|S) – February 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 1</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S) – February 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 28, 2025</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-march-2025">Looking Forward to March 2025</h2>



<p>After a month like February, here’s hoping March isn’t overly packed with new video game releases. We could use some time to rest and recuperate and, of course, to finish all of those massive titles like Kingdom Come and Monster Hunter Wilds. But, here’s what you can look forward to in March 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Two Point Museum</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Tales of the Shire</li>



<li>Atomfall</li>
</ul>

<p>Battlestate Games has confirmed that Escape from Tarkov’s next wipe will hit tomorrow, December 26. This patch – which also includes Escape from Tarkov Arena – ushers in the 0.16.0.0 patch, and the 0.2.5.0 patch for the latter title. It’s set to take the game offline for around eight hours, and when it comes back up, hundreds of thousands of players will flood the game.</p>



<p>How many of them will be cheaters or malicious operators?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-good-with-the-bad">Good with the Bad</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has had a tough time of late dealing with more than a few issues. The biggest concern is cheaters, and the epidemic reached such epic proportions that the game’s biggest streamers were turned off, with many players diverting their attention to the game’s ‘offline’ PvE offering.</p>



<p>This month, Tarkov’s viewer counts on Twitch hit their lowest point since the summer of 2019, when the game underwent a monumental boom on streaming and content platforms.</p>



<p>Regardless, Escape from Tarkov will undergo a sizeable upshift in the coming days as the next Tarkov wipe hits and countless players come back to the extraction shooter in droves. It’ll hit the top spots in the charts on streaming sites, and once again, players will start their stories in Tarkov, tackling those pesky early-game tasks.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Tomorrow, December 26, at 7:00 AM GMT / 2:00 AM EST we are planning to install patches 0.16.0.0 for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EscapefromTarkov</a><span> and 0.2.5.0 for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TarkovArena" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TarkovArena</a><span>. The installation will take approximately 8 hours. The installation of updates may be extended if required. The games will not be…</span></p></article></div>







<p>When Tarkov wipes tomorrow, it’ll bring about the 0.16.0.0 update, which introduces changes to Customs and adds in several new weapons, amongst other things. Battlestate is also tweaking the game’s weapon recoil mechanics, making some major visual adjustments.</p>



<p>It’s also expected that the Unity 2022 upgrade will be wrapped up in this patch.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the next Tarkov wipe?

<p>It’s that time of the year when you finally treat yourself or someone takes pity on you and buys you that one piece of tech you’ve been eyeing all year. For many, that’s the Steam Deck. If you woke up and unboxed a Steam Deck, well, congratulations! But here are a few of the games you should check out first on your new PC handheld!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-games-on-steam-deck-for-new-owners">The Best Games on Steam Deck for New Owners</h2>



<p>The list of available titles for the Steam Deck grows seemingly daily, with new game releases and old titles finally receiving verification. Before long, everything will be playable on the handheld. But for now, you must still pick and choose, though it’s from an absolutely astounding library of games. Here are just a handful of what you can expect to enjoy on your new Steam Deck:</p>



<h3 id="h-balatro">Balatro</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I think Tom would be rather upset with me if I didn’t mention Balatro. But more so than that, it’s an incredible roguelike deckbuilder with innovative gameplay, that borderline enthralling one-more-turn style of gameplay we love, and quite accessible mechanics that warrant a playthrough or ten. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t know poker because Balatro is so simple to grasp!</p>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>

<p>I’m not ashamed to admit that Stardew Valley is one of my all-time favorite titles to date. I used to play a ton of Harvest Moon, and then I graduated to Stardew on release day and never looked back. I’ve spent nearly 300 hours playing the indie farming simulator on Steam Deck alone, as it’s such a simple game to pick up and play with the handheld. It runs smoothly, the battery life is excellent, and the game functions better with a controller than with a mouse and keyboard, in my opinion.</p>



<h3 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t expect to play Baldur’s Gate 3 on Steam Deck for extended periods, as the massive role-playing game will burn through the handheld battery quickly. That said, the turn-based combat and easy maneuverability of the game work splendidly on the handheld controls of the Deck. If you want a game that will suck up countless hours of your free time without leaving the couch, Baldur’s Gate 3 is the go-to choice for many.</p>







<h3 id="h-hades-or-hades-2">Hades (Or Hades 2!)</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was initially unsure about Hades, as I was still relatively new to the roguelike genre upon its release. However, after too many recommendations, I gave it a shot and immediately fell in love. It’s a challenging yet satisfying action hack-and-slash in which you’ll power up your abilities and move over time, delving further into the Underworld as you go. It functions perfectly on Steam Deck, and the bite-size maps allow you to play on your own time.</p>



<h3 id="h-cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cult of the Lamb was my Game of the Year in 2022, and an absolute surprise that I wasn’t sure I’d enjoy until my wife bought it for me as an early birthday present. Well, I was hooked. I immediately sunk 50 hours into a single playthrough, and then I did it again on PC. Then, I started playing on Steam Deck and wound up with another four complete playthroughs on the handheld. It runs well and has impressive battery life. But the technical stuff, while fun, is only a small part of the experience. You can run a cult, build your base, and venture into the wilds with powerful weapons and spells!</p>
