			<p>Denuvo DRM is one of the most well-known and well-hated pieces of software in the gaming industry. It's used to protect games from piracy, which is frequent in a world full of digital content. Denuvo has been on the market for ten years now, and is increasingly more controversial, as it stops people from tampering with the product and making it available for piracy, as well as to stop unlicensed emulation. <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-qa-with-tim-willits-we-have-a-game-that-will-exceed-expectations/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is one of the most highly anticipated games and has decided not to go ahead with Denuvo DRM or any alternatives to DRM. This information was found in a <a href="https://support.saber.games/hc/en-us/articles/26354574015249-Warhammer-40-000-Space-Marine-2-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A posted</a> on the Saber Games website that discusses some important topics, such as the presence of microtransactions.</p>
<p>The FAQ covers a lot of important details about the upcoming release of Space Marine 2, a game that has already received a lot of attention due to a leak of a developer's build. However, many have moved past that and are now eagerly awaiting the game's release date, due on September 9, 2024.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Aside from the lack of DRM, Space Marine 2 will not feature any microtransactions, except paid cosmetic DLC. However, that is completely optional, and there won't be any pay-to-win features in Space Marine 2. "All gameplay content and features will be free to all players. Any paid DLCs will be cosmetic only," as confirmed in the FAQ on the Saber website. While they aren't using DRM, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, they will rely on EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) for anti-cheat coverage.</p>
<p>For those who are more interested in the graphical side of things, there are no plans for ray-tracing at current, but DLSS2/FSR2 will be available to those able to use it on day one, with DLSS3/FSR3 coming later in the year. Additionally, the developers aim to optimize the game for the Steam Deck later in the year. Unfortunately, the game is set not to support ultrawide and super-ultrawide monitors on launch day. This problem with a previous Warhammer 40,000 game was resolved after some time with a dedicated patch.</p>
<p>While Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will be available on GeForce Now on day one, it won't come to Xbox Game Pass for the foreseeable future. Regarding GeForce Now, the game will have fully-functioning cross-platform saves and offline progression, but those who want to play the Operations Mode will need a stable internet connection to access it.</p>
<p>Friendly fire will not appear in any game mode, but there will be dedicated PvP servers for those who want to partake. The dedicated servers will be for NA, LATAM, and SIE regions. As expected, there is no LAN support for PvE/PvP.</p>
<p>For those curious about Space Marine 2, the game doesn't require you to play the first to enjoy this one, despite some returning characters from the first game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After only ten days on the market, <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-first-trailer-gameplay-release-date/">Concord</a> sales are ceasing immediately as Sony and Firewalk Studios explore better options to better reach their players.</p>
<p>In a new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, Game Director Ryan Ellis provided an update on the state of the game, revealing that some aspects of the game and the initial launch did not land the way the studio intended. As such, it has been decided to cease sales of the game immediately and take servers down later this week, on September 6th. A full refund is being offered for anyone who purchased the game on any platform. You can find information on how refunds are being offered below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Steam</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Store</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Steam Store will refund players who bought the game over the coming days.&nbsp;Steam will send confirmation of the refund once it has been processed.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Epic Games Store</strong>&nbsp;– Epic Games Store will refund players who bought the game over the coming days and will contact each customer directly to confirm that the refund has been processed.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Other retailer refunds</strong>&nbsp;– For customers who have purchased a physical copy at a retailer location outside of PlayStation directly, please refer to the refund process of the retailer you purchased it from to obtain your refund.&nbsp; &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>While the decision to halt Concord sales immediately, and take the game offline, may sound a little extreme, with the game having only been out for a few days, it was clear right from release how the game wasn't doing well at all, with extremely low concurrent players numbers on Steam from day one, despite showing some promise. Unfortunately for Sony and Firewalk Studios, gaming has moved past the trends that Concord tried to catch, and it will be very interesting to see how the game will be changed if it ever returns to the market.</p>

Now, after Capcom had what it called “technical discussions” with Microsoft, Xbox will be able to get in on the fun as well, though a bit later than everyone else.</p><div><p>Recently, there’s been a noticeable delay for big third-party releases on Xbox.

In <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830677183695667270">a statement on social media</a>, the developers at Jyamma Games said that they want to bring the game to Xbox as fast as possible but that “this task is nearly impossible with Microsoft taking months to reply to us when we have the game ready for submission.” The developers then implored fans to reach out to Xbox on their behalf, ostensibly to get the ball moving.</p><p>The two Capcom collections include 15 games, featuring arcade classics like <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em>, <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em>, <em>Capcom vs. SNK, Power Stone</em>, and more.

The first-person hero shooter&nbsp;launched exclusively on PS5 and PC on August 23rd, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing?utm_source=twitter">estimates have put sales</a> at under 25,000. <em>Concord </em>also only managed to hit an all-time peak of 697 players on Steam, lower than the launch peak of <em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum — </em>widely regarded as the worst game of 2023.</p><p>“We have decided to take the game offline beginning September 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players,” says <em>Concord game</em> director Ryan Ellis in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">PlayStation blog post</a>. “While we determine the best path ahead, <em>Concord </em>sales will cease immediately and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC.”</p><p>If you purchased the game for PS5 from the PlayStation Store, a refund will be issued to your original payment method. If you purchased<em> Concord</em> on Steam, you’ll get a refund in the coming days, and the same will occur on the Epic Games Store. </p><p><em>Concord </em>launched as a $40 game after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-live-service-hero-shooter-concord-has-been-in-development-for-around-8-years">eight years of development</a> and went up against many free-to-play alternatives like <em>Overwatch </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211812/valorant-console-launch-xbox-series-s-x-ps5-download">even <em>Valorant</em></a><em> </em>in the competitive hero shooter genre. It has ultimately failed to compete as a paid game, especially without a unique selling point. </p><p>Firewalk Studios’ mention of options “that will better reach our players” and the refunds make it seem like <em>Concord</em>, if it does return, will move to a free-to-play model. “We’ll keep you updated and thank you again to all the Freegunners who have joined us in the <em>Concord </em>galaxy,” says Ellis.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation is shutting down Concord just two weeks after its launch. </p>



<p>The company announced <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via a blog post</a> on Tuesday afternoon that it will be taking the game offline on September 6. The company says it’s doing so to “explore options, including those that will better reach our players”.</p>



<p>“[W]hile many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended,” game director Ryan Ellis said.</p>



<p>Those who purchased the game will get a full refund while all future sales will be stopped immediately. If you purchased the game physically, Sony says to check the refund policy at the retailer the game was purchased at.</p>



<p>Concord launched on August 23 to little fanfare. It’s launch day saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concords-launch-is-worse-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than 700 concurrent players</a> on Steam, and the number continued to drop daily. Ahead of this announcement, the game was struggling to hit 100 concurrent players on the platform.</p>



<p>There is no information on what the game did player-wise on PlayStation 5. There were reports that the game sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around 25,000 copies</a>. The actual number, however, is likely lower after early refunds are taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The first major title update for Madden 25 was released on Tuesday, and with it comes a number of changes. From gameplay to Franchise to Superstar mode, every aspect of the game has seen an update or fix in some fashion.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest changes come from the addition of the revamped passing mechanic being added from College Football 25, defensive pursuit logic updates, fixed a glitch that gave receivers speed boost when using custom stems and smart-routing, and fixed an issue with importing draft classes in Franchise mode.</p>

<section><p>GameSpot recently had the opportunity to discuss Persona 3 Reload: Episode Aigis--and the Persona series as a whole--with general producer Kazuhisa Wada.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The Persona series is currently in an interesting place. Following the release of Persona 5 back in 2016, the series has grown exponentially more popular. Back in December 2023, Atlus confirmed the Persona 5 series--which includes the original game, Royal, Strikers, Tactica, and Dancing in Starlight--has sold more than 10 million copies. When Persona 3 Reload launched earlier this year, it sold over 1 million copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling Persona game to date. Compare that with Persona 4 at 2.5 million copies sold--1 million of those from the last year--and you can see the franchise's incredible momentum.</p><p dir="ltr">Suffice to say, there's never been more eyes on the Persona series, and this makes the studio's current transition and trajectory particularly interesting. For the past eight years, the studio has solely released remakes, ports, and additional content pertaining to the series' existing entries. Even more notable, however, is that the team working on these projects (Atlus' P-Studio) has also seen an exodus of long-time Persona developers, with Katsura Hashino, Shigenori Soejima, Yuichiro Tanaka, Azusa Kido, Yujiro Kosaka, and Yasuhiro Akimoto all leaving the Persona series to start a new team and work on the upcoming fantasy RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio. I can't help but wonder, then, what's next for P-Studio and the Persona series?</p><p dir="ltr">I recently had the opportunity to delve into this with Atlus' Kazuhisa Wada, a long-time producer and director at the studio who now leads P-Studio following Hashino's departure. Though the conversation focused on the studio's next release, Persona 3 Reload: Episode Aigis, I was also able to gain some insight into the future of the Persona series, if we'll one day get Persona 1 and 2 remakes, and why we the team can't seem to stop releasing deluxe editions of its games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360770-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360770" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360770-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360770"></a><figcaption>Yukari and Mitsuru ready to attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360770-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%287%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Why did the team decide to release Episode Aigis as DLC rather than incorporating it into the base game as Persona 3 FES did?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Wada: </strong>FES was released months after Persona 3, which ended up being the "complete" version of the game. Episode Aigis itself was a standalone piece of content you could select from the main-menu screen, even though it was included in the base game. Some of the reason is that we felt it made sense to release it as a separate DLC rather than as a complete version of Persona 3 Reload. However, a larger reason was that we were simply unable to plan for Episode Aigis ahead of time. Late into the development of P3R, we found ourselves under extremely difficult circumstances--we still wanted to make Episode Aigis a reality, but we didn't have the proper resources to make it happen. Thankfully, last year, we were able to secure the team necessary to do so. But even then, we hadn't decided on the overall team structure for the project. While we were unsure at the time whether we could get it across the finish line, I was determined to make Episode Aigis see the light day. So, I pushed through, and we were able to develop it as DLC.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I've always felt that The Answer was an extended metaphor for grief--that it explores how the world seems to stand still and we find ourselves pushing away emotions rather than processing them. What is it like revisiting these themes all these years later, with more life experience?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Rather [than the team's thoughts], I would be interested to know how you and others who shared those same feelings at the time feel about these themes now, all these years later and with that experience. The essence of Episode Aigis is essential to fully convey the overall significance of P3, so if we can help people understand it better, that may be one answer.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, we have tried to make a few adjustments to the game in order to help players better understand these themes, and to ultimately help them move forward from 3/31. We looked back at the scenario and analyzed the various opinions of fans at the time and picked out the parts of the scenario that were "controversial" outside of the main plot. In the original, we felt that the limited description of each character's actions and decisions made it difficult to convey the necessary emotional premise, so we made some delicate adjustments around that. I'm sure there are many different opinions on how this will affect the game in general, but I would like to ask you to play the game and see for yourself, and then give us your honest feedback.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What are the most meaningful changes, both story-wise and in regards to gameplay, in Episode Aigis?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">In terms of story, the dialogue of the main story was adjusted based on the policy described in your second question, while the missing information in terms of emotions and relationships between friends was filled in through linked episodes and dungeon conversations.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of gameplay, new Theurgy, shifts, and special skills were added based on the design specifications of Reload to eliminate the stress of the FES era and to make dungeon attack and battles more enjoyable. In addition, five difficulty levels are available here, allowing for a variety of play styles. The highest difficulty level is also very challenging yet rewarding at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, not only is the Persona Compendium included, but any compendium progress can be carried over from the base version of P3R using existing save data, so we hope fans enjoy all these changes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360771-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360771" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360771-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360771"></a><figcaption>Aigis readies multiple personas to attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360771-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%285%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the most challenging aspect of remaking a game nearly 20 years later?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The most difficult task was to create a production structure and get the project drafted and approved. From there, we had to find the best way to convey the essence of the content, which was divisive at the time, and how to tune it for the better. It was equally challenging, but also just as important and rewarding, to find a way to portray both Metis, a character who had not appeared for almost 20 years, and the game's themes in an appealing way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With the inclusion of Episode Aigis, Persona 3 Reload feels like it is the deluxe version of </strong><strong>the game yet it is missing an important feature: the female protagonist. Why was she </strong><strong>excluded? Will we see her again one day?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the female protagonist will not be added to P3R. Back when we were planning Episode Aigis, we had considered adding the female protagonist, but the more we looked at what this would take to make happen, the more unlikely it became. The development time and cost would not have been manageable and due to the nature of the content, it's difficult to entrust this externally. Even if we were able to move forward, the actual release would end up being far into the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, we would be expected to build not just a remake, but a completely new game, so we would need to devote our limited development resources for it. I apologize to the fans who have supported us for so long, but this follows the same reasoning that allowed us to do Episode Aigis: We cannot do any additional content like creating a female protagonist for P3R unless we create and release it at this very moment where interest in P3R is at its highest.</p><p dir="ltr">But since it is not possible for us to release P3R with the female protagonist in this window, we just can't do it. I'm really sorry to all of the fans who were holding out hope, but it is likely never going to happen.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Atlus has a tendency to return to games and release new editions with new features fairly </strong><strong>regularly. Why is that? When do you decide to reach a stopping point?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal added many expanded features that couldn't be contained in a DLC format, so we had to treat them as completely new games. This time, we've kept that in mind for Episode Aigis, so we've made sure that the expanded content only works as DLC. Moving forward, if the content doesn't significantly expand on the base game, then we would like to deliver that content in an appropriate format.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360772-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360772" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360772-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360772"></a><figcaption>The SEES team discusses its next mission.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360772-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%283%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>As Persona 3 Reload wraps up, are there any plans to remake Persona 1 and Persona 2?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It is not on my schedule right now. I would like to do it someday.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I know some of the team members have moved on to Metaphor: ReFantazio. How does this impact the future of the Persona series?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Many years ago, one of the issues we wanted to resolve as a company was to improve the development capacity of the organization. Fortunately, as of today, very talented young and mid-career people are steadily growing through projects like P3R and P5R, so if we are asked about the impact on the future from here on, the answer can only be "for the better."</p><p dir="ltr">We game developers, myself included, have a number of issues that need to be resolved in response to the lengthy and expanded game development process. I believe that one of the most important things to do is to pass on the spirit of the game to the next generation. One of the most important things is to build an organization that allows that transition to happen naturally.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to develop and maintain a sustainable, high-quality series of titles, I believe that the methodologies of organizational reform and generational change at that time were unavoidable and highly necessary. Even then, I believe the fact we can point to the growth of the Persona series from then to now is the best proof we have that we are on the right track. Therefore, we would be very happy and encouraged if you all have even greater expectations of both us and the games we produce in the future, so please keep up the good work.</p>

                <p>After just a week on the market, Sony has decided to remove Concord from sale and will take the game's servers offline. The move comes after the game failed to find an audience, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/" data-ref-id="1100-6526227">reported 25,000 sales</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-big-new-ps5-and-pc-game-concord-got-off-to-a-slow-start/1100-6526101/" data-ref-id="1100-6526101">very low player numbers</a>.</p><p>Game director Ryan Ellis <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "While many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended."</p><p>Concord is no longer available to buy and the servers will go offline on September 6. Ellis said the team will "explore options" for how to "better reach our players," which sounds like the game could return in some form down the road.</p><p>Sony is refunding people who bought Concord. Those who bought the game on PS5 will get an automatic refund to their payment method. People who bought Concord on Steam and the Epic Games Store will get refunds, too, and players should look for email messages from those providers.</p><p>Anyone who bought a physical copy of Concord can get a refund from the store they bought it from.</p><p>This is a shocking turn of events, as few could have predicted Sony would end sales and shut the servers down for Concord so quickly, even though the player numbers and sales figures were low.</p><p>As Ellis alluded to in the statement, it sounds like Sony and Firewalk could be revamping Concord with a plan to bring it back in a different way. One possibility is it returns as a free-to-play title, which is what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/" data-ref-id="1100-6526227">many expected it to be at launch to give it the best chance to find an audience. </a></p><p>Prior to this dramatic announcement, Firewalk planned to launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-concord-early-and-what-time-it-unlocks/1100-6525754/" data-ref-id="1100-6525754">Concord Season 1: The Tempest</a> in October, adding a new character, new map, new variants, and additional cosmetics and rewards. Season 2 was scheduled for January, with Season 3 expected in April, though these timelines have surely now changed.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Concord.</p>

                <p>Jyamma Games, the developer behind the Italian-inspired souls-like game Enotria: The Last Song, has indefinitely delayed the Xbox version due to Microsoft being non-responsive.</p><p>According to a Discord post by Jyamma studio CEO Jacky Greco (via <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/they-dont-care-about-enotria-and-they-dont-care-about-you-jyamma-games-ceo-blasts-xbox-amidst-indefinite-delay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>), an Xbox version is ready for submission. However, Microsoft has seemingly ignored the studio's submission ahead of the game's September 18 release date.</p><p>"We believe that Xbox is blessed with a huge gaming community and we would love to release Enotria on your platform as fast as possible, as we spent a lot of money and resources to make it happen, but this task is nearly impossible with Microsoft taking months to reply to us when we have the game ready for submission," Jyamma Games <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830677183695667270" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained in a statement</a>. "If you'd like to help please let Xbox know about our situation, if we had a dedicated xbox account manager help us out this issue would not exist, thank you so much!"</p><p>Xbox has seen a number of games skip the platform, at least at launch, due to a variety of factors. Black Myth: Wukong reportedly has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox-yet-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-report/1100-6526196/" data-ref-id="1100-6526196">non-publicized timed exclusivity deal with Sony</a>, although other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YOf7LJRiDww?si=X_XzPR0vaCL8Teie&amp;t=1432" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> dispute that. Capcom's remasters such as Ace Attorney Investigations and Capcom Fighting Game Collection were initially skipped over for Xbox as well. However, Capcom revealed that as a result of technical discussions with Microsoft, the latter and the second compilation <a href="https://x.com/CapcomUSA_/status/1830984496260219001" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">are coming to Xbox in 2025</a>.</p><p>Microsoft requires feature parity and simultaneous launches across Series S and Series X, which has also contributed to delays. Most infamously, Baldur's Gate 3 was released late for Xbox last year due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/">technical complications</a> related to the Series S version. However, that's not the case with Enotria, as the developer said on <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830672665482330526" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>, "It's not a performance issue, the game works better as expected on series S, and really good on series X, but we cannot proceed through the submission process and the reply from microsoft can take up to 2 months."</p>

		<p>Enotria: The Last Song won’t be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox</a> at the same time as PS5 and PC, developer Jyamma Games has announced, as they struggle to get access to the game’s Microsoft Store page. The game will still launch as planned on 19th September for PS5 and PC, but the Xbox Series version is indefinitely delayed.</p>
<p>“We understand how disappointing this news is to the Xbox community,” the team writes. “Unfortunately, despite our best efforts and the hard work of our dedicated team, we’ve encountered challenges that have delayed our release on the Xbox platform. We want to emphasize that this is not a decision we’ve made lightly.</p>


<p>“We apologize for any disappointment this may cause and sincerely thank you for your understanding and patience. As a self-published indie studio, your support means everything to us, and we are dedicated to bringing Enotria to as many players as possible.”</p>
<p>In a follow up statement to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/enotria-xbox-release-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, Jyamma Games CEO Giacomo Greco revealed that it’s not a technical issue with the game on console, but rather not being able to access the game’s Microsoft Store page. The studio has been going back and forth with Xbox support staff, but is still unable to access the store backend and submit the game for release.</p>

<p>It’s truly a bizarre situation, and one that I’m sure Microsoft will work to resolve now that it’s getting headlines and public attention.</p>

		<p>Survival horror action RPG Graft has been announced by Harebrained, the studio behind the Shadowrun Trilogy and the mech-tastic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/04/24/battletech-review/">Battletech</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="GRAFT by Harebrained — Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhQZYJkfe8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Blending survival horror with action RPG isn’t just a change of pace for a studio best known for turn-based action, but it’s an interesting change of pace for this style of game. One of the key mechanics is that you can tear pieces from enemies to add them to your own person and abilities – “Every Graft brings with it some piece of its previous owner’s identity, changing more than just your physical body,” reads the blurb, in an exploration of the Ship of Theseus tale from Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Set in a post-cyberpunk sci-fi setting, you must escape the Arc, a continent-sized station that is falling apart as its biomechanically enhanced citizens go a bit loopy, scrabbling around for resources. There are other survivors trying to escape as well, and you can forge certain alliances with them (or stab/be stabbed in the back by them), and as you explore, you’ll fight strange experiements that have been unleashed, and the agents of an AI gone insane that are stalking you.</p>

<p>Harebrained – formerly known as Harebrained Schemes – is best known for their Shadowrun trilogy of RPGs and the turn-based tactical mech action of Battletech, but a defining chapter in the studio’s history came with the disappointing release of The Lamplighters League last year. A 1930s pulpy spin on turn-based tactical action, it launched in a poor state, leading to &nbsp; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/02/the-lamplighters-league-review/">low review scores</a> thanks in part to technical hitches, and sales were then so poor that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/12/paradox-interactive-writes-off-the-lamplighers-league-as-a-22-8-million-flop/">Paradox wrote down the game’s development and took the financial hit</a> – the studio also faced significant layoffs before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/17/harebrained-schemes-going-independent-from-paradox-interactive-after-lamplighters-league-flop/">Paradox and Harebrained came to an agreement</a> to let the studio go back to being independent at the start of this year.</p>

			<p>Following an earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/graft-is-harebraineds-new-game-slated-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tease</a>, Harebrained has now unveiled its next game, a 'post-cyberpunk' survival horror RPG titled GRAFT. In development for PC (it will be released on both Steam and the Epic Games Store), it is themed around the idea of morphing the player character's body and what it does to them.</p>
<p>In GRAFT, players navigate a crumbling, continent-sized space station known as the Arc, where the remains of a once-advanced civilization now lie in darkness and decay. As a survivor in a dying world, you must scavenge and graft parts from enemies to transform and enhance your abilities.<br>
Each graft not only alters the player character's physical form but also infuses them with fragments of its previous owner's consciousness, creating a mix of survival, transformation, and self-discovery - all while battling monstrous abominations.</p>
<p><iframe title="GRAFT by Harebrained — Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhQZYJkfe8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here's an overview provided by Harebrained:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Arc is rich with forgotten technologies and unsettling wonders. Traverse massive chasms, labyrinthine techno-catacombs, and self-replicating corridors in search of a way out. Master these ancient mysteries and uncover the secrets that lie within.</li>
<li>Survival is not just about fighting the horrors that lurk in the shadows. It's also about navigating treacherous relationships with other survivors. Form alliances, build trust, and face the reality that anyone still alive can be both an ally and a threat. Your choices will shape your journey and determine the fate of those you encounter.</li>
<li>Engage in visceral survival horror combat against ancient experiments, monstrous abominations, and relentless agents of a demented AI. Manage your resources and choose your battles wisely to stay alive as you make your way through the dangers of the Arc.</li>
<li>Your evolving body is a powerful weapon. With each Graft you acquire - whether ripped from enemies or found hidden in the depths of the Arc - you gain new abilities and powers. But each Graft carries with it fragments of its former owner's identity, shaping your memories, your impulses, and even your very self. Every choice you make will have a profound effect on who you become.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game is currently scheduled to launch in 2026, so it'll be a while before we see a long gameplay video. Meanwhile, stay tuned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-major-temtem-update-arrives-extensive-patch-notes-revealed.970893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-temtem-update-18<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The final&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>update (outside of smaller maintenance patches in future) has arrived, and it's bringing a ton of changes to the game's economy, as well as its fundamental gameplay mechanics and more.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/temtem-microtransactions-updates">revealed back in March</a>, this update, which is version 1.8, will be the final big update for the game. In essence, from now on,&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>will be in maintenance mode, meaning that while it will still get updates, they'll be focused mainly on fixing bugs and keeping things operational.</p>
<p>Since it's the last update for the game, though, the patch notes are basically a massive blowout of changes, mostly focused around making&nbsp;<em>Temtem</em>'s economy functional from a single-player, offline perspective.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temtem-update-1.8-walking.jpg?itok=zLhr-FXj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temtem-update-1.8-walking.jpg?itok=R61vsVUF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>has received its final update, which may also be its biggest.</figcaption></figure><p>Big changes include a Store that's no longer Premium or rotating; it's now a permanent collection of cosmetics, all of which you can buy with the in-game Feathers currency.</p>
<p>You can now select any Tamer Pass from any previous&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>Season,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-season-reactivation"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>-style</a>, and work towards any Pass you choose. You'll also be able to switch between all of them whenever you like.</p>
<p>It's now possible to skip animations during combat, a change that Crema says it hasn't "agreed with for a long time". Despite that, Crema says that since this update is aiming to make&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>a "kinder, more enjoyable" experience for players, animations are now skippable.</p>
<p>Other big changes include being able to see when Temtems will evolve, eggs hatching faster, and boosted loading times, plus lots more. You can check out the full patch notes for this&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://crema.gg/temtem/patch-1-8/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>right now across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/745920/Temtem/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/temtem/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/temtem/9MVXZMRQXHSF" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/temtem-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Crema's time with the game may be over, but its time in the&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>universe certainly isn't; the studio is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/temtem-swarm-announced-mashing-together-pokemon-like-creatures-and-survivors-style">currently working on</a>&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style game&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm</em>, which is due sometime later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

However, things are more perilous than they initially seem, and before long our plucky heroine finds herself investigating an apparent murder instead. Released on August 15, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Crimson Diamond</em></a></span><em> </em>is a brand-new adventure game from developer Julia Minamata, and it is exceptional. With its design, Minamata excavates a once-common element of early adventure games that has long fallen by the wayside, dismissed as if it were no longer of any value. However, <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>brilliantly demonstrates that, when used effectively, this device can actually enhance our connection to a game. Let me explain.<br></p><p>When you think of adventure games, chances are you think of point-and-clicks, games in which all of your interactions with other characters and the environment are done by clicking. Whether you click on verbs in the lower part of the screen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as in early SCUMM games</a></span> or have more minimal interfaces like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/R0caHaL8l0w?si=VpnRAdYlkgWi0Y2h&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/R0caHaL8l0w?si=VpnRAdYlkgWi0Y2h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many adventure games since the mid-90s</a></span>, the game is designed so that every interaction can be navigated and every puzzle can be solved with nothing but a few clicks of the mouse. This style of play became so common that the term “point-and-click adventure games” practically became synonymous with adventure games as a whole. However, once upon a time there were many great adventure games that you interacted with through a text parser, typing in specifically what you wanted your character to do. <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>brings this back, and uses it to brilliant effect.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,195301,196345" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h608320"><a id=""></a><strong>In defense of text parsers</strong></h2><p>Now, I think some see text parsers as outdated, a necessity of early adventure games that was largely abandoned when something “better” was devised. However, I’ve often thought that if a game is designed intentionally to make good use of a text parser, it can really open up the possibilities for ways in which you can think about interacting with the world and the situations the game presents you with. I’ll give you one example from my own memory. When I was young, I played the brilliant Sierra game <em>Space Quest 2</em>. A 1987 release, this game saw Sierra still very much in its text parser era, and at one point, I became completely flummoxed. I knew I had to dive into a deep pool of water and swim to safety, but every time I tried, I’d run out of air before I could get anywhere, and wound up dying one of those horrible, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/sierra-adventure-games-funniest-deaths/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/sierra-adventure-games-funniest-deaths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notorious Sierra game deaths</a></span>. (Speaking of those, here’s a video I found featuring <em>Crimson Diamond </em>creator Julia Minamata talking about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/2lyaoydIKY0?si=yECem__6p01EY3GU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/2lyaoydIKY0?si=yECem__6p01EY3GU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some of her personal favorites</a></span>!)<br></p><p>Try as I might, I couldn’t figure out how to progress. I had to quit the game and go to school the next day, still stuck at that one spot, and all day long, it was all I could think about. Finally, in some class I no longer remember, I was hit by inspiration. “What if I take a deep breath first?” Once the idea struck, I absolutely couldn’t wait to get back in front of my computer to try it. An eternity of hours later, I typed it in, and it worked! (Watch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/APpxIyL8yhk?si=yVYXckCmXG7blpVY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/APpxIyL8yhk?si=yVYXckCmXG7blpVY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone else struggle with this same puzzle</a></span>, though not for nearly as long as I did.)<br></p><figure id="" data-id="369270fa35ca193989e738e91e2f2b70" data-recommend-id="image://369270fa35ca193989e738e91e2f2b70" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of The Crimson Diamond shows the redheaded protagonist in a rustic lodge room, while another woman sits at a nearby table.

The text parser at the bottom reads &quot;Talk to Kimi.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is an example of a kind of puzzle that, generally speaking at least, couldn’t exist in a point-and-click game, because the concept of “taking a deep breath” is very hard to represent through graphical icons and on-screen verbs, and if the game did graphically give you a way to do this, it would be too obvious that this was the solution. You wouldn’t have to think about the situation and arrive at the possibility on your own.<br></p><p>Now, don’t get me wrong, there are tons of great adventure games that use graphical interfaces. Many of my personal all-time favorites in the genre are pure point-and-clicks, and I don’t think one approach is inherently better or worse than the other. But playing through <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>gave me a new appreciation for how the very limited and specific options those interfaces provide can also limit how you think about the situations in which you find yourself.<br></p><p>When a game gives you a text parser, however, there are no baked-in limitations, no guardrails. If you can think it, you can at least try it. There’s a good chance the game won’t understand you or allow you to do it, but nevertheless, you’re thinking about the situations you’re in in a fundamentally different way than you do when a game limits you to clicks. Throughout my time with <em>The Crimson Diamond</em>, I repeatedly found myself trying things that a standard point-and-click interface simply wouldn’t allow for. I was constantly asking characters <em>about </em>specific things, and interacting with the environment in more thoughtful, deliberate ways than I often do in an adventure game. And because I had to think clearly about what I was doing, I felt much more absorbed in its mystery.</p><h2 id="h608321"><a id=""></a><strong>Using classic elements to create something wonderfully new</strong></h2><p>However, <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>is not simply a new game in the mold of classic text-parser adventures. Its closest cousin is perhaps 1989’s <em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em>, a Sierra game that, like <em>The Crimson Diamond</em>, is an Agatha-Christie-style murder mystery featuring a colorful cast of characters, with a young woman as its unlikely heroine. But despite being presented in gorgeously vivid EGA graphics and sporting a text parser, <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>also feels wonderfully modern. </p><p>For one thing, it gives you a notebook that always indicates what you need to do to advance the story, and so the plot generally hums along at a compelling pace, and you’re unlikely to ever get completely stuck for long periods of time the way players often do in adventure games. (There’s also an online hint book&nbsp;which, wonderfully, lets you first unlock gentle nudges in the right direction before viewing the whole solution, just like the best real adventure game hint books of the past did.) Importantly, however, you never have to consult Nancy’s notebook if you don’t want to, and while you can complete the game by simply following the tasks it lays out for you, that will hardly get you the best result.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="aa81bdda7ac724f7eac09b0af690db61" data-recommend-id="image://aa81bdda7ac724f7eac09b0af690db61" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nancy stands in a wonderfully colorful boudoir, while another woman sits at a vanity.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>No, if you really want to get to the bottom of things, you’ll have to be thoughtful, clever, and observant. In other words, only real detective work will reveal the true intricacies of the plot that some nefarious person or persons are hatching in Crimson. I admit, I wasn’t as successful in my first playthrough as I would have liked. Some secrets stayed buried, and things ended on a sour note between my Nancy and one of her friends at the lodge. However, at the end the game helpfully gives you nudges about areas in which you could have done better, so if I give it another go, I have some clue as to where I should focus some extra attention in untangling its mystery.<br></p><p>And that mystery is a banger, twisty and surprising, while also tackling some big, important themes, like who profits–and who suffers–when land is exploited for its natural resources. Crucially, the game is never hamfisted or preachy about these concerns. They’re woven organically into the plot, and all the drama is kept at a human level, as Nancy interacts with each of the game’s colorful cast members, all of whom have their own desires and motivations.<br></p><p>Finally, remember those notorious Sierra deaths I mentioned? Well, <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>definitely won’t kill you at every opportunity like those games, but it does have seven deaths to discover (and an achievement for each one!), giving you one more reason to poke at its limits and find every possibility you can. My jaw dropped in shocked glee the first time I stumbled upon a death, which came complete with a Sierra-style text box playfully quipping about my demise. I wound up finding five of them in my playthrough. Someday I’ll come back to <em>The Crimson Diamond</em>, both to more thoroughly solve its central mystery, and to find those other two deaths. More than an homage to early adventure games, this is a thrilling game in its own right, and an encouraging sign that the future of adventure games may be as bright as its heyday. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS is a powerful technology, with more and more games being added to the roster that are compatible with DLSS. This week, a few new games are being launched with NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-dlss3-fsr-3/">other advanced ray-traced effects</a> to give those with GeForce RTX system capabilities the most stunning image and performance. Of the games joining the roster this week, players can expect the following to have NVIDIA DLSS integration:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2641470/Spectre_Divide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spectre Divide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299690/Gori_Cuddly_Carnage/">Gori: Cuddly Carnage</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1959580/Supermoves/">Supermoves</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars Outlaws</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/spectre-divide-hands-on-preview-nailing-that-first-impression-with-a-unique-twist-on-6v6-fps/">Spectre Divide</a> is a new 3v3 tactical shooter that was launched today with DLSS Super Resolution integration. In this game, you get to swap between two bodies using the Duality system, allowing you then to take control of a Spectre at any time. This allows you to make strategic moves that get the one-up on your opponent. Launching with day-one DLSS Super Resolution is massive and can help you have the buttery smooth experience you need while gaming.</p>
<p>Next is the game Supermoves, made by Makea Games. This game launched with NVIDIA DLSS 3 with Frame Generation support. This technology increases the frame rate by generating intermediate frames using AI as a post-process for the GPU, which can benefit the game's overall performance. Supermoves is a competitive parkour game with a Mirror's Edge feel, allowing you to soar, backflip, and tumble in first and third person. Multiple game modes exist to explore, allowing you to race against up to 40 players in a Battle Royale-style game mode.</p>
<p>Third on the list to join the expansive roster of over 600 games and applications to utilize RTX technologies is the fun and chaotic Gori: Cuddly Carnage. You play as a cat named Gori and get to ride around a futuristic world on your wise-cracking sentient hoverboard named F.R.A.N.K, alongside your AI companion CH1-P. if you're not sure if this game is for you, there is currently a demo available that lets you try it out. Gori: Cuddly Carnage has launched with ray-traced reflections and shadows, as well as the capability to accelerate the performance with DLSS Super Resolution, boasting the power of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>Last but not least on this list, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-rtxdi-tanks-performance/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> is officially out now. You can explore iconic locations from Star Wars with ray-traced graphics, all of which are enhanced utilizing NVIDIA DLSS 3.5's AI-powered graphics, boosted by the GeForce RTX 40 series to give those on PC a high-definition, immersive experience.</p>
<p>There are more games and applications being added to the list of DLSS integrations every week, with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official NVIDIA website</a> showcasing all applications, games and engines that are powered by NVIDIA DLSS, Ray Tracing and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234777/microsoft-apple-cloud-gaming-app-store-changes-xbox-cma<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050430/apple-app-store-game-streaming">started opening up</a> its App Store to game streaming services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now, freeing them from being restricted to web apps on the iPhone and iPad. Despite multiple changes to Apple’s App Store guidelines this year, Microsoft and Nvidia have still not published native cloud gaming apps for iOS, and Microsoft is now detailing exactly why.</p><p>Microsoft already said earlier this year that Apple’s cloud changes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games">don’t go “far enough” for Xbox</a>, but in submissions to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6d0d19084b18b95709f13/Microsoft_WP_6_Redacted_version_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED__1_.pdf">Microsoft now argues</a> that Apple’s changes in January, March, and April to its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines">App Store guidelines</a> (section 4.9 and 4.7) aren’t enough for it to operate a native Xbox Cloud Gaming app on iOS at all.</p><p>“Microsoft identified a number of other provisions in Apple’s Guidelines that continue to limit its ability to distribute and operate a Cloud Gaming iOS native app (namely Guidelines 2.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.6, 3.1.1, 3.1.2(a), 3.1.3(b), 3.2.2(i), 3.2.2(ii), 4.2.2., 4.2.7(e)),” said Microsoft in a filing to the CMA in late July. </p><p>Microsoft claims that Apple’s guidelines “still represent an obstacle to Cloud Gaming native apps” because it apparently can’t comply with them, both technically and economically, if it incorporates third-party games into its Xbox Cloud Gaming service on iOS. Microsoft specifically calls out <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#multiplatform-services">Apple’s requirement</a> for multiplatform services, like Xbox Cloud Gaming, to make all content, subscriptions, and features available within an iOS app as an in-app purchase (IAP):</p><div><blockquote><p>In fact, Apple’s IAP commission fee is set at a level that is neither economically sustainable nor justifiable. The 30 percent commission fee makes it impossible for Microsoft to effectively monetize its cloud gaming service offering, given that Guideline 3.1.3(b) prevents different content, subscriptions or features (including consumables in multiplatform games) being offered to iOS users (as compared to the content, subscriptions and features offered on other platforms).</p><p>As observed by the CMA in its Mobile Ecosystem market study, the 30 percent fee imposed by Apple on IAPs is the result of a lack of competition in the distribution of native iOS apps.</p></blockquote></div><p>Microsoft also claims third-party game developers would need to recode their games to comply with the IAP requirement. </p><p>Microsoft also takes issue with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business">Apple’s 3.1.1 guideline</a>, which prevents iOS app developers from linking outside to enable the purchase of subscriptions. Apple provides an exception for “Reader” apps, but cloud gaming apps don’t qualify for this exception. Apple argues in its <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6c53fc52d5fb4c82ddd66/2024-08-07_Apple_Response_to_Working_Paper_6_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED.pdf">filing with the CMA</a> that it has “never approved a gaming app to take advantage of the Reader Rule,” so it says app developers shouldn’t be calling into question its approach to in-app purchases in the context of cloud gaming.</p><p>The CMA is currently carrying out a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming">market investigation</a> into mobile browsers, browser engines, and the distribution of cloud gaming services through app stores in the UK. It has identified a number of possible remedies to address competition concerns around cloud gaming apps on mobile devices, including potentially requiring Apple to enable cloud gaming native apps to operate on a “read-only” basis with no in-game purchases or subscriptions so that games don’t need to be re-coded. </p><p>The CMA is also considering requiring Apple and Google to allow cloud gaming service providers to incorporate their own in-app payment systems, and potential requirements for Apple to amend its guidelines to remove elements that may contain technical restrictions on cloud gaming apps.</p><p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6c53fc52d5fb4c82ddd66/2024-08-07_Apple_Response_to_Working_Paper_6_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED.pdf">Apple argues</a> that it supports cloud gaming via web apps, and even cites two <em>Verge </em>articles that cover <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979290/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-ios-ipad-performance-improvements">Microsoft’s improvements to Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> performance on iPhone and iPad and that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/25/23423668/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-20-million-people-streamed">more than 20 million people</a> have used Xbox Cloud Gaming. “It is notable that while CMA cites Microsoft’s concerns in the Working Paper, Microsoft has chosen not to engage with Apple on cloud gaming apps since Apple’s changes to the Guideline,” says Apple. “This lack of engagement comes despite Apple’s affirmative outreach on new opportunities and tools for cloud gaming apps on iOS.”</p><p>Apple also argues that developers “...generally are not having difficulty with the IPA requirement” and then cites Antstream, a small app developer that launched the first iPhone game streaming service in the App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183027/antstream-emulator-apple-iphone-retro-games-ipad-streaming">earlier this year</a> with more than 1,300 retro titles from Atari, Amiga, and Nintendo consoles. Apple helped Antstream with subscription optimizations, editorial frameworks, and even public relations review and guidance for its launch announcement.</p><p>The CMA has set a deadline for all parties to respond to its market investigation for this month before it plans to publish a provisional decision report in November. There will then be plenty of time for Microsoft and Apple to continue arguing between November and December, ahead of a final report in either February or March next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Godslayer Crown, being a Unique Helm, isn’t easy to obtain. It’s an extremely rare, often luck-based drop that requires significant farming endeavors.</p><h2 id="h595040"><a id=""></a><strong>How to farm Godslayer Crown in <em>Diablo 4</em></strong></h2><p>The new Godslayer Crown drops from two Uber Bosses: Duriel, King of Maggots and Echo of Andariel. Now, neither of these enemies is a pushover. Aside from Uber Lilith, they’re some of the most challenging end-game content and will pose significant problems to those with an unoptimized build. If you want to target farm, they’re your best option. But if at all possible, opt for the Tormented versions, as the chance of receiving a Mythic Unique triples! Read on for how to summon them.</p><p>Alternatively, there is a minute chance of Godslayer Crown dropping from Elites, Bosses, and upon opening chests while playing in World Tiers 3 and 4. You’ll have better chances of scoring a monumental drop by running World Tier 4 and playing through late-game content, such as Gathering Legions, World Bosses, and Nightmare Dungeons.</p><h2 id="h595041"><a id=""></a><strong>How to summon Duriel, King of Maggots</strong></h2><p>Let’s start with summoning Duriel, King of Maggots. You can find Duriel at the Graping Crevasse in Kehjistan, but only in World Tier 4. Once inside the dungeon, there’s a summoning altar with which you must interact and place the necessary resources to call forth the maggoty king. You need:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>x2 Mucus-Slick Eggs (Dropped by Echo of Varshan)</li><li>x2 Shard of Agony (Dropped by Grigoire the Galvanic Saint)</li></ul><p>Alternatively, if you wish to increase your odds of receiving Godslayer Crown, spend the additional resources necessary to summon the Torment version of Duriel:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>x6 Mucus-Slick Eggs (Dropped by Echo of Varshan)</li><li>x6 Shard of Agony (Dropped by Grigoire the Galvanic Saint)</li><li>x1 Stygian Stone (Dropped by bosses in The Pit in World Tier 4)</li></ul><h2 id="h595042"><a id=""></a><strong>How to summon Echo of Andariel</strong></h2><p>For Andariel, the summoning process is similar to Duriel, albeit with unique materials and a different location. You must head to Hanged Man’s Hall in Kehjistan while playing in World Tier 4, where you’ll find a summoning altar. You require:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>x2 Sandscorched Shackles (Dropped by Lord Zir)</li><li>x2 Pincushioned Dolls (Dropped by The Beast in the Ice)</li></ul><p>Like Duriel, you may also summon a Tormented version of Echo of Andariel to increase your chances of a unique drop.

Running through various Nightmare Dungeons, The Pit, and the countless bosses in search of rare resources—which will help you run additional bosses for Mythic Uniques—is the gameplay loop once you reach level 100.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-heights-could-be-the-climbing-game-i%E2%80%99ve-always-wanted.970797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/new-heights-climbing-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Around Aftermath’s launch, I wrote about climbing game <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-jusant-gets-rock-climbing-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jusant</em></a> and lamented that, as much as I liked it, it wasn’t quite my ideal climbing game. In the comments, a few of you recommended an early access game called <em>New Heights</em>, which I will admit I completely forgot about until my buddy <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/12/rock-climbing-changed-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Serrels</a> reminded me of the game on Twitter recently. I played it a bunch over the holiday weekend, and while it has some flaws and is still in development, it feels a lot like the climbing game of my dreams.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2179440/New_Heights_Realistic_Climbing_and_Bouldering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New Heights: Realistic Climbing and Bouldering</em></a> is, let’s face it, not a terribly sexy title, and it’s not a terribly sexy-looking game, with only one character model and a less-than-eye-catching visual style. There’s no storyline or mountaineering narrative; instead, the game is mostly its complicated mechanics, where you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_solo_climbing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free solo</a> routes of various difficulties by using your left and right mouse buttons to control each hand, mouse+shift to control each foot, and WASD, Q, and E to control your weight placement and body positioning. You climb real world locations that include rock faces and boulders, but also what I found to be a slight over-abundance of ruins and old buildings, though you might be more keen on those location choices than I am.&nbsp;</p><p>I put all this sort of negative stuff up front to explain why it might be an easy game to make assumptions about and skip, especially in the crowd of early access. But you totally shouldn’t miss it, especially if you're a climber.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="New Heights: Climbing &amp; Bouldering - Early Access Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_NuocVSVII?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Once you wrap your head around the controls, which you can practice in a tutorial area styled like a climbing gym, you’re set loose to do what honestly feels the most like actual climbing of any climbing game I’ve played. The quality of your holds and hand and foot placement is indicated by directional arrows that change color depending on your grip direction and body placement. Too much bad positioning, indicated by yellow or red arrows as opposed to green, will start to drain your stamina meter until you fall. To deal with all this, the techniques that worked for me are the ones that best work for me in real life: bringing my feet up high, shifting my weight around, keeping my body close to the wall. Unlike other climbing games where you just navigate between holds or perform dramatic mid-air moves<em>, New Heights</em> requires full awareness of your virtual body and a careful, systematic approach.</p><figure><figcaption>My left foot should probably lower in that crack, though (Aftermath)</figcaption></figure><p>It's fascinating to experiment with turning a bad hold into a good one (or vice versa) by moving my body around, and I found myself thinking and navigating much the way I would in real life–with the added bonus that the character is much stronger and seemingly taller than me, letting me climb things I can only dream of in real life. Long climbs feel like thoughtful, harrowing adventures the way my favorite roped routes do, with safer areas and sketchier areas, and the bouldering routes are surprisingly tough, the way bouldering often is. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__zh9KFt9aI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speed-based</a> leaderboards whose scores tempt me to think about how I can improve my climbs, and even a <a href="https://frictionlabs.com/blog/connors-world-dynoing-basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dyno</a> mechanic that’s thrilling to execute in the middle of a route. Routes of different levels feel meaningfully harder from each other, and there are player-created <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2179440/workshop/?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">areas</a> and <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/how-to-create-your-own-routes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">routes</a> as well.&nbsp;</p><p>There are places where the simulation falls short, as perhaps it must for something that must be <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/how-we-created-our-climber-1-the-animated-approach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>so</em></a> <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/how-we-created-our-climber-2-using-active-ragdolls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complicated</a> to make work. The physics bugged out on occasion, twisting my character into horrifying shapes or letting my limbs clip through the wall. I couldn’t do some things that feel instinctive for real life climbing–in one route, I wanted to do something with my foot on an <a href="https://hardclimbs.info/what-is-an-arete-in-climbing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arete</a> that the game couldn’t simulate, and it doesn't quite seem to know what to do with <a href="https://frictionlabs.com/blog/how-it-works-the-mantle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mantling</a> or moments where you end up on flat ground mid-route. Moves I would use in real life, like <a href="https://philarockgym.com/climbing-techniques-what-is-flagging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flagging</a> or <a href="https://frictionlabs.com/blog/connors-world-how-to-dropknee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drop knees</a>, felt more like screwing around to see if I could recreate them than vital techniques. One of the biggest challenges, as some Steam reviewers note, is that the <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/nature-is-beautiful" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">textures</a> don’t always correspond to the quality of a hold: something will look like a ledge or grip only to not be, which means finding a good hold is sometimes less a matter of using your eyes and more wagging your mouse around until an arrow turns green.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Fun fact: I can do this in real life (Aftermath)</figcaption></figure><p>But a lack of certain realism in a game that touts realism isn’t a dealbreaker for me. As I wrote about <em>Jusant</em>,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When I imagine what I think a “true” climbing game would be, I inevitably conjure up some kind of inelegant, <em>QWOP</em>-esque nightmare that would force you to navigate foot and hand placement, limb tension, stamina, pathfinding, and your own emotions in a way that couldn’t possibly be fun, much less technically possible.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Developer Wikkl Works seems to recognize the challenging boundaries between what’s realistic, what’s technically possible, and what’s fun. In real life, I would have hooked my foot around that arete, but in a game, controlling ankle movement and simulating using the top of the foot instead of the bottom would be a nightmare for both player and programmer. <em>New Heights</em> picks the right things to get technical about–your contact points with the wall and your whole body’s position in relation to them–to make a game that simulates so much of the strategy and feel of climbing while still simplifying things enough to be approachable and, crucially, enjoyable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a sadly lapsed climber who’s struggling to get back into shape, <em>New Heights</em> gave me so much of the pleasure I get from real climbing. It manages to be realistic without being overly fiddly or complicated, and what it lacks in visual or narrative flair it makes up with through a clear love of climbing and the places where you do it. I’m excited to see how it keeps developing through early access and so glad I took a chance on it. If you’re a climber, I think you’ll have a blast with it; if you’re not, it might give you something like a taste of one of my favorite sports.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Set between the first and second trilogies of the series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ace-attorney-investigations-collection">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a> follows fan favourite Miles Edgeworth as he investigates a string of increasingly wild cases. Combining the original game with it’s never before released in the West sequel, the colllection has Edgeworth joined by series mainstay Detective Dick Gumshoe and newcomer (and Great Thief) Kay Faraday, the trio find themselves quickly involved with wider overarching plots involving smuggling and corruption.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ace Attorney Investigations Collection - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLFMaakr_xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout you’ll run into a host of characters from the main series, which is a mixed bag to say the least. On one hand, some excellent characters that deserved more time to shine or develop get exactly that. On the other, some of the most irritating characters from the Ace Attorney canon get to return to bother you, and Edgeworth is just as disappointed to see them return as I was.</p>


<p>We do get to enjoy more of the buddy comedy double act that is Edgeworth and Gumshoe working together though. The chemistry between the two and Kay is absolutely incredible as well, while the primary antagonist (but not villain) Agent Lang is a superb character as well. So, I guess I can’t explain too much when there’s this much great character work on display.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between this spin-off duo and the main series is the lack of courtroom shenanigans. Far from being a problem, the lack of these parts helps the narrative flow far better, with everything lining up far smoother. The result is that the stories of these games are arguably the most coherent of the series, displaying the clever ‘whodunnit?’ style writing well and giving the twists greater payoffs than ever.</p>

<p>This contributes to the gameplay feeling smoother too, as instead of the harsh transitions between investigation and courtroom, the cases are segmented into smaller narrative chunks that flow into the next towards a natural conclusion each time. Largely though, the main components of the gameplay are investigating crime scenes and listening to testimonies from other characters – business as usual for Ace Attorney fans.</p>

<p>The investigation segments allow Edgeworth to wander around areas to examine them rather than the visual novel style of the main series. Certain spots allow you then to examine in greater detail, and even choose spots that conflict with your evidence to Deduce why contradictions might exist there. As a great little quality of life feature, the game tells you when you have fully investigated a spot. This shouldn’t feel like a big deal, but it absolutely is, believe me!</p>
<p>The main purposes of these investigations are to find evidence and clues for the cases. The evidence, as well as the deductions in investigations, is used in Rebuttals. These function the same as Cross Examinations from the main series, with the player presenting evidence to expose contradictions in the testimony of the character, complete with pressing statements for more information and presenting evidence with the trademark “Objection!”</p>
<p>The clues, however, are more like vague nuggets of information or questions posed by Edgeworth or other characters during the investigations. These are used in the new mechanic, Logic. This is by far my favourite addition in these games and allows Edgeworth to reach new reasoning by combining gathered information, which can result in new items of evidence or new directions of enquiry into the case.</p>

<p>The strength of the Logic system is that it’s easy to understand, and even easier to piece together, with only rare occasions in the whole collection where the link between the clues is unclear. That simplicity is what I enjoy about it. It encourages you to think about the information you currently hold without overly blocking your progress and keeps you moving towards the solution of each chapter’s mystery.</p>
<p>Another new mechanic for the second game is Mind Chess. This is a little more vague than Logic, and sees you playing a game with a witness or other person of interest to gain information. It takes place as a conversation with the character where you need to decide when to go on the attack or remain silent based on the behaviour of the opponent.</p>
<p>If the character is aggressive, you can bide your time in silence until they calm down and let slip information you need to proceed. Oh, and as added fun, you’re timed in these sequences and mistakes take a chunk out of your remaining time. This is the closest these games get to the obtuse nonsense of the main series, and can be frustrating, but once you get into the swing of it, it’s a great little back and forth challenge.</p>
<p>Both of these new mechanics are enjoyable though and really work to diversify the gameplay beyond what would otherwise simply be point and click. I wouldn’t say that they’re as interesting mechanically as say the Magatama or Mood Matrix from the main series, but they definitely add flavour to the investigations, and – of course – they also make sense with Edgeworth’s character at this point in the overall series timeline.</p>

<p>This two game collection has remastered visuals, with the option to use the original pixel art character sprites if you would prefer that, if with the inconvenience that you can only do this from the main menu. For the most part, I would recommend going with the enhanced visuals, as the core cast look great in this updated style. It only starts to fall apart with some of the side characters who have the odd animation or facial expression that just doesn’t look right but that doesn’t overly detract from the visuals.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is absolutely incredible from beginning to end, as you would expect from the Ace Attorney series, with those classic Ace Attorney sound effects thrown in as well to add that little bit of familiarity around these new settings. The song in this game for when you have a witness on the ropes during a Rebuttal especially is exquisite, especially in the remixed version used in the final showdown.</p>
<p>One final feature to praise is the Story Mode, which removes the puzzles and let’s you just enjoy the story of the two game. Also, as is standard for these collections now, all of the music tracks in the game, plus a load of concept art and all that fun behind the scenes stuff, is all available in the Gallery. More things get added to this as you go, with in-game achievements also to be found during gameplay that you can view from the main menu, though I’d advise against viewing those until you’ve finished the games to avoid spoilers.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ace Attorney Investigations Collection finally completes the Ace Attorney series of remasters, and does so with possibly the best two games in the series! The move from the courtroom to the crime scene creates a far smoother and more cohesive narrative experience that really allows the twisting mysteries to shine like never before. Coupled with some excellent quality of life improvements, a bevy of bonus content, and some enjoyable new mechanics, it would be a crime to not indulge in this collection.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-review-law-order<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has done solid work in getting all the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-review-few-objections">Ace Attorney</a> games out on modern platforms. No longer confined to a single handheld, they’re accessible to more people than ever before.</p>
<p>The latest release is the last in the collections to be made available - the aptly named <em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</em>, which includes both <em>Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth </em>and its sequel <em>Ace Attorney Investigations: Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>. Both titles were originally out on the Nintendo DS, so it has been some time since their release. <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> is especially notable because it’s releasing outside of Japan for the first time ever.</p>
<p>To that end, Capcom has seen fit to give these games a proper remaster treatment - redrawing the pixel-based sprites in HD, as well as the backgrounds for a modernized look with the game available on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Having missed out these games before, I was keen on how different they might play compared to the courtroom trials of the mainline series. It’s lucky then that the <em>Collection</em> lets you get right to it.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot01.jpg?itok=QUoLCZh1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot01.jpg?itok=ZIpDGqAC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Upon booting the menu, you have the option of choosing to start <em>Miles Edgeworth</em> or<em> Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>. As the latter is a sequel, it makes sense to start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Right away, the game lets you choose from the original pixel style sprites from the DS version, or the updated HD ones created by the original character designer. It’s a nice touch having that option for purists’ sake.</p>
<p><em>Miles Edgeworth</em> starts off with the titular main character involved indirectly in a murder scene that took place in his very office. While we know Miles didn’t do it, the scene is immediately put into investigation as series detective Gumshoe helps assist, and Miles himself digs deep into unmasking the culprit.</p>
<p>I suppose it shouldn’t be surprising, what with ‘Investigations’ in the title, but right away it’s one of the main things you’ll be tasked with despite Miles being a prosecutor. He’s found a new role for himself by solving crimes out in the field, and much of the story is focused on how he gets roped into these messes - often as a target, and even as a suspect in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting turnabout, with much more agency placed on the story, and the larger and murderous plots at play.</p>

There’s even some gimmicks like recreating the crime scene in a simulation, and is something that puts Miles in more of a direct role, along with other new characters.</p>
<p>My only complaint is there’s no voice acting despite the modern updates. It feels a bit outdated in that aspect, but it’s ultimately a trade off for getting these games at all.</p>
<p><em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>, being a direct sequel, is fairly similar in game design to its predecessor. The story continues once again with Miles Edgeworth of course, but this time he finds himself in the middle of a presidential assassination plot.<br>
Right away, Miles is tasked with understanding the aims of the shooter, their identity, and the evidence of the gunfire. As the investigation continues, Miles finds himself caught up in a setup that eventually leads to some unexpected arrests.</p>
<p>The story is arguably more complex than it was in <em>Miles Edgeworth</em>, with Miles himself put under risk of losing his own badge, and having to further work with rivals to uncover the truth. I largely appreciated his role here because it gave him a lot of depth and nuance. It made me want to see his success to the end.</p>

There’s the usual investigation segments, including talking to suspects and searching for clues, but the former adds a new mechanic called Mind Chess.</p>
<p>Mind Chess is a game that Miles sets up when a suspect doesn’t want to testify. He will question them as always, but these timed segments rely on making decisions that metaphorically destroy the suspect’s chess pieces. Listen to what they have to say, and select the best option to press the truth out of them.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting mechanic that adds a bit of tension, and more layers to help uncover contradictions in testimonies.</p>
<p>The <em>Investigations Collection</em> has been updated throughout with an eye pleasing style that cleans up everything in HD. I found the sprites were especially standout, with the dialogue portraits and investigation items having more of a hand drawn look to them compared to previous games.</p>

<p>It’s a solid transition from the DS graphics in any case. The music is still there, and again, you can use the old pixel sprites if you really want. Overall it’s a great remaster, and even better that it’s the vehicle we finally get to play <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> in. With it finally here, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-review-few-objections">Ace Attorney collection</a> for the modern age is finally complete.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
The Ace Attorney Investigations is another great release from Capcom that brings Miles Edgeworth back in a starring role. Despite the lack of voice acting, the remaster captures the feeling of the series quite well. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

The annual event, in the German city of Cologne (or Köln to the locals), is the largest, most visited gaming exhibition in the world, dwarfing its nearest rivals, and has outlasted many alternative public and industry events. It adapted rapidly to covid, and became a successful online event when others wilted. And it somehow seamlessly combines a massive-scale industry event with an even more enormous public convention. So why is Gamescom so successful, where others struggle?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://abc7.com/e3-expo-canceled-electronic-entertainment-video-game-conventions/14174924/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://abc7.com/e3-expo-canceled-electronic-entertainment-video-game-conventions/14174924/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">E3 is officially dead</a></span>. It’s easy to blame covid, the cause of the Los Angeles event’s cancellation in 2020, 2021 and perhaps 2022, with the resulting demise and lack of online replacement leading to major publishers pulling out of 2023’s event until it was cancelled too. But really, its time had been up long before. For the majority of its life from 1995 to 2016, it was an industry-only event, and regularly pulled in 50,000 to 70,000 visitors (apart from during the bizarre decision to host it in an aircraft hangar in 2007 and 2008). Come 2017, as numbers and interest had begun to dwindle, E3 offered 15,000 public tickets at the same time as the number of exhibitors plummeted by a third. It was already looking very peaky before covid was even a factor.</p><p>Yet Gamescom, which delivers an industry event very similar to E3 (taking place in a monstrously large convention center that takes 15 minutes to walk end-to-end, with building-sized booths for major publishers decorated to match their games, and labyrinthine halls of business booths and meeting rooms), does this at the same time as offering a public exhibition that’s three times the size of PAX West. And add to this an opening night event featuring a wealth of massive-name exclusive reveals and trailers, hosted by the prince of gaming himself, Geoff Keighley. Which makes it all rather a big deal. And no diss to Germany, but it’s not exactly the first country that comes to mind when thinking about the games industry. So what makes Gamescom so persistently successful?</p><figure id="" data-id="a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-recommend-id="image://a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-format="jpg" data-width="1403" data-height="789" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Saint Geoff stares in wonder at Indiana Jones' release date." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Saint Geoff stares in wonder at Indiana Jones' release date." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-recommend-id="image://a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-format="jpg" data-width="1403" data-height="789" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Saint Geoff stares in wonder at Indiana Jones' release date." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Gamescom is a hybrid show,” says Tim Endres, the director of Gamescom, “that’s the USP.” He’s not talking about the combination of industry and public, but rather the overlap of in-person and online. And interestingly, this wasn’t something that began because of covid. In fact, the event had the jump on the virus by a full year, via the presence of the first instance of Opening Night Live in 2019. The flashy stage show that matches Keighley’s other annual ventures like Summer Games Fest and The Game Awards draws in an impressive live crowd (this year doubled to 5,000 people in the room), but a gargantuan online audience.<br></p><p>“This is the sixth year that we’ve been doing Opening Night Live,” said Geoff Keighley in a Zoom call the night before the event. Explaining why it has proved so successful, he stated, “Through the pandemic we were able to do a virtual show, and then come back live here at Gamescom. It’s really a global celebration.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-2024-record-number-of-exhibitors-internationality-and-global-reach&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-2024-record-number-of-exhibitors-internationality-and-global-reach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This year saw 40 million people tune in</a></span>—numbers any TV network would sell its soul to see—and it establishes the online presence of Gamescom in a massive way.

The Voldemort-like nature of the deceased event was an odd shadow during our chat, but I attempted to be more general when trying to understand why Gamescom survived the last few years. His answer: “Because we took place.” Endres primarily credits the incredible fortune of having gotten the show’s online nature established ahead of the global shutdowns in 2020 as a part of the reason for the event’s survival—they weren’t scrambling to try to invent some sort of last-minute digital version of their show, but rather building on an infrastructure that had already begun development. “We never cancelled, we never lost the contact to the community or the industry, so we were able to have a good pace for the restart after the pandemic.”</p><p>Boasting 1,400 exhibitors (E3 would hit 500 at its early peak) from 64 different countries, Endres says this makes the event the most truly international. It’s hard to deny this—I think back to U.S. events I’ve been to, where North American companies dominate the show floor,  international exhibitors scattered around them. In Cologne, there was still a massive American presence—especially in the form of Microsoft and Xbox—but unsurprisingly the European numbers were far higher. Fifty percent of trade visitors came in from outside the country. “That means the world’s here at Gamescom,” said Endres. It’s also true of public visitors, with 10 percent coming from outside the country, meaning over 30,000 people travelling to Germany for the event.</p><p>Microsoft’s enormous amount of floor space was striking, and made me wonder whether Sony and Nintendo might be getting left behind. “Of course we’d love to see them too at Gamescom,” said Endres. “We’re in constant [contact] with them, and if they don’t come one year, it does not mean it’s a decision for the future.”</p><p>But Gamescom is also spreading outward. In 2021, Gamescom Asia was established, an annual event in Singapore, and 2023 saw the first Gamescom Latam, hosted in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Interestingly, despite the existence of those regional events, those countries are also present at Gamescom in Germany, which perhaps makes sense given the different nature of the shows. Gamescom Asia, for instance, is predominantly a show about mobile gaming—a platform that doesn’t have a large footprint at the European show (with the odd exception of <em>Dark and Darker</em>). It also sees the other big players getting involved, with Nintendo having sent games to Latam, and PlayStation showing up for Asia.</p><figure id="" data-id="e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-recommend-id="image://e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pokemon had a presence for the first time this year." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pokemon had a presence for the first time this year." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Gamescom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-recommend-id="image://e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pokemon had a presence for the first time this year." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which all sets up a rather big, obvious question, doesn’t it? Gamescom is massively successful, has gained international recognition as the biggest gaming event in the world, and has survived where that other big name in industry trade shows has failed. That would leave one rather obvious region that Gamescom isn’t reaching, one that has a large void where an event used to be, loosely replaced by a digital-only event that happens to be hosted by Geoff Keighley…</p><p>“You <em>must</em> be looking at the United States,” I say. On my audio of the interview there’s then a long silence, before laughter in the room from a couple of onlookers. I then say, “For my recording, there was a slight shrug.” Endres laughs, called out on his presumably accidental body language, and then stammers toward the company line. “What we see at Gamescom is this massive increase in internationality here in Cologne, and it’s going to be the core event in Cologne, and we have a worldwide reach starting from Cologne, and then with our satellites we have a different reach. And Sao Paulo is not far from the U.S… But right now we’re focusing on making Gamescom Cologne bigger, and Latam and Asia bigger, and then we’ll see what the future brings.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
