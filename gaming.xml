		<p>The recently revealed sci-fi FPS <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/la-quimera">La Quimera</a> now has a launch date, and it’s really soon! La Quimera is coming out for PC via Steam on 25th April, and there’s a closed beta test set to take place this weekend on 12th April.</p>
<p>Here’s a fresh gameplay trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera -  Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVCU_hdG3Iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Reburn – the studio formerly known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/4a-games">4A Games Ukraine</a>, which is best known for its work on the Metro franchise, but has rebranded for this new original IP – La Quimera is a narrative-led FPS set in a futuristic Latin American megalopolis of Nuevo Caracas&nbsp;and a world created by Nicolas Winding Refn and E.J.A. Warren. The game casts&nbsp;you as a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier caught up in the battle between rival factions. All you really have is a customisable exosuit that enhances your mobility and abilities in combat, alongside sci-fi energy weapons, robot dogs and other drones. The intention is to combine the tense gunplay of the Metro series with in-depth storytelling from this new setting.</p>
<p>Playable solo or with three-player co-op, you’ll be able to coordinate combat tactics and complimentary skills, while your exosuit gives you &nbsp;things like a multitarget electric shock, scanning for hidden enemies, dodging and more.</p>

<p>Reburn as a studio naturally carries forward a lot of talent from the Metro series. The project lead is Oleksandr Kostiuk, who was Metro 2033, Last Light, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro-exodus">Exodus</a> gameplay and AI designer, but throughout the team, there’s experience that even goes back to before 4A’s founding by ex-STALKER developers. The company is newly rebranded in an effort to distinguish itself from 4A Games Cyprus – it’s this half of the brand and this studio that is owned by Plaion, and which is presumably continuing on with the Metro franchise.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Dmytro Lymar said, “As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry. Through it all, we stayed focused on what we love: Creating immersive, story-driven experiences. Our work wouldn’t be possible without the bravery and sacrifice of those defending Ukraine, and we’re profoundly grateful for their strength and resilience. We’re also truly thankful to everyone who supported and believed in us along the way.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/tips-for-starting-south-of-midnight/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> is the latest game from Montreal-based developer Compulsion Games, taking you on a magical journey through this gothic version of the American Deep South.</p>
<p>There's a lot of story, art, and music to dig into in South of Midnight, and of course, plenty of gameplay. Before you get started, though, there are a few things you're going to want to know heading into South of Midnight that'll help you get the best experience possible over the dozen or so hours it'll take to complete the game's story.</p>
<h2>Tips for starting South of Midnight</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>You need to keep moving in combat</strong>. You don't have a parry, but you do have a dodge, and if you can time it right to perform a perfect dodge, then you can create this small explosion that'll knock back enemies and give you another opportunity to get a couple of hits in. That being said, enemies won't be waiting one by one to attack you, so it won't always be possible to time a perfect dodge. Keeping yourself moving and dodging is vital to getting through the many combat encounters you'll play through in each chapter.</p>
<p><b>Your traversal abilities are also crowd-controlling abilities in combat, and you should use them. </b>Every ability you get that helps you traverse the world outside of combat is a tool to crowd-control enemies when you're in combat. Yes, you can just constantly dodge and run around the small arena rooms where combat takes place and get your licks in when you can to make your way through each fight. But you'll have a more efficient experience if you're taking advantage of the fact that you can pull, push, and tie up enemies at almost any moment.</p>
<p><strong>You'll always know where to go, so take the opposite path as much as you can.</strong> One thing that helps keep you moving through South of Midnight's story is that you can always know where to go with the press of a button. Clicking R3 on your controller will show you exactly where to go to continue the story, so any path that is not that main path is where you'll find all the optional bits of storytelling you'll otherwise miss. There are plenty of little well-written notes scattered throughout each chapter that add plenty of solid context to the story. It's worth your time seeking these out, and not just for the story, but also because you'll find XP pick-ups next to many of these notes, which will help you move through the skill tree faster.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the general skill tree first.</strong> There's one main skill tree called 'General,' and four other lines of skills you can upgrade based on the abilities you'll acquire throughout the game. Your preferred playstyle might incline you to upgrade one of the abilities first, but, as the title of the 'general' tree would suggest, you are generally better off working through that as quickly as possible. Or at least until you get to the point where you can dodge twice in a row in quick succession.</p>
<p><strong>There's no special points for playing on hard.</strong> I can save you some time right now, there's no special achievement for beating the game on hard. The combat also doesn't exactly evolve in an interesting way if you play on hard. The enemies get more spongey, and Hazel gets more fragile, is the limit of what happens. If you find the combat more engaging on hard, then all power to you, but the storytelling and the art design is where South of Midnight really shines. Less time spent on the combat means more time spent on experiencing the best parts of the game.</p>
<p>These are just a few tips that can help make your experience with South of Midnight as fun as possible. It's a wonderful game, to begin with, and keeping these tips in mind will help you experience the full breadth of that.</p>

It’s not a surprise subversive treat like <em>The Lego Movie</em>, nor an unwatchable dirge, but much like 2023's <em>The Super Mario Bros.

It’s also an astonishing success, almost doubling its already optimistic opening weekend sales, making over $300m worldwide. And you know what? It does this while having a pretty solid message about toxic masculinity.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>After <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve-jason-momoa-trailer-1851639338?_gl=1*10vnjmu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0Mzc4MTAxMS42MS4xLjE3NDM3OTMzMDMuNDYuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve-jason-momoa-trailer-1851639338?_gl=1*10vnjmu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0Mzc4MTAxMS42MS4xLjE3NDM3OTMzMDMuNDYuMC4w">the first trailer for <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> appeared</a></span>, certain quarters of the internet reacted deeply unpleasantly.

And it wasn’t the least bit subtle about it. (There are spoilers to follow, but few events in the movie are going to take you by surprise.)</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jason Momoa’s character in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> is not subtle. He is Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison, a washed-up guy in his 40s, once briefly and nichely famous in 1989 after becoming champion at a particular arcade game. He now runs a failing video game store, still trying to play off this decades-past glory, unable to understand why the world doesn’t view him as the champion he needs to be.</p><p>Jack Black’s character, Steve, is far more opaque. I have very many criticisms of this movie, all the reasons why it never climbs above the ranks of “fine,” and the weird lack of character establishment or development of Steve is high among them. It’s all extremely light and silly, but at the cost of any of his actions or decisions having weight. We’re told that as a kid all he wanted to do was mine, but we’re also told that this means all he wanted to do was create, as if one equates to the other. But anyway, rather fortuitously, as an adult he stumbles upon a cuboid orb that opens a portal to the Overworld where mining <em>is</em> a way to be creative, and makes his home there. Years later he’s captured in the Nether by a bad Piglin lady, and to prevent her destroying the Overworld, sends the orb back to our world via his pet wolf, Dennis. This sets up a way for Garrison, along with a boy (Henry) and his older teenager sister (Natalie), and a realtor (Dawn), to all accidentally end up in the Overworld and go on a <em>Minecraft-</em>themed adventure. Phew.</p><p>But what happens almost straight away, as the peril of the Piglin invasion makes itself known, is that the group is split in half. Garrison, Steve and Henry in one splinter, Dawn and Natalie in the other. And at first this looks like a weirdly regressive bit of storytelling, with the male characters using crafting tables to make weapons and planning to fight, while the female characters rush around trying to reason with Villagers to get a map. I remember thinking how odd this was, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Five&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Five" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Famous Five</a></span> having George and Anne do the washing up in the stream while Dick and Julian plan how to defeat the dastardly robbers. Yet, it was setting up something more clever.</p><p>Crucially, and almost immediately, both Dawn and Natalie are bashing Piglins like badasses, Natalie discovering an unrealized skill for combat. But at the same time, Steve and Garrison are butting heads, Garrison fighting Steve to become the alpha. Steve knows what he’s doing, has survived for years in here, but Garrison finds this threatening, and repeatedly messes things up in his attempts to prove himself the better man.</p><p>So far, so cliche. The arrogant fool is hardly a novel character trope, and we know the pattern: they mess up enough times until it has actual, serious consequences, then have to face up to their folly and accept their realistic status. They’re taken down a few pegs, realize they’re not the best, and we all get a vicarious win through their humbling. Except, that’s not exactly what happens here.</p><figure id="" data-id="de663d3f0bd10915778aafc814114ff6" data-recommend-id="image://de663d3f0bd10915778aafc814114ff6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="696" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason Momoa with a pink jacket and shades on his head looks at Jack Black." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jason Momoa with a pink jacket and shades on his head looks at Jack Black." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de663d3f0bd10915778aafc814114ff6" data-recommend-id="image://de663d3f0bd10915778aafc814114ff6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="696" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason Momoa with a pink jacket and shades on his head looks at Jack Black." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When the group finally turns fully on Garrison, it’s not because they’re all now in a deadly predicament he’s caused, but rather because they’ve just had enough of him. They hit him with some very hard truths. They tell him how selfish he is, how self-absorbed he is, how he is the worst person to be around. And in that moment, he breaks down. But, again, not in a manipulative way, not the cliche. Instead he just faces his reality.</p><p>He sobs, he’s broke, he’s failed at everything he’s tried for decades, and most of all, he has no friends. And then there’s the movie’s most heartbreaking line: Henry says to him, “You <em>had</em> a friend in me.”</p><p>There is <em>so</em> much talk right now about “what’s wrong with men.” People taking seriously the extremely serious statistics that show suicide as being the number one cause of death in men under 40. People trying to understand why toxic masculinity has such a grip on the zeitgeist, and why it’s being so poorly combated. And while a lot of this discussion has become ironically narcissistic and self-justifying (“actually men <em>do</em> have it really hard, so this behavior is OK”), the calm, methodical research keeps coming back to the same issue: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/newsletter/2023-10-10/more-than-1-in-7-men-have-no-close-friends-the-way-we-socialize-boys-is-to-blame-group-therapy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/newsletter/2023-10-10/more-than-1-in-7-men-have-no-close-friends-the-way-we-socialize-boys-is-to-blame-group-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these men not having friends</a></span>. Real friends, people they can be vulnerable with, share their struggles with, people they’re willing to let support them. </p><p>In the moment that Garrison is vulnerable, Steve becomes his friend. And, he’s not magically cured! He’s almost immediately a douchebag right after this. But he’s beginning to allow himself to change.</p><figure id="" data-id="093b92e7273986bbe920836155daab2d" data-recommend-id="image://093b92e7273986bbe920836155daab2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="758" data-height="426" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Minecraft bee." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Minecraft bee." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="093b92e7273986bbe920836155daab2d" data-recommend-id="image://093b92e7273986bbe920836155daab2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="758" data-height="426" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Minecraft bee." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s interesting to contrast this with the movie’s best plot, the C or D-plot of Jennifer Coolidge’s relationship with a Villager who accidentally finds his way into our world. He doesn’t talk in English, because he’s a Villager, and after hitting him with her car, Coolidge asks him out on a date. And, once again, here the film avoids the cliche. (Please note the film does not avoid a hundred other cliches; I’m just interested that in these two mirroring storylines.) This is also an over-worn storyline, the barely sentient character who’s viewed as the “perfect man” because he doesn’t say or do anything, so the self-obsessed woman can just talk <em>at</em> him and project her own ideal responses onto him. It’s usually wildly misogynistic, a “women be like” trope to be condemned. Except, that’s not  what happens here.</p><p>The Villager is genuinely a really nice guy! He may not be able to speak, and the movie certainly does go for the obvious “You’re such a good listener!” lines, but he’s actively responsive to Coolidge (I’m sure her character had a name, but this is Jennifer Coolidge, so it’s Jennifer Coolidge being the character she plays so well), accepting of her advances, and most of all, actively interested in what she’s saying! All through facial expressions, we’re left in no doubt that he’s very happy with this situation, very happy to be the listener, and as such, exists to represent the very opposite cartoonish extreme of Momoa’s character. (And, for goodness sakes, stay for the first of the credits scenes to see the wonderful punchline to all this.)</p><p>The Villager—as silly as I feel over-analyzing this very daft sub-plot—<em>is</em> being a lovely guy! He’s not unaware, not being walked over, not a sap or a victim. He’s on what seems to be, for him, a great date! Where Garrison only talks, the Villager only listens.</p><figure id="" data-id="6791a0a9196aa9384f111365302cf1e1" data-recommend-id="image://6791a0a9196aa9384f111365302cf1e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1265" data-height="712" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason Momoa in his pink jacket looking horrified in a wrestling ring." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jason Momoa in his pink jacket looking horrified in a wrestling ring." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6791a0a9196aa9384f111365302cf1e1" data-recommend-id="image://6791a0a9196aa9384f111365302cf1e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1265" data-height="712" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason Momoa in his pink jacket looking horrified in a wrestling ring." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So for all its weird, half-empty storytelling, and the failure to have Steve be anything other than Jack Black shouting like Jack Black shouts, and the atrociously thrown-away story behind Rachel House’s Piglin boss, Malgosha, and the impossibly weird decision not to have Dawn form an army of Overworld animals for the big battle (surely that was the entire point of her  character arc?), and on and on and on, I really appreciated <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> for its loud opinions on toxic masculinity, and the need for men to have friends. There’s a moment, right near the end, in which Garrison just openly says he wants a male friend his age.</p><p>As a 40-someone who had accidentally become the husband who knows his wife’s friends, rather than having local friends to hang out with of his own, I’m acutely aware of that loneliness. I also, a year or so back, gathered the courage to say to a couple of guys I know, as weird and awkward as it felt, “I’d like to be friends.” The first person I asked rejected it, “Yeah, sure, I’ll WhatsApp you...” to silence. That sucked. That hurt. But the second couple of people: I meet up with them each once a week for coffee, and we shoot the shit, talk about the insanity of the world, get over-excited about TV shows we just saw, and tell each other what we’re struggling with. And I’m so much better for it.</p><p>I love the moments of vulnerability shown by Garrison in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. Yes, he’s an outlandish caricature, but they’re the film’s only honest scenes (in the Overworld, at least—the early stuff set in the real world establishing Natalie and Henry’s recently orphaned lives is so good that I wished I’d gone to see <em>that</em> Jared Hess movie). It’s not a redemption scene, but rather a scene about a man being willing to tell a difficult, vulnerable truth, and it’s what allows him to begin to put his life back together. And most of all, to have male friends.</p><p>I know many have criticized the film for its central message of “keep your creativity” for being over-used. This entirely forgets that the movie’s target audience is too young to have already heard it dozens of times, and oh god, how are adults all so incapable of remembering this? I love it for that. But I also love it for how it just so clearly says, “Boys, you need friends too.” That’s a brave, bold message.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 won’t have achievements. That, according to Nintendo of America’s Vice President of Player and Product Experience Bill Trinen.</p>



<p>In talking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Trinen was asked straight up if the Nintendo Switch 2 would be the first Nintendo system to include the feature for its games. Trinen’s response was a pretty firm one-word answer.</p>



<p>“Nope,” he said.</p>



<p>Hope for achievements on the new system took hold when it was revealed that both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom would have them. Of course, they would be tracked on the Nintendo Switch app as opposed to the system itself, but they’re there.</p>

<p>Despite Nintendo not implementing the feature on its new system, that doesn’t mean no games on the console won’t have them Third-party developers could implement them through their own systems such as EA having achievements for Madden 26 or EA Sports FC tied through the EA Account. It just won’t be something Switch 2 players will be able to show off to others via the console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to launch on June 5, 2025. Pre-orders for the system are set to open on April 8/9 throughout the world. That is, of course, unless you live in the United States where recently implemented tariffs by the government have led to Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying pre-orders in the country</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-developers-discuss-the-consoles-tech-and-iwatas-lasting-legacy-on-its-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior to </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs"><em>Nintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs</em></a><em>. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting hands-on with Nintendo Switch 2 at last week’s reveal in New York, IGN spoke with the hardware leads spearheading the development of Nintendo’s newest console. Kouchi Kawamoto and Takuhiro Dohta from Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Department, along with Tetusya Sasaki from Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, talked to IGN’s Brian Altano about the technology behind Switch 2, the classic Nintendo handhelds that have inspired them and the impact former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata’s legacy had on the development of the console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Can you talk about the SOC system on a chip the Nintendo Switch 2 was running? Is it Nvidia Tegra? If not, can you reveal which graphics architecture it's based on?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I think you'll find a lot of the details in NVIDIA's information that they've shared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> One of the notes in the direct suggested to hit 4K in dock mode, upscaling may be required. What kind of upscaling is this system using? Is it using AI upscaling?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I think probably the main kind of easiest upscaling to use is the DLSS that Nvidia provides. So from that standpoint, I guess you could say this AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> That said, we're planning on providing other options of upscaling through software and so ranging from something that uses AI to something that's not. I think you'll see that as time passes. And lastly, I'll add that even though there is upscaling, there's also the option to not upscale and just output natively. So that's also an option that developers can use.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>What about ray tracing? Is that something that your team experimented with?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> Just like DLSS, that's when we're kind of making the graphics of a game. We consider ray tracing as just another tool to do that – it's not that we're going to try to use ray tracing on everything, but really trying to figure out what types of graphics, what types of screens, what types of situations are best suited for ray tracing, and then trying to apply that. That's the approach we took when we did all of our researching and experimenting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> We saw that the switch two supports third party cameras. What about third-party mice?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> You're talking about USB mice, things like that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Yeah, not the animal!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> [Laughs] It really depends on the game software with the structure. So if that software supports third-party USB mice, yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I have a six-year-old daughter. She took my Switch and I don't get to play it anymore. She also has dropped it a lot and it's okay. What have you done with Switch 2 to make sure that it can survive a kid dropping it on the floor or dropping it down the stairs?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo: Nintendo has made very sturdy devices through the ages and I believe that this time around as well, we've made something that will be sturdy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> Yeah, you can drop it a little bit. I don’t recommend it though!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I also have a Steam Deck and I like it, but the fan gets very loud when I'm playing high end games. It's almost distracting. What did Nintendo do to make sure that that was taken into account when designing the hardware for Switch 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> When a fan is loud it really does affect one's gameplay, so that is definitely something we had in the back of our mind during the development of the Nintendo Switch 2. The system is made to adapt depending on the processing capability so I'm kind of curious to hear from the others here what their experience has been like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> When I was playing it it's not like, “Wow, there's a fan in there”. It hasn’t really gotten to the point where, even through development of the hardware, it has bothered me in any way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> The hardware team put quite a lot of effort into making sure the airflow was smooth. So a lot is coming in but there's a lot coming out, and as such the fan noise isn't too significant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Nintendo invented the directional pad and it's been important for video games for my entire life. What did your team do to ensure that the Dpad on the Switch 2 was great for fighting games, puzzle games, platformers, all that fun stuff?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> You may think that every time you see the directional pad that it's just the same button being reused, but the truth is we do make small adjustments and add small changes every time. I have people – our development and game development teams – try them out when we make a new one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> This is a more detailed point but for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller directional buttons, we made it so that it's even more difficult to have mistaken input. Of course, it doesn't completely eliminate that possibility but it should reduce it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I'm a big fan of Nintendo handheld systems and always have been since the original Game Boy. What are each of your personal favorite classic Nintendo handhelds?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I have fond memories for each of the systems that have come out but for me personally, I think the original Game Boy really has a special place in my heart. Part of the reason for that is that since then there's obviously new systems that came out, like the Game Boy Advance for example. But I just distinctly remember my mother with the original Game Boy playing Tetris, and that’s just burned into my memory.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It was Mr. Iwata's concerns about the magnets that meant it didn't come to fruition [for the original Switch]</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Some of you worked with the legendary Satoru Iwata. Is there any specific part of his legacy that inspired the Nintendo Switch 2 design?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> There are various aspects but what comes to mind first is the magnet connector. We originally didn't adopt it for the Nintendo Switch because it wasn't as secure as we would've liked. However, we put a lot of effort into this aspect and that has come to fruition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> It was Mr. Iwata's concerns about the magnets that meant it didn't come to fruition [for the original Switch]. So being able to actually address all of the issues and create something that probably would've met his standards is moving and meaningful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I love it. I think I took the JoyCon on and off 20 times yesterday!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I actually have a question for you. You saw the footage of the JoyCon 2 snapping on and off. Was the impression you got from that footage different from actually snapping it on and off?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Yes. I thought it was going to be like a refrigerator magnet and it was going to be wobbly loose and instead it just goes ‘snap’ and clicks in. And I was like, “Oh, that feels really nice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I'm very relieved to hear that!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Yeah, they told me I had to stop doing it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Brian Altano has been playing Mario Kart for 30+ years, and it's crazy that 10 of those years were spent with Mario Kart 8. We haven't seen Battle Mode for Mario Kart World yet, but he's still holding out hope that Block Fort can come back. Bring back Block Fort!</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a game set to launch alongside the Switch 2 in June that offers a guided tour of the console itself in video game form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is described as a "virtual exhibition" of the new hardware. Per Nintendo: "through tech demos, minigames and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Direct showed footage of a small player avatar exploring a super-sized Switch 2, reading about the different features and facts about the console. It also includes mini-games such as Speed Golf, Dodge the Spiked Balls, and a Maracas Physics Demo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can now confirm that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-be-a-paid-tour-of-your-new-nintendo-switch-2"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</u></a> costs $9.99 and is a digital-only product. That’s significantly cheaper than other Switch 2 games, but IGN has already reported to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-would-you-make-people-pay-for-that-nintendos-decision-to-charge-for-switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-sparks-backlash">the complaints from some Nintendo fans that Welcome Tour costs money at all</a>, with many saying it should be Switch 2 pack-in, as DualSense tech demo game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-ps5-review"><u>Astro's Playroom</u></a> was for PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN interviewed Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen, at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, and asked him if Nintendo discussed making Welcome Tour a pack-in game, and why the company made the decision to price it as a separate digital product.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We need to point out here that our interview with Trinen was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior to<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs"> <u>Nintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the U.S. due to the potential impact of tariffs</u></a>, and subsequent concern that Nintendo may raise the price of the console and its games further as a result.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen said there’s more to Welcome Tour than it appears based on the showing during the Nintendo Direct and even during recent hands-on opportunities the media had access to. Based on what’s actually in the game, Nintendo decided $9.99 “is not an exorbitant price,” he continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's an interesting product,” Trinen began. “We're actually getting ready today, we're going to be doing some Nintendo Treehouse Live segments and covering a lot of games in detail. That's one of them. And I think people will be able to see through Treehouse Live probably a little bit more maybe than you were able to see on the show floor. It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And for that reason and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Welcome Tour is of course just one part of Nintendo’s next-gen push to become embroiled in controversy, and we’ve also got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">Trinen’s response to questions surrounding the company’s decision to go for $80 Switch 2 games</a>, as well as going for $450 for the Switch 2 itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">IGN’s interview with Bill Trinen in full</a> to find out more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The real shock, though, is that Mario Kart World costs $79.99 — $10 higher than the most expensive Nintendo-published game on Switch, Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Nintendo is bundling Mario Kart World with a Nintendo Switch 2 for $499.99, cutting the cost of the game by a huge $30 in the process. However, Nintendo has indicated this bundle is a limited-time offer, and it remains to be seen if the bundle holds at $500, given the uncertainty surrounding the tariff situation and Nintendo’s pre-order delay in the U.S.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $80 — some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games"><u>Switch 2 Edition games</u></a> announced during the Nintendo Direct also cost $79.99, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world"><u>Kirby and The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv"><u>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><u>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games improve upon their original Switch versions in various ways. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, for example, gain additional support for the Zelda Notes service in the Nintendo Switch App that provides game help. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-are-getting-achievements-on-nintendo-switch-2">They also have achievements on Switch 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has plenty of reaction to Nintendo’s jump to $80 for the Switch 2 generation, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">from analysts who have helped us understand why this has happened</a>. But what does Nintendo have to say about it? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">IGN interviewed Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen</a>, at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, to ask about Nintendo’s pricing strategy for Mario Kart World to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We need to point out here that our interview with Trinen was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs"><u>Nintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the U.S. due to the potential impact of tariffs</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In his response, Trinen insisted Mario Kart world justifies its price tag, and pointed to the upcoming dedicated Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct where fans will learn more about the game and what it has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?” Trinen said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We also asked Trinen about the $80 cost of some of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games. While there is a $10 upgrade path for existing owners of these games on the Switch, and both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($69.99) and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($79.99) are available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, Nintendo is not offering any sort of discount to newcomers on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen’s answer here echoed his Mario Kart World response, pointing to the value Nintendo sees in its games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' " he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game. For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Trinen is saying here is that Nintendo believes its next-generation push is worth a price hike when you consider what the video games themselves have to offer. And that’s a point echoed by Piers Harding-Rolls, Research Director, Games at Ampere Analysis. He told IGN Nintendo has form when it comes to going high for the cost of its games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo has a bit of a history of pricing games higher than other platforms when coming to the market later than other platforms - in this case PS5 and Xbox Series,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember back in the day N64 titles being more than PS1 titles for example. Some of that is related to cost of goods, but Nintendo also likes to follow its own approach and price based on its own appreciation of value."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the current $450 price tag of the Switch 2 itself, Trinen again pointed to value, but also highlighted the increasing costs associated with releasing a video game console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time,” he told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-fear-impact-of-tariffs-on-switch-2-price-i-shouldnt-as-an-average-person-be-priced-out-of-this">some Nintendo fans have expressed concern that they may be priced out of the next-generation</a> if the company goes even higher than the already controversial prices for the Switch 2 and its games such as Mario Kart World due to the tariff situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is increasingly clear, however, is that despite calls from the community for Nintendo to drop the price, the Switch 2 and its games are much more likely to get even more expensive than cheaper in the United States.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Nintendo has sought to justify its bumper £75/$80 price tag for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and pointed to the lower cost of fellow <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> big hitter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> as evidence it had not established a new, more expensive "benchmark".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/04/07/mario-kart-world-price-nintendo-doug-bowser/">The Washington Post</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss Doug Bowser said Mario Kart World's higher price tag was simply an example of "variable pricing" that reflected the "breadth and depth of the gameplay".
</p>
<p>
"I think you can anticipate that there will be variable pricing, and we haven't set a benchmark," Bowser said.

<p>
Historically, Nintendo has set some game prices higher than others - most recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which was priced at $70, an extra $10 on top of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
</p>
<p>
Other Switch 2 games from Nintendo include Donkey Kong Bananza (£65/$70) and the budget Switch 2 Welcome Tour, which is expected to cost around £5. It's worth noting, too, that Mario Kart World can be bought at a significant discount in a bundle with a Switch 2 - though it's unclear how long this offer will last, or whether stock will be sufficient to meet launch demand.
</p>
<p>
Bowser's comments, published today, were apparently recorded before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Nintendo made the dramatic decision to delay US Switch 2 pre-orders</a> due to the impact of tariffs. 
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 will still launch on 5th June worldwide, including in the US, though fans there fear Nintendo may decide to increase the console's price in response to the current global economic situation.
</p>
<p>Earlier today, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return">Nintendo Korea leak revealed the return of an iconic location to Mario Kart World</a>, which Nintendo has so far tried to keep under wraps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643277/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-doug-bowser-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>In addition to a new console and lineup of games, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">Nintendo also revealed some sticker shock</a> at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">its Switch 2 event last week</a>. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">console will cost $449.99</a> — a big jump from the original Switch, which debuted at $299.99 in 2017. Some have speculated that the price hike was at least partly due to the ongoing confusion around President Donald Trump’s planned tariffs. The timing was certainly awkward; Trump announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">fresh, wide-ranging wave of global tariffs</a> the same day as Nintendo’s event.</p></div><p>But Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser says that tariffs did not directly impact the console’s original price tag. “Put [<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">the April 2nd announcement</a>] aside. Any previous tariffs were not factored into the price itself,“ he explained, speaking to me the day after the event.</p><p>That may be true, but the impact of the April 2nd tariff announcement is already being felt. Just two days after its event, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">Nintendo announced that it was delaying Switch 2 preorders</a>, which were originally slated to begin on April 9th, in order to “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” There’s currently no new preorder date, and whether the price of the console will be changed is unclear. “The news is fresh, and like many companies right now, we are actively assessing what the impact may be,” Bowser says.</p><p>So why <em>is </em>the Switch 2 so expensive? When I asked Bowser, he rattled off a list of the new console’s features: the bigger LCD screen, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">the more powerful internals</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">the Joy-Con controllers</a> that have been “enlarged and redesigned for durability,” the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">GameChat social layer built into the console</a>, and more. “We want to make sure that this is a device that is approachable, that consumers will see as part of their overall entertainment experiences and will understand that it has longevity to it,” Bowser says. “And all of those factors really go into the consideration of the price.”</p><p>The Switch 2’s price tag also puts it in the premium spot in Nintendo’s lineup. Even with the announcement of the new console, Nintendo will still be selling all three models of the original Switch — the base unit, the OLED version, and the Switch Lite — for the foreseeable future. But Bowser gave an unclear response when asked if the existing Switch devices, which top out at $349.99, had an impact on the decision to charge $449.99 for the Switch 2. “You want to consider pricing relative to the Switch since we still have that in distribution,” he says. “But, really, the consideration was driven more by what is a part of this particular gaming experience versus what it is relative to the Switch 1.”</p><div><p>“We are actively assessing what the impact may be.”</p></div><p>The console isn’t the only part of the Switch lineup that’s gotten more expensive. Select Switch 2 games have also received a price bump. For example, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> will cost $79.99 when it comes out on June 5th, compared to the standard $59.99 for first-party games on the original Switch. Speaking generally about determining pricing for games, Bowser says that “each game, we believe, is a unique experience,” and thus prices can vary accordingly.</p><p>That’s how <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour </em>— a game that teaches players details about the Switch 2 and offers tech demos highlighting its key features — ended up as a paid game instead of a free pack-in title like <em>Wii Sports</em> or <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller">Astro’s Playroom</a></em>. “As this game was being developed, what’s been packed into it is a depth of minigame experiences,” Bowser says. “They’re very deep, they’re very repeatable. And so, as we looked at that depth of play experience and opportunity, we felt that $9.99 was a fair price to ask for that.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They won’t be used for all releases, but essentially they’re Switch 2 cartridges that don’t actually contain a game, but instead feature a “key” that’s used for “downloading the full game to your system via the internet.”</p><p>As video games continue to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/638535/physical-digital-video-games-nintendo-xbox-ps5-disc-cart">shift away from physical releases</a>, game-key cards understandably created some confusion among fans. I had the chance to ask Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser why they exist, and the answer was pretty simple: retail stores.</p><p>“In essence, it’s a digital game on a card,” he said. “What it’s beneficial for is for our publishing partners to be able to bring games to market that may be of a significant size, and therefore they may need too large a cartridge for that game. It allows them to sell those physical games at retail.”</p><p>That makes a certain amount of sense, as retail stores are still a notable market for Nintendo in particular. Bowser also noted that, in an attempt to make the distinction between the Switch 2 and its predecessor more clear, the company is “working with our retailers in the US” to create “separate sections for Nintendo Switch 2, so there will be that point of delineation at retail.” (Switch 2 cases also feature a different design with <em>a lot</em> of red on them.)</p><p>Still, the existence of game-key cards will likely be a disappointment for those who rely on physical games for either collecting or preservation purposes — even if it means more large-scale games on the Switch.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An official announcement for Final Fantasy 9 Remake could be imminent, as Square Enix has just teased the game on its social media.</p>



<p>A new post from Square Enix on <a href="https://x.com/SquareEnix/status/1909229750176075791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) features a quote from the ending sequence of Final Fantasy 9 Remake: “My memories will be part of the sky…” The image was accompanied by a caption, “If you know, you know,” with a crying emoji. Many players speculate that Square Enix is teasing a Final Fantasy 9 Remake announcement with the latest post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players have been hoping for a Final Fantasy 9 Remake for a very long time; however, this is Square Enix’s first direct reference to the title. A week ago, Final Fantasy 9 Remake rumours heated up with the arrival of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-rumors-heat-up-with-new-ff9-website-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25th Anniversary website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new Remake series sounds like an excellent idea for Square Enix, seeing how their Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy has performed. We have received two instalments for their current remake project, each performing better than the last. Fans hope other instalments of the stories receive the same treatment, too, and there’s hope that Final Fantasy 9 could be next in line.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Since April 2’s big Nintendo Switch 2 showcase, the talk surrounding the new console hasn’t been about it’s features, specs, or even release date. Rather, the focus has been on the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 itself as well as—and in some cases more so—its game prices. Now, in a new interview with IGN, Nintendo is defending its decision to charge $80, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more in some regions</a>, for its first-party titles.</p>



<p>During a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sit down with IGN</a>, Nintendo of America’s Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen was asked about the pricing decisions by the company. Right off the bat, Trinen justified the decision to charge $80 for Mario Kart World due to the game’s value to players.</p>



<p>“I would say it’s less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it’s more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what’s the content, and what’s the value?” he said. </p>



<p>“But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there’s still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they’re going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they’ve ever had.”</p>



<p>On the topic of other Nintendo Switch 2 games charging $80, Trinen, again, said it’s because of the value Nintendo sees in its games for players.</p>



<p>“[What] I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, ‘what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?” Trinen said. </p>



<p>“What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you’re looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that’s the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game. For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there’s no additional charge for those.</p>



<p>“But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what’s the content, what’s the value, and what’s an appropriate price based on that.”</p>



<p>Regarding the $450 price of the console itself, Trinen said that it had to due with the cost of producing the system alongside the value it brought to players. IGN made it clear that the interview took place prior to Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulling pre-orders</a> in the United States, leading to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/trumps-new-tariffs-on-exports-to-u-s-could-push-nintendo-switch-2-price-higher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculation that the cost</a> of the system could go up.</p>

            <p>
Last week's big <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> unveiling prompted plenty of excitement for the game's new open world formula and its expanded character roster - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">including its Cow</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But the reveal also came with questions - namely, where the heck is Rainbow Road? Well, thanks to sneaky leak by Nintendo Korea, we now have an answer.
</p>

<p>
Mario Kart World will indeed include Rainbow Road, it appears, after an icon for it was briefly displayed on the Nintendo Korea website for the game. 
</p>
<p>
The image including Rainbow Road has now been removed, presumably to keep its inclusion a secret, but of course the internet has already taken notice.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1jqrwq8/rainbow_road_has_finally_been_found_it_seems_it/">Rainbow Road has finally been found. It seems it will be unlocked later in the game.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TonkyTc/">u/TonkyTc</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/">mariokart</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
Does this secrecy mean Rainbow Road will be kept as an unlockable extra area in-game? Or perhaps Nintendo is just holding something back for its next marketing push - likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">the game's dedicated Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct</a>, due on 17th April.
</p>
<p>
Looking at Mario Kart World's full world map, it looks like Rainbow Road will sit just below Princess Peach's Castle, in the lower centre of the map.

<p>
Mario Kart World's demo, which Eurogamer played last week, limited players to only exploring certain sections of the game's open world, with others off-limits. It remains to be seen how the game's world will open up when it is fully playable on launch, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, on 5th June.
</p>
<p>
In other news, Nintendo Korea's website has been responsible for another slip-up. Earlier today we noted that it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-nintendo-accidentally-reveals-surprise-character-appears-in-donkey-kong-bananza">revealed a surprise character set to appear in fellow Switch 2 game Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.

			<p>It has been a while since a puzzle game so utterly drew me in, but the puntastically named Blue Prince has managed to do exactly that. The premise of the game is that the main character’s great uncle has left him his home which is Mt Holly mansion with sprawling grounds in his will, but there is a condition to be met. The mansion has 45 rooms, but to be able to inherit it the heir must find the hidden 46th room. A tough task made tougher by the fact that the layout of the mansion changes each day.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blue Prince Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Goj5usM4tGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the early hints that you come across in Blue Prince is to take notes, and if you dismiss this advice you will struggle. Blue Prince is a game of secrets, which you would expect from a game that has a hidden room, and there are clues spread out that will point you to the solutions of the puzzles found throughout the mansion. Due to the nature of the game, you may not come across these clues or solutions again for a while. I kept a Word document to make note of each clue, referring to it as each day was reset.</p>


<p>At the start of the day you have a blank canvas to work with. The only room that is in place is the entrance hall, and from there three doors lead off into the mansion. Before you set off, you should make a note of how many steps you are starting with. Every time you enter or exit a room you lose a step, even when retracing your steps, and when that counter reaches zero, the day ends.</p>


<p>When you select a door to open, three room plans are drawn which you must choose from. These could be basic rooms like the Den, Parlor, and Billiards room, or something a little more special. Each room has a chance to let you pick up keys to unlock doors, gems to pay for certain room plans, and gold for items like food or a metal detector. There’s also a chance to find a bedroom, which can replenish your step count. However, as you make your way through the mansion in the hope of reaching the antechamber at the far end, you will also encounter rooms that have detrimental effects on you. The weight room will take away half of your steps, while the archive room will hide one plan when you are drafting rooms.</p>
<p>There are so many different rooms to discover, each with their own pros and cons, which makes putting your blueprint together that bit more challenging. A lot of the detrimental rooms have four doors so you can at least continue onwards, while some rooms that do provide advantages may only have one way in and out. As you create rooms you need to keep looking at your blueprint to avoid getting yourself trapped in a dead-end situation. If you do this you have a couple of options, go out and explore the grounds or call it a day and begin again.</p>

<p>The grounds hold secrets too and you will come across puzzles out there. Solve these and you will unlock permanent buffs that will provide a small advantage each day. Other puzzles will lead you to clues that will be necessary to note though you can go back and review these at any time as much of the outside does not change daily.</p>
<p>Blue Prince’s visual design is excellent, with each room having a distinct design so you can tell where you are at a glance. A small issue is that interactive items can be tricky to spot. For example, in the Pump Room you can manage the water of the estate and it took me a little while to realise there were additional switches behind the tanks I was interacting with. Operating the pump became a lot easier once I found them.</p>
<p>The main sound of the game is the music and much of it is quite chill, with some slower themes in the mix too. It’s nice enough, but it doesn’t grab you. In a way, that is understandable as much of the progress will feel slow at times, but a few more upbeat beats would have been welcome.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Blue Prince is an excellent, intricate, and intriguing puzzle game that will have you thinking about solutions even when not playing it. While there's some minor foibles, coming across a puzzle and scrolling through your notes for an answer from previous runs is very satisfying. Blue Prince is one of the best puzzle game available.	</p></div>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 looks to have <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great third-party developer support</a>, with many recent titles announced for the upcoming hybrid console. One of these titles is Sid Meier's Civilization VII, which launched a couple of months ago to lower-than-usual reviews for the traditional king of the 4X turn-based strategy genre. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8 out of 10 score</a>, whereas previous entries had all scored above 9.</p>
<p>The good news is that Civilization VII will perform nicely on the Nintendo Switch 2, at least according to the development team. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/switch-2-civ-vii-hogwarts-legacy-hades-ii" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Game File</a> during the press hands-on event, Dennis Shirk (Executive Producer at Firaxis Games) said:</p>
<p><em>We were able to make this look like a mid-tier PC, because it's got enough power. We are extremely happy, and it's been easy. Their software development kit is great, the customer support, their developer support, developer relations is great. They knew they wanted Civilization VII on that platform because it’s such a great showcase for the mouse. And it pairs up so well with our existing PC audience because we have crossplay.</em></p>
<p>Civilization VII is actually already available on the original Switch, but it will look much better on the Nintendo Switch 2 (not to mention the mouse-like support enabled by the new Joy-Con 2 controller). The same goes for Hogwarts Legacy.&nbsp; Jimmie Nelson, Senior Producer for Tech, VFX, and Lighting at WB Games / Avalanche Software, stated:</p>
<p><em>We originally started with our Switch version. We got very good results really quickly, but we felt like we could make a higher quality product if we brought in a lot of the high-resolution assets and raised the resolution, textures, lighting, and world streaming.</em></p>
<p>The version available for the original Switch introduced mandatory loads between certain zones, such as before entering Hogsmeade. However, this limitation has been removed on the Nintendo Switch 2, thus making this new version feel more seamless. Both games will be part of the launch line-up when the Nintendo Switch 2 debuts in stores on June 5.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blue-prince-review-i-finished-the-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve.1157100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Blue Prince</em> is a roguelite puzzle game where you draft room tiles to try to build out from the Entrance Hall in search of the mysterious Room 46. I'm an avid fan of puzzle games that require you to break out the pad and paper, so when I tell you that I reached Room 46 at about 18 hours of gameplay, but I've currently got 68 hours played there's a lot more to <em>Blue Prince</em> than meets the eye.</p>

<p>The game begins with a simple story: your uncle Herbert Sinclair has named you, Simon Jones, the sole inheritor of his Mount Holly estate. This will include his home, land, employees, and fortune with the big asterisk that he must first find the fabled Room 46 in his mansion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-day-marker.jpg?itok=geGJLXhe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-day-marker.jpg?itok=eIsjaMxw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every day begins with informing you just how long you've been exploring the mansion</figcaption></figure><p>You're given no hints as to how to reach it, or about what a challenge searching the mansion will be as every day you begin with only the Entrance Hall in the southmost row of the house and you need to approach doors and draw from a deck of potential rooms, fitting them together like jigsaw pieces.</p>

<p>As you build out the mansion, you'll get to explore the different rooms, interact with the strange mechanisms of the rooms, and slowly uncover all kinds of secrets. An early example of a room with a singular puzzle is the Observatory. After using two cranks correctly to position the telescope out the window, you can start to receive different prizes each time you draw this card into your mansion.</p>

<p>Beginning the story with a treasure hunt primes the player perfectly to go into each room scrutinizing every aspect, tracking down and making note of things that interest you, and testing out as many theories as you can. I had an incredible time noting down the leads that I was currently tailing, and even I was starting to get a bit overwhelmed when that list got into the double digits.</p>

<h2><em>Blue Prince</em> And Blueprints</h2>

<p>You explore the house and its grounds in the first person, immersing you in the world and also making it easy to miss out on interesting clues here and there if you're not looking closely enough. There are also a variety of things you might not have known could be interacted with, or need certain criteria met to be useful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-exploration.jpg?itok=HVZw2I8t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-exploration.jpg?itok=ROnMrOMV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Build out a strange and wonderful house with each run, attempting to uncover your next clue</figcaption></figure><p>There are ways that you'll get stopped from exploring, unlike a standard roguelike, where it might be more difficult enemies <em>Blue Prince</em> will control your exploration through luck of the draw and the different kinds of items you'll find around the mansion.</p>

<p>Each day isn't just a matter of filling up the 5x9 grid, as rooms might only turn left or right, or have no exits at all. You also have a step counter that is constantly lowering by one for every room you enter. Add to this locked doors that require you to collect keys on your journey, gems required to pay for creating rarer rooms, and rooms that work against you.</p>

<p>Red Rooms are dangerous rooms that will begin to impart negative effects on you. The Archive will mean you'll only be able to see two of the three drawn floor plans, the Chapel will steal a coin from you every time you step foot into it, and the Weight Room will drop your remaining step counter in half.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-dead-end.jpg?itok=8fuf48Bp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-dead-end.jpg?itok=7lJvtH0s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Build your house wrong and where there should be a doorway you'll find none</figcaption></figure><p>Some runs you'll make it all the way through the mansion, even filling up every tile in the house, and other runs will get cut short as you only draw left-facing tiles and get stuck in a tiny loop.</p>

<h2>Layered Puzzle Solving</h2>

<p><em>Blue Prince</em> is a game of many puzzles, some are simple single-room contraptions, while others will require knowledge you've acquired across multiple runs, a collection of carefully collected items, and a combination of specific rooms to be drawn from the deck.</p>

<p>Something that the <em>Blue Prince</em> does so well with its puzzles is how disconnected they all are from one another. While playing the game, I knew that there were certain puzzles that I should be looking out for to complete next, but just by happenstance, I'd stumble into the solution of a completely different puzzle, revealing some whole new aspect to the game that I had never even considered would be present.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-redacted-history.jpg?itok=hFmo54Ri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-redacted-history.jpg?itok=GUBWm3fO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Learn about Simon's family, as well as the world he inhabits (even if it's slightly redacted)</figcaption></figure><p>By having these puzzles and clues so spread out across so many of the rooms and having basic requirements to incredibly complex ones it means that even if there was a single goal I had in mind if I didn't happen to draw that specific room on any given day there was pretty much always something for me to do.</p>

<p>At least most of the time…</p>

<h2>RNG Can Break This Experience</h2>

<p>As <em>Blue Prince</em> is a game with finite content, there were definitely a few times after I had reached Room 46, and solved another wave or two of interconnected puzzles, that there were specific goals in mind that might have required a specific room be drawn or a certain combination of items appear.</p>

<p>If you're in it for the long haul you'll find that there will be a few times that your options get bottlenecked. When each run can be anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour, if you don't happen to have the stars align for what you're after, it can start to feel like you've wasted that time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-drafting-room.jpg?itok=u_xpNEix 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-drafting-room.jpg?itok=QhOuguiE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While there's a puzzle to solve in the Shelter if you're waiting for the Tomb to appear this can be a frustrating sight</figcaption></figure><p>There are some ways you can do some level of manipulation of rooms or likelihood to generate certain items, but normally, the scenario to set that up is also by chance.</p>

<p>An easy example of this might be if you're looking to light a candle, to do so you'd need to combine the Metal Detector and a Magnifying Glass. For something as simple as lighting a candle, you're now looking at the need to draft the room a candle would be in, drafting the Workshop, and hoping that the Metal Detector and Magnifying Glass appear somewhere in your mansion.</p>

<p>You might draw a room that could have a chance to make the Workshop a more common card, likewise, accessing a certain computer could allow you to request a Magnifying Glass to be purchasable at the Commisary (but then you'd also need to make sure you draw that room).</p>

<p>You definitely never feel like the requirements are helpless, but it can be frustrating to put a few hours into the late game and not feel like you've made meaningful progression.</p>

<h2>Progression And Momentum</h2>

<p>While the core structure of the game repeats as a Roguelite there are a variety of opportunities to make the experience easier from run to run, some temporary, while others are permanent. For those times where you have a special item but the room where you want to use it isn't drafted, there's a chance you might also draft the Coat Check Room. Checking an item here pulls it out of the normal rotation and instead guarantees it the next time you obtain the Coat Check. It's a great way to make an otherwise rare item just a little bit less rare.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-upgrade.jpg?itok=vzWPM6Hj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-upgrade.jpg?itok=xpUfLJoj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Options aplenty to upgrade my Storeroom, but do I favor keys, gems, or some extra money?</figcaption></figure><p>There are also permanent upgrades that will allow you chances to do more each run and make meeting certain criteria that much easier, but I don't want to go too far into spoiling those. Some of these permanent upgrades also include making improvements to the rooms you already have, or even adding new rooms to the room pool.</p>

<p>Looking back, it's quite astounding to me how the core of the gameplay has been so consistent, yet the upgrades make exploration more and more consistent.</p>

<h2>Post Room 46</h2>

<p>As I alluded to in the introduction, I reached Room 46 in less than a third of what my current playtime is, and I assure you, between writing this review and when it will be published, I'll have likely put in another 5-10 hours. Reaching Room 46 is only just scratching the surface of this incredible puzzle game.</p>

<p>Rooms that you'll have passed through literally 100 times will be revealed to hold incredible secrets once a certain clue has been deciphered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince-billiards-room-puzzle.jpg?itok=x2LQyXeK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-prince-billiards-room-puzzle.jpg?itok=rFGqxr60 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Billboard Puzzle is one of the first you'll encounter, and even 70+ hours in it's changing on me</figcaption></figure><p>Every new layer of the puzzle you solve and open the way for an additional layer will be an incredibly rewarding experience while fueling a puzzle lover's desire to continue deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Not just the puzzles will continue after finding Room 46, as the story of Simon, his eccentric Uncle, and his entire family tree will continue to expand… but if you want to learn more about that, I'd highly recommend you just get lost in the game.</p>

<h2><em>Blue Prince</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Blue Prince</em> takes a concept that is not wholly unfamiliar in a game, using deckbuilding and roguelike mechanics, to explore a 'dungeon' of sorts, but dials it up to 11 for a puzzle lover's brain. Exploring the mansion and interacting with its different mechanisms is easy to do, but so satisfying when completed.</p>

<p>If you were to complete the base experience you'd still get a complete experience filled with exploration, puzzles, and satisfying feelings that you've overcome the obstacles that the game has had to offer you. If you're a player who is looking to complete the deeper experience you'll be returning for hours on end.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of puzzling games with intriguing stories you'll likely not only enjoy this game but devour it. If you aren't too sure about more complicated puzzles you can still enjoy the game and reach Room 46 and put it down when the puzzles stop being interesting, if you can.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-guns-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty Warzone brought back Verdansk in 2025. It reminds us of a simpler time, but we must put nostalgia aside and concentrate on eliminating players and taking home dubs. The best Meta Warzone guns are the key, so let’s find out the best guns to use right now.</p>



<p>Verdansk, it’s good to see you again. The reintroduction of (probably) battle royale’s most popular map has seen a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-hits-highest-peak-viewer-count-since-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge uptick in CoD players</a>. The community is scrambling to unlock the devilishly difficult to obtain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-trail-blazer-skin-unlock-fast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trail Blazer skin</a>, and they’re trying out new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone features such as Casual Mode</a>. </p>



<p>We’ve already covered what we think is the definitive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Meta Warzone Loadout</a>. But if you want a greater pool of guns to choose from, we’ve got what you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-assault-rifle-guns-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk-right-now">Best Assault Rifle Guns to Use in Warzone Verdansk Right Now</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One shot is all you need. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The best Meta Assault Rifles to use in Warzone right now are easily the CR-56 AMAX, Kilo 141, and AK-74.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not naming 10 guns for each category as it’s a waste of time. These are the <em>best </em>of the best when it comes top fast-firing and hard-hitting ARs. You also have to bear in mind that buffs and nerfs will change the Meta, so be ready to pivot when the time comes.</p>



<p>But there’s a distinct old-school feeling with the Warzone AR Meta in 2025. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMAX</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-kilo-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kilo 141</a>, and AK-74 have been staples in Verdansk at one point or another.</p>



<p>We think the AMAX is the best of the bunch—which is why it made it into our best Warzone Verdansk Meta Loadout—but you won’t go wrong with any of the three.</p>



<p>Also, while a couple of the Attachments may vary, all three guns benefit massively from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-monolithic-suppressor-attachment-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monolithic Suppressor</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-smg-guns-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk-right-now">Best SMG Guns to Use in Warzone Verdansk Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>The KSV, C9 (AKA MP5), and Saug are the main players in Warzone’s SMG department.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, I would still prefer the best ARs over SMGs—that’s a personal preference. According to <a href="https://wzstats.gg/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone Meta</a>, these are the top three most popular SMGs as it stands. They benefit players who like to get in close and decimate enemies at close range.</p>



<p>SMGs should serve you better if you don’t care for Sniping or engaging at a distance. Furthermore, throwing a quick <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-thermite-lethal-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thermite</a> before storming a player’s location isn’t the worst idea in the world!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sniper-rifle-gun-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk-right-now">Best Sniper Rifle Gun to Use in Warzone Verdansk Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>Warzone’s HDR is undoubtedly the best Sniper Rifle in CoD’s battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> one-shots anyone at <strong>any distance</strong>. I’m not saying you need to start dropping shots from 800m away, but you can equip the HDR knowing if you land a headshot, you’ll instantly delete whoever is the unfortunate soul on the other end of the shot.</p>



<p>Other Snipers will likely be buffed to provide competition (Kar98K, please), but the HDR is king right now.</p>
