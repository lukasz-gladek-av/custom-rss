			<p>Stellar Blade developer SHIFT UP has announced the signing of a publishing deal with Tencent's Level Infinite for their upcoming game codenamed Project Spirits.</p>



<p>The press release mentions that this will be a cross-platform game developed on Unreal Engine 5 for PC, consoles and mobile. It is being co-developed between SHIFT UP and Yongxing Interactive, an affiliate of Tencent. </p>



<p>This partnership marks the second global collaboration between Level Infinite and SHIFT UP, following the successful global release of GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE. Both companies are committed to achieving even greater synergy with Project Spirits than with their previous venture and, as part of this process, Level Infinite and SHIFT UP have reportedly strengthened their strategic partnership to encompass publishing and joint development.</p>



<p>The South Korean studio's first hit was indeed the mobile game GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE, but it was Stellar Blade that propelled it to global renown. </p>



<p>Last week, SHIFT UP <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the sequel would be a multiplatform release that launches on multiple consoles, unlike the first installment which was published by Sony Interactive Entertainment on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The original game earned a 9/10 score on Wccftech:</p>



<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve off-putting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach has been listed for PC, bringing closer the moment in which you and I can learn why exactly Troy Baker is a glam rocker, why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> director George Miller (it's not actually him) has a cat demon, and why Turkish-German screenwriter Fatih Akin has become a living doll. Sony have yet to announce the PC version of Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> courier fantasy or give it a release date, but the Entertainment Software Rating Board have <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">a page up now</a>. Go on, Sony - call them liar liar, pants on fire.
</p>
<p>Which leads us neatly into the detail of said ESRB ratings page - it warns that you will encounter "a man set on fire in a fantastical manner" in Death Stranding 2. Possibly the man was being deceitful? A social stealth game featuring self-combustion would be neat, actually, and is absolutely the kind of brilliant garbage Kojima would develop. The ESRB further caution that "the word 'f**k' is heard in the game." Well, that's me out. I was already iffy on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-death-stranding-2-trailer-features-a-familiar-bandana-and-a-weapon-to-legally-surpass-metal-gear">the flagrant Snake bait</a>. I don't want to hear not-George Miller swear.
</p>
<p>I found the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> a mixture of unbearable and fascinating, with the balance shifting towards fascinating as I revisited the game after review and made connections between its portering and path-beating mechanics and my own experiences of getting horribly lost in the vicinity of Kettlewell. It was also one of RPS's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-games-of-2020">favourite games of 2020</a>, with Katharine (RPS in peace) calling it "a walking simulator in the very best sense of the word".
</p>
<p>The sequel remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games of 2025</a>. There's still time for a surprise end-of-year release. Come to think of it, isn't there some big industry awards show round the corner in December? In other news, Hideo Kojima has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-has-learned-so-many-ways-to-kill-people">learned so many ways to kill people</a> and we really should hurry up and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already">send him to outer space</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Envy has become the third major organisation to pull out of Marvel Rivals’ Esports scene, with an announcement stating a decision to pause “competitive operations in Marvel Rivals.”</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals’ Esports scene has grown significantly in the year since launch, with competition including the Ignite Mid-Season Finals in Guangzhou, China, offering a $500,000 prize pool, but the scene has been hit by the departure of major teams in recent months.</p>







<h2 id="h-envy-follows-sentinels-100-thieves-out-of-marvel-rivals">Envy Follows Sentinels, 100 Thieves Out of Marvel Rivals</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Departure. Image via Envy</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a statement on Twitter, Envy’s decision to halt operations in Marvel Rivals Esports was confirmed, but, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sentinels-announce-marvel-rivals-esports-exit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similarly to the Sentinels</a>, the door has been left open for a return in the future.</p>



<p>The statement read: “Today, we’re announcing that we will be pausing our competitive operations in Marvel Rivals. We’re incredibly proud of the effort and passion our roster brought to the game, and grateful for what we were able to build together during our time in the scene.</p>



<p>“As of today, all our players are free to explore new opportunities, and we wish each of them success in what comes next. As the Marvel Rivals competitive ecosystem develops, we hope to see the return of Envy Rivals.”</p>



<p>With Envy, Sentinels, and 100 Thieves all announcing their exit from the Rivals Esports scene, which comes free of the Ignite Grand Finals in Atlanta that culminated earlier this month, there is major uncertainty about the future heading into the second year of Esports competition.</p>



<p>NetEase have not commented on the departures from the Esports scene, but a recent post on the <a href="https://x.com/RivalsEsports/status/1993356509611168183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Twitter account</a> of Marvel Rivals Esports said 2025 was “just the beginning,” and that “in 2026, that spark becomes something even greater.”</p>

            <p>Remember Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2? The Ubisoft game last seen publicly at E3 2017, coming up on seventeen years of development? Well, believe it or not, it's still actively being worked on. In fact, Ubisoft is hiring new staff to work on it.</p>
<p>This is proven by a <a href="https://hitmarker.net/jobs/ubisoft-technical-sound-designer-m-f-nb-beyond-good-evil-2-montpellier-1584708">hot new job listing for a technical sound designer</a> popping up overnight, a role that'll explicitly be working at Ubisoft Montpellier on the infamous sequel. The job description also provides an up-to-date description of what Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will actually be.</p>
<p>This description reads: "Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is an action-adventure open world game set in a captivating space opera universe and the direct prequel to the 2003 cult classic. Based on a breakthrough technology driven by the proprietary Voyager engine, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 aims to offer a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations, colorful characters and mysteries to uncover, solo or with friends. So, if you are ready for an adventure like no other, come join forces with us to build System 3!"</p>

<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has gone through the ringer when it comes to development, as you'd expect given how long it's been in Ubisoft's oven.  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">The game got a new creative director last year</a>, with original creator Michel Ancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2s-troubled-development-due-to-passionate-managers-not-getting-along-says-creator-michel-ancel">saying the troubled development came down to "passionate managers" not getting along</a>. The anniversary edition of Beyond Good &amp; Evil, released last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evils-new-anniversary-edition-content-demands-bge2-is-made">included new cutscenes that further pointed to the sequel's existence</a>. So in spite of all the messiness, there does seem to be a relatively recent push to get this game made.</p><p>Ubisoft has been going through a drastic shift in structure and focus recently. Earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">it established Vantage Studios with Tencent, a new subsidiary that now owns many of Ubisoft's major franchises</a>. Montpellier, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, did not move over to this new gaming venture.</p>
<p>Then there's the recent AI push, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">with Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stating that he believes generative AI will be as big a revolution for the video game industry as the leap to 3D</a>. Worth noting is that generative AI software isn't mentioned in this Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 job post.</p>
<p>So there we have it, a sign of life from Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 yet again. Though after a while, one would hope you'd stop seeing signs of life and actual life itself. This decade, hopefully!</p>

<p>Wallace, who is Australian, also has credits in shows including Euphoria and The Society, as well as films such as The Bikeriders with Tom Hardy, Eden with Jude Law and Ana de Armas (pictured below), and Inside with Guy Pearce.</p>
<p>Resharing the announcement of Wallace's casting, the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1993387005955211285">Assassin's Creed social media account</a> posted the two peering eyes emoji.</p>
<p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">was first announced in 2020</a>. The long-in-the-works series is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show. Filming is currently reported to be starting next year, in Italy.</p>

<p>According to the official blurb for Netflix's take on Assassin's Creed, the series will be "centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny".</p><p>Once upon a time, Die Hard writer Jeb Stuart was attached to Netflix's Assassin's Creed project. However, in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-loses-die-hard-writer-jeb-stuart">Stuart stepped away from the series due to differing visions between himself and the show's executives</a>. Meanwhile, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-anime-announced-by-netflix-castlevania-creator">Assassin's Creed anime was announced by Netflix in 2017</a> from Adi Shankar, creator of the popular Castlevania animated series. However, the project ultimately failed to materialise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>Two Bungie leakers have come out publicly to say that Bungie has begun work on Destiny 3. The first to do so <a href="https://x.com/Bungie_Leaks/status/1993425004281639083" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was Bungie_Leaks</a>, a former leaker who stopped posting leaks a few months ago to avoid legal troubles with the developer. However, in this case, they are reposting information that was originally shared by another X user, <a href="https://x.com/starsiza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starsiza,</a> whose tweets are protected (meaning they can only be seen by those who have been approved). Beyond the Destiny 3 rumor, the tweet also mentions that 'something like a Destiny 2 classic game' has been greenlit, which the leaker claims is also the reason the D2 roadmap was recently delayed.</p>



<p>Around five hours later, trustworthy Bungie leaker Colony Deaks/Deakstiny <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated the report with the following tweet</a>:</p>



<p><em>Yes, Destiny 3 is in extremely early development. Some of you may have seen a tweet early this afternoon that mentioned that. We have been sitting on the info for a few weeks now and wanted to wait to talk about this seeing as it is in such an early state, and it just sucks to see others post about it carelessly for free internet points. We plan to share more info in the coming months as we wait on the larger scale things to develop and take shape. Sit tight.</em></p>



<p>When a follower asked about the other part of the original rumor (the one about a Destiny 2 Classic), Colony Deaks <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993526382517985702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that they currently have a lot of info on that front but are still working to confirm it.</p>



<p>Clearly, though, the big rumor here is Destiny 3. It's no secret that Destiny 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been registering all-time low players on Steam</a> after the launch of the Edge of Fate expansion. A couple of weeks ago, Bungie owner Sony even <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $204 million impairment loss caused by lower-than-expected Destiny 2 sales.</p>



<p>Perhaps this convinced both the developer and its parent company that the only way to reignite interest in the sci-fi franchise is to create a brand-new installment. Indeed, this seems to be the dominant sentiment within the community, with many former players vowing to only return if and when Bungie launches a new entry.</p>



<p>Granted, this is not the first time we've heard rumors about Destiny 3. The first ones stretch all the way back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-starting-development-destiny-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2018</a>, and then again <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-unveils-prismatic-subclass-destiny-3-leak-seemingly-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year</a>, just ahead of The Final Shape expansion that concluded the ten-year-long Light and Darkness saga. Just a few months later, however, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that a third chapter was never in development up to that point. Bungie had been working on a different Destiny experience codenamed Payback, with original Destiny creative directors Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy leading, but that got canceled and the two developers left the studio. Bloomberg's report also said that the new strategy was to release smaller 'experience packs'. However, by now it's quite clear that this is not working, which might have forced them to reconsider. </p>



<p>Even if Destiny 3 is now really a thing that's secretly starting to take shape at the developer, it'd have a long road ahead of launch, given the current average triple-A game development cycle. We might not hear anything concrete for three, four, or even five years, so Destiny 2 is likely to keep going for a while longer.</p>



<p>On that note, Destiny 2 is getting the Star Wars-inspired Renegades expansion on December 2, and Bungie has just released a ViDoc and a launch trailer, as covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-destiny-2-renegades-expansion-ahead-of-launch-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-version-rated-esrb-published-by-sony/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-version-rated-by-esrb-will-be-published-by-sony.1365025/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The PC version of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)</a> in the United States, suggesting that its launch is near. An official announcement may well come at The Game Awards, Geoff Keighley's show which features both awards for the best games of 2025 but also plenty of announcements for upcoming and existing titles. The Game Awards 2025 airs on Thursday, December 11.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the ESRB rating also reveals that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment on PC, just as it was for the PS5 version. It's a change from the first game, which was published on PC by 505 Games. This is also surprising because Kojima Productions bought the publishing rights back from Sony and could have technically self-published this sequel. However, it may be that the studio doesn't yet have the necessary expertise or resources to self-publish, and as such, they are still relying on their partner, Sony. It'll be interesting to see whether the game ever makes it on Xbox like the previous installment and if so, if SIE will still publish there.</p>



<p>The ESRB rating is M for Mature (17+) with Blood and Gore, Partial Nudity, Strong Language, and Violence highlighted by the board. It's the same rating as the PlayStation 5 version, although that's not a surprise, as the content is likely to be identical.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launched on June 26, 2025, for PlayStation 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-estimated-to-have-sold-1-4-million-units-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling an estimated 1.4 million units in June</a> and earning more widespread acclaim than its predecessor. In the Wccftech review, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a world of both the familiar and the alien, of trails well-worn yet frontiers to be explored. So much of what made Kojima Productions’ first title such a unique experience is here, with something brand new to explore. Those looking for a comfortable walking simulator to transport goods by food and explore nature have exactly what they’re looking for, while those who come to Hideo Kojima’s works for the off-the-wall narrative and memorable fight scenes will also walk away satisfied with plenty to chat about online.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-26-899/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s time for a bit of midweek madness; hopefully, your streak can keep up with today’s NYT Connections puzzle! That’s right, I’m here with the latest NYT Connections hints to get you through this midweek lull and keep pushing towards the inevitable weekend. It’s almost the festive window, but for now, we’ll wait to celebrate until you’ve smashed today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>Read on for today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-26">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 26)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #899:</p>



<ul>
<li>CAN</li>



<li>DEB</li>



<li>COULD</li>



<li>JAN</li>



<li>MAY</li>



<li>KAT</li>



<li>MIGHT</li>



<li>SUE</li>



<li>APR</li>



<li>FLOW</li>



<li>CFO</li>



<li>GOD</li>



<li>IRA</li>



<li>MAR</li>



<li>SEC</li>



<li>TAB</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Words that hedge or allow something, often before a main verb.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Common nicknames that stand in for longer given names.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>You’ll see these on statements, filings, and in boardrooms.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Animals that feel a little backwards,</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 26:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-26-899">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 26 (#899)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CAN, COULD, MAY, MIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DEB, JAN, KAT, SUE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – APR, CFO, IRA, SEC</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FLOW, GOD, MAR, TAB</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble keeping up with the successive updates, the studio has now put out a handy blog post of the title's first month in the garden.

            <title><![CDATA[Leaker Claims Destiny 3 Is In Development]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-3-possible-leak-twitter-bungie/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/leaker-claims-destiny-3-is-in-development.1364971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a <strong>credible leaker on Twitter</strong>, <strong>Destiny 3 is currently in development at Bungie</strong>. While not much is said, it seems <strong>the project is very early</strong> in the process.</p>



<p>The Destiny series is a much newer franchise, starting in 2014. It received plenty of acclaim for its great FPS gameplay and multiplayer aspects. Then, in 2017, Destiny 2 was released and has become one of Bungie’s biggest games. Even today, the game continues to get new updates and expansions, including with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-star-wars-collaboration-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars</a>. </p>



<p>While it hasn’t been without controversy, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-copyright-lawsuit-destiny-2-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent copyright lawsuit</a>, fans still flock to the titles for a good time with friends for raids and such. Bungie is currently working on Marathon, set to release in 2026, but, as one credible source posted on social media, the company is returning to the space opera once again.</p>







<h2 id="h-destiny-3-in-early-development-claims-credible-bungie-leaker">Destiny 3 In Early Development, Claims Credible Bungie Leaker</h2>



<p>The claim in question comes from <strong>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Colony Deaks</a></strong>. In previous years, the insider has leaked several Bungie-related information regarding Destiny and Marathon. In <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the tweet</a>, they state,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yes, <strong>Destiny 3 is in extremely early development</strong>. </p>



<p>Some of you may have seen a tweet early this afternoon that mentioned that. We have been sitting on the info for a few weeks now and wanted to wait to talk about this seeing as it is in <strong>such an early state</strong>, and it just sucks to see others post about it carelessly for free internet points. </p>



<p><strong>We plan to share more info in the coming months</strong> as we wait on the larger scale things to develop and take shape. Sit tight.<a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752/photo/1"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite their credibility, <strong>there has been no official confirmation from Bungie</strong>, so <strong>take the leak with a big grain of salt</strong>. It’s also important to note that, since the project is claimed to be in early development, there’s no telling just how far it is. </p>



<p>Sometimes, early development is story building or maybe just even a pitch board. Even still, likely, it’s likely that fans won’t hear much about a possible Destiny 3 for a long time, even if the leak is true. Regardless, it would be nice to see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-mobile-game-destiny-rising-announcement-may-arrive-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Destiny</a> done for newer consoles and with all the new advancements.</p>







<p>What do you think of the Destiny 3 leak? Do you think Bungie is working on it? When do you think it’ll come out? Leave your thoughts down in the comments and in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-nes-and-game-boy-library-with-four-more-titles">return of multiple retro games today</a>, Nintendo has rolled out a new update for the Game Boy app on the Switch and Switch 2, bumping it up to Version 3.0.0.</p>
<p>Apart from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/kid_icarus_of_myths_and_monsters">Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/bionic_commando">Bionic Commando</a>, this major update also comes with some cool new easter eggs. If you missed the boot screen of the Game Boy era featuring the 'Nintendo' logo (or 'Game Boy' one) and iconic sound, the good news is it's back!</p>
<p>It works <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/switch-onlines-gba-app-has-been-updated-version-3-0-0">the same as it does on the GBA</a>. Once you've installed the update, boot up the app and hold the left analogue stick, and you'll see the original Game Boy start screen appear. What's also neat is it's different depending on your 'game screen' settings in the app's options menu.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067iglonj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>So, you'll get whatever screen filter you've got the game screen set to: Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket or Game Boy Color.</p>

<p>One last thing, the sound when booting up the Game Boy - Nintendo Classics app has also been changed from the Game Boy boot up noise to a coin block sound from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a>. If you want to see the boot up of each screen in motion, <a href="https://youtu.be/txjFcpHTmN4">Vooks.net has shared a video</a>.</p>
<p>According to multiple player reports, this latest update has also added the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/psa-you-can-now-remap-nintendo-classics-nes-and-game-boy-controls">ability to remap Game Boy controls</a> in this app. You can find the 'View/Change Controls' setting in the game options menu.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A <strong>PC port of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</strong> has <strong>leaked ahead of any official announcement</strong>. The leak comes from <strong>an ESRB rating</strong>, which has been registered for <strong>Windows PC</strong>.</p>







<p>As one of 2025’s best titles, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-script-was-changed-midway-through-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> continues the legacy of the original 2019 Death Stranding. Crafted by Kojima Productions for PlayStation, the ‘Strand’ game has taken players cross-country delivering packages and building back a broken world. The sequel has garnered much acclaim for its storytelling, music, and direction by Hideo Kojima of Metal Gear fame. At The Game Awards 2025, the title is up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year</a>, as well as six other categories. While only available for PlayStation 5, it seems it’s coming to PC, if the ESRB is anything to go by.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-pc-port-of-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-has-been-leaked-by-the-esrb">A PC Port of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Has Been Leaked by the ESRB</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An ESRB rating for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has emerged online ahead of an official announcement.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official ESRB site</a> has leaked a <strong>Windows PC version</strong> of <strong>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</strong>. No official announcement of a PC port has come out yet, making this a pretty huge leak. Still, until then, take it with a grain of salt. Its rating, M (Mature), matches its PS5 counterpart. The description for its rating also includes some in-depth references, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-esrb-rating-confirms-a-battle-guitar-melee-weapon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the guitar weapon</a> and robotic samurai. As of writing, the page has not been taken down.</p>



<p>The original Death Stranding didn’t go to PC until July 2020, a few months after its first release. With it being rated, it’s likely that Death Stranding 2 is coming to Windows PC sooner than we thought. Interestingly enough, The Game Awards are in two weeks, so perhaps Kojima was planning to reveal it there. Either way, the leak seems rather legit and, if true, means players will get to play one of the year’s best titles in a whole new way.</p>







<p>What do you think of Death Stranding 2’s PC leak? Do you think it’s legit? When do you think it’ll be announced? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cricket 26 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cricket-26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cricket-26-review.1364947/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I fired up Cricket 26 for the first time and hopped into a quick five-over game to get my eye in, I was pleasantly surprised by how substantially smoother it all seemed in contrast with the messy launch state of 2023’s Cricket 24. Cricket 26’s lighting and player models all really pop, the inputs feel far snappier, and the fielders all seem like they actually know there’s a game being played – unlike the dawdling doofuses in Cricket 24 who all seemed to stand around with their hands in their pockets. Then my match between the Mumbai Indians and the Delhi Capitals crashed at the change of innings. At which point I reloaded it, and it crashed again. And again. In fact, the longer I played Cricket 26, the more obvious its numerous technical flaws became, to the point that I’d have to say that my experience with Big Ant Studios’ latest has been a bit like playing on a cricket pitch in Perth – the grass looks greener on day one, but it’s not too long before the cracks start to show. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there’s no question that when it works, Cricket 26 presents a much more enjoyable representation of the sport than Cricket 24 was ever capable of. Batting, in particular, feels far more responsive and natural – whether you’re using the arcade-style button controls or the more intuitive dual-stick setup. For the first time in a long time with this series, I feel like I’m able to consistently direct my strokes where I actually intend them to go, unlike Cricket 24 which often felt a bit predetermined in the way I’d keep knocking off-drives straight to the same cover fielder no matter where I aimed or how well I timed it. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cricket 26 Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say that scoring runs has become too easy, however, and I’ve found myself playing down the wrong line and getting beaten on the inside and outside edges of the bat, which also feels far more true to life. Even on the default difficulty setting, batting in Cricket 26 has provided an absorbing challenge for the most part. I’m yet to feel the need to dig deep into the menus to painstakingly fiddle with the various timing and physics sliders in an effort to make it feel more realistic like I did with Cricket 24, which takes a lot of the trial and error out of the experience.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bowling, on the other hand, hasn’t changed quite as much but it still feels engaging. I had hoped that the wobble seam delivery would have been added to Cricket 26, especially given that it’s become such a common variation these days that Pat Cummins has basically made it his stock ball, but sadly that’s not the case here – and the floaty knuckleball that a number of Indian pacers have added to their arsenals over the past decade or so hasn’t been included either. However, while the delivery types themselves remain the same, there has been some added nuance introduced in the form of the effect of wind on the ball. An arrow on the edge of the pitch map indicates the direction and strength that a gale is blowing, and that can be used to enhance the amount of swing on a delivery (or if you’re batting, how much further a lofted shot will travel should you aim it downwind). It’s a thoughtful addition that brings some extra strategy to each ball you face or deliver.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cricket 26 presents a much more enjoyable representation of the sport than Cricket 24 was ever capable of.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s clearly been a lot of work put into player animations too, especially as far as unique bowling actions are concerned. It’s great to see Nathan Lyon’s signature right-handed flick to the side as he leaves the top of his mark, or Mitchell Santner’s shark fin-like front hand carving through the air above his head as he’s about to release the ball. Some of these unique bowling actions aren’t just for show, either – I’ve found facing Jofra Archer to be noticeably more awkward than other fast bowlers, not just because of his speed on the ball but also the way he seems to lumber in so casually before suddenly exploding through the crease. It’s kept me more conscious of making subtle adjustments to my shot timing as the opposing team rotates from one bowler to the next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, fielding has been substantially overhauled, although certain frustrating quirks still remain. There’s now much less of a delay between a fielder gathering the ball and making a return throw, and there are some new catching animations that see them diving and sliding around in a more agile fashion than they ever did in Cricket 24. However, the slow-motion runout system almost always makes me throw to the opposite end that I intended, and wicketkeeper behaviour is erratic. One moment they’re stubbornly refusing to swipe the bails off during a genuine stumping chance, the next they’re taking a superhuman catch around their ankles down the leg side. Yet, by and large, Cricket 26’s fielders display a level of alertness that more closely resembles the real thing, and it’s nice to see them run in pairs for relay throws or dive towards the rope for a tap-back. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Un-urned</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that it’s been branded as ‘the official game of the Ashes’, you’d think that Cricket 26’s special mode dedicated to the freshly reignited Australia-England rivalry would have been given extra attention from the developers to ensure that it really capitalised on what has been one of the most hyped test series in recent memory. However, there appears to have been about as much thought and effort put into it as England’s approach to batting on day two of the recent first Ashes test. Sure, you do get to play all five test matches in the series in all of the relevant Aussie venues, including a day-night pink ball test at the Gabba, but there really is little else here to distinguish the mode from just building a series yourself using the tour creator that returns from Cricket 24.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are no practice matches to play for the touring side, although given English coach Brendon McCullum’s ‘it will be alright on the night’ philosophy for player preparation, perhaps that’s true to life. Instead, the build up to each of the five matches in the series goes like this: you press a button to travel to the city hosting the match, complete a fairly modest and non-tailorable training minigame that involves bowling precisely three deliveries and a handful of batting strokes, select your final 11 from your squad of 16, mindlessly spam your way through painfully generic answers in a press conference, and then play the match itself. Repeat that four more times and you’re done.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There appears to have been about as much thought and effort put into [the Ashes mode] as England’s approach to batting on day two of the recent first Ashes test.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a team confidence meter to maintain, and optional match objectives to complete as well, but it all feels a bit nebulous. Team confidence fluctuates depending on match results, success or failure in the training minigames, and your responses to press conference questions, but it’s all applied so inconsistently and absolutely none of it seems to have a measurable effect on anything. I failed my first training session and my team confidence took a dive, meaning I went into the opening test at Perth with my Australian team seemingly flagging at 55% confidence. It clearly didn’t make much of a difference, though, since I still ended up smashing England inside three days. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pre-match press conferences are particularly hard to engage with, given that the questions you have to field are often factually incorrect. I kept getting asked about how I felt about securing a draw in a previous match, even though I’d won it, or I’d be asked to reflect on my performance at a certain venue even though I hadn’t played there yet. It feels less like facing a press room full of proper sports journalists and more like being punked by a crowd of teenage TikTok pranksters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Successfully completing optional match objectives also gives team confidence a boost, but these goals seem to veer wildly from the realistic to the ridiculous. In one match I was tasked with scoring 64 combined runs with the tail, which was tricky but ultimately attainable, while in another my objective was to bat at above eight runs an over, which is an insane demand for a test match innings. You could field a team of 11 Harry Brooks and still struggle to score at that rate. You couldn’t field a team of 11 Brendan Doggetts, though, or even a single Brendan Doggett for that matter, given that he’s disappointingly absent from Australia’s Ashes squad in Cricket 26 despite making his international debut last week. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Armchair-man of the Board</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So the Ashes mode is more slapdash than fierce clash, and Cricket 26’s only other new mode of note, the management career, is equally as half-baked. To be honest, I’m typically not one to dabble in the front office side of sports simulations, so perhaps I’m not best equipped to evaluate this series’ first crack at allowing players to run a cricket club. However, after investing several hours into this fairly superficial squad management sim let’s just say I’m unlikely to become a convert any time soon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s just not an enormous amount to it. You don’t get to manage the budget for player salaries, or hire a coaching staff, for example. You basically just pick your team and either play the matches or simulate them, not unlike the existing player career mode minus the training minigames and net sessions in between. It also seems a shame that there’s no option to watch a generated highlights package when you simulate the result like you can in the Football Manager series. Unless you want to be fully hands-on with each match, your only exposure to the team’s performance is via static scorecards and text-based match reports that pop up in your email inbox, which feels pretty dry.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do opt to play the games yourself, there doesn’t appear to be any management options during a match that make it feel any different to the general gameplay featured elsewhere. You can’t, say, run tactical team instructions out to the middle with the 12th man during a drinks break, or send a substitute fielder on because your ageing opening batsman injured his back playing a golf tournament the day before the game. Strangely enough it also doesn’t seem to factor in the unavailability of players with national team duties either. I was able to steer the NSW Blues to the top of the Sheffield Shield, largely because the likes of Australian test team stars Steve Smith, Pat Cummins, and Mitchell Starc were inexplicably available to be picked for every match of the domestic summer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cricket 26’s management career just feels underdone and, in some aspects, partially broken. You can adjust training schedules for each of your players, like assigning them recovery sessions to reduce fatigue or team bonding sessions to boost their individual morale meters. However, I struggled to really get a feel for the impact of these options given that the training section of the management menu often just completely failed to load. I also encountered a bug that would cause Cricket 26 to crash everytime I tried to finalise my line-up. The irony that the design of Cricket 26’s dedicated management mode appears to have been somewhat mismanaged certainly isn’t lost on me. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The irony that the design of Cricket 26’s dedicated management mode appears to have been somewhat mismanaged certainly isn’t lost on me.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Cricket 26 possesses most of the same feature set as Cricket 24, from the largely unaltered player career mode to the microtransaction-riddled card collecting of Pro Team – with the latter featuring a new mode called Centurian. At the time of writing this just has a ‘Coming Soon’ message posted on it, leaving me completely in the dark as to what it might actually entail. The robust suite of customisation tools for everything from players to bats to stadia remain present and useful, while the actual number of licensed teams stays more or less the same. On the upside, all but one of the 10 IPL teams are now officially included, but on the downside you still need to rely on the talents of community creators to import Indian and South African squads into Cricket 26, and New Zealand’s Dream11 Super Smash competition has seemingly been ditched entirely.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Patches Fix Matches</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In every area in which Cricket 26 excels, though, the shine is regularly taken off it as though it’s been polished with a piece of 60 grit sandpaper pinched from David Warner’s kit bag. It feels exhilarating to setup a batsmen by pushing a few straight balls across him before pulling the trigger on a hooping in-swinger than cannons into his pads, but it’s infuriating to slave away in search of a wicket only to watch a thick edge sail into the keeper’s gloves and have it given not out for no clear reason, with no option to challenge the umpire’s decision (at one point, this happened to me three times in the space of one over). It’s satisfying to swivel-pull a short ball into the crowd for six, but absolutely deflating to hook it down to deep backward square and get caught on the boundary, only to watch the fielder very clearly step on the rope, and still be given out anyway. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I like that matches can now be affected by rain and outcomes can be decided by the Duckworth-Lewis method, but so far my only exposure to it came when I was a mere three overs into the first innings of a T20. Without warning, the game was abruptly called off due to rain and my team was declared the winner – even though I was the only one who’d had a chance to bat. This is not to mention the regular crashes I’ve experienced during the 20 hours or so I’ve invested into Cricket 26 on the PlayStation 5 so far, or the many UI glitches – like the scoreboard for The Hundred that seems to be a placeholder hastily cobbled together in MS Paint. Or the many unrealistic AI behaviours, like bowling a bunch of short stuff in the opening over of a test – or indeed opening the bowling with one of its batsmen. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The shine is regularly taken off it as though it’s been polished with a piece of 60 grit sandpaper pinched from David Warner’s kit bag.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, and as has long since become customary with Big Ant’s cricket games, the in-game commentary is about as accurate as often as a broken wristwatch. I welcome the presence of cricket luminaries like David Gower and Adam Gilchrist to bring their insights to the game, but not when it seems like they’ve been blindfolded and spun around in a circle before they entered the commentary box like they’re playing a verbal game of pin the tail on the donkey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In spite of these issues, I find myself far more invested in Cricket 26’s future because the core experience out in the field is such a major step up from the previous game that I’m willing to live with the noticeable rough edges. Assuming that Big Ant can stamp out most of the bugs, this could yet turn out to be one of the best cricket simulations the Aussie developer has ever produced. Yet even though the developer does have a track record of providing plenty of post-release support to its cricket games – and there have already been four patches for the PlayStation 5 version in the first week since launch – it’s hard at this point to be confident that it will rectify all of my complaints. As if to justify my slight pessimism, I fired up Cricket 24 this week to compare it side by side with Cricket 26, only to discover that Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett’s facial textures had disappeared completely. I know the English batting order has a tendency to lose their heads, but this is ridiculous – and then my test match crashed before I could even bowl a ball. To be clear, that’s <em>after </em>more than two years of post-launch patching.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/cricket-26-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've been wondering what's next for the Switch Online's 'Nintendo Classics' service, the November update is now available.</p>
<p>This latest update includes NES and Game Boy titles, with a total of four more games added to the service today. On the NES, there's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ninja_gaiden_ii_the_dark_sword_of_chaos">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/battletoads">Battletoads</a>, and on the Game Boy, retro enthusiasts can look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/kid_icarus_of_myths_and_monsters">Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/bionic_commando">Bionic Commando</a>.</p>
<p>Switch Online's Nintendo Classics service for Japan has received the same four titles in this week's update. Here's the rundown of each game (via Nintendo's Japanese website):</p>
<h3><strong>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"This title is an action game for family computers that was released in 1990. A year after Ryu Hayabusa defeated the Evil Demon King and prevented the resurrection of the evil god in the previous work "Ninja Gaiden". The man who was controlling the Evil Demon King behind the scenes, the Fierce Demon Emperor Ashtar, starts moving on his own. In this game, you can climb up and down after being held on to a wall, or attack by consuming ninjutsu power while holding on to a wall, increasing your freedom of action. In addition, the "Alter Ego Technique" appears, in which up to two alter egos appear that follow Ryu and attack at the same time as Ryu. By successfully guiding the alter ego, Ryu's attack range will be greatly expanded."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Battletoads</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"This title is an action game for family computers that was released in 1991. Rush and Jitz, the strongest and most trained frog warriors in the Battle Toad, will defeat a host of enemy monsters, navigate through traps, and rescue Princess Angelica and her fellow Pimples from their rescue. Fight through all 12 stages with a variety of variations, including side-scrolling, vertical scrolling battle action, and high-speed action on air bikes and space boards, using techniques tailored to each stage."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The title is an action game released in 1991 in North America for the Game Boy (unreleased in Japan). A new mission given to the angel pit by the goddess Palutena is to fight the bosses in the three worlds and obtain the "Three Sacred Weapons". As you defeat enemies that stand in your way and jump to jump, the pit will travel through a vast world. In "Hades" and "Sky", where the tower is set, it moves upwards, and in "Earthly World", it moves horizontally. Inside the stage, there are various rooms, such as a shop where you can buy items and a room where you can train and get weapons."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Bionic Commando</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"This title is an action game for the Game Boy that was released in 1992. The main character, "Rud Spencer", who is equipped with a gun in one hand and a special wire in the other, challenges the Dreise army to a battle. There are several types of guns, such as the Wide Range Rifle that shoots bullets in three directions and the powerful Grenade Launcher. And the elastic wire is essential for capturing the fortress. It exerts great power when moving, such as shrinking the hooked wire to climb to a high place or jumping with momentum like a pendulum. In the communication rooms in each area, you can talk to allies and eavesdrop on enemy conversations to obtain valuable information."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To access these titles, you'll need to have an active base-tier Switch Online subscription. This update for the Nintendo Classics library follows the arrival of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> for the GameCube app in October.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-saros-10r-crashes-600-off-22-000-pa-suction-with-self-emptying-station-hits-all-time-low.1364905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums range from basic bump-and-go models that randomly wander your floors to sophisticated machines that map your home with surgical precision, and Roborock always positioned itself at the premium end with innovations that justify higher price tags. Each new model brings features that push the category forward, but that innovation typically costs serious money, with the flagship Saros 10R normally demanding $1,599 from your wallet.</p>
<p>The great news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">Amazon’s Black Friday deal slashes $600 off that price to bring it down to $999 (38% off)</a> hitting an all-time low that makes this ultra-premium cleaner actually accessible instead of just aspirational. This discount transforms the most advanced robot vacuum on the market into something you can justify buying, and once it starts handling your cleaning routine, you’ll wonder how you ever tolerated doing floors manually.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Engineering That Solves Real Cleaning Problems</h2>
<p>The <strong>ultra-slim 3.14-inch profile lets this robot slip under furniture</strong> that standard vacuums can’t reach, thanks to the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 that eliminates the raised LDS dome making most robot vacuums too tall for low-clearance spaces. You get cleaning coverage under beds, sofas, and cabinets where dust bunnies normally live undisturbed for months because your regular vacuum can’t fit.</p>
<p><strong>3D sensing technology maps your home with precision</strong>, even in tight spaces under narrow-legged furniture, while the VertiBeam system navigates around cables without getting stuck or needing you to pre-clean your floors before the robot can do its job. Improved algorithms recognize and adapt to 108 different obstacle types, so it handles everything from pet toys to chair legs without calling for help every five minutes.</p>



<p>The <strong>22,000 Pa HyperForce suction pulls dirt, pet hair, and debris</strong> from hardwood, tile, and carpets with enough power to handle embedded mess that weaker vacuums just push around. Combined, the <span>Zero-Tangling DuoDivide</span> main brush and anti-tangle omnidirectional wheels mean you never spend ten minutes cutting hair wraps off the roller bar-which, if you have long hair or pets, is basically the worst part of owning robot vacuums. The <strong>FlexiArm side brush and mop automatically extend to reach corners</strong> and edges that circular robots typically miss, sweeping along baseboards and into tight spots where crumbs accumulate.</p>
<p>The AdaptiLift chassis <strong>climbs over obstacles as high as 4 cm</strong> and tackles thresholds and furniture legs that stop lesser robots dead in their tracks and turn your open floor plan into an actual open floor plan rather than a series of isolated zones. The dual-spinning mops automatically lift when carpets get detected to avoid getting your rugs soaked while still making thorough mopping possible on hard floors.</p>



<p>The Multifunctional Dock 4.0 does the dirty work you would avoid by automatically washing mops in 176°F hot water and drying them with 131°F hot air to prevent mildew and smell. <strong>Auto dust collection works for 60 days before needing attention</strong> while auto tank refilling and detergent dispensing mean the robot maintains itself between the occasional check-in you give it.</p>
<p>At $999 instead of the usual $1,599, you’re saving $600 on a machine that brings flagship features reserved for people with unlimited home automation budgets. This Black Friday price opens up the most advanced robot vacuum technology to households wanting exceptional cleaning results without compromise on coverage, power, or convenience.</p>

<p>Four iconic NES and Game Boy games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online’s Classics catalog for November 2025. Two of them, in particular, are some deep-cut, difficult titles.</p>







<p>As a benefit of Nintendo Switch Online, the Classics catalog offers many nostalgic games from Nintendo’s past. There are plenty of titles to choose from, like Donkey Kong and Metroid 2: Return of Samus. While the Expansion Pack adds Nintendo 64 titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online-halloween-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi’s Mansion</a>, there’s still plenty of new additions to the base catalog. Now, there are some iconic games making their way to the Classics lineup that are sure to unlock some fun (and frustrating) memories. </p>



<h2 id="h-battletoads-kid-icarus-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-tomorrow">Battletoads, Kid Icarus Coming to Nintendo Switch Online Tomorrow</h2>

<p>In the video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wZZI8a4uDI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we see four nostalgic games coming to the Nintendo Switch Online Classics Catalog for November 2025. Those games are <strong>Battletoads, Ninja Gaiden 2: The Dark Sword of Chaos, Bionic Commando, </strong>and <strong>Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</strong>. The titles <strong>will be available</strong> starting tomorrow, <strong>November 26th</strong>, for all Nintendo Switch Online players.</p>



<p>If you were an avid Nintendo fan in the 1990s, you know how difficult Ninja Gaiden 2 and Battletoads are. The iconic Turbo Tunnel level in Battletoads has left many with good and bad memories, depending on perspective. For Capcom lovers, Bionic Commando is a welcome sight, as the last time we saw the series was 2009’s controversial reboot. Then, Kid Icarus, who has yet to get another entry since 2012’s Uprising, can now complement the original, which Of Myth and Monsters is a sequel to.</p>







<p>What do you think of the new November 2025 Nintendo Switch Online lineup? Any games you remember from back in the day? Excited to try them out?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-t7-ssd-goes-for-pocket-change-now-2tb-drive-selling-68-off-original-price-2000647374</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-t7-ssd-goes-for-pocket-change-now-2tb-drive-selling-68-off-original-price.1364884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung earned its reputation as the <strong>most reliable brand for SSDs</strong> through years of consistent performance and the T7 has been an iconic model in portable storage since its launch a few years back. Traditional external hard drives (HDD) feel painfully slow once you experience the speed difference that solid-state technology delivers, and even more as <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/">this T7 model just hit a record low at $168 instead of the usual $187 (and $399 at launch!) for Black Friday on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Most color options already sold out completely</strong> which leaves only the gray version in stock so you’ll need to move fast if you want one before inventory disappears entirely. This<strong> drive transfers files at speeds up to 1,050MB/s</strong> which means copying a full 4K movie takes under a minute instead of the 5+ minutes you’d spend waiting with an old spinning hard drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Forget Your Old HDD</h2>
<p>The USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface pushes<strong> read speeds to 1,050MB/s and write speeds close behind</strong>, which gives you transfer rates that actually match modern file sizes and project demands. You can edit 4K video directly from the drive without pre-copying footage to your computer’s internal storage, saving time and preserving precious laptop SSD space for applications and system files. With a <strong>total capacity of 2TB, you’ll have room for approximately 500,000 photos</strong>, 50 hours of 4K video, or your entire game library plus room for new titles.</p>



<p>Measuring <strong>smaller than a credit card and weighing only 58 grams</strong>, the compact design disappears into any bag pocket without adding noticeable bulk or weight to your carry. The metal construction provides shock resistance that protects your data against drops from as high as 2 meters-though you obviously shouldn’t test that limit on purpose, just because the specs say it can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient thermal management</strong> keeps the drive cool during extended file transfers, preventing performance throttling when you’re moving massive amounts of data for longer periods. <strong>Password protection and AES 256-bit hardware encryption</strong> secure your files in case the drive gets lost or stolen, providing peace of mind that your client projects or personal photos will not end up in random hands.</p>



<p>Cross-platform compatibility works <strong>seamlessly across Windows, Mac, Android devices</strong>&nbsp;and gaming consoles without requiring reformatting or special drivers for basic use. The<strong> included USB-C to C and USB-C to A cables</strong> cover connection to virtually any modern device, though you’ll want the C-to-C cable for maximum speed with newer computers. Samsung’s Magician software provides drive health monitoring, firmware updates, and performance optimization tools that help maintain peak performance over the years. <strong>The three-year limited warranty</strong> backs up Samsung’s confidence in the drive’s reliability, covering manufacturing defects and giving you recourse if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>At $168 for 2TB of fast and reliable Samsung storage, you’re getting the brand’s proven track record at one of the lowest prices this model has ever seen which makes it the right moment to upgrade from slower storage solutions. This Black Friday deal delivers great portable storage at a price that finally makes sense for people who need speed and capacity without emptying their wallets.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-65w-3-port-block-charger-2-pack-selling-for-4x-cheaper-than-one-apple-charger-2000647316</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying official chargers from tech companies feels like highway robbery when you see Apple charging $59 for a basic 35W single-port USB-C adapter which makes you wonder if they think everyone has unlimited money to burn on accessories.</p>
<p>The <strong>Baseus 2-pack 65W charger bundle</strong> flips that equation completely by <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/">giving you two three-port chargers for $28 total, dropping from the usual $49 price tag</a> to hit an all-time low for Black Friday on Amazon. Each charger pushes 65W when you plug in a single device which means you can actually fast-charge a MacBook Air at full speed instead of watching the battery percentage crawl upward like a lazy snail. You get <strong>six charging ports total across both units</strong>, and that’s the kind of flexibility that solves the eternal problem of fighting over outlets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W, Two Chargers</h2>
<p>The intelligent charging technology inside these blocks automatically figures out how much power each connected device needs and <strong>splits the 65W accordingly</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not manually calculating wattage or worrying about frying your phone because you plugged it into the wrong port. You can charge your laptop, phone, and earbuds simultaneously from a single charger without everything slowing down to a frustrating trickle, though connecting<strong> three devices does divide that 65W among them</strong> based on what each one can handle. It also operates on a <strong>92% energy conversion rate thanks to the GaN chip technology</strong>&nbsp;which means less wasted electricity and noticeably cooler operation compared to older, silicon-based chargers that get hot enough to cook an egg.</p>



<p>The compact size is <strong>41% smaller than Apple’s original 65W brick</strong> and matters more than you think once you’re trying to fit chargers into already-stuffed laptop bags or tight outlet spaces behind furniture. <strong>Foldable prongs</strong> collapse flush against the body so they won’t snag on clothes or scratch other gear rattling around in your backpack.</p>
<p>You can fast-charge an<strong> iPhone 17 from 0 to 50% in about 30 minutes</strong> or power up a Dell laptop without the need for its original, bulky charger. The <strong>USB-A port handles older devices</strong> that haven’t made the USB-C jump yet and saves you from having to carry separate adapters for wireless headphones, older tablets, or that one weird gadget that just refuses to adopt modern standards.</p>



<p>The <strong>lower operating temperature</strong> keeps these chargers safe to touch even after hours of continuous use, unlike some cheap alternatives that get concerningly hot and make you nervous about leaving them plugged in overnight. Each port delivers consistent power without the voltage fluctuations that can damage batteries over time, protecting your expensive devices while they charge.</p>
<p>At $28 for two 65W three-port chargers, you’re spending less than half what Apple charges for their wimpy 35W single-port adapter, and you’re getting roughly six times the functionality in return. This Black Friday price works out to $14 per charger which is basically impulse-purchase territory for accessories that’ll get daily use for years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Goes Zero-Profit on WH-1000XM5, 2x Cheaper Than AirPods Max and Bose]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-goes-zero-profit-on-wh-1000xm5-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-and-bose-2000647400</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-goes-zero-profit-on-wh-1000xm5-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-and-bose.1364857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony just launched the <em>1000XM6</em> headphones, pushing the XM5 model into second place in the lineup but <strong>the performance gap feels like a minimum</strong> while the price difference stretches over… $200! The new XM6 demands $449 <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5629/">while Amazon just dropped the WH-1000XM5 to $248 from its usual $399</a> (38% off), hitting a record low that makes this generation the obvious choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5629/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>This deal also positions the <strong>XM5 at roughly half the price of Apple’s AirPods Max</strong> which costs about $550 and delivers similar specs without justifying that massive premium. The feature sets across all these flagship models is nearly identical with slight tweaks that don’t justify paying double and makes<strong> this almost 40% Black Friday discount surprisingly aggressive</strong> for headphones that rank among the best available.</p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation That Blocks the World</h2>
<p><strong>Adaptive noise cancelation technology</strong> automatically adjusts to your environment and head position with multiple microphones that sample ambient sound and produce opposing frequencies that cancel unwanted noise. You get great silence on planes, trains, and busy offices where background chatter normally destroys concentration and forces you to crank the volume to dangerous levels.</p>
<p>The Auto NC optimizer analyzes a<strong>tmospheric pressure and adjusts cancellation accordingly</strong>&nbsp;which matters more than you might think when you’re flying at altitude, where changes in air density alter how sound travels. This system works so well that you’ll sometimes take the headphones off to check whether the announcements are playing or whether the cancellation merely served to block them out completely.</p>



<p>With noise canceling activated,<strong> battery life extends to 30 hours</strong> and covers weeks of daily commutes before needing a charge. Quick charging saves you when you forget to charge overnight and rush out the door: three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in. The lightweight design distributes pressure evenly across your head, preventing the fatigue and headaches that plague cheaper headphones after an hour of wear. <strong>Soft ear cushions seal around your ears</strong> without creating that uncomfortable vacuum feeling, maintaining comfort during marathon listening sessions where lesser headphones become unbearable.</p>
<p>Sound quality delivers Sony’s<strong> signature balanced profile, with detailed mids, clear highs, and controlled bass</strong> that doesn’t overwhelm everything else into muddy soup. The 40mm drivers produce accurate audio reproduction across all frequencies, letting you hear instrument separation in complex mixes and subtle details in well-produced tracks.</p>



<p>Alexa voice control responds to commands without touching your phone, though Google Assistant and Siri also work if you prefer different ecosystems. The speak-to-chat feature automatically pauses music when you start talking, then resumes after you finish your conversation and removes the annoyance of manually controlling playback during brief interactions.</p>
<p>Multipoint connectivity lets you <strong>pair with two devices at once</strong> and fluidly switch from your laptop for work calls to your phone for music without needing to constantly disconnect and reconnect. Touch controls reside on the ear cups and manage volume, track skipping, and call management via swipes and taps, though the learning curve takes a few days before gestures become second nature. <strong>A carrying case with the headphones protects them during travel</strong> and folds flat to save bag space, while the headphones themselves fold into a compact shape rather than just having the ear cups swivel flat.</p>
<p>At $248 instead of $399, you’re saving $151 on headphones that match or outperform the competition at significantly higher price points including Apple’s AirPods Max at double this Black Friday price. That value gets even clearer when you put this deal up against the new XM6 at $449; for $201 extra, you’re getting marginal improvements that most won’t notice in real-world use.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple refuses to discount products on its own website even for items that have been around for years like the AirTag which means you need to shop smarter and hit up retailers with actual pricing flexibility like Amazon. These <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Bluetooth trackers just dropped to $64 for a four-pack from the usual $99,</a> which marks an all-time low with the kind of discount you rarely see on Apple products.</p>
<p>AirTags solve the daily frustration of searching for misplaced items by letting you ping their location through your iPhone’s <em>Find My</em> network and turns frantic morning searches into quick 30-second retrievals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision Finding That Actually Works in Real Life</h2>
<p>The <em>Find My</em> network uses <strong>hundreds of millions of Apple devices to detect the location of your AirTag</strong> anonymously and relay that information, creating a crowdsourced tracking system that works even when your tagged item ends up miles away from you. You get precision finding with iPhone models that feature the U1 chip, which uses ultra-wideband technology to guide you directly to your lost item with on-screen arrows and distance measurements.</p>



<p><strong>Setup takes literally one tap</strong> when you hold an AirTag near your iPhone or iPad, with the device automatically recognizing it and walking you through naming and assigning it to an item. The <strong>CR2032 battery lasts over a year</strong> before needing replacement, and swapping it out requires just a quick twist of the AirTag’s back cover rather than sending the whole unit back to Apple or dealing with proprietary charging cables.</p>
<p>There’s also a <strong>built-in speaker for playing sounds</strong> to help find items when they’re nearby but buried in couch cushions or hiding in your coat pocket. Its volume could be louder to find tags in noisy environments.<strong> Water and dust resistance</strong>, thanks to its IP67 rating, means your AirTag survives being caught in rain, dropped in puddles, or living inside your gym bag with sweaty clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy protections</strong> prevent creepy tracking scenarios by alerting you if an unknown AirTag follows you around, addressing concerns of people using these devices to stalk others without consent. The system regularly rotates Bluetooth identifiers so that random people can’t track your movements by detecting the same AirTag signal repeatedly over time. If you find a lost AirTag, you can tap it with any NFC-capable phone to see the owner’s contact information if they’ve marked it as lost, making returns possible even for non-iPhone users.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-pack setup gives you enough AirTags</strong> to cover your most frequently misplaced items, such as keys, wallet, backpack, and luggage, without needing to constantly move a single tracker between items. You can label each AirTag with custom names and emojis in the Find My app, making it easy to tell “work backpack” from “gym bag” at a glance. The system works seamlessly across your Apple devices, so you can trigger an AirTag sound from your iPad when your iPhone is the thing you actually lost.</p>
<p>At $64 for four AirTags, instead of the usual $99, you pay $16 per tracker instead of nearly $25 and that finally brings the cost per unit down to something reasonable rather than feeling like the Apple tax in full effect. This Black Friday discount makes equipping your entire life with tracking capabilities actually affordable, especially compared to buying AirTags individually at a price of $29 each when you need more than one or two.</p>

                <p>Solid-state drives (SSDs) have come a long way over the years, evolving from expensive storage devices into affordable upgrades for PCs and consoles. For <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>, SSDs from various manufacturers are on sale, with a wide range of capacities available. Considering that modern-day video games require more storage space than ever before, a storage capacity is an essential purchase for PC and console players--and grabbing one while they're on sale is a great opportunity to add a terabyte or four to your devices at more affordable price points. To help you find the best deals, we've rounded up a selection of discounted SSDs in the lists below. You'll find models that work on PC and PS5, as well as proprietary storage card expansions for Xbox Series X, and MicroSD cards for Switch, Switch 2, and Steam Deck.

While there are several great options to choose from, note that certain devices require specific microSD models, so we've broken the list below into separate categories depending on if you're looking to upgrade a Switch 2, original Switch, or Steam Deck.</p><h3>MicroSD cards for Switch 2</h3><p>Switch 2 owners looking to improve on the handheld's modest 256GB internal storage capacity will need to pick one of the ultra-fast microSD Express cards listed below. MicroSD Express cards are much faster than other SD card models, but they're also more expensive per GB, so expect to pay more for smaller capacities than with older SD cards. Nevertheless, it's still worth the upgrade. Upcoming Switch 2 games are also quite big, with titles like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Kirby Air Riders, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment ranging from 21 to over 40GB in size. Third-party games are also quite large--and most are only available as digital or Game Key-Card releases, both of which require you to download and install the game to your Switch 2's internal drive, which makes the microSD Express cards all the more useful, despite their higher cost. Here's a look at Switch 2-compatible microSD Express cards that are available now:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3VTCZK8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of the hardest gamers to get gifts for these days are the dedicated TCG players in your life. Do they like this set of cards or think it was a dud? Do they have everything they need from the newest release? These are the questions the wrack many a gift giver’s mind! That’s why I thought it would be useful to check out a whole suite of new product releases from&nbsp;Gamegenic, my fave TCG accessory maker, to see what’s new and worth your consideration.</p>

<h2>Epically Huge Game Boxes</h2>

<p>I first fell in love with Gamegenic with their smaller-sized deck boxes. Expertly crafted, they're perfect for storing a Commander Deck, your favorite rares, and more. But it wasn't until checking out this latest batch of new releases that I've finally seen the light on their larger (heck, downright&nbsp;<em>huge</em>) game boxes.</p>

<h3>Collectors' Lair 2000+</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-collectors-lair.jpeg?itok=ng3e9ULB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-collectors-lair.jpeg?itok=kBoc7vWo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Just look at the size of this massive beast! Able to hold over 2000 cards (hence the 2000+ in the name), the Collectors' Lair is now my go-to for storing multiple decks safely and securely. The picture above shows it next to the Gamegenic Watchtower 100+ Convertible for scale. If you're not familiar with the Watchtower... it's not tiny!</p>

<p>My friend and I are foolish enough to have embarked on the 36 deck challenge, where we challenge ourselves to build 32 different&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;Commander decks (one for each of the different possible color combos, plus mono-colored decks and colorless), and I desperately needed a storage solution.</p>

<p>I'm nowhere near completing the goal, but the Collectors' Lair is exactly what I need to store my growing collection of decks. Just check out the pic below to see how I put it to work!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-collectors-lair-box-top-opened.jpeg?itok=ZIVWGLAh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-collectors-lair-box-top-opened.jpeg?itok=Ej7H7eVr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Whether storing full-on deckboxes in here, or just a loose assembly of cards, everything in this deck box is ready, safely stored, and good to go. But what if I want a (somewhat) more portable option?</p>

<h3>Dungeon Pro Convertible</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-dungeon-pro-convertible-.jpeg?itok=f_fjFeU5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-dungeon-pro-convertible-.jpeg?itok=QAE5znrQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Gamegenic Dungeon Pro Convertible has quickly become my new go-to for all my on-the-go gaming needs. Now, obviously, this isn't the kind of box I bring to a game night where we're only hoping to grind out a few games, but when I know I've got a full day of gaming ahead of me -- this is the box I load up and take with me.</p>

<p>Included with this box, and this is really my favorite part, is a very handy bag - which instantly turns my collection into a mobile backpack full of janky decks!</p>

<p>The "Convertible" aspect of this deck box comes from the inclusion of a removable acrylic divider, which I keep in here to make sure my deck boxes stay orderly. Truly one of my favorite new ways to cart like... I dunno, half my collection around!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-dungeon-pro-convertible-in-backpack.jpeg?itok=KdJeloAX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-dungeon-pro-convertible-in-backpack.jpeg?itok=v6mYnac9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h3>Sidekick Pro 100+ XL Convertible in Teal/Pink</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-sidekick-pro-100-convertible-in-teal-pink.jpeg?itok=ZLuhf6cU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-sidekick-pro-100-convertible-in-teal-pink.jpeg?itok=vk46sJw7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now THIS is a "Giaco-coded" deck box - I love the lean here into these neon, bright, vibrant, and totally 1990s colors. For a retro geek like me, there's nothing better!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving away from the gargantuan releases, this deck box comfortably holds a sleeved up deck of 100 cards. As you can see from the photo above, there are a few fun bells and whistles here, too. First off, there's the acrylic slide for you to put your commander (if you're playing Commander), or another feature card in your deck/collection.</p>

<p>Along with that, and a feature in a lot of their deck boxes, is the little tray at the bottom designed to hold other little treasures. I keep my dice in these to make sure I'm never fumbling through my bag looking for a few d6's.</p>

<h2>Gamegenic Stranger Things Hellfire Club Official Accessories</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-stranger-things-new-releases.jpeg?itok=-QMrj2pW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-stranger-things-new-releases.jpeg?itok=kRtF8JZc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While it's hard to see anything Hellfire Club branded and not shed a tear for our favorite shredder (if you know, you know), it's hard to deny just how rad these new Gamegenic&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things</em>&nbsp;officially licensed accessories look. In an exciting turn for Gamegenic, they're moving further into the Tabletop RPG space with these new releases.</p>

<p>Of all the products in this line -- which includes a playmat, metal dice (not pictured above), a dice tower, dice bag, sleeves, and more -- I think my favorite of the batch are the set of d6's. The 6 on these dice are represented by the Hellfire Club logo, and the dice themselves have a great feel, rounded edges, and I love the creepy swirl of red and blue.</p>

<h2>Gamegenic Official&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>Accessories</h2>

<p>Finally, let's take a look at some recent official collabs with&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, including some of my favorite new releases.</p>

<h3>Spider-Man Shiny Playmats</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-prime-playmat.jpg?itok=nueaDbQb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-prime-playmat.jpg?itok=Do1fxv5F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I think some of my favorite artwork from the recent&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>set comes from this cycle of full-art basic lands, where Spider-Man's webbing traces out the mana symbol. Gamegenic made five of these - one for each color - and they've got a nice, high-quality design and a gorgeous, subtle shine to them.</p>

<h3>Spider-Man Soft Crate 80+</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-soft-crate-spider-man.jpg?itok=8KLFHOWQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-soft-crate-spider-man.jpg?itok=RLSAxl3V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The new Spider-Man set also gave us some incredible artwork of Spider-Man and Spider-Gwen swinging into action, which they've translated nicely into this new Soft Crate 80+ deckbox. The deckbox "officially" holds 80 double-sleeved cards, but if you don't double-sleeve your deck you can - in my opinion - absolutely fit a whole commander deck in here.</p>

<p>That just about wraps up our rundown of some of my favorite new releases from Gamegenic. Whether you're looking for a little gifting inspiration,&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;you're just searching for a new, great storage solution, I really don't think there's much better on the market than Gamegenic.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-lost-its-mind-on-mic-mini-premium-wireless-transmitter-crashes-to-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000647310</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-lost-its-mind-on-mic-mini-premium-wireless-transmitter-crashes-to-all-time-low-on-amazon.1364824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It wasn’t long before <strong>wireless microphones</strong> became essential equipment for content creators tired of dealing with tangled cables and audio that sounds like you’re recording in a bathroom. The <strong>DJI Mic Mini</strong> earned its spot as the go-to choice among top creators for good reason, and the bundle with two transmitters is now entirely out of stock on Amazon, which says it all about how hot this system is.</p>
<p>But the good news, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5939/">another DJI bundle with a single transmitter has fallen to $45 from its usual $89 price tag (49% off)</a>, hitting an all-time low that makes professional audio accessible without the usual sticker shock. This deal probably won’t last that long considering just how fast the dual pack disappeared and getting one now beats waiting for empty stock pages later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5939/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Audio Quality That Separates Amateur From Pro</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini captures <strong>detail-rich audio with noise-canceling technology</strong> that removes background hum, wind noise, and the general chaos of recording in real-world environments instead of soundproof studios. You get <strong>automatic limiting that prevents distortion</strong> when your voice gets loud or excited, saving you from that clipping audio that ruins otherwise perfect takes.</p>
<p>The ultralight design weighs so little you forget you’re wearing it after the first few minutes, and that matters during long recording sessions when heavier mics start to feel like ankle weights around your collar. The <strong>400-meter transmission range</strong> gives you freedom to move without staying tethered to your camera or phone, whether filming a house tour, doing street interviews, or just walking and talking through your latest vlog idea.</p>



<p>It works <strong>seamlessly with an iPhone, Android, or camera</strong> via plug-and-play connectivity that doesn’t take an engineering degree to set up. You clip the transmitter onto your shirt, plug the receiver into your device, and in mere seconds, you are recording clean audio instead of wrestling for twenty minutes trying to get a connection.</p>
<p>This compact receiver easily slides onto your camera’s hot shoe or directly connects to your phone, not adding bulk that makes your entire setup feel awkward and unbalanced. The <strong>battery life will easily last long enough for several shoots</strong> before needing to be recharged: you won’t have to constantly interrupt your creative flow, looking for a place to swap batteries or find power outlets.</p>



<p>Recording quality jumps noticeably compared to the built-in microphones on phones and cameras, and gives your videos that polished sound which actually makes viewers want to stick around rather than click away after ten seconds. The<strong> system automatically syncs audio to your video feed</strong>, and saves you the frustration of manually matching sound files in editing software later. <strong>Wind noise reduction works</strong> impressively well for outdoor recording, though extremely windy days still benefit from the included windscreen that blocks gusts without muffling your voice.</p>
<p>At $45 for this one-transmitter setup, you’re paying half the normal price for audio gear that immediately elevates your content above the tinny, echo-filled sound that screams <em>“amateur hour”</em> to anyone watching. Professional wireless systems from traditional audio brands cost three or four times this price, and they don’t necessarily sound better or work more reliably than the Mic Mini delivers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-22tb-hard-drive-cut-55-off-giant-storage-cheaper-than-tiny-4tb-budget-drives-2000647391</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-22tb-hard-drive-cut-55-off-giant-storage-cheaper-than-tiny-4tb-budget-drives.1364821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>SSDs are fast but their high cost-per-gigabyte makes them impractical for storing large quantities of data. For simple bulk storage where capacity is more important than ultra-fast transfer speeds, traditional HDDs still rule and Seagate just hit record low pricing across its lineup during Black Friday Week.</p>
<p>However <strong>most capacities sold out rapidly,</strong> with only the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/">massive 22TB model still in stock at $229 instead of the usual $249, and way down from its $599 launch price</a> that made early adopters wince. That works out to about <strong>one cent per gigabyte</strong> and it’s the best value cost-per-GB storage you can find right now on Amazon during Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Handles Your Entire Digital Life</h2>
<p>The 22TB capacity gives you breathing room that smaller drives simply can’t match, letting you dump entire external drive collections onto a single unit instead of managing multiple devices with confusing labels. You can <strong>store roughly 4,400 hours of HD video, 5.5 million photos, or 440,000 music files</strong>&nbsp;which covers most people’s entire digital collection with space left over for years of future growth.</p>
<p>USB 3.0 connectivity delivers <strong>transfer speeds around 120-160MB/s depending on file types</strong>&nbsp;which means copying a 100GB folder takes about 10-15 minutes instead of the sub-minute transfers you’d get with an SSD. That speed difference matters less for archival storage where you’re moving files once and accessing them occasionally rather than working directly from the drive daily.</p>



<p><strong>Plug-and-play design works</strong> straight out of the box with Windows and Mac computers, with no software installation or superfluous setup processes to waste your time. You just connect the USB cable, wait for your computer to recognize the drive, and start dragging files over like you would with any storage device. Included <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em> provide a safety net if the drive fails and offers professional data recovery attempts that normally cost hundreds or thousands of dollars separately.</p>
<p>The<strong> drive runs quietly during operation without the loud clicking</strong> and whirring that older external drives produced, though you’ll still hear some mechanical noise since spinning platters can’t match the silent operation of solid-state drives. Seagate’s build quality has improved over the years, with these expansion drives showing solid reliability ratings from users who’ve run them continuously for backup operations. The vertical orientation saves desk space compared to laying drives flat, and the simple black design blends into any workspace without drawing attention.</p>
<p>At $229 for 22TB of storage, you’re paying roughly a penny per gigabyte which is absolutely the floor for cost-effective bulk storage right now in this Black Friday window. The $20 discount from the recent $249 price adds up when you’re buying this much capacity, and compared to the insane $599 launch price, this deal feels like robbery in your favor.</p>

              <p>Black Friday typically means massive LEGO discounts on Amazon with fans waiting to finally pick up those sets they have been eyeing all year at reasonable prices. This year feels a bit like a disappointment as the number of discounted sets fell significantly compared to previous years.</p>
<p>One of the most iconic Star Wars sets managed to make it through with a proper deal, though: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/">the R2-D2 building set dropped to $79 from its usual $99 price tag,</a> and reaches <strong>an all-time low</strong> that makes this the perfect time to grab it. Star Wars is LEGO’s most popular licensed theme and R2-D2 stands as one of the franchise’s most beloved characters, so getting this particular set on sale feels like winning the Black Friday lottery.</p>

<p>The<strong> 1,050-piece construction gives you a satisfying build session</strong> that takes several hours without becoming frustratingly complex, hitting that sweet spot where you’re engaged but not pulling your hair out over confusing instructions. You assemble R2-D2’s iconic dome head with 360-degree rotation capability, letting you position him looking in any direction once he’s on display. The <strong>detachable third leg recreates the droid’s mobility configuration</strong> from the films, adding an authentic detail that fans immediately recognize and appreciate. <strong>Attachable tools and a periscope</strong> give you multiple display options, so you can swap accessories based on your mood or recreate specific scenes from the movies.</p>



<p>The finished model<strong> stands over 9 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches deep</strong>, and makes it substantial enough to command attention on a shelf without dominating an entire room like some of Lego’s massive Ultimate Collector Series sets. Once completed, build quality feels solid, with sturdy connections that let you pick up and reposition the model without pieces falling off every time you touch it. Color accuracy is perfect and matches R2-D2’s blue and white scheme with just the right shades that make the droid instantly recognizable even from across a room.</p>
<p>The included <strong>25th-anniversary Darth Malak minifigure </strong>adds collectible value beyond just the main R2-D2 build by giving you a character from the expanded Star Wars universe that doesn’t appear in many sets. The information plaque and display stand, decorated with the LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary logo, turn this from just a toy into a proper display piece that looks intentional on your desk or bookshelf.</p>



<p>It works equally well for <strong>kids aged 10 and upwards</strong> who want to play out Star Wars scenarios and adult collectors who just want a detailed replica sitting next to their other memorabilia. The articulation points and removable accessories encourage actual play rather than static display, but the model is sturdy enough to survive either use case without falling apart.</p>
<p>At $79 instead of the usual $99, you’re saving $20 on one of the few discounted Star Wars LEGO sets available this Black Friday which makes this deal worth jumping on before stock runs out or the price creeps back up.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Earlier this week Ubisoft announced <em>Teammates</em>, which the company <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-an-ai-experiment-to-change-the-game?ref=aftermath.site"><u>describes</u></a> as its first "playable generative AI research project which explores how AI can be used to deepen the player experience through real-time voice commands and enhanced gameplay".</p><p>Upon reading that, my first reaction was "well that's some bullshit", but quickly following was a second reaction that I remember hearing something similar before. From Ubisoft. Promises of a bold new future, of pioneering new technology that would empower players to own their own stories, but which ultimately led nowhere, because they were so patently and obviously <em>stupid</em>.</p><p>Over the last four years, the company--<a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-france/"><u>which has been in serious financial and legal trouble for a <em>very </em>long time</u></a>--sure has been excited to hitch its cart (and its workers, resources and reputation) to whatever picture of a horse the latest Silicon Valley huckster has forwarded into CEO Yves Guillemot's inbox that week. </p><p>Like how in 2021 the company<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-first-major-pub-to-befoul-own-game-with-nfts-1848176813?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>first announced Ubisoft Quartz</u></a>, "an NFT initiative which allows people to buy artificially scarce digital items using cryptocurrency". <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em>, the first game to make use of that marketplace,<a href="https://x.com/GhostRecon/status/1511373147475484682?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>was cancelled less than a year later</u></a>.</p><p>Or in February 2022, when Ubisoft announced<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-rabbids-blockchain-nft-crypto-scam-the-sandbox-1848504231?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>its first foray into the metaverse</u></a>, with a <em>Rabbids </em>world for the Sandbox platform, designed "to empower players to create their own original experiences incorporating elements of our gaming IP". Earlier this year Sandbox<a href="https://x.com/gregory_raymond/status/1960688743032950923?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>laid off half its staff</u></a>, amid claims the "platform...now attracts only a few hundred daily users, largely bots".</p><p>Then in October 2024 Ubisoft released <em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</em>, a PvP tactical RPG with a "<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-crypto-nft-champions-grimoria-tactical-rpg-1851685289?ref=aftermath.site"><u>crypto-backed marketplace</u></a>". At time of launch the most expensive collectible for the game was "worth" over $60,000. Just a year later the game's shopfront looks like this:</p><figure></figure><p>Now, in November 2025 comes <em>Teammates</em>, a project building<a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ai-npcs/"> <u>on some ghastly stuff they first teased last year</u></a>, and which is so on-the-nose that Ubisoft had to put a disclaimer in its own press release:</p><blockquote>The team is aware of the criticisms around AI in games. The goal is not to replace creatives, but rather to find ways to enhance it by combining the strengths of the technology and the human creativity and ingenuity that are crucial to making games.</blockquote><p>This is a company run by the dumbest people on the planet. I look forward to updating this post in two years' time to make fun of whatever new set of keys someone is jingling in front of Ubisoft's face. If they're still around to fall for it.</p>
