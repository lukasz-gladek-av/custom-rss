<figure data-uuid="cc9747870d3b1"><a title="Split Fiction" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc9747870d3b1/split-fiction.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p>AI is absolutely bloomin' everywhere these days; doubly so if you kept an eye on CES 2026 earlier this month. There's no getting away from it, and folks are particularly keen to see what game developers think of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Josef Fares, founder of Hazelight Studios and director of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, recently caught up with Chrisopher Dring at <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>. The subject of AI naturally cropped up, and while Fares is keen to highlight the technology's advantages in game development, he doesn't see it taking over completely anytime soon, and firmly believes that having someone with a "vision or idea" for a game is vital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have been working with AI for a long time in game development. The problem is the generative AI. If [an AI tool] is helpful to get your vision out there, I don’t see why we shouldn’t look into it. But… it’s the generative AI that people are a bit like…</p>
<p>“It’s really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn’t gone up much. Maybe this is the limit of it.</p>
<p>“You get someone generating a game concept and saying, ‘oh look what might happen in five years?’ But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, you still need someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is. I don’t see AI taking over. I don’t. But it’s really hard to answer. Who knows what happens in the future?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, we think it's worth pointing out that developers do, in fact, have a choice in the matter. Mentioning the idea of AI "taking over" makes it sounds like an inevitability, but we're not quite sure that's entirely accurate. Here's hoping Hazelight doesn't let itself get too dragged into the weeds, anyway.</p>
<p>A recent image for Nintendo's own 'My Mario' collection was scrutinised for potentially using AI, however the company had since come out and clarified that it did not use the technology in producing the images.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196052,195736 @ 1768325403 -->
<p><em>Are we doomed to accept that AI might inevitably become a key part of game development in the future? Or are you hopeful that devs take a stand and refuse to use it extensively? This topic isn't going away, so let us know your thoughts with a comment.</em></p></section>

            <guid>1404868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A report from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html">New York Times</a> on Monday revealed that <strong>Meta</strong> would be <strong>laying off 10% of its Reality Labs</strong> division, the branch of its business under which it works on products like the Metaverse, and also houses its internal VR teams under <strong>Oculus Studios</strong>, including <strong>Deadpool VR</strong> developer <strong>Twisted Pixel Games</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/asgards-wrath-ii-hands-on-impressions-vrs-breakout-untethered-rpg/">Asgard's Wrath 2</a></strong> developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/facebook-acquired-sanzaru-games-asgards-wrath-for-its-oculus-studios/">Sanzaru Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Today, as developers began sharing the news that they had been impacted by the cuts, we learned that at least two whole studios, the aforementioned Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games, <strong>would be shut down</strong>, with the entirety of their teams laid off.</p>



<p>The first signal came from <strong>Andy Gentile</strong>, a designer at Twisted Pixel, who shared on his <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">X (formerly Twitter) account</a> that not only had he been laid off, but the entire studio, along with Sanzaru Games, had been shut down.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unclear how many people have been impacted by the cuts, but more developers have come forward to confirm the news of the two studios shutting down, including a senior level designer at Sanzaru, Ray West, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared on his personal LinkedIn page</a>, "<em>Welp. As many will hear soon, several Meta game studios were closed today, including Sanzaru.</em> <em>It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I'm really glad to have gotten to know everyone there.</em>"</p>



<p>Twisted Pixel is known for titles like Deadpool VR, 'Splosion Man, and Path of the Warrior, while Sanzaru was highly regarded for its Asgard's Wrath titles, the second of which is commonly known as one of the best VR titles to release in recent years. </p>



<p>Sanzaru also has a place in the hearts of many longtime PlayStation fans, as it was also the team that ported the first three Sly Cooper games to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, and even developed the fourth entry in the franchise, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time. Sanzaru was also responsible for ports of the God of War Collection and Secret Agent Clank.</p>



<p>Both studios were founded in 2006, which means that Meta is shuttering them just as they were set to hit their 20th anniversaries. A milestone that not many studios get to hit anymore in today's unstable video game industry. It's altogether an unfortunate start to 2026, and a sign that the mass layoffs that have plagued the industry for the last few years aren't going away anytime soon.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-hytale-mods/</link>
            <guid>1404856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Modding is a huge part of gaming, and instead of concentrating on the default content, Hypixel Studios encourages the community to download and install the best Hytale mods to make the game even more wild.</p>



<p>Some games actively discourage modding and do their best to avoid having the base game assets be manipulated in any way. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> is the complete polar opposite. Hytale wants you to mod, it wants you to create mods; whatever funky ideas are flowing around in your brainwaves need to be used to create fun and original content.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to mess around with Hytale and implement the best mods to make the game easier, better, or even more entertaining, this guide has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-8-top-hytale-mods-to-install">8 Top Hytale Mods To Install</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios and CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hytale has partnered up with <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CurseForge</a> to deliver official mods. The game’s long-awaited launch was accompanied by well over 80 mods to download and install. Insider Gaming has picked out our favorite ones so far, and keep checking back as the list is updated with new mods to add. </p>



<h3 id="h-advanced-item-info">Advanced Item Info</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is comfortably one of the most (if not <em>the </em>most) downloaded Hytale mods—and for obvious reasons. It tells you much more information about the items and materials you pick up. There’s a certain level of ambiguity when it comes to survival games about the resources you collect, leaving it up to you to decide what they’re for, or discover their main purpose(s). This mod eliminates a lot of the mystery and gets straight to the point.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/advanced-item-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Advanced Item Info mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-ymmersive-foliage">Ymmersive Foliage</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hypixel Studios and founder Simon Collins-Laflamme have been hard on themselves at times in the build-up to launch. It’s in early access, and the team has said that it needs a lot of work. It’s probably true, but the game’s early access launch looked spectacular. However, if you want to spruce and juice up the environment with extra color, depth, and detail, the Ymmersive Foliage mode does that in Hytale.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/ymmersive-foliage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Ymmersive Foliage mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-lucky-mining">Lucky Mining</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>A good way to think about this mod is like hacking away at a material in Fortnite. You get rewarded for consecutive good hits, and it’s kind of the same here. If you keep mining the same material in a row—Ores, in this case—you get more of it. It can make the grind easier, and stock up your inventory with enough Ore to start a new country.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/lucky-mining" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Lucky Mining mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-yung-s-hydungeons">YUNG’s HyDungeons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>This mod might not be for beginners, but if you fancy a devious dungeon-based challenge and upgrade, consider checking out the YUNG’s HyDungeons mod. It adds new dungeons with “procedurally generated dungeon instances.” You do need to hit 100 Memories first, but there will come a point where you can enjoy this fabulous mod.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/yungs-hydungeons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the YUNG’s HyDungeons mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-thorium-furnaces">Thorium Furnaces</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes, a good quality-of-life feature can go a long way. It doesn’t have to be a wild mod that breaks the game. The Thorium Furnaces mode adds 11 new furnaces, and they speed up the smelting process, saving a lot of time. The rarer the furnace, the faster it gets the job done, allowing you to go exploring quicker.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/thorium-furnaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Thorium Furnaces mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-wan-s-wonder-weapons">Wan’s Wonder Weapons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you are after a wild mod that is just plain fun, look no further than Wan’s Wonder Weapons. When you think of ‘Wonder Weapons,’ you might think of Call of Duty’s Ray Gun, but here, you get special weapons like the Maelstrom anchor, Frostburn sword, or Chromatic Cleaver—the final one looking like it was pulled straight from a unicorn. If a pickaxe or regular sword just isn’t cutting it, download and get yourself Wan’s Wonder Weapons.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wans-wonder-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Wan’s Wonder Weapons mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-ymmersive-melodies">Ymmersive Melodies</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can “Annoy your friends with custom melodies” using the Ymmersive Melodies mod in Hytale. Does more need to be said? If you’re <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-invite-friends-join-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing with friends in Hytale</a>, why wouldn’t you want to upload custom melodies to make them want to throw Wild Berries or Dark Feathers at you?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/ymmersive-melodies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Ymmersive Melodies mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-wayback-charm">Wayback Charm</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As we come to the home stretch, it makes sense to end with a mod that aptly takes you home. CurseForge says this about the mod: “The Wayback Charm is a magical tool that can help you find your way back home. Simply press the use key (F) while holding the charm, and you will be teleported to the nearest respawn point. Respawn points can be created using blocks like beds. If you do not have a respawn location, or the respawn location is considered invalid, you will be sent to the world spawn.” Sounds good, right?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wayback-charm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Wayback Charm mod here.</a></p>



<p>Have your say on Hytale modding. Have you found any must-have lists that have been left off this list? If so, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let the staff know, as the mod might end up on this list!</p>

            <guid>1404853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Meta is scaling back its gaming presence with a round of layoffs. A report on Monday from the New York Times said that the company was set to let go roughly 10% of staff from the Reality Labs side of the company. </p>



<p>One day later, and it appears <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that those layoffs</a> have begun with a number of studios being hit. </p>







<p>Reality Labs, if you didn’t know, houses Meta’s Oculus Studios division. Oculus Studios is responsible for managing the various first party studios and teams that develop games for the Meta Quest VR headsets.</p>



<p>Two studios known to be impacted by the layoffs are Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games. In a <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Twitter</a>, designer Andy Gentile revealed that he had been let go. In his post, Gentile added that <strong>“It appears the entire Twisted Pixel games studio has been shut down. Sanzaru Games too.”</strong></p>



<p>Over on LinkedIn, Sanzaru senior level designer Ray West <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also confirmed that Sanzaru</a>, along with “several Meta game studios” were shut down.</p>



<p><strong>“It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I’m really glad to have gotten to know everyone there,”</strong> he said.</p>







<p>Prior to the layoffs and studio closures, Twisted Pixel Games recently released Deadpool VR for Meta Quest 3. For Sanzaru, they developed the highly regarded Asgard’s Wrath and Asgard’s Wrath 2.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Meta for comment on how many jobs were lost and all of the studios hit as part of these layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

This edition includes all 26 episodes with English audio, the original Japanese audio with subtitles, hours of bonus features, and two films. The first Evangelion film, Death (True), is essentially a clip show that recaps the series, and The End of Evangelion is a retelling of the final two episodes.</p><p>Anyone who's familiar with the series will want to check out the four Rebuild of Evangelion movies. Released in four parts from 2007 to 2021, the project began as an almost shot-for-shot remake of the early episodes before introducing major changes to the established story, introducing new plotlines and characters. Shout Factory has released all of them to date, both as standard and limited-edition Blu-rays.</p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FJMQ34H9,B0FJMR1VDP,B00GS1EOJS,B0CC4JV5XJ,B0D136B49L,B0CC4GFWDF,B07GQ8VXZ5,B0012V4WSM,B004EC5IV6,B00GS1DM2S,B0BS1P8LFN,1421550792,1421553058,1421553627,1421553635,1421586541,1974707032,1421507676&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neon Genesis Evangelion &amp; Rebuild of Evangelion Anime</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FJMQ34H9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone (Blu-ray)</a> -- $25 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FJMR1VDP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance (Blu-ray)</a> -- $25 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evangelion-2-22-You-Can-Advance/dp/B004EC5IV6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance (DVD)</a> -- $15 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evangelion-3-33-You-Can-Redo/dp/B00GS1EOJS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: 3.33 You Can (Not) Redo (DVD)</a> -- $26.45 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/EVANGELION-1-11-THRICE-UPON-Blu-ray/dp/B0CC4JV5XJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: 3.0+1.11 Thrice Upon a Time (Blu-ray)</a> -- $14 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evangelion-Thrice-Limited-Steelbook-Blu-ray/dp/B0D136B49L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: 3.0+1.11 Thrice Upon a Time Steelbook (Blu-ray)</a> -- $22.85 (<del>$37</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/EVANGELION-1-11-THRICE-UPON-Collectors/dp/B0CC4GFWDF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evangelion: 3.0+1.11 Thrice Upon a Time Collector's Edition (4K Blu-ray)</a> -- $52.26 (<del>$80</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-Complete-Blu-ray/dp/B07GQ8VXZ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neon Genesis Evangelion: Complete Series (Blu-ray)</a> -- $42 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-icons-lord-of-the-rings-balrog-book-nook-building-set-best-deal/1100-6537313/">Lego Lord Of The Rings Book Nook Gets First Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arrow-video-4k-blu-ray-movies-50-percent-off-at-amazon/1100-6537233/">Save 50% On New Limited-Edition 4K Blu-Rays At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-4k-blu-ray-sale-january-2026-3-for-33-new-movie-deal/1100-6537208/">Recently Released 4K Blu-Rays Are 3 For $33 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-magic-the-gathering-set-preorder-restock-guide/1100-6535373/">TMNT Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Preorders Steeply Discounted</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-sonic-the-hedgehog-building-sets-crossworlds-cars/1100-6536549/">Budget-Friendly Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Lego Sets Are Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-harry-potter-sorcerers-stone-25th-anniversary-series-collectors-edition/1100-6537154/">Lego Harry Potter 25th Anniversary Sets Have Arrived, Including A New Collector's Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-bb-8-astromech-droid-75452-new-release-2026/1100-6537153/">New Lego Star Wars BB-8 Droid Building Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Double Nintendo Switch 2 Console Storage For Only $33 With Samsung MicroSD Express Deal</a></li>   </ul> </div>

The mode itself is a stripped down version of the game that drops or modifies some of the series' traditional elements, like the HUD, the map, and hitmarkers, as well as XP and leveling progression. Instead, players will have to adjust to a completely rebalanced arsenal and a reality where shooting a foe in an arm or a leg isn't very effective anymore. But headshots still work, which is good news considering that ammo will be much harder to find in this mode.</p><p>In the announcement video above, the Ubisoft team revealed that the upcoming anniversary season will feature a collaboration with another Tom Clancy creation, but further details about that particular collaboration weren't shared. However, it sounds like outfits and gear from Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six Siege, and Ghost Recon will be added to the game.</p><p>Following the anniversary season, Ubisoft has plans to add even more content to The Division 2. But according to the video, the publisher won't share those details until March.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-definitive-edition-spotted-in-the-wild/1100-6537325/" data-ref-id="1100-6537325">a definitive edition of The Division</a> was spotted in Japan, but it's unclear when or if Ubisoft will announce that project. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">The Division 3</a> remains in development and franchise executive producer Julian Gerighty recently said, "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-boss-hasnt-left-ubisoft-and-more-updates-are-coming-soon/1100-6535549/" data-ref-id="1100-6535549">It’s shaping up to be a monster</a>."</p>

                <p>Those discontent with their current <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> housing neighborhood may soon have another option at their disposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, those participating in WoW's recently added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/" data-ref-id="1100-6536160">player housing feature</a> have two options when it comes to joining a neighborhood. The first is to join a public neighborhood that is open to anyone, while the second is to be a member of a guild and join a neighborhood that only fellow guild members can live in.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhshcr68CJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nhshcr68CJ0?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Soon, however, it looks like there will be a third option to choose from. The ability to create invite-only charter neighborhoods recently appeared for testing on the beta for WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion. The feature doesn't appear to be fully functioning just yet, but there is an option for naming and purchasing a charter neighborhood, implying that the feature is indeed on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">This charter option lets the owner invite whoever they want to the neighborhood, including players from an opposite faction, allowing Horde and Alliance players to live side-by-side. This option also allows for players from different servers or guilds, as is the case with public neighborhoods.</p><p dir="ltr">Exactly how much it might cost to create a charter neighborhood is still unknown, but if it's relatively cheap, it could have some side effects. If players are easily able to create their own private neighborhoods, more public neighborhoods could start to become abandoned. However, players can easily pick up their house and move it to a new, more populated neighborhood with little effort.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether character neighborhoods will go live with WoW's Midnight pre-patch on January 20 or with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">expansion proper on March 2</a> (or sometime later) is still unclear. However, players have already wasted little time coming up with all kinds of awe-inspiring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-world-of-warcraft-player-housing-creations-so-far/2900-7370/" data-ref-id="2900-7370">player housing creations</a>, so giving one person or a small group the keys to an entire neighborhood could create some even more impressive results.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what is definitely coming in the Midnight pre-patch, the update will introduce class talent tree changes, a new Demon Hunter specialization, major user interface updates, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pricey-wow-transmog-changes-have-players-angry-and-confused/1100-6536391/" data-ref-id="1100-6536391">overhaul of WoW's transmog system</a>, and a controversial new policy towards <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-killing-part-of-the-game-before-its-ready/1100-6535418/" data-ref-id="1100-6535418">player-made add-ons</a> that will see many related to combat no longer function.</p>

            <p>Styx: Blades of Greed is probably one of my most anticipated games this year, so I am pleased to let you know that there is now a demo available to try out.</p>
<p>This demo will give you the chance to play the first hour of Styx: Blades of Greed, which (I am 99 percent sure) will plop you down at The Wall. This is one of the areas I got to explore during a preview session with developer Cyanide last year.</p>

<p>While this Styx: Blades of Greed demo is only available to try out on Steam, the game itself will be launching across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, as well as PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. As for when, that would be 19th February, so in a little over a month's time.</p>
<p>Cyanide has said that demo save data will be transferable to the full version on Blades of Greed's release. If this all sounds good to you, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">check out the demo via Steam</a> now. </p>
<p>As well as this nugget of demo news, the studio has also released a new trailer for Styx: Blades of Greed, which hands narrative duties over to Styx himself. Here, the caustic goblin explains his love of Quartz (a powerful and precious substance), as well as showing off some of his new gear such as the glider.</p>
<p>You can check it out below.</p>

<p>Blades of Greed all kicks off after the events of Styx: Shards of Darkness, though the developer has said you won't need to have played any of the previous entries to still enjoy the upcoming release.</p>
<p>Like I said already, I got to go hands-on with Styx: Blades of Greed last year, and while I wasn't very good at it (in fact, I was terrible), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/styx-blades-of-greed-managed-to-impress-with-its-stealth-gameplay-despite-my-attempts-to-do-the-opposite">I had an absolute blast playing as the titular goblin and causing all sorts of chaos</a> for those that got in my way.</p>

<p>Down 33% in 5 months</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7ecc99f80aabf"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7ecc99f80aabf/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's share price has been on a downward turn over the last several months, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;sq">currently sitting at 9,950 yen</a> following an all-time high of 14,795 yen in August 2025.</p>
<p>Fluctuations are inevitable in this business, but according to <a href="https://kantangames.com/">Kantan Games</a>' CEO Dr. Serkan Toto, Nintendo's investors are "spooked" by the prospect of price rises along with the lack of any major first-party titles in 2026 (so far!).</p>
<p>In a post on X (via <a href="https://xcancel.com/serkantoto/status/2011080382108913781#m">XCancel</a>), Toto states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo stock in Japan is sliding: All-time high of 14,795 yen in August 2025, and closed at 9,950 yen today.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"So -33% in 5 months: Investors are spooked by possible price hikes, lack of 1st-party hits and US/EU hardware discounts during the holidays."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, we're not sure what the heck is going on with that last point. Was anyone really expecting to see a console discount within the first year of sale? Christmas or not, that just seems bonkers to us.</p>
<p>Either way, it's a noteworthy downturn, but we're not worried at the moment. The Switch 2, despite some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-sales-reportedly-struggled-over-the-christmas-period">apparent struggles over the Christmas period</a>, is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">still the fastest-selling console of all time</a>. Furthermore, we're confident Nintendo will have some more big games up its sleeve for the latter half of 2026. <strong>Pokémon Gen 10</strong>, anyone?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Is This a Joke?” Asks Battlefield 6 Players as Season 2 Confirmed to be Delayed to February 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/</link>
            <guid>1404805</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was one of the biggest commercial successes in 2025, not just for <strong>EA</strong>, but across the video game industry overall. It was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">best-selling games on Steam by revenue in 2025</a>, and as of November 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">it was the best-selling game in the US overall</a>. But while EA has been enjoying its commercial success, the players around the game have begun to feel the lack of new content, with concurrent player numbers (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">at least on Steam</a>) practically falling off the map compared to where they were when the game launched.</p>



<p>That's why, when EA announced in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update">today's January Update blog</a> that the next major batch of content, <strong>Season 2</strong>, wouldn't arrive until <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>, one of the first comments, which sums up community sentiment quite well, was, "<em>Is this a joke?</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Season 2 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylKfsTB3uKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">October 10, 2025</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Season 1 and its highly anticipated REDSEC battle royale mode launching on October 28, 2025</a>. Since October 28, there have been content updates for the game as part of Season 1, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-now-live/">with the introduction of new maps and limited-time modes</a>, but the launch of Season 2 arriving in February means that players will have gone almost four months without any major new content.</p>



<p>To a certain vintage of player, it may seem ludicrous for this to be an issue the community is complaining about, but that's simply the world we live in when it comes to modern-day live-service titles. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">Marvel Rivals</a></strong>, for example, doesn't let its community go a single month without new content, with a new season every two months and new characters and maps introduced at the halfway point. </p>



<p>Like it or not, that is the pace of modern live-service games, and while Battlefield 6 and Marvel Rivals offer different experiences to players, if EA hopes to keep up with free-to-play games like Marvel Rivals, it can't keep players waiting months for new maps.</p>



<p>In fairness to EA and Battlefield Studios (DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect), the team is aware that this is a longer wait than players would have expected, and claims the decision was made "<em>in order to keep our promise</em>" to the community to deliver the best possible experience. </p>



<p>"<em>During our ongoing development, we've continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2</em>," the team writes. </p>



<p>"<em>Season 1 will be extended past its in-game end date of January 20, and we will launch Season 2 on February 17. The Season 1 extension update to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will be released on January 20, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season 1 Battle Pass until the start date of Season 2</em>."</p>



<p>As part of Season 1 getting extended, EA is adding new cosmetics, free rewards, and XP bonuses for players, including a Frostfire Bonus Path that players will be able to complete alongside the Season 1 battle pass rather than having to choose between them, which is how players currently work through the several battle pass paths. There will also be a Valentine's Day update arriving later, with double XP weekends, login rewards, and more. </p>



<p>It's a nice attempt from EA to try and hold players over until Season 2 is ready, but it's doubtful community sentiment will change until we start to see what Season 2 will bring. Hopefully, it's enough to bring the players who have dropped Battlefield 6 due to a lack of content back to the game. Otherwise, EA and Battlefield Studios may be in for a rough 2026.</p>

              <p>Developers at two of Meta’s virtual reality game development studios are posting online that massive layoffs have happened and that the studios might be shutting down completely.</p> <p>On January 13, multiple developers from Twisted Pixel and Sanzaru Games posted online that they had been laid off from the studios. Many of the affected staff have suggested that both studios, and others owned by the company formerly known as Facebook, might be completely shutting down. Meta has not confirmed this. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to the company for more information about the future of the VR studios and the publicly confirmed layoffs.</p> <p>“Welp. As many will hear soon, several Meta game studios were closed today, including Sanzaru. It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I’m really glad to have gotten to know everyone there,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs/">posted senior-level designer Ray West on LinkedIn on Tuesday.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p><span>“I’ve just been laid off. It appears the entire Twisted Pixel </span>games studio has been shut down.<span> Sanzaru Games, </span>too,” <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">posted another developer on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, I was part of the layoffs today at Meta, and will be seeking a new role,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kathrynyu.com">said Twisted Pixel VR gameplay designer Kathryn Yu on Bluesky</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-reality-labs-vr-horizon-worlds-teams-2026-1">This follows reporting on Monday</a> that Meta was looking to pivot away from VR and the metaverse to AI and augmented reality tech after that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/29/meta-earnings-report">part of the company lost $4 billion.</a> Meta is reportedly looking to cut 10 to 15 percent of Reality Labs, its VR sector, which includes 15,000 employees as well as numerous game studios like Sanzaru. These teams were developing exclusive Meta Quest games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514">like last year’s <em>Deadpool VR</em></a>, which was developed by Twisted Pixel.</p>

 <p>Sanzaru was acquired by Meta in 2020 following the release of<em> Asgard’s Wrath</em>, a popular and critically acclaimed RPG, in 2019. It developed a sequel that launched as a free pack-in game with the launch of the Quest 3 in December 2023. Twisted Pixel previously worked on games like <em>Splosion Man</em> and <em>Lococycle</em> before being bought by Meta in 2021 to work on VR titles.</p>

The bright side is Blizzard is taking the opportunity to rework the affix to make it less punishing, with the new and improved version of the affix set to return in a later update.</p><p dir="ltr">For the unfamiliar, Executioner is an affix enemies can have that causes swords to fall from the sky at a player's location. At endgame, many of these swords can fall all at once if players are killing large groups of foes quickly, with the hail of swords capable of obliterating a player nearly instantly.</p><p dir="ltr">In a forum <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/temporary-disabling-of-executioners-affix/240196" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, Marcoose outlined what changes Blizzard intends in order to make Executioner feel a little more forgiving. Those changes will include a one-second spawn cooldown, with only one sword spawning instead of multiple when killing groups of enemies with Executioner all at once. Blizzard will also remove the tracking period of the swords themselves, which will instead fall as soon as they reach the player. That should make them easier to predict.</p><p dir="ltr">For a full look at what all changed in Diablo 4's leaderboard update, make sure to check out the full <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24244466/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> didn't cause a commotion when it launched last year, but it quietly became a compelling alternative to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>'s offerings, which many felt were on the simpler (albeit extremely polished) side. Now, a little over a month since the native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version arrived digitally, we've got confirmation the physical release is coming in March.</p>
<p>Sega (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-physical-switch-2-release-wont-be-a-game-key-card-sega-confirms/">VGC</a>) dropped the long-awaited news on January 13, confirming the date you need to mark on the calendar is March 26. The suggested retail price is $69.99 / £64.99, same as the digital version of CrossWorlds. Perhaps more convincing is the fact the complete base game will be on a regular cartridge versus a game-key card. Mind you, patches and content updates still need to be downloaded, but we know many of you will celebrate.</p>
<p>Though some developers have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">gone on to explain</a> game-key cards enable them to do true physical releases (better than codes in boxes for sure) while avoiding the "data streaming" limitations of the Switch carts, which are slower than Switch 2's internal SSD and microSD cards, there's been a vocal crusade against third-party releases that aren't 100% physical.</p>
<p>This has reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-dev-says-nintendo-has-cheaper-cartridges-coming-as-alternative-to-game-key-cards-then-backtracks-but-either-way-its-title-will-now-be-a-proper-physical-release">pushed Nintendo to look into alternatives</a>, but for now, you can lend and sell game-key cards without issue, as they're rather similar to PlayStation and Xbox discs that only come with part of the games on them. It's more of a distant future-proofing issue.</p><p>In any case, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds' sales should see another boost with this physical release, as many fans of the off-beat racing series were waiting for a Switch 2 release they could add to their physical collection. (It's me, I'm fans.)</p>
<p>Since its September 2025 release, the game has welcomed free crossover characters like Hatsune Miku (really), Joker from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-30th-anniversary-boxing-fitness-more-announcements">Persona</a>, Ichiban Kasuga from Like a Dragon, and even NiGHTS from the underrated series of the same name. Paid content has included Pac-Man, Minecraft content, and even SpongeBob SquarePants. Up next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-mans-finally-making-a-comeback-but-his-first-big-game-in-years-is-still-a-while-away">Mega Man</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and Avatar (the Nickelodeon one) will be making a splash too.</p>

<p>The demo will give you a small taste of what the co-op horror title will have to offer, with Tarsier Studios previously stating that solo players will have no problem experiencing the game if you can't find anyone to join you.</p>
<p>Reanimal is somewhat of a spiritual successor to <strong>Little Nightmares</strong>, which Tarsier Studios worked on before development passed over to Supermassive Games for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">third entry</a>. It looks to be an altogether more disturbing experience as the story follows two siblings to work to escape a hellish environment full of grotesque creatures.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rnjkht&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

              <p><span>Staff redundancies are anticipated at Ubisoft Stockholm and Massive Entertainment, Ubisoft has announced. 55 employees are expected to lose their jobs, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted"><span>according to a statement sent to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Massive, acquired back in 2008, is the studio behind </span><i><span>The Division 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement, Ubisoft explained, “This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements, and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect in line with local regulations,” Ubisoft said.</span></p> <h2>Ubisoft’s slow, painful transformation</h2> <p><span>The news comes months after the French publisher began a new cost-cutting restructuring plan. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-massive-layoffs-division-3-star-wars-outlaws-2000638264"><span>Back in October 2025</span></a><span>, it asked developers at Massive to lay themselves off voluntarily.</span></p>

 <p><span>The publisher’s redundancy scheme came after a new deal with Tencent, in which the conglomerate invested over $1 billion in a smaller subsidiary, Vantage Studios. The new studio will focus on the </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Rainbow Six Siege</span></i><span> franchises.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> notes that despite the new layoffs, updates for </span><i><span>Tom Clancy’s The Division 2</span></i><span> will continue, as will development for </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span> and the survival extraction mode </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>News of job cuts at Ubisoft is not new. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752"><span>Last week, Ubisoft closed its Halifax office after it unionized.</span></a><span> The shuttering of the mobile game developer resulted in the loss of 71 jobs.

            <title><![CDATA[CS2 Transfer Market ‘Out of Control’, apEX Declares]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-transfer-market-out-of-control/</link>
            <guid>1404724</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Vitality’s award-winning IGL, Dan ‘apEX’ Madesclaire, has voiced <strong>strong concerns </strong>about the state of the Counter-Strike 2 transfer market. He has argued that the current pricing climate has made roster changes (especially meaningful ones) almost <strong>impossible </strong>for most organizations in the space.</p>



<p>In the wake of the HLTV Award Show, during which apEX secured an award for IGL of the Year, he suggested that even the biggest organizations in Counter-Strike are being priced out of making key moves.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-the-counter-strike-market">What’s Wrong with the Counter-Strike Market?</h2>



<p>According to apEX, the financial expectations around player buyouts have reached a critical point. Even well-funded organizations can’t engage, and teams that want to ‘shake things up’ simply can’t. They’re backing off because quotes are ‘completely unrealistic’.</p>



<p>He also stated that the Counter-Strike esports ecosystem doesn’t generate enough revenue to justify skyrocketing buyout demands that have surged in the last year.</p>



<p>Here’s the full quote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So many teams wanted to make a change, I guess, but they couldn’t. The transfer market is crazy. The prices are “What the f**k is going on?” In CS, we don’t make enough money to make changes, all those prizes are crazy. That’s why we hear nothing from NAVI, no MOUZ as well, who wanted to shuffle, I’m pretty sure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/75019-apex-cs2-transfer-market-is-crazy-the-prices-are-on-what-the-f-k-is-going-on-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escore</a> for the quote</em>)</p>



<p>ApEX explained that the quiet offseason and the lack of transfers can be attributed specifically to this issue.</p>



<p>The looming shadow over the market remains Team Falcons, the Saudi-backed organization that has the largest coffers in the esports world. In the last few years, the company has soared in the competitive gaming space, buying out killer squads in multiple games.</p>



<p>But even Team Falcons neglected to make any changes during the winter freeze. If Team Falcons is hesitating, then the pricing issue must be <strong>extreme</strong>.</p>



<p>ApEX’s comments reflect the growing concern amongst players that the CS2 transfer market is overheating. If buyout quotes continue to rise faster than team revenues do on a comparative scale, the top organizations willbe forced to delay or abandon roster plans and rebuilds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA has announced that it is delaying the start of Battlefield 6 Season 2.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s official subreddit, EA revealed that Season 2 for both Battlefield 6 and Battlefield REDSEC will now start on February 17. Originally, the next season was expected to begin on January 21.</p>







<p><strong>“During our ongoing development, we’ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2,” </strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1qbv6tf/battlefield_6_and_redsec_season_1_january_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA said</a> in their statement.</p>



<p>They continued: <strong>“Season 1 will be extended past its in-game end date of January 20, and we will launch Season 2 on February 17. The Season 1 extension update to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will be released on January 20, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season 1 Battle Pass until the start date of Season 2.</strong>“</p>







<p>With this delay, EA is giving players a new “Frostfire Bonus Path” starting on January 27. This new path includes new customization rewards along with XP boosts. Free rewards from the path include Hardware XP Boost, a Vehicle Skin and player card customization items. Those with the Battle Pass can get a new weapon package and career XP boost. </p>



<p><strong>“Unlike previous Bonus Paths, all Bonus Path Points for the Frostfire Bonus Path are earned through Weekly Challenges; there are no Bonus Challenges associated with this Bonus Path.,”</strong> EA says.</p>

<p><strong>Playoffs – Round One</strong></p>



<p>The first round of the playoffs will be a behind-closed-doors event, held between <strong>February 8 </strong>and <strong>February 10</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Playoffs – Round Two</strong></p>



<p>The second round of the playoffs will run from <strong>February 13 </strong>to <strong>February 15 </strong>and will be played in front of a live audience in the Adidas Arena.</p>



<p>The playoffs will feature a double-elimination bracket with best-of-three match formats (except for the grand final, which is best-of-five).</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6's much-anticipated Season 2 update won't launch on time. Battlefield Studios has confirmed that the update will now arrive on February 17, which is later than expected.</p><p>"This extended launch has been implemented to allow extra time to further develop and refine Season 2 as a result of community feedback," the developer said (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2011105964896711059" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Charlie Intel</a>). The update was previously expected to arrive sometime in late January.</p><p>Battlefield 6 had a strong start in October 2025 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">even outsold Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 in the US through November</a>. However, sentiment has somewhat shifted of late, with recent reviews on Steam shifting from "Mostly Positive" to "Mixed." Additionally, people have called out EA for pushing microtransactions and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-ai-generated-art-just-like-call-of-duty-fans-believe/1100-6537131/" data-ref-id="1100-6537131">the game's apparent use of generative AI. </a></p><p>It remains to be seen what changes Battlefield Studios may make to the Season 2 content roadmap based on the community feedback mentioned in the statement. In fact, we don't yet have a rundown of what's in Season 2, but it's expected to bring more maps, guns, modes, and more.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

                <p>Developer Sandfall's RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of 2025's breakout hits, and with a budget of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-was-under-10-million-report/1100-6536874/" data-ref-id="1100-6536874">reportedly less than $10 million</a>, a relatively small development staff, and a price point below $70, some have said the game could be representative of a "AA"-style project that can break through. It may have worked for Expedition 33, and it could work for other titles, but Hazelight boss Josef Fares wants to see the AAA space continue and hopes that decision-makers in gaming don't go all-in on smaller-scale games with lower budgets.</p><p>"You do hear, after the success of things like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that the AA games are taking over. But I would not be able to live without a AAA title," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "I really want to play the blockbuster games. You can't do GTA for $10 million. We need both."</p><p>Fares went on to say that "it's important not to get stuck in ideas." People should not allow themselves to be convinced that "AA is a new thing" or "indie is a new thing," he said.</p><p>"We need the diversity. I hope that publishers don't just look at a game like Expedition, which has been super successful, and think, 'Oh, AA is a new thing. Let's only do that.' I don't believe in that," he said.</p><p>Fares also reminded people that while Expedition 33 was a success, many other "AA" games were not. "You had a huge amount of AA games that came [in 2025], which nobody cared about. Let's remember that," he said.</p><p>The interviewer suggested to Fares that with higher budgets comes more risk-averse decision-making, as the money people want to have a return on investment and may opt for safer bets. Fares doesn't believe this is always the case, saying Naughty Dog is known for "pushing the envelope" with massive budgets, as are companies like Rockstar and Nintendo.</p><p>"So you can do a big AAA title but also take innovative risks," he said. "But once you go over a $100 million budget, you're going to be like, 'Okay, sh**. There's a lot of money on the table.' People are more scared. It's understandable. But it's proven that you can do it."</p><p>The budgets for Hazelight's games have grown over the years. Split Fiction had <a href="https://youtu.be/QQvUgUlknis" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">almost double the budget</a> of It Takes Two, for example. Still, Hazelight's games are understood to fall within the AA category.</p><p>The creative director of Assassin's Creed Unity and Revelations, Alexadre Amancio, recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-games-future-lies-in-smaller-teams-says-ac-unity-director/1100-6537267/" data-ref-id="1100-6537267">AAA game development is broken</a> and problems cannot be solved by "throwing people at it." Instead, he said the future of AAA games might be in smaller teams.</p><p>Hazelight is working on a new game now, but it hasn't been announced as of yet. All of Hazelight's games so far have been co-op titles (Brothers was a single-player game with a unique co-op element). Fares said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fictions-josef-fares-has-already-started-next-game-clarifies-relationship-with-ea/1100-6530172/" data-ref-id="1100-6530172">co-op will always be part of Hazelight's DNA</a>, but he didn't rule out the possibility of the studio changing things up. "You never know what happens in the future. It's not impossible we look into single-player as well. But it would be done in a Hazelight way, with a Hazelight twist. It's not going to be your typical single-player game," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, Ubisoft made headlines when it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-shuts-down-recently-unionized-halifax-studio">shut down its Halifax studio</a>, which not only put 71 developers out of a job, but those developers had just <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-halifax-staff-officially-form-union">unionized two days prior</a>. Today, Ubisoft is continuing this trend by proposing to lay off even more people, this time at its subsidiaries Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted">According to a statement provided to <em>IGN</em></a>, the restructuring would impact "approximately" 55 workers at the two Swedish studios, but the timeline of this restructuring is unclear. Ubisoft also claims that "the long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged," and doesn't suggest that any ongoing projects, such as the development of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/21/ubisoft-announces-tom-clancys-the-division-3-appoints-new-series-producer">The Division 3</a>, will be impacted.</p><p>You can read the full statement provided to <em>IGN </em>below.</p><p>Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructure that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm," Ubisoft said in a statement passed to IGN today.&nbsp;</p><p>This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.</p><p>These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams.</p><p>The long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged, and we will continue to serve as the global home and lead for to The Division franchise, move forward with an unannounced innovative tech project with a refined team setup, and play a central role in the development of Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect.</p><p>The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect inline with local regulations.</p><p>As noted in the statement, this news follows a <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732?s=20">voluntary leave program at Massive that began last October</a>, allowing employees that might potentially be laid off to do so on their own terms. The announcement of further layoffs suggests Ubisoft wasn't satisfied with the number of people, if any, who took the offer.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4hSHqpDZ3g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4hSHqpDZ3g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Known for developing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in 2023 and Star Wars: Outlaws in 2024, Massive has been one of Ubisoft's most prolific subsidiaries in recent years. All of this is on top of Massive's work developing and maintaining The Division 2, which had an expansion as recently as last year. Massive is currently in the midst of developing The Division 2: Survivors (an added survival extraction mode), The Division Resurgence (a mobile entry in the series), and The Division 3.</p><p>Last year, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-redlynx-says-up-to-60-positions-could-be-cut-in-restructuring-proposal">a similar layoff proposal at its subsidiary RedLynx</a>, known for the Trials series. Last March, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-creates-new-subsidiary-for-its-biggest-franchises-with-tencent-as-minority-owner">it founded a new subsidiary in partnership with Tencent</a>, who owns a minority stake in the new company, to manage Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p><p>[<em>Source:</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted"><em>IGN</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/ubisoft-proposes-to-lay-off-55-employees-at-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-developer]]></content:encoded>
