<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial report</a> (which covers the fiscal year's third quarter), Sony reveals that it sold 9.5 million PS5 units during the quarter, bringing the console's total lifetime sales over the 75 million mark.</p>

<p>The quarter stands as the PS5's best yet, beating the same period in 2023 by 1.3 million sales despite the fact that the third quarter of 2023 offered up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">a major hit in the form of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>This means two things. First off, we don't know how well the PS5 Pro has done in isolation; we only know that it's contributed in some way to the 9.5 million number. Second, We don't know what proportion of that 9.5 million consoles represents PS5 Pro sales.</p>

<p>While it's more than likely Sony's hardware business got a boost from the PS5 Pro, the console does boast what is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">arguably a rather prohibitive price point</a> for a general gaming audience, so whether it's sold the kind of numbers that would significantly boost the console's totals is hard to say.</p>

<p>Still, it'll likely provide a confidence boost for Sony, especially after a year that offered up what is probably one of the company's biggest gaming embarrassments in history in the form of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">launch and swift cancellation</a> of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/days-gone-remastered-sony-ps5.jpg?itok=h6gWhUsA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/days-gone-remastered-sony-ps5.jpg?itok=lv2i9F0E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony held a State of Play showcase yesterday, during which we learned what's coming to PS5 soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The company sold 95.9 million software units during the quarter, of which 11.6 million were first-party games, although it doesn't provide a breakdown of which games contributed the most to that total.</p>

<p>Sony also reports an increase in PlayStation Plus users, which will likely come as a relief since subscriber numbers remained static throughout the first two quarters of the year.</p>

<p>As for the future, Sony held a State of Play showcase yesterday during which it showed off upcoming PS5 games like&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Days Gone Remastered</em>.

<p>Funko Fusion developer 10:10 Games has recently undergone restructuring within the studio which includes some layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that 10:10 Games made changes with the last week as part of projects within the company wrapping up. We were told that the restructuring was being done to better meet the needs of current projects within the studio. What those projects are, however, remains unknown.</p>



<p>As far as the number of people let go, sources have indicated that it’s around 20 employees. 10:10 Games has yet to give clarification on the exact number of people who were laid off despite multiple requests.</p>



<p>Sources say that the company is assisting with those let go, but couldn’t verify whether that includes any sort of severance as of publishing.</p>



<p>Founded in 2021 by industry veterans Arthur Parsons and Traveller’s Tales founder Jon Burton, 10:10 Games is based in Warrington, United Kingdom. The studio released Funko Fusion, its first game, in September 2024. According to the latest public records and information from the studio’s website, 10:10 Games employed around 100 people before the layoffs. </p>



<p>Through the first seven weeks of 2025, the games industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 1,000 known jobs lost</a> across 27 companies.  Multiple companies have yet to make headcounts public, meaning t hat it’s likely the number is well over 1,000 at this point. In 2024, the industry saw over 16,000 estimated losses.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-review.1108494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">On the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grounded-review"><u>an insect-filled survival game</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pentiment-review"><u>a 2D detective story straight out of the 16th century</u></a> that were pleasantly surprising departures from what developer Obsidian does best, Avowed is a return to that traditional action RPG comfort food we know and love. Set in the fantasy universe of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/27/pillars-of-eternity-review">Pillars of Eternity</a>, this is a game that’s filled with all my favorite RPG cliches, like standing around a campfire with my party members to exchange dark backstories and unresolved traumas, and looting every single slain enemy before their corpse has even begun to cool. Per Obsidian’s pedigree, the writing, world-building, and open-world maps are all quite good, and running around lobbing deadly spells at reanimated skeletons and violent lizard folk to claim shiny new gear is as entertaining as you might expect, if not exactly breaking new ground. That’s a bit of a trend, actually: Avowed draws so much from the Skyrims and Dragon Ages of the past that it ends up an overall unsurprising adventure that has few distinctive ideas to call its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As both a chosen Godlike imbued with magical powers and the Envoy of the Emperor your character is granted a downright irresponsible amount of authority to do whatever you please, and you’re dispatched to the wild continent of the Living Lands to put an end to a mysterious plague of madness called the Dreamscourge while also finding the time to aid any person on the street who asks you for help with whatever personal problem they might have. You’ll spend your days delving into ruined yet beautiful caves, sewers, and forgotten places in search of loot and XP, while taking every opportunity to whale on beasts and ne’er-do-wells with swords, bows, and spells. Yes, this is basically the premise of every western RPG from the past several decades, but that’s because it’s a formula that works reliably. Avowed executes almost every aspect of it quite well.</p><div id="how-do-you-rank-obsidians-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">How do you rank Obsidian's games?</h3><h3>How do you rank Obsidian's games?</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is especially true of the dialogue and story, which is without question the thing Avowed does best. Unraveling the mystery of the fungal Dreamscourge and the otherworldly forces at play is a journey well worth seeing to its conclusion, especially since your decisions can have a profound impact on how things end up – the ending I got hinted at loads of things that could have gone much differently and my fingerprints were all over the ultimate fate of the Living Lands, which could make it worth another playthrough to see how things might have gone differently. And although you usually don’t make major world-changing decisions until you’re just about to move on to the next zone, there are a few times where the consequences of my choices were immediately and keenly felt, like the time I decided to cast a spell so powerful it <span tabindex="-1" role="button">Tap to Reveal</span>, and everyone hated me thereafter. Granted, most of the twists and turns that Avowed’s plot sets up become pretty apparent well before your character and their companions become aware of them, which is a bit disappointing given the Pillars of Eternity series’ track record for wild revelations that took me by surprise. Even so, the story kept the adventure running full steam the whole time, especially with interesting choices to make to keep you company along the way.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bringing the catlike and relentlessly horny mage Yatzli along will guarantee some choice innuendos.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bantering alongside your four companions, each of whom brings their own opinions, personal problems for you to untangle, and cool combat and puzzle-solving abilities to rely upon while exploring the Living Lands is especially delightful. Just like in sister Obsidian RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review">The Outer Worlds</a>, you can bring two of these rapscallions with you at a time, which allows you to experiment with different pairings for mechanical purposes or just to hear them trash talk your decisions. Hanging out with Kai, the sarcastic reptilian mercenary with a fondness for woodworking is rarely dull, and bringing the furry, catlike, and relentlessly horny mage Yatzli along will almost guarantee you won’t have to go very long without some choice innuendos. Sadly, she’s just a tease: you can’t actually romance any of them, and the social links you can develop are fairly shallow. That seems like a fairly big miss since it’s otherwise great at building camaraderie with your eclectic found family, and even a fade-to-black sexytime scene can give you something to remember an RPG playthrough by.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaning into Obsidian’s substantial worldbuilding chops, Avowed is absolutely brimming with lore that builds upon the world the Pillars of Eternity games established, and it’s easy to lose hours just reading books and scrolls or discussing politics with the locals of every major region. Better still, even if you aren’t an expert on the world of Eora, there’s an extremely handy reference guide that populates with key places, factions, people, and concepts unique to the world whenever a character brings it up in a conversation, similar to the active time lore feature in Final Fantasy XVI. So before you make that really important decision that might well carry dire consequences, you can quickly toggle over to make sure you understand what they heck they’re talking about before proceeding. That makes Avowed’s typical fantasy setting that’s filled with what can quickly become too many made-up words and foreign concepts a whole heck of a lot easier to navigate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you aren’t chatting up the locals, you’ll probably be sending them back to The Wheel for reincarnation via Avowed’s tumultuous combat. You’ll face off against the usual baddies, from typical fantasy creatures and animals to anthropomorphic mushrooms and people driven to madness by the Dreamscourge. Fighting with melee weapons and magic feels smoother and more competent than it does in many similar fantasy RPGs, but evading dozens of enemies as they charge through sickly marshes and barren deserts isn’t as easy as it looks. I spent most of my time playing as a squishy wizard who had little in the way of protection and had to do my best to keep my distance, quick-dodge like a champ, and rain down as many high-powered spells as I could to keep them at bay. I’m especially fond of one that opens a black hole that lifts enemies helplessly into the air, and another that fills the area with a deadly lightning storm. Alternatively, there are more martial character build options that require more blocking, stabbing, and making use of power attacks to break the enemy’s guard, and each of these has their own skill trees that let you do neat things like smack enemies onto their backs with a powerful ramming attack. As someone who insists on playing on the hardest difficulty on my first run, I definitely found myself knocked on my butt more than a few times, and accidentally stumbling into an area that I wasn’t properly leveled for was quite humbling. But it was never insurmountable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There so many bears in this world! Even when it doesn’t really make any sense. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My biggest issue with combat is in the variety of opponents: for the vast majority of my 50-hour completionist run (you could easily beat it in less than half that time if you breeze past some side quests and play on normal difficulty) I found myself fighting the same handful of enemy types everywhere I ventured, and almost none of them are interesting or unique in their behaviors to begin with. There’s, of course, skeletons in need of re-killing, oversized spiders that spit gunk at you, and bears (oh my). And by God, are there so many bears in this world! Even when it doesn’t really make any sense for them to be here, they throw a few bears into the mix. A bandit camp with half a dozen ruffians sitting around a campfire? Why not add two pet bears to the party? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few hours the novelty of fighting these humdrum fantasy baddies, and my interest in squaring off against them, diminished. Every once in a while something big, scary, and unexpected would arrive and make me remember how to defeat a non-bear opponent, but these welcome surprises are too few and far between.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avowed Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully there’s plenty more to do and see while exploring each of Avowed’s four substantial open-world hubs, each filled with side quests to complete, minor puzzles to solve, hidden chests to loot, and people to talk smack to. You’ll go from a forested port town to a creepy, corrupted countryside, then to a perilous desert and an ashen wasteland with an active volcano spewing lava every which way. It’s a structure that resembles The Outer Worlds’ separate planets: None of the maps are especially big, but they make great use of the space they have, and they’re all delightfully colorful and brimming with personality that’s a welcome change from the sometimes drab and dull places we end up exploring in other RPGs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It felt as if the clean-up crew was going to show up to break down the set at any moment.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Those maps are great to explore the first time you go through them, though they don’t give you many reasons to stick around or run through again since enemies never respawn. This is a blessing insofar as you don’t have to retread the same areas to fight monsters (and bears) that have arbitrarily reappeared, but this also means any backtracking is completely devoid of life. They’re empty to the point where I felt extremely pressured to move onto the next zone as soon as possible because it felt as if the clean-up crew was going to show up to break down the set and remove the furniture at any moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One unique aspect of Avowed’s exploration is just how much it wants you to engage with its parkour system: it gives you ample opportunities to leap from ledge to ledge, mantling over this and that as you search for hidden treasure chests and avoid traps. This is an emphasis on mobility that’s fairly unusual for the genre, and it adds an activity that’s a welcome change from the routine to focus on in between (or sometimes during) combat. You won’t be doing wall-running or anything quite so fancy as what you’d find in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-2-stay-human-review">Dying Light 2,</a> but it’s still an interesting extra dimension to break up the conventional dungeon delving. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite RPGs</h3><p>If you're looking to get transported to another world, here are my the best escape destinations I can think of!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While there aren’t a lot of big new ideas that set Avowed apart, there are some nice smaller ones that I’d love to see every RPG hereafter learn from. For example, although there’s a stamina system during combat whereby you can exhaust yourself and lose the ability to fight back for a short time, running never drains it, whether you’re in or out of combat. So I appreciated that Avowed never inflicted the all-too-familiar annoyance of constantly running out of energy every 15 seconds when sprinting around the world. Similarly, you have encumbrance limits when looting items, but it’s quite generous with the space it gives you, even if you’re a wimpy wizard with a relatively small capacity like myself. What’s more, only larger items like weapons and armor count towards your carrying capacity, while consumables, materials, and other small items are weightless, ammo for guns and arrows for bows are unlimited, and larger items can be dismantled on the spot to turn them into valuable (and weightless) materials. There’s even an option to just hit a “send to camp” button anywhere in the world to instantly transport loot to your stash. These little details might not be genre-shifting refinements, but as someone who is easily infuriated by meaningless limitations that start to feel terrible after dozens of hours, they were seriously a godsend and I appreciate Obsidian’s thoughtful approach to removing some traditional RPG friction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet if there’s one thing that impressed me the most about Avowed, it’s the fact that across my 50+ hours with it on Xbox Series X, I encountered almost no glitches or technical issues worth mentioning. There was one time where I unwittingly killed an optional boss before accepting the quest to hunt it down, another where my compass wouldn’t tell me where to go for the next part of the main story, and sometimes I’d see odd polygons pop in and out while exploring the world. But I can count the number of times these things happened on one hand, and I didn’t experience a single crash even once during my entire time playing. That’s all but unprecedented for this genre, and an extremely welcome surprise.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">With awesome worldbuilding and stellar character writing, Avowed reminds me why I fell in love with Obsidian’s RPGs in the first place. However, the bigger picture is that it plays it quite safe, with a by-the-numbers fantasy adventure that’s more familiar than evolutionary, and there’s bear-ly any enemy variety to keep its swords-and-sorcery battles interesting for long. Even if it doesn’t swing for the fences or leave a memorable mark on the genre, though, it’s still perfectly competent with all the tried-and-true stuff I expect, including chaotic combat, leveling systems and a loot progression that lets you build the kind of character you want to play, and meaningful decisions that can have a massive impact on the world. Plus, the whole thing’s surprisingly technically stable compared to its reliably unreliable peers. I enjoyed my time parkouring my way through Eora and think you will too – just don’t expect Avowed to show you anything you haven’t seen before.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Amazing Seasun has confirmed that an open beta for its multiplayer mecha shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/" data-ref-id="5000-612139">Mecha Break</a> will begin on February 23. It will be the most comprehensive one for the game yet, featuring most of what players can expect in Mecha Break at release.</p><p>The Global Storm Open Beta begins at 2 AM PT / 5 AM PT on February 23, while no end date has been confirmed yet. Global Storm will contain the 6v6 Operation Verge and 3v3 Ace Arena modes that have been in previous Mecha Break betas, but it will be the first to feature full cross-play across PC and console and include Mashmak. Mashmak is Mecha Break's PvPvE extraction mode, where teams of players work together or fight each other over an element called Corite.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UbY_bPQ-9I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-UbY_bPQ-9I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mashmak gets its name from the map on which this mode takes place. An evil organization called Theia's Vanguard has taken over the Mashmak Isles and its massive supply of Corite. That serves as the narrative backdrop for why players explore, collect resources, and fight each other before extracting. From a gameplay perspective, Mashmak stands out because players can equip themselves with special mode-exclusive equipment to enhance their suits' abilities.</p><p>Mecha Break will launch for PC and Xbox Series X|S sometime in Spring 2025 before coming to other platforms later in the year. The PC version of this open beta can be pre-loaded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a> from 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET on February 20.</p>

			<p>The second Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 PC patch is now live, introducing various improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Patch 1.212.1.0 focuses mostly on stability improvements based on the developer's research and player reports. Among these are stability improvements on AMD GPUs introduced by disabling Anti-Lag 2, as the initialization of the tech's SDK caused driver crashes and, thus, instability.</p>
<p>Stability improvements are only some of the enhancements the new Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 patch brings. According to the full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/576000532521418781?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a>, game version 1.212.1.0 also featured improved adjustability of Mouse Sensitivity, improved screen-space reflections, and new NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction options that allow users to enable it at native resolution and with the Ultra Performance setting. Rounding up the new additions included in today's patch are a variety of bug fixes and the ability to use Nintendo Switch Pro controllers with Steam Input.</p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 was released two weeks ago on PC, and its launch was far from the best for PlayStation to PC ports due to stability issues and other visual issues, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">launch report</a>, which have yet to be completely fixed.</p>
<p><em>However, in between the crashes, I also noticed a graphics issue during cutscenes with character hair flickering in a very distracting way. Between this, the crashes, and the fact that NVIDIA said DLSS Multi Frame Generation will be added soon to the game, it's best to take a rain check on the PC version for the time being.</em></p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-outperforming-expectations-as-sales-near-2m.1108461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios' parent company Embracer Group has announced that the developer's medieval RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has "significantly outperformed" its expectations with regards to sales.</p>

<p>In its latest financial report (which covers the period between October and December 2024, but also features a look ahead to the next quarter), Embracer reveals that <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>is "fast approaching" two million sales.</p>

<p>That means the game has picked up another million sales between now and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">its first day on release</a>, which would explain why Embracer considers the game to have exceeded its sales estimates. Those are impressive numbers, especially for what is arguably a non-triple-A game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-near-2m-fight.jpg?itok=Qa7ojw9I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-near-2m-fight.jpg?itok=Fh-avwum 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has "outperformed" Embracer's expectations for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer says that it has a "strong belief" the medieval RPG will "continue to generate substantial revenues over the coming years", pointing to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">"robust roadmap"</a> Warhorse Studios has in place for the game's next twelve months.</p>

<p>All in all, Embracer says it expects to enjoy a stronger fourth quarter thanks to both&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>and the impending release of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for launch in March</a>.</p>

<p>However, it sounds like Early Access roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Embracer was hoping for, since the company says its Q4 will be "slightly negatively impacted" by the game.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>launched into Early Access in January and was quickly met with a negative reception, with players pointing to problems with the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">performance and accessibility features</a>, as well as what some perceive to be odd or poor design decisions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-embracer-group.jpg?itok=xl2m0kkV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-embracer-group.jpg?itok=l-zf5x-y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>doesn't seem to have achieved the sales numbers Embracer would have liked.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to its future, Embracer says that it currently has "10 AAA games under development, of which eight are from internal studios and two from external studios".</p>

<p>The company says this number doesn't include anything being released in the current quarter, so it sounds like games like&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>aren't part of that figure. The games in question are set to release over the next three fiscal years.</p>

<p>Embracer also points to its "exciting mid-sized releases" schedule, which includes games like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em></a>, ARPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, and the console release for&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>.</p>

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><br>The first teaser for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343454/sonys-until-dawn-movie-wants-to-channel-games-dust-yourself-off-and-try-again-energy">Sony and Screen Gems’ big screen <em>Until Dawn</em> adaptation</a> made it seem like it might just be another supernatural horror with a splash of <em>Groundhog Day </em>tossed in to keep things mildly interesting. But judging from the way the studios are describing the film, it sounds like this <em>Until Dawn </em>will also feature another important element from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/24/9187447/until-dawn-review-playstation-4">its video game counterpart</a>.</p><p>Though old man Hill (Peter Stomare) still won’t tell Clover (Ella Rubin) and her friends just what kind of danger they’re wandering into in <em>Until Dawn</em>’s new trailer, the meddling youths have a much easier time figuring out the basics of what’s going on. Somehow, the strange building they’re staying in is able to hurdle them back through time after they’re murdered by different kinds of monsters, and the phenomenon gives them another chance to survive through the night.</p><p>That much was obvious in <em>Until Dawn</em>’s first teaser, and the new trailer shows off a few more of the ghouls Clover’s group will encounter. Something that was less apparent, though, was how the movie will limit the number of extra lives each character will have. According to Sony and Screen Gems’ new synopsis for the film, the fact that group only gets a handful do-vers is one of the more terrifying things about their situation. That makes it sound like a couple of characters might run out before they’re able to escape, which could make <em>Until Dawn </em> feel even more like the game when it hits theaters on April 25th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For the most part it’s a standard popcorn bucket with a blue finish that resembles the group’s costumes. However, the lower section is clear and fades into the blue, emulating Sue’s power to disappear without a trace. If your power is to not be seen, it’s probably hard to capture that in a tangible thing people could buy at a movie theater, without just making a clear bucket, so I commend BossLogic for figuring this one out.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-recommend-id="image://f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like a fire extinguisher cabinet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like a fire extinguisher cabinet." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BossLogic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-recommend-id="image://f91ad52c2bf9c8d2eea0aa31a2b33595" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A popcorn bucket made to look like a fire extinguisher cabinet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The popcorn bucket for The Human Torch is cheeky, but so is the fire-wielding hero.

It’s a cute idea, but the theater better offer free refills—that’s not enough popcorn for a 90-minute movie.</p><hr><p><em>Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>is coming to theaters on July 25, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s next movie, <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> is out now and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/captain-america-4-reviews-round-up-messy-bad-boring-1851761664&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/captain-america-4-reviews-round-up-messy-bad-boring-1851761664">apparently not great</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended-specs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Konami officially confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at PlayStation’s State of Play event yesterday. As you wait for the game, here is a guide on the minimum and recommended system requirements for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater on PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a remake of the hit 2004 title, featuring the original story, characters, voice acting, gameplay, and music. The rest of the game has been built from the ground up for modern consoles, featuring cutscenes with new life, expansive stages, and new graphics for jungles, forests, and more. Characters also have better details, with even facial wrinkles, pores, and iris movements becoming visible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have also upgraded the MGS 3 remake’s battle system, so players will see wear and tear on Snake’s clothes, bruises and bullet wounds will appear on the body, and serious injuries will remain permanently.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To best experience Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eaters’ visual enhancements, the developers have revealed a set minimum and recommended PC system requirements. However, players should note that 16 GB of RAM, 100GB of SSD storage, and DirectX 12 are compulsory for both presets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Check out Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater PC’s minimum and recommended specifications, as listed on the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam listing</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-nbsp">Minimum&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The minimum requirements for MGS 3: Snake Eater are more demanding than those for recent games. As the bare minimum, players need an Intel i5-8600 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and RTX 2060 Super (8GB) GPU. These specifications will let players run Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at 1080p/30fps.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Specifications</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Minimum Requirements </strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel i5-8600 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">RTX 2060 Super (8GB)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">RAM</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">100 GB SSD Storage</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">OS</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-recommended-nbsp">Recommended&nbsp;</h3>



<p>With the recommended specifications, players can run Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at 1080p/60fps. However, they will need some upgrades, with the CPU increasing to Intel i7-8700K or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and the GPU increasing to RTX 3080.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Specifications</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Minimum Requirements </strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel i7-8700K or AMD Ryzen 5 3600</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">RTX 3080</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">RAM</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">100 GB SSD Storage</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">OS</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In other news, it was recently claimed that Metal Gear Solid Delta could also be released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Nintendo Switch 2 this year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/creating-seamless-multiplayer-experiences-for-games-like-space-marine-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hello everyone, I’m Dmitri Brevdo, Head of Game Services at Saber Interactive. Today, I’d like to share some key insights into developing seamless multiplayer experiences for games, something that often has its fair share of challenges—including the complexities of backend service integration and some universal lessons that may be helpful to anyone working on multiplayer projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the biggest hurdles in creating engaging multiplayer modes is ensuring a seamless online experience for players. This usually involves a ton of backend services like matchmaking, dedicated server hosting, cross-progression, and game analytics, each of which comes with its own set of technical challenges. Many studios rely on third-party tools to handle these components, but managing multiple services can quickly become overwhelming. Each service often introduces new SDKs, potential integration conflicts, and added layers of complexity that can negatively impact game performance. Developers across the board have likely encountered these frustrations, where the different systems hinder rather than help their game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In response to these challenges, we developed Hydra, an all-in-one backend platform designed to streamline and simplify operations. Hydra was created with modularity at its core, allowing us to customize the backend setup by plugging in only the components we need. It integrates services like matchmaking, analytics, social features, and communication tools into a single, cohesive framework. This not only reduces the need for multiple SDKs but also mitigates integration conflicts, allowing our team to focus on crafting better player experiences. With a scalable and flexible architecture, we’ve been able to support projects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which handled over 5 million multiplayer sessions daily and managed peak loads of more than 400,000 concurrent users in its first month.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To break this down, we wanted to address as many of these common challenges as we could. Here is what that looks like.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By unifying services, development teams can reduce integration overhead and allocate more resources to enhancing gameplay features. For example, many successful projects have&nbsp;&nbsp;adopted modular solutions that allow teams to plug in only the components they need. This modular approach is particularly beneficial in session-based multiplayer games, which demand a bunch of matchmaking and social features, as well as scalable voice and text communication. Ultimately, prioritizing a consistent and scalable backend architecture significantly enhances the player experience while minimizing the risk of technical issues during peak player loads.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another area worth highlighting is the management of in-game economies and live operations. Virtual stores, loot systems, and dynamic pricing models are critical for maintaining player engagement and driving revenue. Yet, these features also require real-time monitoring and the flexibility to adjust based on player behavior. Tools that offer intuitive web portals for analytics and configuration can empower developers to make informed, data-driven decisions. The broader takeaway here is that having the right infrastructure allows teams to be more responsive, rapidly implementing adjustments and capitalizing on opportunities as they emerge. Even beyond multiplayer features, effective game operations tools are indispensable for keeping communities active and satisfied.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Comprehensive diagnostics and analytics also play a crucial role in game development, a lesson that’s broadly applicable across different genres and platforms. Having access to real-time telemetry can mean the difference between a minor issue and a significant, game-breaking outage. Automated health monitoring, error tracking, and constant updates on key performance indicators enable studios to proactively address potential problems. This kind of preparedness isn’t just about crisis management; it’s about fostering a data-driven culture where every decision can be backed by insights into player behavior and system performance. Developers from indie teams to AAA studios can benefit from prioritizing this aspect of their infrastructure, ultimately supporting more stable and enjoyable player experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In summary, whether you’re a small studio or part of a massive development team, simplifying backend operations, adopting flexible infrastructure, and leveraging robust analytics are lessons that resonate across the board. The goal is to create an online environment that enhances gameplay while giving teams the tools they need to be agile and responsive. By focusing on&nbsp;these core principles, developers can spend less time fighting technical fires and more time innovating and crafting unforgettable experiences for players.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The studio behind grim cyberpunk action shooter Ruiner revealed its next game during PlayStation's State of Play showcase yesterday evening, and it's out surprisingly soon on 6th May 2025 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>
<p>Metal Eden puts you in the reprintable robot body of run and gun android Aska, who's on a mission to uncover the secrets behind an artificial paradise planet called Mobius. As well as shooting everything that stands in her way, Aska has the ability to yank out enemy power cores, killing them instantly. She can then use these cores to either throw them back as mini-grenades or consume them for a limited-time power boost, allowing her to perform a super punch to knock out shielded enemies or just mulch them in a metallic pulp.</p>

<p>That's the main hook of this cyberpunk shooter, though having played a short demo of it ahead of last night's State of Play, I'm not sure it's going to be quite enough to set Metal Eden apart from the pack.</p>
<p>The easiest way to describe Metal Eden is that it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> meets modern Doom, meshing the latter's 'move or die' mantra with the former's abstract corridors of generic sci-fi set dressing. It's a formula that might sound appealing on paper, but it's one that struggles to get the blood pumping in the moment.</p>
<p>Granted, I've only played a small slice of it so far, but early on at least, the similarities to Ghostrunner are almost uncanny. Much like One More Level and Slipgate Ironworks' 2020 first-person shooter-slasher, Metal Eden takes place on cramped, snippets of platforms and metal walkways, with an emphasis on wall-running between suspended sheets of metal and grappling between abstract industrial corridors.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>It's a little more forgiving than Ghostrunner, in that you have a proper health bar that can be topped up with green, Doom-like armour power-ups, but you're still facing pocketfuls of enemies as you parkour toward your objective, occasionally getting locked down in larger, wave-based battle arenas where everything must be mulched before you're allowed to move on.</p>
<p>It's not exactly the most scintillating of settings, nor does it feel like Metal Eden is doing anything particularly new here. I'm also sorry to report that the shooting was a bit underwhelming, too. The guns were deadly, sure, often one-shotting enemies with swift efficiency, but they had no kick to them, making them feel a bit limp and lifeless under the thumbs.</p>
<p>Like Doom, you'll need to stay on your feet to stay alive, but the tight confines of Metal Eden's levels don't always give you much room to manoeuvre here - or at least not as much room as you'd ideally like given how often everything's leaping and shooting at you. Aska's dodge and limited jet pack thrust can help extend her double jump to make movement feel a little more athletic and punchy, but nothing stops the momentum of battle faster than accidentally falling to your death and having to restart because you ran out of thruster fuel or mistimed a jump.</p>
<p>Perhaps the full game will reveal a deeper side to Metal Eden, and one that will allow it to hold its own against Doom: The Dark Ages when both games come out this May. But as first impressions go, I fear this may well get lost in the Doom Slayer's wake.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As showcased in the State of Play yesterday, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has an official release date of August 28, 2025. This title will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. For those in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) you are already able to pre-order this title on your chosen platform, with some differences in the editions that are available.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is set to be a faithful remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, an iconic game that was originally released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2. However, with a new generation being introduced to Solid Snake, as well as loyal fans wanting more Metal Gear Solid action, a remake was the perfect way to introduce newcomers to the franchise. The remake will star the original English and Japanese voice actors, with a rich and intense storyline and some<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/"> new expansive features</a> of the combat system with brand-new graphics and immersive sound.</p>
<p>If you are yet to see the trailer, here is what you missed from last night's State of Play.</p>
<p><iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - Release Date Trailer 【PS5®,Steam® version】| KONAMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6WuqxGg0yek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This particular trailer is for the PlayStation 5 and Steam version of the game, with Xbox having a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN3BdHaR6U8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly different trailer</a> available. This is due to the return of Snake vs. Monkey, which is a fan-favorite game that will be making a return on PlayStation and Steam at launch, with more information to come about Snake vs. Monkey for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game later down the line.</p>
<p>If you know that you plan on getting this game, pre-orders are already open in EMEA, as stated above. There are multiple editions available, with some of the editions providing you with DLC that can give you some extra cosmetics to play with.</p>
<p>The Digital Deluxe Edition and Physical Deluxe Edition will both include the Sneaking DLC Pack, as well as players getting access to the game 48 hours earlier with the Digital Deluxe Edition. The Sneaking DLC includes:</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-diablo-4-expansion-not-due-until-2026-blizzard-says.1108410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion won't be arriving until next year, so if you were hoping to play the followup to last year's&nbsp;<em>Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>in 2025, you'll be disappointed, unfortunately.</p>

<p>That's according to&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>general manager Rod Fergusson, who delivered the news during yesterday's DICE summit (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-next-expansion-after-vessel-of-hatred-wont-come-until-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>).</p>

<p>According to Fergusson, plans are in place to deliver a&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>roadmap before Season 8, which is expected to land sometime in spring. The game's second expansion won't be on that roadmap, Fergusson says, "because our second expansion is coming in 2026".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-next-expansion-2026-gameplay.jpg?itok=ZvDTTg9w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-next-expansion-2026-gameplay.jpg?itok=bmdcF_0_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Diablo 4</em>'s next expansion won't launch until 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>As IGN points out, Fergusson previously suggested that&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>would be getting an expansion a year, making reference to "annual expansions" and "quarterly seasons" in an <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/diablo/diablo-4-gm-confirms-annual-expansions-for-the-game-2279389/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with Dexerto back in September 2023.</p>

<p>The fact that no&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion will be released in 2026 suggests that there's been a policy shift in that regard at Blizzard, although since Fergusson's reference to the expansion is fairly throwaway, he doesn't provide a concrete reason for the delay.</p>

<p>He did, however, say at the DICE talk that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-expansion-vessel-of-hatred-announced-itll-come-in-late-2024-itll-be-even" rel="nofollow"><em>Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>launched later</a> than Blizzard expected it to, so that could well imply that the company's whole schedule for expansion launches has shifted to accommodate that late launch.</p>

<p>In any case, you're going to be waiting at least another year or so for the next major&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion. The company still appears to be intending to release seasons on a quarterly basis, though, which is encouraging.</p>




<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably guessed, the fourth major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>series (although it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-immortal-new-class-tempest" rel="nofollow">not the fourth overall</a>). The game returns to the grittier, darker aesthetic of earlier&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>games after&nbsp;<em>Diablo 3</em>'s shift towards a relatively lighter and more stylized aesthetic.</p>

<p>Back in June, it was revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>franchise had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales" rel="nofollow">hit 100 million players</a>, although it's worth noting that's not equivalent to sales since it seems to include player counts for the free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Diablo Immortal</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>, which is available on Game Pass.</p>

<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/diablo-iv/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/diablo-iv/9NQRCD3W41L3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

It's got an open world full of NPC quest-givers and creatures designed by Hee-Cheol Jang, the mad scientist behind the menageries of Okja and The Host.

<p>I fear there is context we must discuss. Since its console release last year, Stellar Blade's protagonist Eve - who is modelled after South Korean influencer Shin Jae-Eun - has become the postergirl for a vocal audience of Very Good Boys, who see reflected in her skintight metallic bodysuit a utopia in which all talk of sexism and critique of male gaze has been silenced, and there is nothing to complicate anybody's down-to-Earth enjoyment of jiggle physics.</p>
<p>Or at least, that was the case until Shift Up had the appalling bad taste to equip one of Eve's downloadable outfits with a modest undershirt for the international release - covering up a few crucial inches of Free Speech in a brazen blow to the billiards of the internet's gentlemanly sophisticates. There were cries of "censorship". There was a petition, written in several languages like the Rosetta Stone; perhaps aliens will use it to decipher our cultures once we've all been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-huge-space-rock-has-a-23-chance-of-hitting-earth-so-lets-all-play-asteroid-launcher">wiped out by asteroids</a>. Somebody, possibly a troll, started the Twitter hashtag #freestellarblade. It was like a scene from the French Revolution, except that all the people yelling about cleavage don't mean the guillotine. </p>
<p>I'm not 100% clear how things stand at the minute, but I've seen a lot of talk from the damper regions of social media about Stellar Blade being snubbed by the Game Awards 2024, so presumably Shift Up have been forgiven for buying Eve a shirt. For what it's worth, Stellar Blade sounds like a well-made action-adventure, sexualised protagonist notwithstanding. Reviewing the console version for Eurogamer, Jessica Orr <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">praised</a> its "killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat", while highlighting moments of "surprisingly endearing weirdness".</p>
<p>The PC version will be "optimised for PC", and presumably includes various updates added to the console version, like the photo mode. It'll launch alongside the Goddess of Nikke DLC, trailered above.

                <p>During February 12's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">State of Play</a>, Konami confirmed an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-with-state-of-play-trailer/1100-6529438/" data-ref-id="1100-6529438">August 28 release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and teased that the Snake vs. Monkey crossover mode with Ape Escape would return on PS5. You may have missed that Xbox players will be getting a different crossover.</p><p>It looks like Xbox players can expect Snake to face off with Bomberman. Konami and Microsoft released a dedicated release date trailer for the Xbox version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> shortly after the State of Play. In lieu of the shot teasing the Ape Escape collaboration, the Xbox trailer instead plays the iconic "alert" Metal Gear sound effect over an exclamation point. The square serving as the point on that punctuation then unfolds to reveal a cartoonish bomb, which then blows up and shows a camouflage version of Bomberman with the text "Snake vs. ???" overlayed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti5bNYtsHy8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ti5bNYtsHy8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Konami isn't saying anything more about this special mode at this time, it's clear that this is a collaboration with another one of Konami's biggest franchises. Bomberman predates Metal Gear, as Hudson Soft created it in 1983. Konami has owned Bomberman since it acquired Hudson Soft in 2011 and developed new games in the series, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-bomberman-r/" data-ref-id="5000-461290">Super Bomberman R</a> and its sequel.</p><p>The top-down bomb-laying and maze-navigating gameplay of Bomberman is quite different from the hardcore action of Metal Gear, so we aren't sure how Konami will combine the two gameplay styles into a special mode just yet. The Ape Escape mode on PlayStation is expected to be similar to the Snake vs. Monkey mode that appeared in the original PS2 release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-18284">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 28.

Though the studio is no stranger to making first-person RPGs like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, bringing the Pillars series to first-person is a hefty challenge. The existing audience is used to turn-based combat and top-down exploration. And when it comes to first-person fantasy—well, every game in the field is likely to be compared against Bethesda Softworks' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the 800lb gorilla of the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a tall task to be sure. Game Developer previously spoke with game director </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/avowed-director-carrie-patel-explains-how-obsidian-pushes-boundaries-in-the-fantasy-genre">Carrie Patel</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about translating the wild world of the Pillars series to first-person fantasy, but we had more questions about the technical nitty gritty of the transition. When you play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you quickly notice it feels distinctly different from the fantasy epic made by Obsidian's cousins at Bethesda. There's a certain snappiness to how the player animations feel, and the use of "hit stops" supercharges the impact of every swing of a sword, axe, mace, or other melee medium for violence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The details are dense—but luckily gameplay director Gabe Paramo, lead VFX Artist Ash Kumar, and senior animator Seth McCaughey had answers for us and fellow developers. In a conversation earlier this month, the trio broke down how those hit stops—alongside carefully-crafted motion trails, 60 FPS source animations, and player response to the 2023 Xbox Showcase—were all key parts of making the game's combat so punchy and unforgettable.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/avowed-director-carrie-patel-explains-how-obsidian-pushes-boundaries-in-the-fantasy-genre" target="_self" data-discover="true">Avowed director Carrie Patel explains how Obsidian pushes boundaries in the fantasy genre</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early multiplayer design had long-term payoff">Early multiplayer design had long-term payoff</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You might recall that when Obsidian first teased </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it mentioned the game would include optional co-op multiplayer. That feature was cut later in development (in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Oo9ZYDRQkbg">a 2023 documentary</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the team explained designing for multiplayer was interfering with single-player pipelines), but elements of its design were "foundational" for the first-person combat of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Paramo broke down how in a rather technical explanation, beginning with how the team was designing animations in Unreal 4 (and later Unreal 5). Paramo set up much of the initial combat design. The goal, he said, was to make sure a player's console or PC could replicate the third-person view on another player's machine during multiplayer gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We needed to be able to utilize Unreal's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animation-slots-in-unreal-engine">slot system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in their </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animation-montage-in-unreal-engine">[animation] montages</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so that you'd basically have two tracks simultaneously going on. Then, depending on whether you're in first or third-person view, they're in that perspective, running that animation tree, and running that slot," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Translation: In order to design </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s first-person view, Obsidian needed a functional third-person camera that could capture the animations of another player and let a player in first-person see what the other player was doing in third-person. That made the third-person camera that ships with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (useful for players who might get motion sick in a first-person view) a "foundational" part of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers familiar with multiplayer animation know there are inherent limitations to animating objects and characters in a way that can be efficiently tracked by two machines across great distances. Even with the multiplayer features removed from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the work put into the Unreal slot systems was also "foundational" for the final game. "The constraints of animation timing and keeping those things in sync—if you don't do that, the gameplay feels off-sync on another person's machine," Paramos continued. "I think that's where it all started from."</span></p><p>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Throughout that process, the team began reckoning with the challenges of a first-person combat system that would be dominated by melee attacks. Players can use guns, bows, and magic pepper enemies from a distance, but in the fantasy world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, enemies are always rushing toward the player with a violent urge to be smacked upside the head. McCaughey explained that melee animation is "a lot more difficult in first-person to make it readable and feel comfortable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He called out how much time the animation team spent on "motion trails"—subtle animations that follow the movement of the players' weapons as they attack. They're not generally visible to the human eye, but their presence tricks the brain into getting a more clear sense of how objects move in the game. It's the equivalent of adding "woosh" noises to swords in fantasy movies. Swords may not make those sounds in real life, but it helps the viewer sense how heavy a swing is.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We pushed the source animations of those to up to 60 frames per second to get good, clean motion trails and good readability," he said, adding that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s motion trail rendering is calculated in real-time. "You need lots of samples so they aren't taking a strange path through the frame as they go."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the motion trail animations don't work properly, they might render in a completely different direction from where the player swings. Imagine swinging your sword left-to-right, but an animation appears showing from right to left. "Or in a loop de loop," McCaughey said with just a hint of exasperation.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making visual effects that play up-close and personal">Making visual effects that play up-close and personal</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A number of weapons and magical spells in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> generate a mix of flashy, colorful visual effects. You've got fireballs, chained lightning, sparks of energy shooting out of a wand, and more. In a strictly third-person game, those effects would render in the midground of the environment. When you're in first-person view, those big effects are playing front-and-center.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Kumar, that means the fidelity of the animations needed to be "way higher" while being careful about how much space they took place on the screen. What helped, in part, was the creation of "hit stops" on all the weapons that play on the animation as the player makes contact with the enemy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Hit stops" for the uneducated (like I was before this conversation) are brief pauses in an animation where an object freezes, then accelerates to mimic the feeling of colliding objects. Kumar said combat designer Max Matzenbacher was the one responsible for implementing them in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and explained those brief pauses were a huge opportunity for the VFX team to spice up the combat visuals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"On the effects side, we try to underline it with different bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing effects," he explained—largely referring to blood spatters. Those spatters, he said, also had to play differently between first-person and third-person view, because the different camera position would automatically make the effects play at different distances.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">McCaughey said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s hit stops have another interesting feature. "They're not just a pausing of the animation," he said. "It actually branches to [another] unique animation where the weapon hits and draws through—the blade hits, is deflected, and pulls through the cut so you can feel the difference between swinging at air and swinging and hitting the target."</span></p><p>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The system also accounts for attacks on enemies whose defenses are too strong for the player's current power level. Different animations play on those attacks that show the player's weapon bouncing off the target instead of powerfully swinging through.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a new trick for Obsidian—if you study the animation of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you'll notice it has conventional swinging animations for melee weapons, with no fancy redirects based on where the blow lands.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tuning all of these animations and effects, as always, demanded hours and hours of staring at fast-moving loops to assess if what they'd created felt good for players. With so many different moving parts, we wanted to know how Mcaughey, Kumar, and Parano could keep track of the different variations and figure out what worked and what didn't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It turns out they had an unusual reference point. Parano explained that after the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> gameplay reveal trailer shared in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/HvNw8a0ls3Q?si=7JfyTIS7aoGyjPNw">January 2023 Xbox Showcase</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Obsidian spotted critical feedback from some prospective players worried about the feel of the first-person combat. The studio already planned to polish up what was in the trailer, but now they had a precise reference point of what </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>didn't</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> feel good to compare and contrast against.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That kind of kept me sane at least," he admitted. It was a strong baseline to make incremental adjustments against—a video that could answer the question "does this feel better or worse?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course Obsidian is in a rare position to take advantage of a preview like that. Microsoft's interest in promoting its own games means they got a premiere opportunity to put the game in front of thousands (millions?) of eyeballs and see what players thought. They also had time to react to that feedback. Developers with less marketing power and shorter runways don't have that opportunity, but those working on Early Access games or building closed beta programs have a chance to learn from Obsidian's experience here.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Animation bugs can be extra fun">Animation bugs can be extra fun</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because animation and visual effects are such a—well, visual—experience, it's where developers can encounter a battery of bizarre bugs, the kind that break your workflow because you just stop and laugh. So, which bugs are currently living rent free in the heads of Obsidian's dev team?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First there was the "giant sword" bug. "Certain enemies, if they were standing around you and then you engage them in combat, would just come at you with a weapon three times the size as they are," Mcaughey said. "There was an animation bug where some of the scales on the weapon joints had accidentally been set to zero during the idle animations. If that got interrupted the game miscalculated how big those bones should be."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parano said facial animation bugs are the ones that always stick out to him—prompting Mcaughey to bring up a bug where he accused a non-playable character of being a "coward," and that NPC reacted by shoving his arms through his own torso.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Apparently the team at Obsidian are big fans of what you might call the "mouse door" bug. "What the issue was," Parano explained "is that we made a very systemic game where lots of things share properties." And because mice have the same "AI brain" as other NPCs, they would sometimes have access to the same properties as humanoid creatures wandering the city.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And so you might be testing a build of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, round a corner, and see a tiny mouse walk up to a door, open it, and walk through like it owns the place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the longtime RPG studio is once again showing how developers can push the technical boundaries of games without compromising on core gameplay or ambitious storytelling. First-person fantasy games are going on three-decades old, but Mcaughey, Kumar, Parano, and their colleagues show there are still incredible ways for developers to innovate in the space.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The architecture in the world around you is bathed in neon lights, helping to immerse you into the cyber-futuristic world in front of you, which has been named Moebius. As you explore Moebius, you will find yourself participating in the ongoing conflict over the souls of a lost human colony that are stored in cybernetic COREs.</p>
<p>On this journey, you are accompanied by your sentient spaceship named Nexus. As you progress through the story, you will expand and upgrade your arsenal, as well as make your robotic body even stronger and more robust to be able to continue fighting off enemies in a mechanical world. By fighting the diverse roster of enemies, you will have to extract energy cores that will provide you with an advantage on the battlefield. Along with upgrading your weaponry, you'll also get to upgrade and obtain new combat abilities that will make you a force of nature.</p>
