			<p>I wasn’t sure what to expect from&nbsp;No Sleep For Kaname Date.&nbsp;As a big fan of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/16/ai-the-somnium-files-review/">AI: The Somnium Files</a>&nbsp;games, it’s hard to picture where in the timeline a third entry could fall that would cleanly follow up on the ending of the second game, while also giving us the characters that this one seemed to be specifically focusing on. Much like how the series tasks you with disregarding your main options and seeking out a hidden third path, that’s the exact route that the developers have ended up taking with this No Sleep For Kaname Date.</p>
<p>This game is neither a prequel nor a sequel – in carving out a hidden third path for themselves, the team behind this title have made a game that creates it’s own context somewhere vaguely in-between both entries. While it doesn’t deliver a satisfying continuation of the main narrative as a result, it still ends up being a really enjoyable, fan-pleasing side-story that I couldn’t help but smile at.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES, System Trailer | Switch, Switch 2, Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzXuPDXSi-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>No Sleep For Kaname Date sees the return of the iconic investigative duo from the first game – perverted slacker ABIS agent Kaname Date and his cybernetic AI, the eyeball-shaped companion Aiba. Protagonist duties don’t squarely belong to them, though – you’ll also spend a lot of the game playing directly as Iris, the iconic bubbly social media influencer that the first game revolved around. I’ve already talked a bit about how this game is heavy on fan-pleasing moments for people who enjoy the rest of the series, but it’s also surprisingly packed with send-ups to creator Kotaro Uchikoshi’s other iconic sci-fi murder mystery series, Zero Escape.</p>
<p>Iris suddenly finds herself kidnapped by a UFO and trapped in a mysterious set of escape room puzzles that are part of something called The Third Eye Games. These puzzles literally play out like gameplay from the&nbsp;Zero Escape&nbsp;franchise, all the way down to minute aesthetic details like the “SEEK A WAY OUT” message popping up at the start of a puzzle or the iconic item pickup sound effect returning from&nbsp;999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors.</p>


<p>Much like those games, puzzles in this title are also incredibly absurd, and are nearly impossible to gauge at a base level. The items you need to find, the combinations you need to concoct, and the reactions you need to unfurl to escape each room feel like they’re being made up on the fly – it’s equal parts maddening and entertaining, but rarely feels unfair. In the moments where it does, the game provides some precise difficulty options and hint systems that you can toggle between pretty freely as you play. For a purist, you can stick to hard mode and never use the Seek system that points out your next item to interact with. For a story-focused player or someone struggling with a particular puzzle, the malleability of the difficulty and hints is really helpful for ensuring that the frustration of these escape rooms never boils over.</p>
<p>Between solving escape rooms as Iris, you’re also doing familiar investigations and Psync dives as Kaname Date. These play out exactly as they would in prior games, with nothing new mechanically going on to spice them up. If the entirety of No Sleep For Kaname Date were just these investigation scenes, they would be a bit of a drag considering how familiar and almost formulaic they’ve become. But drizzled in between the escape rooms, they help ground the experience a bit and keep it feeling like a proper AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;entry, while also helping break up the gameplay a bit.</p>

<p>All these moments ultimately serve to support and amplify the writing of the game – that’s something that No Sleep For Kaname Date delivers on in spades. Characters are consistently funny, weird, and absurdist in that way that I love so much. Part of me is still frustrated that the game sort of captures so many of these characters in a bubble of sorts, presenting flanderised versions of them that don’t reflect the growth or changes they go through in the main series. It’s especially frustrating to see Kaname Date and Mizuki presented in the way they are, because the versions of these characters that come later in the story are so much more interesting to explore.</p>
<p>At the same time, this game delivers some really exciting new character interactions that I was sorely missing from the last game. Tama the flirty and air-headed AI companion always felt like such an exciting character to see Kaname Date interact with, and finally having moments in this game where the two of them bounce their idiocy off each other is so much fun.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if you come to No Sleep For Kaname Date looking for a continuation of the story from the first two games, or a title that carves a brave and destructive path for itself the way that games from Kotaro Uchikoshi tend to do, this ain’t it. What it is, though, is like a really creative and entertaining filler arc from a long-running anime. The events of this game might not entirely matter in the grand scheme of things or push the more serious elements of the narrative in any particularly exciting direction, but it is full of fun character moments, wild puzzles, and so much of the charm and absurdity that made the first two games such a blast.</p>

            <p>Alongside working on The Duskbloods and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s post-launch bits, FromSoftware are reportedly deep in development on an unannounced game that could release next year.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fromsoftware-i-development-unannounced-project-codenamed-fmc">MP1st</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-reportedly-has-another-unannounced-game-that-could-release-next-year/">VGC</a>), which claims said game is codenamed FMC, multiplatform and - based on "the nature of the source these details come from" - at an advanced stage of development.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The site alleges that unless this game is delayed, it could be in line for a 2026 release. That's the extent of the report's concrete info, with it then dissecting the various codenames given to other FromSoft game while they were in the works.</p>
<p>Since a number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> projects and Armored Core 6 all had codenames beginning with F, as this mystery game reportedly does, MP1st speculate that FMC could be related to one of those series. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, meanwhile, had the snappy moniker SPRJ, so it'd appear you may well be barking up the wrong gothic tree if a PC port of that was your go-to guess.</p>
<p>FMC. Hmmmmmm. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s codename was GR, short for Great Rune. Maybe this is Fuck, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a>'s Cool? Four Massive Cats? Frustratingly Melancholy Chambers? Fear Magical Chairs? Failure, My Chums? Fight Man Crush, with all six thousand things that could mean?</p>
<p>Full Macarena Confidence? Alright, stop there. I'm going with that one. FromSoft collabing with the lyrical talents of Los del Río, who really are the music industry's George R.R Martin, to give you the ego boost you need to accomplish cosa buena.</p>
<p>What do you mean Miyazaki and co would never do that? Whatever, I can't hear you over the sound of vaguely Spanish dancing. As VGC point out, the director made clear <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/miyazaki-promises-switch-2-exclusive-duskbloods-wont-distract-fromsoftware-from-single-player-games/">earlier this year</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods don't signal the studio moving away from the sorts of single player games they made their name with.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-are-reportedly-working-on-an-unannounced-game-alongside-the-duskbloods-that-could-release-next-year]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Zack Snyder has confirmed he's taking a break from Rebel Moon to work on other projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars-style sci-fi movie Rebel Moon launched on Netflix in December 2023 amid much hype. It's set in a galaxy ruled by the imperialistic Motherworld, whose military, the Imperium, threatens a village on the moon Veldt. As the titles suggest, a band of rebels fights back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Netflix had high hopes for Rebel Moon, critics panned the film. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-one-review-netflix-zack-snyder">Rebel Moon review</a> returned a 4/10. We said: "Zack Snyder's space opera is let down by a derivative patchwork script, mediocre action sequences and a superficial story."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sequel Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver followed in April 2024, and it met with a similar reception. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-two-the-scargiver-review-netflix-zack-snyder">Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver review</a> was another 4/10. "The second part of Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon space opera, The Scargiver, delivers a half-baked conclusion to a well-trodden story with flimsy character studies and lacklustre action." R-rated director's cuts of both Rebel Moon 1 and 2 followed in 2024 and met with a more positive reception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got sidetracked into this — not sidetracked, it’s all uptown problems, as they say — for Netflix, I’m working on an LAPD SWAT movie,” Snyder told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/rebel-moon-video-game-zack-snyder-film-franchise-superman-1236453663/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> in a recent interview. “So I was like, OK, well, I’m gonna just sort of let that Rebel Moon world boil for a minute, and I’m gonna go do this.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Man of Steel writer and director, who is perhaps best known for his work on the now rebooted DC Universe, also highlighted the complicated nature of working on two projects simultaneously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Frankly, it was a very exhausting, long process doing the two movies together. So it was nice to have a bit of a break from it,” he explained. “I love it like crazy, but it’s nice to have a bit of a break. So yeah, we’ll see after I finish this, when I come back, where we are with everything.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as more stories or even more film adaptations specifically being planned in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/rebel-moon-part-2-the-scargiver">Rebel Moon</a> universe, Snyder was mostly tightlipped about any confirmations. ​​“There’s tons of stories. So, I mean, I think it’s literally, it’s endless,” he said. “But, again, like I say, I’m waiting to see how we want to and in what way we would move forward, if at all.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s clear Snyder <em>does</em> feel like the possibilities for Rebel Moon are endless — because we now have a video game spinoff set in the universe to go along with the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-video-game-launches-for-netflix-subscribers-as-zack-snyder-keeps-plans-for-future-movies-paused">called Blood Line</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lex Briscuso is a film and television critic and a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.

Essentially a user-friendly version of Blender, players are able to sculpt in 3D, producing incredible works of art--or pure nightmare fuel--that have been chiseled to perfection.</p><p>This is meant to be a creative diversion from DK's new adventure, and some of the creations that people have gleefully uploaded to their social media accounts are best described as creative or cursed--sometimes, both--and they're all <em>excellent</em>.</p><p>Some of the creations glimpsed below include Five Nights at Freddy's fanart, an unflattering portrait of US VP JD Vance, and a version of DK that can see into the very depths of your soul. All of them look like they could easily replace the Mona Lisa at The Louvre, and at the very least, they deserve their own wing at that art museum.</p><p>People are really making the most of this mode, as the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls offer a high level of precision. Accessing Artist Mode is also easy, as it's available from the main menu of Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza has earned critical acclaim since it launched this week, as it's not only one of the best games of the year, but a must-play Switch 2 title as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.8 will be launching in late July, bringing with it a brand new permanent summer resort map, a new playable character, and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date" rel="nofollow">last month's Version 5.7 update</a>, Version 5.8 will arrive on July 30th. Its main new addition is the Easybreeze Holiday Resort, where you'll meet familiar faces pursuing their own agendas, including none other than everyone's favorite bard Venti.</p>

<p>The new map will also grant you traversal powers that will allow you to "glide across water and hover briefly in midair across the layers of the resort", and you'll gain other powers that will let you solve new puzzles and explore the resort more effectively as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.8-easybreeze-holiday-resort.jpg?itok=5ncAcvWU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.8-easybreeze-holiday-resort.jpg?itok=iuXQ2PwU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A brand new holiday resort is being added in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.8.</figcaption></figure><p>As usual, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>version update without a new character to play as, and while there's only one to add to your roster this time around, you'll want to take the time.</p>

<p>Ineffa is a 5-star polearm user based on the Electro element, and she can deal continuous Electro damage by summoning a devastating thunder cloud to hover over the battlefield. Not only that, but if she's your active character, she can summon a shield and a drone that deals extra Electro damage for her.</p>

<p>You'll be able to recruit Ineffa to your team as part of the first half of Version 5.8's wish cycle, along with a rerun of Citlali. In the second half, you'll get the chance to recruit Mualani and Chasca if you missed them the first time around.</p>




<p>As ever, there are also bonus codes to give you some free stuff as part of this version cycle, so here they are!</p>

<ul><li>Ineffa0730Birgitta - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>Summer0730Asha - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>TranquilBanquet - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a>. Version 5.8 launches on July 30th.</p>

Microsoft is not offering a refund for purchases, either.</p><p>The closure of Microsoft’s movies and TV store has been nervously anticipated by Xbox and Windows users ever since Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/2/16401898/microsoft-groove-music-pass-discontinued-spotify-partner">shut down its Groove Music service</a> in 2017. Microsoft originally launched a movies and TV storefront with the Zune Video Marketplace in 2006, before it was replaced by Xbox Video in 2012. That then morphed into the Movies &amp; TV app and store in 2015, and now a decade later it’s going away.</p><p>Microsoft is now leaving it up to Amazon, Netflix, Apple TV, and the many other streaming video services to cater for movies and TV content on Windows and Xbox. Microsoft will continue to provide support for any issues playing back previously purchased content, and owners will be hoping the company keeps its servers online for many years to come.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/709737/microsoft-movies-tv-store-closure-xbox-windows]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I've only dipped my distal index fingerbone in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-necromancers-tale">The Necromancer's Tale</a>, a just-released historical fantasy tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Psychic Software, but I can at least report back that the character creator is a gentle joy, to the point that I was disappointed to reach the end of it. True to the promise/threat of "400,000 words of hand-written narrative and lore", it's a hearty choose-your-own-adventure prologue that follows the protagonist's infancy and early adulthood. Each choice you make skews the stats on the left. Might sound unremarkable of concept. Here's why it's stuck with me.</p><!--more-->

<p>Firstly, the guy doing the narration has a fine set of pipes indeed, with intonation that reminds me of certain elder Drag n' Dunkers (the loudly painted 3D graphics, a little less so). I can imagine that actor leaning across the campfire to tell tales of the Time of Troubles, a chaotic period, when gods were made flesh and forced to walk the earth. In general, I wish more RPGs conducted themselves like weird storytellers in the woods. Make us feel like kids again, watching the flames on a frosty, moonless Halloween.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's a nice showcase for the game's writing, and how it informs the stat-massaging. The Necromancer's Tale is set near Venice in a mildly sorcerous version of 18th century Europe, where "courtly intrigue collides with black magic even as chemistry emerges from alchemy". You are a child of nobles who meets with strange fortune and takes a hard left into lichedom. </p>
<p>That's the kind of rich setup that often leads to sentences that sag beneath the weight of adjectives and metaphors like sickly, fermenting, wasp-blighted plum trees, but the prologue writing is spare and evenly stressed, easy to read aloud. More importantly, the relationship between the choose-your-own adventure decisions and the evolution of your stats is unclear in an engaging way.</p>
<p>Some of the decisions are QTE fare, like "do I fend off this stone-throwing girl with a stick or do I ask her to stop". Sometimes they are more introspective. An example: I have just been banished by my parents, for reasons unknown. As I'm borne away in a carriage, I have the choice of feeling angry and unwanted, or wounded and betrayed, or simply confused. Now, see if you can work out how those emotions will feed into my nine core stats: Strength, Agility, Constitution, Acuity, Knowledge, Investigate, Analyse, Impress, or Convince. </p>
<p>It's not an <em>absolute</em> enigma, but there's enough slipperiness that I make the choice more to discover the outcome, than to boost the preferred stat. I like it when RPG yarns successfully unhitch my brain from The Numbers. Elsewhere, the prologue attempts the perilous feat of taking some Numbers away. As you age, things happen that lower your stats. I found these misadventures just as convincing - all part of life's pissy golden tapestry - and I liked how they got around the presumable underlying design issue of needing to cap the player's points.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Psychic Software</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If all of this leaves you cold, rest assured that there's the option of skipping the adventure book element and just adding or deducting those points from a bar. Go on, play it like you're doing your taxes - I'd judge you for it if I hadn't once been fined £800 for handing my tax return in late. You can also tinker with the points after completing the prologue. Myself, I'm sticking with the character I've rolled, an absolute weed with respectable detective skills, a little book learning and a plausible manner.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the game - well, it's early days, but I'm not sure the combat is anything to write home about. It's turn- and hex-based with melee, projectiles and spells. Pretty routine. My enthusiasm will hinge on whether the necromancy component lets you do things more devious than summoning increasingly gnarly hordes.</p>
<p>I'm more compelled by the game's social intrigue aspect, which reminds me of Vampyr. The greater the quantity of skelliwags and other phantoms you hang out with, the more you risk getting into trouble with local townsfolk. There's the risk of torchlit arrest, court proceedings and even a brusque lynching for necromancers who don't keep their cadavers in check. The prologue gave me a little taste of this: an eventful meeting with Isaac Newton, who shrieked that I was an agent of the grim reaper before dropping peacefully dead of old age. You have to love the chutzpah of a game that relegates one of the Enlightenment's big beasts to the role of Scream Queen.</p>
<p>I can't promise that we'll review The Necromancer's Tale, because belts remain tight and I have yet to devise the enchantment that lets me conjure an army of skeletal staff writers. No, chatbots don't count: that's not "dark magic", just tech industry chicanery, and you can tell Bezos I said so, assuming he is not you. Still, perhaps I'll keep plugging away with this. There's the prospect of escorting a corpse to a ball, amongst other things.

            <p>Remedy has announced the content and update plan for its three-player co-op Control spinoff, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p>
<p>"It has been approximately four weeks since we launched FBC: Firebreak. During that time, we have released four patches that improve the game and partly address your feedback. Now that the game is live, our community plays a big part in shaping the future of the experience. This is just the start," Remedy has said, stating the frequency of its updates will now slow as the team gears up for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-two-major-updates-planned-for-this-year">first major update due this September</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of that September launch, though, the studio has a few points it will be focusing on in the coming months. These are: understanding the game, upgraded gunplay, new ways to play and more things to do.</p>

<p>On the 'understanding the game' front, Remedy said it wants to improve the onboarding process and playable tutorial level, with the developer admitting many players leave within the first hour out of frustration. "You feel ineffective and confused as to what to do," Remedy acknowledged. "This needs to be improved."</p>
<p>When it comes to Firebreak's gunplay, the studio wants to give more control to players as to how weapons progress, and so it will introduce a mod system down the line.</p>
<p>"We don't plan to become a game with 100 guns because we don't believe that's the right focus for our experience. That said, it's important for us to deliver on meaningful variety, so we are adding three new heavy guns to round out your arsenal," Remedy furthered.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Remedy</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Major changes to the way players access Jobs - and to the content of Jobs themselves - are also on the way to FBC: Firebreak. This will offer players "more ways to play" as well as a "more surprising and exciting way of getting there".</p>
<p>Next up for this round of communication is Remedy's 'More things to do' objective. "When we think about content variety, we aren't just looking at how much is there, but also what it's like to replay what is there," the studio said. "Always knowing what to expect is counter to the fantasy of being a crisis responder. So, while we still want you to know what type of experience you're stepping into, we want to mix up what specific things you need to do there to proceed through zones (especially zones 1 and 2), making runs a lot more dynamic and surprising."</p>
<p>With that in mind, Remedy is now looking at what randomisations it can add to the mix, including things like placement of key items and ammo stations as just two examples.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Remedy</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for that major update in September, that will bring a brand new Job for players to try out. This will, in the words of Remedy itself, require you to "identify and eliminate and hopefully not eat strains of mould" using something the team has dubbed internally as The Sushi Train.</p>
<p>"As we hope has become clear, we are pushing a lot of improvements and changes into the game for our first Major Update," Remedy said.</p>
<p>"We are extremely excited about these changes and about delivering even more than we'd originally been planning, but changes now also mean changes later. We need to see what's working for you and to hear from you again before we can be certain that we're prioritising the right things," it concluded.  "So, while we are still planning on the next major update in the winter, and the next one after that, the specific focuses and features are a lot more nebulous."</p>

<p>So he knows his stuff, then. So when the subject of the remake trilogy cropped up in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7350944750100762624/">LinkedIn</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/crash-bandicoot-remake-co-creator-jump-criticism/">Nintendo Everything</a>), we certainly took noticed. Released in 2017 and developed by Vicarious Visions (now Blizzard Albany), Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy was generally well received for its faithfulness to the original games, but according to Gavin, the developers "botched" the jump mechanics.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067irsqhl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Gavin heaps praise upon the remake trilogy, saying that it "got almost everything right" and "nailed the visuals". However, he notes that because the remakes don't implement the same control scheme in which the game would measure how long you pressed the jump button, thus adjusting the height of the jump accordingly, you're instead left with fixed-height jumps.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In my opinion (key word, opinion!), the Crash Bandicoot remake got almost everything right. Except the most important 30 milliseconds. When they remade Crash, they nailed the visuals. Looked great, faithful to the original, kept the spirit. Then they completely botched how jumping works.</p>
<p>"On the original PlayStation, we only had digital buttons - pressed or not pressed. No analog sticks. Players needed different height jumps, but we only had binary input. Most games used the amateur solution: detect button press, trigger fixed-height jump. Terrible for platforming.</p>
<p>"So we built something borderline insane. The game would detect when you pressed jump, start the animation, then continuously measure how long you held the button. As Crash rose through the air, we'd subtly adjust gravity, duration, and force based on your input. Let go early = smaller hop. Hold it down = maximum height. But it wasn't binary - I interpreted your intent across those 30-60 milliseconds and translated it into analog control using digital inputs.</p>
<p>"The remake developers either didn't notice this system or thought it wasn't important. They reverted to simple fixed jumps. Then realized Crash couldn't make half the jumps in the game. Their solution was to make all jumps maximum height. Now every jump on the remake is huge and floaty. Those precise little hops between platforms are awkward. The game's fundamental jumping mechanic feels worse than the 1996 original despite running on hardware that's 1000x more powerful.</p>
<p>"The minutiae of timing and feel matter a lot more than people realize."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So despite his praise, Gavin's criticism on the jump mechanics feels pretty damning given how vital they are to the overall feel of the games. It's quite literally the whole experience.</p>
<p>Still, the N.Sane Trilogy is pretty good fun regardless, and if you've yet to try it out on Switch, you can probably find it pretty cheap these days. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy">7/10 review</a>, we said that "despite some odd design choices it still manages to be a really enjoyable retread of some old classics".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Saber Interactive, the studio currently working on the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake, Jurassic Park Survival, and a currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">unannounced title based on a Hasbro franchise</a>, to name a few, is teasing the reveal of what appears to be another game, and fans believe it to be a Hellraiser-based horror game.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Saber posted a teaser video and a<a href="https://www.july-22-2025.com/"> URL</a> that points to next Tuesday, July 22, 2025, 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST.  Going to the website doesn't show you much, as it is just the date and time for the reveal, appearing as old VHS footage. The teaser posted to YouTube tells us a bit more, with a soundscape that views on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1m2mi55/hellraiser_game_in_development/">Reddit</a> and in the comments of the video believe point to this project potentially being a new Hellraiser game. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="👀" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMlWH3renGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Today, Saber posted another video, this time of horror-focused influencers being shown what is presumably the same trailer that we'll all get to see this coming Tuesday. Their reactions describe it as an extremely gore-y game, with one even commenting, "<em>Can you even put stuff like that in a video game?</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We'll see what Tuesday has in store, but the notion of a Hellraiser game is an interesting one. Pinhead, the iconic character from the series, was added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-update-skill-base-matchmaking/">Dead by Daylight</a> in 2021 and was removed from the game <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-pinhead-why-leaving">earlier this year</a> without a completely clear explanation. As far as dedicated Hellraiser games go, there was a Hellraiser game in development in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2354075/">1990 for the NES, set to arrive in 1991</a>, but it never made it to store shelves.</p>



<p>It could be the case that Pinhead was removed from Dead by Daylight to make way for whatever Saber Interactive has planned for Pinhead and the Hellraiser franchise. Or, Saber is teasing something entirely different, and we've all misread the signs to be Hellraiser ones. We'll find out on Tuesday.</p>

The world is getting dumber, and since the perpetuators of all this stupid shit are the ones in power, it’s growing harder to laugh at any of it, no matter how comically stupid it might be, because it’s impossible to ignore how it could all usher us into a slop-filled world where every expression of humanity is coded into an algorithm and turned into a program for someone else’s benefit. The dystopia of Night City has gone from speculative fiction to reality, and we didn’t even have to wait until 2077 to get there. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-chatgpt-psychosis-ai-robot-austin-weho-1851786563]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valve's ubiquitous PC gaming storefront, Steam, may soon experience a purging of its adult content after a significant change to its guidelines this week.</p><p>In a quiet <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update to its terms</a>, Valve has now provided that, "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult-only content" should not be published on Steam.</p><p>The move, which invites banks and similar institutions to exercise an unprecedented degree of power in the kind of content that goes up on Steam, seems to have been made to appease the payment processors that work with Valve. This tactic, while relatively new to games, has been used in the past to go after porn and sex work sites like OnlyFans.</p><p>This change to Steam's guidelines has already brought down several games from the store. In a response to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-gets-pressured-by-payment-processors-with-a-new-rule-for-game-devs-and-various-adult-games-removed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a>, Valve claimed that it was already notified of certain games violating the new standards set in place by its payment processors, saying, "As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam. We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they’d like to distribute on Steam in the future."</p><p>This shift in policy comes as multiple digital storefronts, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-eshop-looks-so-much-smoother-at-least-so-far/1100-6532069/" data-ref-id="1100-6532069">Nintendo eShop</a> and Steam, begin <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rolls-out-new-eshop-publishing-guidelines-for-switch-2-in-asia-seemingly-to-curb-spam-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cracking down</a> on a glut of content that's been dubbed "slop" of late. Many of these titles, which seem to blatantly infringe on the aesthetics and naming conventions of existing popular games and feature sexual (see: adult) content, have popped up in great number over the last several months. Many believe these games are largely made by developers capitalizing on generative AI and large-language models to quickly produce content masquerading as the games they're ripping off.</p><p>However, the language used in the update leaves many factors unclear and open to a potentially disastrous amount of interpretation. For example, it is never clarified what "kinds of adult-only content" will not be permissible on Steam now. Moreover, the updated guidelines stress that these payment processors are enforcing new rules that should be adhered, but never makes clear exactly what the new standards of these companies are.</p><p>Despite the fact that a lot of these "slop" games lead with sexual content, there are also plenty of developers making adult-only games that touch on similar subjects. Following these changes, there are now many developers at risk of being penalized or being removed from one of the largest digital gaming storefronts.</p>

			<p>While the genre has never returned to the heights of the Lucasarts and Sierra boom of the mid-90s, point and click adventure games have never gone away. Every now and again one will break through (such as Excavation of Hob’s Barrow or Kathy Rain) but a devoted community of developers and players continue to enjoy their gripping storylines and challenging puzzles. I often go back and check out recent releases and am always excited to find one that blends in my fondness of the dark and mysterious. The Drifter is a game that ticks all my boxes, ending up as a real standout entry in the genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Drifter - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2GiHlkE2z8g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Powerhoof, the devs behind The Drifter, have made the game through their own custom designed Unity point and click creation tool, called Powerquest, with the ending credits including an invocation for players to tell their own stories through this. This passion for the form really shines through in the game, which is a love letter both to gritty pulp science fiction and adventure classics. There is more here than tribute and nostalgia, though, as the quality of the writing, voice acting, and storytelling are all extremely high.</p>


<p>The opening to the game immediately strikes you with its gorgeous pixel graphics and animation, alongside the superb voice acting of the main character and narrator, Mick Carter by Adrian Vaughan. Other characters are all professionally voiced but it is Mick’s story to tell and the rough Aussie voiceover fits the style of the game to perfection. There is a grittiness to Vaughan’s acting here that elevates the story to a level of polish that is rare to see.</p>
<p>We first meet Mick stowing away aboard a freight train en route to the home he abandoned under mysterious circumstances. He is returning to attend his mother’s funeral, but it is clear that there are layers of regret and sorrow beneath his rough exterior. Immediately upon arriving at his destination, a fellow stowaway is murdered in front of him and the narrative of intrigue and terror begins.</p>


<p>The opening section (which is also in the demo if you want to get a taste of the game) sets out the broad outline of the story, introduces several characters and takes you through the familiar point and click controls. Everything is carried out through a highly intuitive graphical interface that is tailor made for either mouse or controller. I played the game through on desktop, but it is designed to work just as well on console or Steam Deck. With mouse you follow the familiar point and click whereas on controller you can scroll through interactive points which removes some of the frustration of pixel hunting or lesser accuracy of an analogue stick.</p>
<p>At the end of the first chapter, Mick has been drowned (with a clear nod to Guybrush Threepwood in both setting and a hidden achievement) and come back to life. The remainder of the game sees Mick try to find out how he has unlocked this new found ability, survive against sinister plots, and rescue those closest to him. The narrative zips along at a thrilling pace, with each chapter building and escalating to create an emotional crescendo that is surprisingly affecting. These chapters could be taken individually to give an episodic feel that would be well in keeping with the pulp thrillers that have influenced the game, but I felt compelled to binge the game in two sittings.</p>

<p>So, graphics, voice-acting, and narrative are all excellent, but what really matters with point and click adventures is the quality of the puzzles. The Drifter focuses on item-based puzzles, with dialogue furthering the story at times or revealing new areas to investigate. There are none of the overly complex dialogue trees that can prove frustrating as you repeat lines multiple times to try and find the one path that opens up new information. Instead, all conversations are clearly laid out with icons representing the subject, and these light up when they haven’t been discussed or when new information is available. This is one of the most intuitive dialogue systems I’ve seen and shows just how refined the Powerquest engine is.</p>
<p>Inventory manipulation is the main area for puzzles and you’ll pick up the traditional array of items, many of which would never fit in a real pocket. Puzzles either involve combining items to create new ones, or interacting with the environment with others. Stripped down to that basic description, this mechanic always sounds somewhat limited, but the skilful design of puzzles, alongside the ever-present threat of death (albeit with a swift return) constantly keep you on your toes. There are some memorable moments where you have to quickly react to threats to survive whilst some late game puzzles involving deliberately dying and resurrecting bring in a level of depth and time travel that reminds me of peak Day of the Tentacle (with a much darker aesthetic).</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Drifter is a new standard in point and click adventures and deserves to be spoken about in the same breath as the very best the genre has to offer. The look, sound, and feel of the game are all superb and it tells a story that never stops being thrilling. All in all, it’s an essential purchase for anybody who has even a passing interest in the genre.	</p></div>

			<p>Black Mesa, the well-known remake of the first entry in the Half-Life series developed by Crowbar Collective, looks great with modded path tracing, but it also proves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">once again</a>, how gaming hardware is still not at a point where it can run even older games with full path tracing at high resolutions without upscalers and frame generation.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the game's Remixed mod running with RTX Remix path tracing, highlighting how path tracing, alongside the other improvements featured in the mod, significantly improves visuals, but also completely tanks performance even on a powerful GPU like the RTX 5080. In the side-by-side shots at the beginning of the video, it's highlighted via a performance overlay how the game can go from running in the 200-plus FPS range without path tracing to the high 30s, low-to-mid 40s range with path tracing with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode. As such, Frame Generation becomes a necessity to run the game at higher, more playable framerates with path tracing.</p>

<p>The Black Mesa Remixed mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-remixed-poc-inbound">ModDB</a>, introduces plenty of improvements to the remake of the first Half-Life game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/">released in 2020</a>. It relights the inbound train ride and parts of the laboratory, and introduces five new meshes including 2K and 4K textures, 10 new meshes that were only present as texture in the original game, 40 to 50 very high quality materials built from the ground up and around 100 materials created from the original colormap using a mixture of techniques and workflows. As such, the mod is worth trying out even without path tracing to experience a small portion of the Half-Life remake like never before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-realityv-ray-tracing-improvements/">Grand Theft Auto V</a> was initially released on September 17, 2013, and will have officially been out for 12 years this coming September. For hundreds of millions of people around the world, it's been a game they played countless times, or at least have had access to through legal means for the last dozen years. Unless you've spent the last 12 years of your life living in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and didn't try to obtain the game through any under-the-counter means, in which case, Grand Theft Auto V is a brand new release for you in 2025. </p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online are now available in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and as <a href="https://nikopartners.com/grand-theft-approval-a-turning-point-for-mena-game-regulations/">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad reports</a>, both titles being approved for launch in the regions is a "<em>turning point for MENA game regulations</em>."</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto V getting approval for launch in Saudi Arabia and the UAE also marks the introduction of a new age rating in the region, with the General Authority for Media Regulation in Saudi Arabia and the UAE Media Council introducing a 21+ rating. Grand Theft Auto isn't the only series that hasn't had major releases in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. </p>



<p>The regulatory boards in both regions have previously blocked games based on restrictions that for ratings boards like the ESRB or PEGI would fall under M for Mature/PEGI 18+. The introduction of this new age rating, as Ahmad points out, is what potentially opens the door for those titles that would've previously not made it through. Particularly because under this new rating, Grand Theft Auto V is being allowed to launch "<em>without any major modification</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This is a positive signal for the industry as it potentially allows games to be approved without edits, thereby offering publishers a viable path to market for games that would normally be blocked</em>," Ahmad writes.</p>



<p>So while GTA V and GTA Online getting approval isn't the most significant thing on its own, especially because GTA V has still circulated in the region through unofficial means in the last decade, this new age rating is the thing that has the power to have a drastic impact on the video game industry in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and the rest of the globe. </p>

            <p>If you're sick of being tag-teamed by Gaping Jaw &amp; Darkdrift Knight, then I bring good news. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s next wave of enhanced bosses have now successfully RSVPed to the big darkness party. They'll be arriving when the next cycle begins on July 31st.</p>
<p>Sure, that was the most logical point for a fresh rotation, given it's when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surprise-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-enhanced-boss-has-arrived-kicking-off-weekly-big-baddie-visits">established lot of Everdark Nightlord duos</a> were set to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-hero-for-our-times-elden-ring-nightreign-boss-becomes-unbeatable-by-refusing-to-show-up">disappear</a>. Though, for whatever reason, FromSoft haven't fully committed to a date until now. One can only assume the Equilibrious Beast was busy polishing its horns.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, as the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s about rolling around the big lad until one of you expires have just tweeted, the enhanced versions of Tricephalos, Augur, Fissure in the Fog, and the goat-headed beast I just mentioned will be arriving as part of a cycle starting on the final day of this month.</p>
<p>So, they're really August bosses, but they're doing you a favour and rocking up to the party before the first of the month. Early boss gets to slap up the worm with an underwhelming build, I guess.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The veil thins, and the Night hungers still.</p><p>On July 31, 2025, a new Everdark cycle shall begin; the enhanced Nightlords Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will soon unleash their darkest powers upon Limveld.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> <a href="https://t.co/IN71Mm53ux">pic.twitter.com/IN71Mm53ux</a></p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1946208540416168293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If they follow the same cadence established by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-latest-elden-ring-nightreign-enhanced-boss-is-plenty-tough-enough-without-the-everdark-treatment">first wave</a> of Everdark Sovereigns, you can expect three weeks of one new boss invading at a time, then three weeks when you can take them in pairs. Is that enough to keep you Nightreigning without some more juicy additions, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">already confirmed duos mode</a>, currently in sight?</p>
<p>Well, if you're desperate for ways to spice things up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-inevitable-randomiser-mod-is-here-to-spice-up-your-runs-with-extra-funky-map-scrambling">a randomiser mod for Nightreign</a> came out earlier this week. Nothing like taking your chances with a map structure that may or may not be balanced, eh? Maybe blindfold and truss yourself up like Hannibal Lecter too. Can't make thing easy by being able to see or touch things as you try to beat the bosses, can we?</p>
<p>Better plug up your nose as well. No hunting bosses by smell unless you want the FromSoft lot sniggering at the amount of training wheels you're running with.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-enhanced-boss-wave-crashes-against-the-shores-of-frustration-at-the-end-of-this-month]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Peter Connelly, the video game composer and sound designer on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-starring-lara-croft/user-reviews/2200-12865716/" data-ref-id="2200-12865716">Tomb Raider Remaster series</a> and Tomb Raider: Chronicles, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for fraudulently applying for a government COVID-19 support loan. Based in Peterlee, County Durham, Connelly obtained a second Bounce Back Loan (BBL) of £37,500 (approximately $55,000) in June 2020 by greatly overstating his company's turnover. This was in direct violation of the loan rules, which only permitted one loan per business. He had already secured a legitimate loan of £22,000 the previous month.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Insovlency Service</a>, Connelly claimed his company had a 2019 turnover of £150,000 when, in reality, it had earned just over £58,000. Additionally, he falsely claimed that he had not previously applied for a BBL. His actions led to a criminal investigation by the Insolvency Service, the body responsible for monitoring misuse of the COVID loans.</p><p>At a hearing this week, Connelly was sentenced not only to prison but also disqualified from serving as a company director for six years. The Insolvency Service emphasized the seriousness of his fraud, noting that this sort of loan was created to support struggling small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, not to be exploited for personal gain. Chief Investigator David Snasdell condemned Connelly’s "blatant disregard" for the rules.</p><p>In his defense, Connelly stated that he had undertaken financial risks to work on a high-profile project involving the reimagining of the Tomb Raider soundtrack. He claimed to have sold his car and taken out personal loans in anticipation of the project's success, which he also claimed was sidelined by the pandemic. However, the court ruled that his financial mismanagement did not excuse committing fraud.</p><p>His company, Peter Connelly Limited, entered liquidation in August 2021, with neither of the two loans repaid. In June 2022, Connelly entered into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), agreeing to repay his debts through regular payments to an insolvency agency.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After years of discussion of collaboration between Ubisoft and Netflix, today we got official confirmation that a live-action Assassin's Creed series has been greelit at Netflix. Robert Patino (<em>Westworld</em>, <em>DMZ</em>) and David Wiener (<em>Halo</em>, <em>Fear The Walking Dead</em>) will lead the project as co-creators, showrunners, and executive producers. Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, and Matt O'Toole will also serve as executive producers.</p><p>If this news sounds familiar, you're not imagining things. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/10/27/netflix-reveals-live-action-assassins-creed-series">2020, Netflix announced the show,</a> led at the time by executive producers Jason Altman and Danielle Kreinik. Then, in June 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/06/15/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-series-lands-writer-from-die-hard">we learned the project would be led by showrunner Jeb Stuart</a>, but by January of the next year,&nbsp;<a href="https://collider.com/assassins-creed-series-showrunner-jeb-stuart-departure-comments/">Stuart had left the project</a>, according to&nbsp;Collider.&nbsp;</p><p>The show was not canceled, however, and this new duo of showrunners is seemingly its latest form. Now that the show has been greenlit, it can formally move from development into production and is more likely to actually come out.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1k6HqBK1TRo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1k6HqBK1TRo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Assassin's Creed series is known for its detailed historical settings, typically focusing on major cities at pivotal moments in history. We don't know exactly when or where this live-action series will be set, but according to a description provided on Ubisoft's news page, it might take place at several time periods.</p><p>The description reads, "The Assassin's Creed live-action series is a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions: one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, the other fighting to preserve free will. The series follows characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny."</p><p>Later in the announcement, a joint statement from showrunners Patino and Wiener communicates their feelings on the games as they begin developing the show. "Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story - about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith," they write. "It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it's about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break."</p><p>For more on live-action video game adaptations,&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/16/nintendo-reveals-link-and-zelda-actors-for-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie">see who was cast as Link and Zelda in the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/18/netflix-greenlights-live-action-assassins-creed-series-led-by-westworld-halo-producers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Focus Entertainment and developer Hutlihut Games have announced that their co-op space action game Void Crew is coming out for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on 4th September 2025.</p>
<p>New console players will join the existing PC-based community, which grew through early access and the full game’s launch back in November 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Console Release Date Trailer [Void Crew]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hcwJCbd_PQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Void Crew sneds you off into the depths of METEM space to fight back against the HOLLOW alien enemy that is invading. With crews of 1-6 players, you will take on specific roles within the ship as Pilot, Gunner, Engineer, and Scavenger, running around the 3D environment to man stations, perform tasks and generally work together to try and push back the enemy. There will be job like hopping onto cannons, of course, but also planning out your moves at a shared table, going on space walks to patch up the hull, making internal repairs, flipping internal controls, and more.</p>
<p>As you progress from objective to objective, you’ll expand your ship’s loadout, taking the opportunity to customise and upgrade your ship, hopefully improving your survivability for when you wind up in space battles with swarms of enemies and huge bosses. It’s a roguelite, though, so expect to fail a good few times and have to start all over from the beginning.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Nintendo first announced the Switch 2’s slate of launch titles, people were very <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lcz0a4/why_is_the_switch_2_selling_so_well_it_seems/">quick to cry foul</a> about how few original, exclusive games the company had lined up for its latest console. There were ports from other systems and updated versions of original Switch games. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> was the Switch 2’s only major new exclusive title, which, for some, put a further damper on a launch that was already mired in confusion about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/650982/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-price-fair">pricing</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644803/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-trade-borrow-resell">game key cards</a>.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685142/nintendo-switch-2-3-5-million-sold">the Switch 2’s sales</a> disproved that pessimistic read, the system’s relatively thin selection of exclusives has <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-hype-pre-order-special-compared/">continued to be a talking point</a> in the ongoing discourse about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/611518/one-month-analysis-hype">whether the overall launch was exciting enough</a>. But after a month of the Switch 2 being on the market, what do you know — there just so happens to be a new game for it out this week. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>’s arrival isn’t at all a surprise because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo told everyone exactly when it would be available</a>. Being made to wait a bit might have rubbed some folks the wrong way, but in a world where we <em>all</em> have a back catalog of games that we’ve yet to finish (or even start in some cases), a measured release schedule kind of feels like a good thing.</p><p>Back in April when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">Nintendo first announced all of the Switch 2 games</a> slated to come out through the end of 2025, you could see that the company was loosely following a monthly release schedule for its new exclusives. June would go to <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>. And <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>would drop in July amid the releases of a couple Switch 2 editions of older games. At the time, Nintendo said that <em>Drag x Drive </em>would debut at some point in “the summer,” but it has since pegged the game to a firm August 14th release date.</p><p>Currently, there’s nothing on the docket for September, but the month could easily go to <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, which is supposed to come out this year. And after <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>’s release in October, the “winter” will belong to <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> (and maybe <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, which is also due out sometime in 2025).</p><p>Looking at Nintendo’s roadmap for the rest of the year, it feels as if the company is trying to pace things in a way that gives people time to really sit with and enjoy its exclusives. For every hardcore gamer who prides themself on speeding through a title and being the first to uncover or unlock all of its surprises, there are far more casuals who prefer taking their time. Nintendo could have opted to flood the zone with more exclusives from the jump — a move that probably would have made the Switch 2’s launch seem like a splashier beat in <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">the console wars’ twilight hours</a>. But by spacing things out, the company is guaranteeing that there will be a steady stream of new stuff for people to dig into, and giving people ample time to decide if they’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">willing to pay the games’ higher prices</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 is Nintendo’s new flagship, which is to say it’s not going away anytime soon and there will be plenty more games for it in due time. Had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> dropped alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, neither game would have been able to take up so much space and command attention they way they could with some distance between them. Releasing new titles at a steady pace was a major part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">Nintendo’s vision for the original Switch</a>, and that strategy paid off through the console’s life cycle. Now it looks like Nintendo’s sticking to its guns, and the Switch 2 will probably be better off for it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule]]></content:encoded>
