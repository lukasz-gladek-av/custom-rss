            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-cyberpunk-2077-update-includes-free-copy-of-cyberpunk-red-easy-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> includes a hidden treat for those interested in the tabletop experience. With a bit of digging, players can find a copy of <em>Cyberpunk Red: Easy Mode</em>, giving them a small taste of the latest version of the foundational TTRPG.</p>



<p>In a recent report <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/500301/cyberpunk-2077-red-easy-mode-ttrpg-pdf-how-to-get" rel="nofollow">by Polygon</a>, a spokesperson from R. Talsorian Games stated that anyone who owns a copy <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and can access their Bonus Content folder will find a PDF of <em>Cyberpunk Red: Easy Mode</em>.</p>

For those playing on console, the PDF should be available through the Digital Goodies folder via the GOG account linked to your game.</p>

<p><em>Cyberpunk Red: Easy Mode</em> contains the quickstart rules for the latest version of Mike Pondsmith's iconic TTRPG set in the dark future. It contains an abridged version of the core rules, an introductory mission, and five pre-made characters for players embody: Rockerboy, Solo, Tech, Medtech, and Media. A great entry point for those interested in the hobby.</p>

It's still set in the capitalist dystopia that is Night City, but in The Time of the Red, the literal nuclear fallout of a terrorist attack that devastated Arasaka Tower. Everyone still needs to deal with corpo scum, cyberpsychos, and brutal cops, but they also need to navigate dangerous storms and suffocating radiation.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> recognized its tabletop foundations. The Bonus Content in the game includes a PDF of the Cyberpunk 2020 Core Rulebook.</p>

<p>This is the second edition of the foundational TTRPG released in 1990. It contains crucial elements of lore such as the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War, and is a snapshot of the game's design ethos of the era..</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Evil Geniuses has officially signed Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker and Jacob “icy” Lange to its VALORANT roster today. The two players will join the returning trio Derrek “Derrek” Ha, Nicholas “NaturE” Garrison and Phat “Supamen” Le.</p>



<p>While EG took a step back in 2024 after its 2023 world championship, the organization has now brought in a player once recently regarded as VALORANT’s best duelist.</p>



<h2 id="h-someone-cooked-here">Someone Cooked Here</h2>



<p>The addition of icy was announced earlier in the day. icy played for G2 during the 2024 season, helping the roster core that qualified through Ascension reach the playoffs of Champions 2024. Coincidentally, icy was dropped this offseason in favor of the last remaining EG player from their Champions 2023 run, Alexander “jawgemo” Mor. Icy was also on the EG reserve roster in 2023.</p>



<p>Yay competed as a stand-in for Evil Geniuses during this offseason at the Sen City Classic. EG also competed with Tyler “sym” Porter at that event, though he returned to TSM in Challengers. At the Sen City Classic, yay said that things were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/CKpt1TkoC4I?si=tnZdxweO5h2ZVTnh&amp;t=14055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“clicking right away”</a> as soon as he started playing with EG.</p>



<p>With icy arriving alongside him, yay will  not take on the primary duelist role he was once famous for. Following the 2022 season, in which yay established himself as a world-class duelist player for OpTic, yay was highly sought after by all the partnered teams. He would land with Cloud9, but nothing went his way over the next two years. He quickly departed C9, had a dismal run with Disguised in NA Challengers, then found himself in the Pacific league with BLEED in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BLEED was <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/status/1842063072111792589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed</a> from the VALORANT Champions Tour by Riot completely, due to “failure to comply with critical reporting requirements and other key obligations under the TPA.” This was part of a much larger story at BLEED involving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bleed-esports-rainbow-six-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged missed payments and the CEO’s legal troubles</a>.</p>



<p>Did Evil Geniuses put together a winning lineup with yay and icy? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">The Amazon Luna cloud-streaming service is an awesome choice for anyone who wants to game without the need for expensive consoles or gaming PCs. If you've recently joined the service, we've put together this guide filled with tips to optimize your experience, as well as game recommendations to check out.</p><p dir="ltr">Before diving in, if you're new to Amazon Luna or need a refresher on how to sign up, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-luna-cloud-game-streaming-overview-benefits-subscription-cost-compatible-devices/1100-6528079/" data-ref-id="1100-6528079">our previous guide</a> that explains what Amazon Luna is and how to use it. Now, let's explore how to enhance your cloud-gaming sessions and highlight our recommendation of must-play titles on Amazon Luna.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 1: Invest in a Luna Controller</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418510-lunacontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418510" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418510-lunacontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418510"></a><figcaption>Luna controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418510-lunacontroller.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Our first and biggest tip is to purchase and use an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Luna controller</a>. While you can use other controllers or your phone, the Luna Controller is designed for cloud gaming with its direct Wi-Fi connection, making it easy to switch between devices. It also supports Bluetooth and USB, includes Amazon Alexa, and even works with Steam. If you're serious about Luna gaming, the investment is worthwhile. Luckily, you can save big on the Amazon Luna Controller right now. The controller is available by itself for just $45 (was $70), or in discounted bundles that include the controller and an Amazon Fire TV Stick streaming device. Check out all the deals below.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Luna controller deals at Amazon:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Luna Controller</a> -- $45 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Bundle-including-streaming-Controller/dp/B0CLPDXQ8Z?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Luna Controller Bundle</a> -- $80 (<del>$130</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stick-Controller-Cloud-gaming-bundle/dp/B0DK64GFKX?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K and Luna Controller Bundle</a> -- $68 (<del>$120</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Bundle-including-streaming-Controller/dp/B0CLPDXQ8Z?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire TV Stick HD and Luna Controller Bundle</a> -- $60 (<del>$105</del>)</li></ul><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 2: </strong><strong>Connect your Luna Controller to Wi-Fi</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, the Wi-Fi direct connection on the Luna controller offers lower latency compared to Bluetooth. While the controller supports 2.4 and 5GHz Wi-Fi connections, it's best to connect with 5GHz if possible for the best possible performance.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 3: Optimize Your Amazon Luna Connection</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">For a smooth 1080p gameplay experience, Amazon recommends an internet speed of at least 10 Mbps, and you can optimize your connection by changing a few settings.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Use a wired Ethernet connection when possible.</li><li dir="ltr">Disable VPNs</li><li dir="ltr">If you're playing via Google Chrome, enable hardware acceleration by typing “<strong>chrome://settings/?search=hardware</strong>” in the address bar and toggling the option on.</li><li dir="ltr">Disable location services while playing on Fire tablets and macOS to avoid performance issues.</li><li dir="ltr">Adjust in-game resolution/graphics settings as needed. Note that some games may not save these settings after exiting, so you may need to tweak them each time to you play.</li><li dir="ltr">If you still experience buffering or lag while playing, reduce the resolution to 720p, which requires only 5 Mbps. You'll find this setting in the Luna app under <strong>Settings &gt; Audio &amp; Video Quality.</strong></li></ul><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 4: Use your phone as a controller</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Since Luna is a cloud-streaming service, you can access your games on a wide variety of devices at virtually any time, as long as you're connected to the internet. One of the most convenient options is with your iOS or Android smartphone. You can pair a Luna controller or other Luna-compatible Bluetooth controller to your phone and play that way, but you can also use the phone itself as a controller thanks to Luna's virtual on-screen controls, which adds a d-pad, thumbsticks, face buttons, and triggers to your phone's screen.</p><p dir="ltr">While this lets you play and control the action all on one screen, you can also connect your phone to the same network as your main Luna streaming device and use your phone as a controller while playing on a TV, computer, or other external display. If you sign in to both devices with the same Luna account, you can quickly and easily sync them up. Guests can even join your gameplay using their phones via the Luna Controller app, making this a simple solution for local multiplayer, though they'll need your Amazon credentials.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 5: Play online with friends without a Luna subscription</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Speaking of multiplayer on Luna, the Luna Couch feature allows you to play with others online without them needing a Luna subscription. The only requirements are that they have an Amazon account and a supported controller.</p><p dir="ltr">To do this, select Couch from the Luna interface, pick a game, and start a Luna Couch session. Share the provided code with others, who then use the Luna Couch website to join your game.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 6: Broadcasting Games to Twitch</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418511-014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418511" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418511-014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418511"></a><figcaption>You can stream live to Twitch directly from Luna</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418511-014.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Amazon owning Twitch, Luna integrates seamlessly with Twitch, making is super easy to stream your gameplay to viewers. Here's how it works:</p><ol><li dir="ltr">Select the Broadcast button in the Luna app's navigation bar. <strong>For Fire TV and Fire tablet:</strong> Scan the QR code using your mobile phone. Use your phone to set up your stream and broadcast audio and video.</li><li dir="ltr">Select Setup broadcast to open a new browser window.</li><li dir="ltr">In the broadcast setup window, configure your Twitch stream to enable or disable audio and webcam input.</li><li dir="ltr">Select <strong>"Start live broadcast" </strong>to begin sharing your audio and webcam on Twitch.</li><li dir="ltr">Return to the Luna app and start a game. A separate window will pop up, allowing you to manage your stream. This window includes controls to enable or disable your audio and webcam feeds, as well as options to stop or pause the broadcast at any time. Keep this window open while you broadcast.</li></ol><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What to play On Amazon Luna</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418512-015.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418512" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418512-015.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418512"></a><figcaption>Amazon Luna has dozens of great games to play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418512-015.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So now that we've covered some helpful tips and cool features, let's go over the most important part: what to play.</p><p dir="ltr">We've put together a few lists of suggestions based on various genres and popular series in the following slides. Note that our picks are all available in the core Luna+ and/or Amazon Prime libraries accessible as part of your subscription. We included several standout titles in each genre, but there's plenty more to play than what we've listed. Beyond Luna+, there are also various add-on channels and other storefronts you can sync to Luna if you want to add even more games to your Luna library. Check our Amazon Luna overview for more information. For now, let's look at some of our recommendations for what to play on Luna+.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Fallout Games (Amazon Prime)</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418484-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418484" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418484-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418484"></a><figcaption>Fallout 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418484-001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If Amazon's Fallout Prime Video series has you curious about the games it's based on, you're in luck, as two of the best games in the franchise are available to stream on Luna. While they look and play similarly at a glance, <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/game/fallout-3-game-of-the-year-edition/B0CWDRMZDF?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Fallout 3</strong></a> and <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/game/fallout-new-vegas-ultimate-edition/B0CW16SB1M?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong></a> offer different takes on the open-world RPG formula. Fallout 3 is perfect for exploring the nuclear wasteland and crafting your own adventure, whereas Fallout: New Vegas is packed with some of the best bespoke storylines the series has ever seen. Either way, both will satisfy cravings for post-apocalyptic adventuring. Note that unlike the other titles covered in the post, the Fallout games require an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime subscription</a> to play. </p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>More RPGs (Luna+)</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418994-017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418994" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418994-017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418994"></a><figcaption>Mortal Shell</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418994-017.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna is stacked with plenty of other excellent RPGs of all styles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-wont-get-crazy-with-cross-overs-for-fallout-tv-season-2-the-devs-wont-overdo-it/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's no doubt that Fallout 76 <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-now-free-to-grab-on-prime-gaming-for-pc-and-xbox-franchise-sees-player-boost-following-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a major boost in its player base following the smashing success of Fallout's TV debut on Amazon Prime Video. While previous installments in the franchise also registered significant upticks in player activity, Fallout 76 is the only game still running and being updated, and it also received a few nifty cross-over items like the Ghoul's outfit, inspired by fan-favorite TV show character Cooper Howard (played by Walton Goggins). Now, on the heels of the Ghoul craze, the studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-experience-detailed-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about to add playable Ghouls</a> for the first time in the franchise.</p>
<p>With all this excitement, no wonder, then, that it quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-passes-20-million-players-milestone-bethesda-is-planning-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the 20 million player milestone and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-reaches-21-million-players-asks-for-labor-of-love-nominations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> 21 million only a few months later. With the show's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second season</a> now in full production, the question is, can fans expect a bigger cross-over event?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-76-lead-producer-of-fallout-show-season-two-crossovers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to VG247</a>, Fallout 76 Lead Producer Bill LaCoste replied that that's probably not going to be the case, as the team doesn't want to go all-in on fan service with the risk of overdoing it.</p>
<p><i>I would imagine it would probably be along the same lines because we have an appreciation for the TV show, the story it’s trying to tell, and the characters it's trying to portray, and we also have an appreciation for the story Fallout 76 is trying to tell.</i></p>
<p><em>So, very, very limited amounts of crossover, where it actually makes sense because, again, we're on extreme ends of the Fallout timeline as well. So, some of that crossover doesn't make sense. We just want to make sure that it's done in a way that is supportive of the TV show, but also allows us to just coexist within this story overall that's being told.</em></p>
<p><em>We probably won't go out of our way to add a whole bunch of stuff specific to the show because we don't feel like we need to. We feel like it's great to let the TV show do its thing and for people to love the TV show for what it is, but also love our game for what it is, and not just give fan service for just the sake of doing it. We'll do some things that make sense, the Vault 33 suit made sense, it's something that exists in the world and you can have it, but yeah, we'll probably keep that relatively light would be my guess.</em></p>
<p>On paper, it sounds like the right choice. While fan service is generally appreciated by gamers, it can easily backfire. For now, though, the Fallout 76 community is very excited about the future following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleaming Depths update</a> and the upcoming debut of playable Ghouls.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-everything-you-need-to-know-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We're only weeks away from the February 4 release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and you may still find yourself a bit lost as to what all the fuss is about. All month long, we've been covering different aspects of this medieval action RPG in detail as part of IGN First. But let's not get too ahead of ourselves. This digital treatise is here to cover all the basics, and tell you where you can go next to find out more about any given topic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What is Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put it as simply as possible, it's a first-person, open-world action RPG based on real medieval history, and the very direct sequel to 2018's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/17/kingdom-come-deliverance-review"><u>Kingdom Come: Deliverance, which I gave an 8/10</u></a>. You play as Henry, a young villager who lost his home and his parents to the ravages of war. While exploring the open countryside, you'll use stealth, persuasion, and swordplay to overcome your enemies and complete diverse side quests that generally have multiple endings.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The real highlight for me is the combat system, which is based on real European martial arts and looks to evolve and streamline the mechanics of the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance. It's highly technical and skill-centric, but it doesn't require amazing twitch reflexes. Attacking from one of four cardinal directions, timing parries and counters, and a combo system similar to fighting games that rely on a specific sequence of directional inputs, are at the heart of it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>KCD2 is making an effort to help new players get up to snuff. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It may sound intimidating, but KCD2 is making an effort to help new players get up to snuff. You can check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-developers-share-8-tips-for-survival-ign-first"><u>developer-aided survival tips</u></a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-evolves-its-combat"><u>an explanation of how combat has evolved from the first game</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What is the setting of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The year is 1403, right in the middle of what are often called the Late Middle Ages. The venue is central Bohemia, in the vicinity of Prague, and what is today the heart of the modern Czech Republic. It's been about 50 years since the Black Plague – recent enough that there are still people alive who remember it – and 50 years before the fall of Constantinople. Europe, including Bohemia, is watching one age coming to a close and a new one just starting to take shape.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While KCD presents a fictional and dramatized version of history – many of its characters are based on historical ones, but their actions and personalities have been tweaked and embellished – it doesn't contain any outright fantasy elements. No trolls, dragons, or magic – although the people living at the time certainly believed in them. You can do alchemy, which is the one place where this series feels the most like a fantasy RPG. I'm not aware of any herbs or nectars that can make you better at sword fighting. But even these require you to pick real plants and cook them up using period-accurate technology.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>No trolls, dragons, or magic – although the people living at the time certainly believed in them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To be more specific, KCD2 picks up almost immediately where the first game left off. Which brings us to our next question…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do I need to play the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance before I play the sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, not really. It's kind of a soft reset in terms of your character progression, and it will introduce you to all of its systems as if you've never touched them before. The extended intro sequence even catches you up to speed on the events of the first game, which aren't overly intricate. If you want to see for yourself and decide if you need more context, you can watch our <u>first 43 minutes of gameplay</u>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I certainly wouldn't discourage you from playing the first one, though. I replayed it earlier this year and found that it holds up really well. Some of the technical issues that were present during my original review have even been fixed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Who are the major characters in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, well, well… we happened to put together <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-meet-the-medieval-cast-ign-first"><u>a whole article about the major characters</u></a>. But to put it simply: You play as Henry, a young man who has gone from some random nobody to a trusted retainer in the service of Sir Radzig Kobyla. Kobyla and his buddies support King Wenceslaus IV, who has been kidnapped by Wenceslaus' half-brother, the pretender Sigismund. Our pal Sigismund has been riding around the country dealing harshly with anyone he sees as a supporter of Wenceslaus, including burning down Henry's hometown and killing his parents.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Henry is part of the conspiracy to free Wenceslaus and restore him to the throne. At the start of KCD2, he's off on the road with his spoiled, womanizing best "friend," Sir Hans Capon, to try and figure out who else among the nobility is willing to help the cause. The two young men frequently butt heads, since Henry was raised as a commoner and sees Hans as sort of stuck-up man-child, and Hans feels Henry doesn't treat him with the respect a noble deserves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>When is Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 coming out?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">February 4, 2024 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5. The original also received a Switch port earlier this year, six years after the original release, but we don't know yet whether or not the sequel might eventually be on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What about the PC system requirements?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Steam page recommends a Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32 GB RAM, and a GeForce RTX 4070 or Radeon RX 7800 XT. Thankfully, from what I've played, it's <em>much</em> better optimized than the first game, which I still can't play on max settings to this day even with a rig that meets all of the recommended specs for KCD2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you pet the dog?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes! Your trusty Mutt can even help you out in combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Anything else I should know?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The devs were nice enough to highlight <u>8 Little Things Not to Miss in KCD2</u> for us. If you want to hear my in-depth impressions of the 12+ hours I've played so far, you can check out <u>my hands-on preview</u>. We also got <u>a guided in-game tour of Kuttenburg, the biggest city Warhorse has ever created</u>. It's mostly based on a real city that's still standing, too, and we also got to go walk around it in real life! So take a peek at our <u>comparison of in-game and real-world locations</u>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't prepare you for everything. The forests of 1403 Bohemia are vast and full of surprises. But at least now you have some idea of what you're dealing with.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-creator-of-garrys-mod-to-sue-over-skibidi-toilet-in-fortnite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Please stop telling me."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Skibidi Toilet in Fortnite. This most internet of crossovers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-true-horror-of-fortnites-skibidi-toilet-crossover-is-finally-revealed">has sparked as much confusion as it has delight</a>. But what does Garry Newman, creator of Garry’s Mod, think about it all?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background. Why would people care what Newman thinks about Skibidi Toilet? Well, Skibidi Toilet is a series of web shorts created by Alxey Gerasimov using Source Filmmaker, Valve’s 3D computer graphics software. Some assets used in the series are taken from video games such as Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source, which form the basis of Garry's Mod's physics sandbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some had wondered whether Newman himself might have taken issue with Fortnite’s Skibidi Toilet bundle. But Newman made his stance on the issue crystal clear: he really doesn’t care at all. Not only that, but he has no interest in a lawsuit, as some have said he should consider. And when you think about it, that makes a lot of sense given the 25 million-selling Garry’s Mod wouldn't exist were it not for Valve’s Half-Life 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm 42, I don't care if Fortnite added a skibidi toilet, please stop telling me,” <a href="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1870102165315801410" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newman tweeted</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not gonna sue," <a href="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1870121903819526487" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he added in another tweet</a>. "Basic logic should tell you this. I don't have any basis, want or need. I don't have ownership to any of it. I didn't make hl2, I didn't make any toilet models, I didn't make sfm, I didn't make any of these videos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Plus I'm lazy af, he could be using a photo of me on the toilet and it wouldn't outweigh how much I can't be bothered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Newman has distanced himself from the issue, it does raise questions about who actually owns Skibidi Toilet. Is it Valve, creator of Half-Life 2 and the assets Gerasimov used to make the Skibidi Toilet shorts? Is it Gerasimov himself? Is it someone else?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Newman said the “Skibidi Toilet guys” had hit him with a DMCA in a wild bit of litigious irony. But soon after, an account purporting to be Gerasimov insisted he wasn’t behind the claim, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-modskibidi-toilet-dmca-claim-has-been-resolved-creator-garry-newman-says"><u>Newman then told IGN that the matter had been “resolved.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The copyright holder the DMCA letter was attributed to was <a href="https://inviz.tv/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invisible Narratives</u></a>, the film and TV production studio that’s partnering with Michael Bay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay"><u>on a Skibidi Toilet film</u></a>. The letter cited Skibidi Toilet characters Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, and Titan TV Man, saying they were "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand." Sure enough, <a href="https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search%5FArg=Titan%20Cameraman&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=Gr6jPAL716R1MnV450HxzbpYaFF0b&amp;SEQ=20240730153403&amp;SID=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a public catalog search reveals</u></a> that Invisible Narratives had indeed claimed a copyright for Titan Cameraman and three other unpublished works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The letter added that “significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere." The irony was not lost on Newman, who declared: “can you believe the cheek?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-mod-removing-all-nintendo-content-from-steam-workshop-after-takedown-request"><u>Facepunch removed all Nintendo-related content on Garry's Mod</u></a> - what amounted to 20 years of uploads - from Steam Workshop after receiving a takedown request from Nintendo. Newman is currently working on a successor to Garry's Mod called S&amp;box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>As sports leagues move forward, trying to find new and engaging ways to entertain viewers is one of the biggest tasks at hand. Ratings are down for most broadcasts, and people are consuming their live sports through different means. To help bring more viewers in and give them a different experience, the NFL, NBC and EA Sports are partnering up for the first ever Madden NFL Cast on December 21.</p>



<p>Airing exclusively on Peacock on Saturday, the Madden NFL Cast features the Houston Texans against the Kansas City Chiefs. While it’ll be the actual game, the broadcast will feature Madden-like graphics to give it that video game feel.</p>



<p>For Vice President of Gaming at the NFL Ed Kiang, this broadcast has been a long-time coming for the league.</p>



<p>“This is something that us and EA have really been interested in trying to pursue for a really long time,” Kiang told Insider Gaming. “For a variety of reasons, there were challenges getting it all to come together the way we would have wanted.</p>



<p>“The time finally felt right with NBC looking to create their first sports altcast and new developments from Genius Sports on the underlying tech which helped bring the vision to reality in a way that we couldn’t before.”</p>



<p>The Madden NFL Cast won’t be the first foray into alternative broadcasts for the NFL. The league has done broadcasts featuring characters from Toy Story and The Simpsons in the past. The big difference with this, however, is that instead of using generated characters, it’ll be the actual players and game on the field.</p>



<p>Kiang says by using the actual game for the broadcast, it allows for better breakdowns of the strategies and intricacies that go into an NFL game on the field.</p>



<p>“It gives that really interesting and immersive viewing experience that speaks to different ends of the spectrum of our fanbase that I think everyone can kind of enjoy and get something out of,” Kiang said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite using the real game, the goal of the broadcast is to make it feel like a game of Madden is happening. To do that, the Madden NFL Cast will feature route trails, player and X-Factor icons, play selection screens, player ratings, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even the broadcast camera will have a Madden feel as it will use the All-22 camera angle that is default in Madden games as the primary angle viewers see. Pair that with the analysis of former players Chad Ochocinco and Kury Benkert, and it starts to bring what the NFL envisioned to life.</p>



<p>“That all creates this great immersive Madden experience, which I think avid Madden players are going appreciate,” Kiang explained. “On the other end of the spectrum, we knew we also wanted the broadcast to be accessible to casual viewers but I don’t think I had anticipated how much the Madden overlays combined with the commentator analysis could help connect the dots for casual viewers in such a fun and visual way.”</p>



<p>To lead up to the broadcast on December 21, the team held two rehearsals with live games to build the chemistry, test the technology, and make sure everything can go smoothly. Seeing how everything worked during the test run left Kiang excited about what fans will see during the live show.</p>



<p>“I was blown away,” he said. “I’m not as close to how normal broadcast production comes together, but I was pretty blown away at how quickly everyone kind of came together and how smoothly everything’s gone so far. It’s a massive undertaking.”</p>



<p>While there’s nothing set in stone just yet, the hope for the league is that there will be more Madden-style NFL broadcasts in the future as the technology and abilities improve.</p>



<p>“As a league, we love the alternative broadcasts, and it just makes a ton of sense to continue to enhance them for the future,” Kiang said.</p>



<p>The Madden NFL Cast airs at 1pm ET on Peacock.</p>

		<p>In a lot of ways it’s easier than ever to make an incredible looking game, thanks in no small part to the broad accessibility of Unreal Engine 5 to developers across the whole industry, and the technical baseline that the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S console provide.</p>
<p>But visual design isn’t just about how many pixels you can throw around the screen, how many polygons you can zoom in on or how realistic everything can look. There’s absolutely a place for that – especially when you can apply it in new and unusual ways – but it’s also so important to have an individualistic streak and a real artistry to make a game stand out from the hyper realistic crowds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor Refantazio</a> is the story of a boy who wants to build a fairytale world, but that means something rather different when he lives in a world of high fantasy. When his world already features a tribal caste system, where certain races have bat and dog physiologies, demon horns and angel wings, and institutional racism sees the more human-like tribes rising to the top, his dreams look much more mundane to our eye.</p>
<p>It all stems from a book&nbsp;that describes our modern world. Effectively, our version of a fairytale world has characters who dream of ours.</p>

<p>All of this takes a stunning visual design, with the book pages painting themselves in monochromatic watercolour as the story unfolds. This contrasts beautifully with the colourful and highly saturated overworld.&nbsp;And that’s before considering the anime sections or the ridiculous pedigree at this studio, with accolades from Persona to Neon Genesis Evangelion.</p>
<p>The mix of styles and stylisation come together beautifully in Metaphor, which has an incredible story of coming together and overthrowing a corrupt and racist regime that runs alongside it. If you’re looking for the prettiest game of the year, you won’t find one better than Metaphor.</p>
<p><em>– Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Empire of the Ants – Runner Up</h2>
<p>You know what ants look like in the real world? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/empire-of-the-ants-review/">Empire of the Ants</a> looks like that, but like, really close up. It’s pretty great… unless you have some kind of insect phobia.</p>
<p>Making use of Unreal Engine 5, it really is nearly photorealistic, but uses that to show us the world from a perspective that we very rarely have. The woods and gardens that Empire of the Ants plays out across play home to some of the most stunning ant and insect-based animations you will have ever seen. Everything is alive, everything is moving, and as the colony sets about individual tasks you can wander about as Ant 103,683rd, marvelling at just what Tower Five have created.</p>
<p><em>– Dom L</em></p>
<h2>Ultros – Runner Up</h2>
<p>If you ever wanted to know what its like to play a game that’s a 70s prog rock album cover, then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/ultros-review/">Ultros</a> is the answer to that. With artwork from El Huervo – of Hotline Miami cover art fame – this is more than just a step into the realms of psychadelia, the alien ship and world that you explore bombarding you with colours across its juxtaposition of organic and mechanical environments.</p>
<p>It’s an alien setting that blends into with the narrative and the gameplay, as you gradually explore this adapted metroidvania structure with a completely fresh set of eyes, needing to learn about the world, how to cultivate and nurture it through each cycle of the story.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-is-currently-free-to-play-until-the-new-year-including-spiritborn-class.1066515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-4-is-currently-free-to-play-until-the-new-year-including-spiritborn-class/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment is currently allowing those who are interested in playing Diablo 4 the opportunity to play it for free across all platforms on which you can get the game. At the moment, a large amount of ARPG fans are flocking to Path of Exile 2, with the game currently available in Early Access if you purchase it. Path of Exile and Diablo have been compared since the dawn of their very existence together, and Path of Exile 2 is no different. If you find that Path of Exile 2 isn't treating you quite right, or you want a new experience, Diablo 4 is currently available to play for free, thanks to Blizzard.</p>
<p>Once again, Blizzard has brought back the Diablo 4 trial, but with a significant difference. While the trial typically just involves the base campaign, this time, players will get the opportunity to try out the new Spiritborn class from the recent expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Vessel of Hatred</a>. Players won't be able to play the latest expansion, but you'll get to take the new class for a test run and see if it's something you enjoy.</p>
<p>The trial for Diablo 4 is currently available on PC via <a href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/#purchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle.net</a>, PlayStation, and Xbox. You'll be able to play the game for free until January 3, 2025. This gives you plenty of time to grind out the game, complete the campaign, and see if it's a game you'd be interested in playing in the future. Unfortunately, Diablo 4 isn't available as a free trial on Steam, so you won't be able to play it there if you are a PC user.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you find that you were enjoying your time during the Diablo 4 free trial, the game is on sale for up to 40% off across all platforms, which is the perfect time to get a game that will provide you with lots of value for money, especially with the addition of new content through the new seasons, as well as the ability to play the brand new expansion, Vessel of Hatred.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to purchase the game but want to play it, Diablo 4's base game is available through Game Pass on PC and Xbox, giving you the opportunity to try out the campaign for a significantly lower price than buying the game in its entirety. It does mean you won't have access to the expansion unless you purchase it, but that is a decision you can make later down the line.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Squid Game</em>, schoolyard games are turned into nightmares, as players compete to survive and — if they’re lucky — earn a massive cash prize. But in <em>Unleashed</em>, a new mobile spinoff that’s part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates">the streamer’s fledgling gaming efforts</a>, those games are <em>fun</em>. It’s a strange experience that sands off much of the appeal of <em>Squid Game</em> in service of making a multiplayer party game.</p><p><em>Unleashed</em> is sort of like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game"><em>Fall Guys</em></a> but in a <em>Squid Game</em> wrapper. You compete against 31 other players across three random games pulled from the show, like “red light, green light” or racing across a bridge made of glass. Slowly other players die off, and by the end one wins a whole bunch of money.</p><p>Aesthetically, the game mostly follows the show. There are a bunch of characters to play as — some pulled from the show, others new for the game — and even though there’s a cartoon aesthetic, things still get bloody, with players being shot for breaking the rules or crushed under some obstacle. There are the familiar green track suits and masked guards.</p><p>But the connections to the show are really only surface level. There’s no story element, so if you haven’t watched the show, you’d have no idea the kind of personal anguish many of the characters are going through.</p><p>In fact, many of the elements that make <em>Unleashed</em> a pretty fun mobile game are also what keep it from being a good adaptation of what <em>Squid Game</em> is all about. In order to reduce frustration, most of the games have respawning. So even if you fail at “red light, green light” and get shot by a guard, it’s not game over. It simply slows you down in a race to be one of a pre-determined number of players to cross the finish line and move on.</p><p>Similarly, the games can all be completed in a few minutes. This is great for playing short sessions on the go; being stuck in a 30 minute multiplayer match on your phone typically sucks. But when you put elements like the short run time and respawning together it, completely erases any of the tension that’s so core to <em>Squid Game</em>’s appeal.</p><p>And despite having no in-app purchases — <em>Unleashed</em> is completely free for Netflix subscribers and, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319725/squid-game-for-everyone">for a limited time, non-subscribers</a> — it’s still structured like a typical free-to-play game. You earn cash from winning matches and completing various goals, which is used to unlock new characters, costumes, and emotes. Every time I log on I’m greeted with a jarring number of pop-ups and notifications letting me know I just unlocked a zombie costume or that there’s a Christmas-themed event going on. Just this morning I was gifted a twerking emote.</p><p>Yes, now I can make Kang Sae-byeok, whose death was one of the most tragic moments of season 1, twerk in the middle of a deadly obstacle course.</p><p><em>Unleashed</em> isn’t a bad game. In many ways, it’s a clever reinterpretation of online party games for mobile. But, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23971416/squid-game-the-challenge-review-netflix">like most of Netflix’s expansions of the <em>Squid Game</em> universe</a>, it also completely misses the point of the show. It’s sort of like what <em>Fortnite</em> is to the original movie <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23851408/battle-royale-revisited-hunger-games-fortnite-squid-game-criterion"><em>Battle Royale</em></a>: a playful, colorful take on a brutal, piercing story.</p><p><em>Fortnite</em> largely avoided the tonal dissonance by creating a cartoon-ish, multiversal world that is far away from an island full of kids killing their classmates. <em>Unleashed</em>, on the other hand, is another part of S<em>quid Game</em> — one that doesn’t seem to understand why the series exists.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
