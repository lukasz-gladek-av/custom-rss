            <p>With a final lick, the weasel expires. Its head is mine. I slink back to my nest and shove this new head onto my strangely thick duck neck. Then, I take off in a flutter and scutter of beetle wings and legs. I pass an Oscar the grouch-style bloke in a basket selling animal body parts for crystals. Ahead lies a giant salamander wearing a fedora. He asks me to go and steal some eggs from an ant queen who's wearing an actual crown. I refuse. We fight. He keeps whistling for backup. My weasel head bites away, an openly terrified expression written across its whiskers.</p>
<p>That, in so many words, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2463690/Strange_Seed/">Strange Seed</a>, which came out in full yesterday and also has a demo I've gioven a go for this article. It's a cartoonish evolution murderfest from devs Chronicle Games, who cite E.V.O.: Search for Eden and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a>’s creature stage as their inspirations.</p>

<p>I'm quite young, and so haven't gotten around to playing either of those games. I've still found Strange Seed charmingly weird and weirdly charming. Well, at least when I'm managing not to think about what its central loop entails too much. You begin as a purple blob which drops off a tree, and quite jovially sets about replacing its blob body parts with those of creatures inhabiting the forest.</p><p>You murder these creatures and other blobs by licking, biting, or charging them, and they turn into a hunk of meat on a bone. You gobble this up for health, biomass which'll allow you to equip more animal parts, and animal parts themselves. Some can be talked to. For example, early on you meet a lonely duck. He'll only let you be his friend if you've got a duck's long neck. You murder another duck, take the neck from its hunk of death meat, and voilà, he's your mate. For five seconds, after which point you murder him for more duck parts.</p>
<p>To equip new parts, you claim nests, which I'm probably going to risk pissing people off by likening to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s sites of grace. They're spots of brief respite that act as respawn points throughout the world and also allow you to switch up your animal part loadout. What you equip is limited by what you've found, but also how many bits of biomass murders and exploration have earned, with some animal parts being more effective, but taking up more of your biomass limit while they're active.</p>
<p>You also find powerups while exploring which allow you to upgrade the mass of a body part. These all offer different stat boots, and the health one's linked to your neck. So, if you're minded similarly to me, odds are your head'll end up mounted on a tree trunk. Though, that might just be because I'm a bit crap at timing my licks and charges to quickly take out fairly tough beetles. I've found one boss so far - the salamander who speaks like a cockney gangster that I mentioned earlier. It's going to take a fair bit more murder-grinding before I can beat him.</p>
<p>I may well end up doing it though. Despite the constant freakish body horror, Strange Seed's got a chuckle-worthy charisma that hasn't quite worn off on me yet and is janky in the right ways rather than annoying performance ones thus far. You can check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3224660/Strange_Seed_Demo/">Steam</a> if it sounds up your alley.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hello and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and other stuff you might care about. It’s weird to me that<a href="https://kotaku.com/gremlins-3-announced-2027-speilberg-call-of-duty-sequel-chris-columbus-2000641675"> WB is making a <em>Gremlins 3</em></a>, but hey, if it features a lot of gross puppets bouncing around like cartoon maniacs, I’ll be there day one to enjoy it. Anyway, today we have news about a <em>Roblox</em> movie, <em>Overcooked</em> is becoming a reality show, and the story of an NBA player who kicked ass to spite a kid he met in a video game.</p> <h2><strong>NBA player was heckled in <em>NBA 2K26</em> and then scored 46 points as revenge</strong></h2> <p>On Wednesday night, Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell had a great game against the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 46 points and eight assists to help the Cavs grab a victory. When asked afterward about his performance, Mitchell revealed that he played so well because he was taunted by someone, possibly a kid, while playing<em> NBA 2K26</em>. <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1986382376843551086">Here’s what he said</a>, according to CBS Sports:</p>

 <blockquote><p>You have moments where it’s like–obviously, you play this game and you’re trying to win–but this was just a cool day as a whole for me. And obviously, to have the night I had was definitely special as well. But I wouldn’t put the game I had based on the court.</p> <p>This kid pissed me off today, I was playing <em>2K.</em> I had been playing <em>2K</em> for like two hours, and I told him, too, I said ‘Just wait.’ He called me ‘Washed up,’ he called me a bunch of things. But I love it. He said he hadn’t seen a highlight from me in a minute. I just told him, ‘alright, we’ll see.’ He told me to ‘go to sleep.’ He was going in. So this game was for that kid or grown man or whoever that was. So I appreciate you. I told him I’d give him a shoutout, too. So that’s what tonight was…</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>Yup, Hollywood is making a <em>Roblox</em> movie</strong></h2> <p>Production company <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/">Story Kitchen announced</a> that it is now developing a feature film based on the hit <em>Roblox</em> game <em>Grow a Garden, </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824">one of the most popular user-created games</a> available in the free-to-play online metaverse for kids. At one point, <em>Grow a Garden</em> had over 20 million concurrent users, making it one of the most popular video games on the planet and beating everything on Steam.</p>

 <p>“<em>Grow a Garden</em> is exactly the kind of imaginative, heartfelt world we love to adapt,” said Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Michael Lawrence Goldberg, “an uplifting story-world rooted in play, creativity, and community.” No release date for this one, and considering that Story Kitchen is already working on a slew of other video game adaptations–including <em>Split Fiction, It Takes Two, Sifu, Shinobi, </em>and <em>Toejam and Earl</em>–but has yet to complete and release most of them, I’m not holding my breath that this actually gets made. But we shall see.</p>

 <h2><strong>Netflix working on reality cooking show based on <em>Overcooked</em></strong></h2> <p>Speaking of video games getting turned into movies and TV shows, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Netflix has announced that it is working with A24</a> to develop a reality cooking show competition based on the hit co-op cooking game <em>Overcooked</em>. The game’s original devs are involved, and it’s reportedly going to be similar to Netflix’s other popular cooking shows, like <em>Nailed It.</em> While I enjoyed <em>Overcooked</em>, the game is nearly a decade old at this point, and it feels like perhaps Netflix waited too long to do something with it.</p> <h2><strong><em>Marvel Rivals</em> reveals new heroes via sneaky patch notes tease</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-rivals-rogue-gambit-patch-notes/">As spotted by <em>Polygon</em></a>, on Wednesday, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> developer NetEase Games <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20251105/41548_1269153.html">posted some patch notes</a> for the popular hero shooter. And if you look closely at the top image of the post, you’ll spot what looks like Rogue and Gambit, two famous X-Men characters, hidden in the artwork. These heroes have been rumored to be coming to the game for some time now, alongside many others, so it’s not shocking that it looks like these two mutants will be making the leap to <em>Rivals</em> in the near future.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">Rockstar claims fired devs were leaking secrets</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonics-latest-outing-is-a-grim-fall-guys-knock-off-with-60-skins-2000641427">The new <em>Sonic</em> game suuuuuccccckkkks</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355"><em>Battlefield 6′</em>s drone glitch is still causing problems, but a fix is coming soon</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-roadmap-new-map-patch-barricade-2000641734</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-has-a-big-roadmap-and-a-new-update-but-fans-want-some-things-kept-secret.1345903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, developer Embark Studios published their 2025<i> Arc Raiders</i> roadmap detailing what’s coming to the PvPvE extraction shooter through the rest of November and&nbsp; December. This includes a newly revealed 1.1.0 update that went live today, with some features arriving this weekend. But while fans are chiming in with requests for new features, some also want <i>Arc Raiders</i> to keep some surprises up its sleeves.</p> <p>Here’s where things stand in the massive hit multiplayer shooter a week since launch. Also, I have an epic video of someone taking down a Bastion with a pickaxe at the end. But first the game’s latest set of patch notes:</p> <h2>Patch 1.1.0 updates and changes</h2> <p>Thursday<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/590661232047948062?l=english">’s 1.1.0 patch notes</a> detail some welcome quality-of-life changes, as well as a sneak peak of what’s dropping into the game on November 8 .</p>

 <p>Over the weekend, <i>Arc Raiders</i> will see three new map conditions arrive. For the uninitiated, map conditions change up what you can expect while out on the battlefield. For example, a “Lush Blooms” condition on a map means that you can expect more plant life and more fruits to harvest than normal.</p>

 <p>Following the latest update, Hidden Bunker, Electromagnetic Storm, and a Night Raid in Blue Gate will be added to the game. Hidden Bunker, as you can imagine, is a hidden loot spot you’ll have to unlock. Electromagnetic Storm (which was available during the Server Slam) sees deadly lightning strikes pose a risk to anyone on the map–maybe fire up some <i>Final Fantasy X</i> to prepare yourself?</p>

 <p>Right now, however, folks can expect the following tweaks to <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gameplay:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Fixed the issue where the Integrated Shield Recharger was only recharging when equipped.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed an issue where Augment skills sometimes did not work.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed exploit using deployables pushing players through walls.</li> <li aria-level="1">Added a charge progress for Integrated Shield repair.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed an issue where Health Regen skills wouldn’t work if they were triggered while DBNO.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed the bug where the Well-Travelled achievement wouldn’t register.</li> <li aria-level="1">Barricades can no longer be placed near zipline exit points.</li> <li aria-level="1">Added the Punch Hands emote (preorder bonus) in game.</li> <li aria-level="1">Changed the schedule so new Map Conditions become available Saturday.</li> </ul> <p>The most significant of these is the inability to plant a barricade in front of a zipline exit. Barricades are really generous with where they can be placed, letting you effectively block off doors. It seemed like only a matter of before this exploit was nerfed.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ roadmap details a new map, new gear, and snow!</h2> <p><a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">Later on in November</a>, folks can expect a new map to unlock the currently inaccessible “Stella Montis.” There’s also some new Arc enemies on the way called the “Matriarch” and “Shredder.” There will also be some new quests, and new guns with which to take them on.</p>

  <p>The December updates, however, sound even cooler. The maps will experience snow as a new environmental condition and the game’s first expedition departure window will open up.</p>

 <p>What’s an expedition? Instead of a global server wipe that nukes everyone’s gear, <i>Arc Raiders</i> has a unique seasonal mechanic that encourages you to invest a ton of gathered loot into a “Project” to build a caravan. Once you finish it, and once there’s an expedition departure window available, you can send your Raider out on a permanent expedition, allowing you to start up a new one.</p> <p>This will reset all your skill points and clear out your stash, as well as your workshop upgrades. You’ll keep all your cosmetics and your new Raider will also get an XP boost, extra materials from our pal Scrappy, easier weapon repairs, and more space in your stash.</p> <p>Most survival games have some kind of mechanic for wiping everyone’s progress, otherwise the game would just turn into a warzone of folks perpetually hoarding and stocking up on their best gear forever. We’ll see if this one can help make <i>Arc Raiders</i> palatable to casual players where other hardcore extraction shooters like <i>Escape from Tarkov</i> have failed.</p>

 <p>If you’re working on your Caravan right now, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1opk2ti/psa_for_all_raiders_dont_scrap_these_items/">OrganicAppointment43 on Reddit has kindly shared</a> a list of every piece of loot you’ll need to put it together:</p>   <h2>Fans still want some surprises kept secret</h2> <p>Since the early preview tests of the game, many fans have been asking for quality-of-life features like the ability to craft more of an item directly from a right-click submenu without diving into the various workshop submenus. One thing it seems many fans <i>don’t</i> want, however, is to know about future Arc enemies.</p>

   <p>“It would be very cool if new ARC just started appearing randomly,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1op9f2e/please_embark_keep_new_arc_units_secret/">a popular post on the game’s</a> subreddit says. Some players basically want the game to mimic <i>Helldivers 2</i>’s more organic way of evolving in which the developers don’t explicitly telegraph every change ahead of time.</p> <p>I have to echo this sentiment. So much of what makes a match of <i>Arc Raiders</i> fun is when the “unknown” happens: A Leaper arrives when you weren’t expecting it, a Tick jumps down on your face in true <i>Alien</i> facehugger fashion from a hiding spot you never anticipated, and so on. We know we’re getting two new Arc this month, but it sure would be nice if a few of the future ones remained a little hidden and were rolled out in secret.</p> <h2>Behold: Someone took down a Bastion with a friggin’ Pickaxe</h2> <p>If you’ve played any amount of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, you know your pickaxe is essential for breaking into caches and can prove a deadly melee weapon in a pinch. But as Reddit user NotaFTCAgent demonstrates, it can also deliver <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/last_night_i_had_my_lowest_low_so_far_lost_all_my/">a satisfying final blow to a friggin Bastion</a>:</p>    <p>Call him <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nmz5994/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">John of Arc</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nn1baqv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Marc Raider</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nn1s9q3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">THOR with Mjolnir</a>, the dude needs a medal for that one.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p><strong>"</strong>What happens when a legendary franchise reveals one of its most anticipated experiences? ... Only to become the game everyone loves to hate?" the narrator asks at the start of the video. "When conversation shifts from gameplay to ideology? When everything you say only adds fuel to the fire? And when the voices you thought were with you actually turn against you."</p><p>The video's narrator described the ire Ubisoft experienced after it revealed Shadows in 2024. To combat the ferocity, the company "had to stop focusing on those who hated us [and] start firing up our allies." Doing that meant one thing, according to the narrator: Ubisoft had to lean on The Assassin's Creed brand.</p><p>"We started by doing the last thing anyone would have advised. We delayed the game," the narrator continued. "The extra time allowed the devs to polish, optimize, and reach the high standards fans expect from an Assassin’s Creed game. It also gave us time to rebuild the Assassin’s Creed brand pact, putting the markers of the franchise back at the center. More hood, more stealth, more leap of faith, more lore. So we could show that the spirit of Assassin’s Creed lives on in Shadows."</p><p>The video lathers on this corporate speak for the rest of its runtime, according to a transcript in that November 5 Game File report. The narrator says that, by showing the game and letting the experience speak for itself, Ubisoft won fans back, shifted the conversation, and found the confidence to "stand tall, to take risks, to speak up, even against the loudest haters." There's no explicit mention of who the "haters" were, and Guillemot doesn't define the backlash Shadows faced in his remarks after the video either. However, he did hint at the "fake fights" caused by the tension between gameplay and history.</p><p>"We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,” Guillemot said. "And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message.</p><p>"What we saw is that, by allowing our fans to see in the game--everything they were going to be able to rediscover--of what they love about Assassin’s Creed, [that] ultimately helped to combat this aggression, which is linked to the fact that video games have a very strong impact on the people who play them," Guillemot continued. "And so they’re kind of caught between 'I want to play, and what interests me is self-expression within a game' and 'there is a cultural message that comes with the video game.' So our goal is really to be able to ensure that our fans discover and defend what they expect from our games. It very quickly eliminated the fights, which were just fake fights."</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows received intense backlash for Yasuke, a Black slave who became a retainer for Oda Nobunaga, making him a samurai by association. The game was slammed for everything from being "woke propaganda" to featuring historical inaccuracies, and grew so intense that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/" data-ref-id="1100-6535320">Ubisoft reportedly canceled a Civil War-inspired Assassin's Creed game</a> as a direct result.

            <p>The Dispatch original soundtrack will be coming to music streaming services in late November / December of this year. However, a certain special song present in the latest batch of episodes won't be present.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, a PR representative confirmed that there were plans to bring the original score for Dispatch to music services after the conclusion of episode 8, though an exact date when these original songs will be streamable has yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>As of writing, you can listen to much of the original score for Dispatch on the official Adhoc Studios YouTube channel, including the most recent upload of episode 5 &amp; 6's score. However, a certain song is absent from that upload. The song itself is a spoiler<strong>, which we'll discuss below.</strong></p>

<figcaption>Here's the preview of Episode 5 &amp; 6 of Dispatch.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zidpOy-Zta4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>That song that won't be making it to streaming services is Flambae's karaoke cover of Meredith Brooks - Bitch, which plays in full during the credits of Episode 5. When asked whether Flambae's cover will also be making it to streaming services, a representative of Adhoc told Eurogamer: "We can't upload the Flambae cover, sadly. Maybe in the future, but right now we can't."</p><p>When asked why they can't include it on soundtracks, the spokesperson said that while the track itself is licensed, they: "don't have rights to throw it on soundtracks". However, they also added that they might consider re-negotiating this in the future. Given the success of Dispatch so far, this seems like a good move.</p>
<p>Dispatch has proven exceptionally popular since its initial batch of episodes came out in October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kapow-episodic-gaming-really-is-back-on-the-map-the-dispatch-success-story-continues">with the latest two episodes causing a new peak in players on Steam</a>. The game is selling well too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">pushing past 1m copies sold in ten days</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="60e66d87f7a94"><a title="MK World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/60e66d87f7a94/mk-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has just released a transcript of its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf">Q&amp;A session</a> following its Q2 2025 financial release. It's a pretty short one overall with few surprises, but one question regarding the Mario Kart franchise definitely piqued our interest.</p>
<p>Essentially, the query raises the possibility of another IP surpassing the sales of the Mario Kart franchise on Switch 2. As we know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has already sold 9.57 million units on new console, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is comfortably the best-selling Switch game at an astonishing 69.56 million units.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_PuEn0ZOn5c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt_PuEn0ZOn5c" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f036rxnitv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Shigeru Miyamoto answered by stating that Nintendo has always worked with the belief that "there are no limits", citing the comparisons made between <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> and other films released around the same time. If the film has reached number one, Nintendo believes it can always strive to do more.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that the if a new IP resonates with players, then it could absolutely go on to commercial success. But then he counters this by stating that Mario Kart would continue to sell regardless, and so "it may never be surpassed".</p>
<p>Amusingly, he then recalls a conversation with <strong>Pokémon</strong> creator Satoshi Tajiri. Speaking about the creation of Pokémon in Japan, Tajiri had supposedly joked with Miyamoto, stating “if you want to surpass Nintendo’s Mario, you’ll have to sell two copies of the software to each customer". This is apparently one of the driving forces behind the decision to create <strong>Pokémon Red and Green</strong>.</p>
<p>Surpassing Mario Kart will definitely be a tricky task for any publisher, including Nintendo itself. Not even the might of games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> could knock Mario Kart 8 Deluxe off its throne.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how things pan out with the Switch 2 in the years to come.</p>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, one of the best games in 2025, and one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-ultimate-game-of-the-year-award-major-indies-stacked/">games contending for game of the year</a> is going to be <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/play-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-for-free-this-weekend-on-steam">free for players to try on Steam and Xbox Series X/S starting today</a>, November 6, 2025, until this coming Monday, November 10, 2025. This free weekend comes just ahead of the launch of its third and final DLC, Mysteria Ecclesiae, which launches on November 11, 2025.</p>



<p>Along with the free weekend, if you do decide to grab the full game, then you'll get it at a 40% off discount on both Steam and Xbox, though PlayStation fans seem to be left out of the fun, as there is no mention of a free weekend for PlayStation or a discount on PlayStation consoles.</p>

<p>When Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 released at the beginning of this year in February, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Wccftech's reviewer, Chris Wray, gave the game a 10/10, writing</a>, "<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>

			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will launch together with the Valley of Memory expansion to introduce gameplay changes and new features, Ubisoft confirmed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/assassins-creed/news/62bserGVoUbHQPrsGCasOU/assassins-creed-mirage-new-gameplay-features-and-valley-of-memory-expansion">The new update</a> launching together with <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-free-dlc-release-date-reveal-november/">the free expansion on November 18</a> on all formats will introduce some brand new features, starting with the ability to replay all black box missions and contracts after they have been cleared once. Each replayable mission presents distinct challenges that require players to approach these missions creatively, such as avoiding the use of Eagle Vision, targeting only the main enemy, and more. Completing these missions grants the player exclusive in-game rewards usable in New Game +.</p>



<p>The upcoming free Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will also introduce a new free jump option that will allow players to jump manually, a new control scheme to smooth parkour that works better with free jump turned on, a Back and Side Ejects Mode, which allows Basim to perform ejects regardless of the presence of a safe landing spot and a few other parkous tweaks to make the experience smoother.</p>



<p>Finally, the new Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will also add a new skill called Engineer 2 that will allow him to equip all level 1 enhancements to his tools, and a new level 3 modification that will power up every tool. Rounding up the new features included in the update is the inclusion of new difficulty levels called Hardened Assassin, which will sport enemies with higher defense than Assassin difficulty, and Ultimate Assassin, the hardest difficulty in the game.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game which brought back the classic series' gameplay formula by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">Nathan Birch's review.</a></p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-long-story-short">Patrick Recommends: Long Story Short</h3><figure><figcaption><span>This scene is less familiar growing up, more familiar in the car with my own kids. Credit: Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the saying goes, there is universality in specificity. That is no more present than in one of my favorite television series this year, Netflix's <em>Long Story Short</em>, aka the tremendous new series from <em>Bojack Horseman</em> creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg.</p><p><em>Bojack Horseman</em> was a <em>bummer</em>. An insightful show, but quite often bleak enough to make it challenging to hold onto the ideas the show had about hope, redemption, forgiveness, and becoming a better person amidst the pain you have caused others. (Forgiveness isn't about another person being "okay" with you, it's living with knowing you fucked up.) <em>Long Story Short</em> channels a similar level of absurdist humor—<em>god</em>, the episode about Yoshi trying to start his own business inside his parent's house—without relying on the visual gag of lol talking animals. </p><p>(I am not trying to reduce the show to lol talking animals, but that part helped!)</p><p><em>Long Story Short</em> has little that I can personally relate to in terms of family dynamics. A mother more parts bully than loving parent. Siblings who snipe at each other. A deeply religious household. But I do know what it's like to not understand the person a parent performs in public and the person they reveal themselves to be at home.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-launches-final-clearance-sale-on-powerful-1tb-ryzen-7-laptop-now-75-off-with-no-mercy-for-rivals.1345846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Want a powerhouse laptop without having to take out a second mortgage? Most of us just can’t justify spending $4,000 on a computer, no matter how impressive the specs might be. A premium price like that puts premium computing firmly out of reach for the average professional or student. But right now, Dell has slashed the price on <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5373/">their Inspiron 16 laptop (Ryzen 7 8-core 8840U, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 1TB SSD) from $3,999 to just… $989</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5373/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This Dell laptop <strong>features an eight-core AMD Ryzen 7 8840U processor</strong> that will make video editing and complex spreadsheets fly, not to mention everything in between. Its architecture also supports AI-enhanced tasks which means that it’s ready for the next generation of productivity applications that are becoming the norm in professional environments. <strong>Surround that chip with 32GB of DDR5 RAM</strong>, and you get a system comfortable juggling dozens of browser tabs and background apps all at the same time.</p>



<h2>Perfect for Long Sessions</h2>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ display stretches to 1920×1200 resolution</strong> and gives you extra vertical space compared to the standard Full HD screens. That additional screen real estate makes a noticeable difference when you’re working with documents, coding, or comparing data side by side. Dell has fitted this screen with an anti-glare coating and its ComfortView technology, filtering out harmful blue light without distorting colors.</p>
<p>The backlit keyboard will let you comfortably work in a variety of places-from the coffee shop down the block to late-night home office sessions. Dell has fitted the keys with decent travel and spacing, such that typing feels natural, not cramped. The <strong>AI Copilot key offers one-touch access to Microsoft’s AI assistant</strong> for streamlined tasks like drafting emails, summarizing documents or generating content suggestions.</p>



<p>What’s more, the fingerprint reader saves you from typing passwords throughout your day and offers more secure authentication than the old login methods. The privacy camera cover gives you physical control over your webcam to put worries about unauthorized access or accidentally showing up on video calls to rest. These are not fancy features, but they safeguard your data and privacy in very practical ways.</p>
<p>The 54Whr battery keeps this laptop <strong>running through a full workday of typical use</strong>. From virtual meetings and working on documents to web browsing and content streaming, there isn’t much you can’t do on the move without having to constantly hunt for outlets. And when you do, the system allows for fast charging in order to get you back up and running quickly.</p>
<p>For $989, this configuration becomes a very compelling value for anyone who needs reliable computing power for business. Spending $3,999 initially put this kind of performance out of the reach of most buyers, and this clearance sale changes the equation entirely.</p>

The news comes as the company is facing multiple lawsuits regarding teens who allegedly suffered grooming and sexual exploitation on the platform, as well as in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/safety/family-center-is-getting-an-update">blog post</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that went live yesterday, the company stated that the update is meant to help guardians stay informed and play a more active role in their teens' online experiences, while also giving teens autonomy to shape their "digital environment."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The features, which will roll out over the next week, allow guardians more visibility over weekly activity, including all purchases made, total minutes spent on voice and video calls, and the top five users and servers a teen most frequently messaged and called in the last week.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, if a teen submits a report on another user or piece of content to Discord, they'll have the option to notify their guardian. If they do, the guardian will receive an email with the notice, but this won't include the details of the report. Similarly, while guardians can now filter who can DM a teen and whether sensitive content is filtered, the exact content of conversations isn't shared.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/book-excerpt-the-game-needs-to-change-towards-sustainable-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Book Excerpt: The Game Needs to Change: Towards Sustainable Game Design</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The new teen safety tools roll out amidst lawsuits pertaining to allegations of Discord being unsafe for underage users">The new teen safety tools roll out amidst lawsuits pertaining to allegations of Discord being unsafe for underage users</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The blog post includes bulleted lists aimed at both teens and guardians, with the former noting that "your voice matters" and that "privacy is protected." For guardians, Discord advises they "play a more active role in safety," to "nurture trust," and "start better conversations" with teens. "We’re focused on making it easier for you to offer guidance, not surveillance," the announcement reads.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back in April, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-discord-sued-for-facilitating-the-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor">Roblox Corporation and Discord were sued</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over allegations that each company facilitated the sexual harassment and exploitation of a minor across both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord.

Over time, the plaintiff was convinced to share her Discord username with the accused predator, leading to conversations on the popular chat platform where she was then coerced into sending sexually explicit images. These events took place over the course of six months.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-wizards-of-the-coast-exec-resurrects-canceled-game-at-new-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Wizards of the Coast exec resurrects canceled game at new studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back then, Discord declined to directly comment on the case in a message sent via a spokesperson.

The son started playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at the age of 9 with his parents' approval and with parental controls in place. The alleged targeting by an "adult sex predator" who posed as a child in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> began when he was 12, attorneys for Rebecca Dalas said in a statement to NBC at the time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-subsidiary-bad-brain-game-studios-is-shutting-down" target="_self" data-discover="true">NetEase subsidiary Bad Brain Game Studios is shutting down</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conversations "gradually escalated to sexual topics and explicit exchanges," and the son was allegedly encouraged to turn off parental controls and move conversations to Discord, the lawyers said. On Discord, the man "increasingly demanded explicit photographs and videos," and threatened the son that he'd post or share the images. The son complied out of fear, the complaint says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This lawsuit accuses Roblox and Discord of wrongful death, fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and strict liability. It argues that if Roblox and Discord had taken steps to screen users before allowing them to register on the apps, or implemented age and identity verification and other safety measures, the aforementioned events wouldn't have transpired.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regarding Discord specifically, the suit said the platform is "overflowing with sexually explicit images and videos involving children, including anime and child sex abuse material."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A spokesperson told NBC that the platform is "deeply committed to safety," and that it wouldn't comment on legal matters. "We require all users to be at least 13 to use our platform. We use a combination of advanced technology and trained safety teams to proactively find and remove content that violates our policies,” the spokesperson said. “We maintain strong systems to prevent the spread of sexual exploitation and grooming on our platform and also work with other technology companies and safety organizations to improve online safety across the internet."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the new features and moderation tools are helpful on paper, Discord makes the clarification that communication between teens and guardians is a key element throughout the announcement.

The full patch list is below.</p>

<p>In our ARC Raiders article, Stefan pondered whether the game could be for everyone, and said, <em>“ARC Raiders has the potential to quickly become the biggest and best example of the extraction shooter out there. The distinct tone and feel of the world that Embark Studio has created, the feel of the action, the layered progression and systems to try and make failure not feel so final, all builds to what could be this genre’s new gold standard.”</em></p>

			<p>Square Enix is the latest video game publisher to push for AI usage in video game development, aiming to let it handle a critical part of development almost completely by 2027.</p>



<p>As part of the company's latest earnings report, the Japanese publisher shared a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">Progress Report on its Medium-Term Business Plan</a>, detailing some of the initiatives underway to boost long-term growth, which include promoting AI utilization in Japan. This is being achieved through the initiation of joint research with the Matsu Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes using AI technology.</p>



<p>The current goal of this joint research project is to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027. This will <em>"improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development"</em>, Square Enix detailed in the report. As of now, the research team is composed of more than 10 people, including researchers from the Matsu-Iwasawa Laboratory and engineers from Square Enix.</p>



<p>While Square Enix has only started researching AI usage in QA, other publishers are already using it for their titles, putting testers' jobs at risk. Last month, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">EA has already been using AI in QA for a while</a>, as a former employee at Respawn confirmed that over 100 people were laid off last Spring because the company started using AI to review and summarize feedback from play testers, which was work previously handled by human employees.</p>



<p>Square Enix's plans to utilize AI to enhance game development efficiency appear to align with a prevailing sentiment among the most successful Japanese video game developers, such as Masahiro Sakurai and Hideo Kojima. Both developers are not averse to using AI to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">make large-scale game development sustainable</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">let it handle tedious tasks to allow them to focus on the creative process.</a></p>

			<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A has been out for three weeks at the time of this writing, and has had a stunning commercial start with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/">5.8 million copies sold in its first week</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-massive-retail-launch-in-the-us/">strong sales in both the UK and the US</a>. Continuing the momentum, today, The Pokémon Company announced that the game's first paid DLC, Mega Dimension, will arrive on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 devices this coming December 10, 2025.</p>



<p>The announcement came with two new trailers, one that's more of a cinematic showcase of the new DLC, and another that goes into more detail about Mega Dimension and lays out what to expect in the paid expansion.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As shown in the cinematic trailer above, Mega Dimension marks a historic change for the Pokémon series, which is that the level cap for Pokémon, which has been at level 100 for the entire history of the series, has been removed, and you'll now have to face Pokémon far, far stronger than level 100.</p>



<p>The DLC begins with the introduction of a new character, Ansha and her partner Pokémon, Hoopa. They pull you into a new dimension and a new version of Lumiose City that has new versions of Pokémon running around the city, but you're not just there to capture new Pokémon. You're also there to uncover a mystery behind distortions that are appearing across Lumiose City, with the help of Ansha and Hoopa.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/">Wccftech's review of Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, our reviewer Nathan Birch gave it an 8.5/10, and<em> </em>wrote, "<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s tough being a </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>fan when Square Enix drops an announcement trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720"><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV</span></i></a><i><span>,</span></i><span> then mostly disappears for three years. These days, those waiting to hear more about Goofy and company’s next foray into the Disney/</span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>crossover universe will lap up even the smallest of crumbs in hopes that it means a full-course meal could be waiting for them at the end of development. This week’s crumb is an Instagram story from Haley Joel Osment, the voice behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-best-games-ranked-2-3-birth-by-sleep-1851494518"><i><span>Kingdom Hearts</span></i><span>’</span></a><span> key-wielding hero Sora, that implies he’s recording…something!</span></p> <p><span>On November 5, Osment posted a photo to his Instagram story of a big red sign that says “RECORDING” with the caption “Back to work” in what looks like a recording studio. Now, this could be for anything. Osment has done plenty of voice work over his decades-long acting career, and it’s not limited to playing Sora in the </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>series, which he’s done since the series’ debut in the PS2 era. Take a cursory look at his acting credits, and you’ll see he’s done a lot of voiceovers for tons of animated Marvel, DC, and </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>projects over the past few years. So it’s entirely possible he’s just doing another routine gig.</span></p>

 <p><span>But we also don’t know that this </span><i><span>isn’t</span></i><span> him gearing up for another monologue about how Sora’s friends are his power, right? </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV </span></i><span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809"><span>still in an uncertain point of development</span></a><span>, but if Square Enix is considering a re-reveal of sorts, it’s entirely possible Osment is doing a session or two for a trailer. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Nobody would ever get themselves in a tizzy over a simple, nondescript Instagram story, right?&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>35 years later, Warner Bros has finally announced it’s making a <em>Gremlins 3</em>. The new sequel will be executive-produced by Steven Spielberg, <a href="https://kotaku.com/spielberg-call-duty-movie-activision-medal-honor-2000623436">who reportedly was denied a chance to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie</a>, so why not help produce a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/gremlins-2-the-new-batch-1"><em>Gremlins</em></a> movie instead?</p> <p>On November 6, Warner Bros. Discovery chief David “I’m Bad At My Job” Zaslav <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/warners-gremlins-3-steven-spielberg-chris-columbus-1236419932/">announced during the company’s third-quarter earnings call</a> that a third <em>Gremlins</em> movie had recently been greenlit and had some big names attached. As mentioned, Spielberg is returning to the franchise to once again be an executive producer and will be producing the sequel through his company, Amblin Entertainment. Meanwhile, the writer behind the OG 1984 <em>Gremlins</em> movie, Chris Columbus, is returning to produce and direct the flick.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gremlins-3-final-destination-screenwriters-1236371957/">As reported by<em> The Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em>,</em> Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein are working alongside Columbus to help write the script for <em>Gremlins 3</em>. The duo previously directed this year’s smash hit horror sequel <em>Final Destinations: Bloodlines.</em></p>

 <p>Warner Bros. has set a November 19, 2027 release date for its new <em>Gremlins</em> sequel. That is 37 years after the last <em>Gremlins</em> movie, making it a true legacy sequel.&nbsp; Arriving in theaters in 1984, the original <em>Gremlins</em> was a massive box office success. On a budget of just $15 million, the Joe Dante-directed comedy-horror movie about evil little creatures who show up after some rules are broken while taking care of a cute furry mogwai made over $150 million in the US alone.</p>

 <p>However, six years later, <em>Gremlins 2</em>, also directed by Dante, only made $41 million, was ravaged by critics and fans and basically killed the franchise. In 2023, WB produced an animated series based on the dormant property and it seems the response to that was strong enough to convince the studio that <em>Gremlins</em> is still a worthwhile franchise. Let’s hope the third movie sticks to puppets and doesn’t go full CG.</p> <p>And I hope working on <em>Gremlins 3</em> will help Spielberg get over Activision denying him the chance to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-its-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-now-cheaper-than-a-mini-bluetooth-speaker-2000641681</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-its-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-now-cheaper-than-a-mini-bluetooth-speaker.1345807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>TVs are getting thinner and that’s terrific for aesthetic purposes but disastrous for audio quality. Those razor-thin screens don’t have any physical room for decent speakers which means most integrated audio sounds flat, tinny and lifeless.</p>
<p>Amazon definitely noticed this gap in the market and decided to create a solution that’s largely inspired by premium brands like Bose and Samsung – except the Fire TV soundbar <em>Plus</em> costs two to three times less than comparable models from those manufacturers. At the moment, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">you can score this soundbar for just $174, down from its usual $249 sticker</a>, which puts it at an <strong>all-time low</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Audio Upgrades</h2>
<p>The Fire TV soundbar Plus is a fantastic soundbar that houses <strong>real home theater technology inside a single sleek unit</strong> sitting neatly below your television. This is a 3.1 channel system which means you get three forward-firing speakers combined with a built-in subwoofer for bass in one compact unit. The dedicated center channel <strong>takes care of dialogue specifically</strong> so that if people are talking in movies or shows, the conversations come across sharp and clear rather than being blurred with background music and effects.</p>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos support brings 3D audio into the mix</strong>&nbsp;with the sensation that sound is moving around and above you rather than just blasting straight ahead. Action scenes feature helicopters flying overhead, atmospheric dramas rain from above, and much more. <strong>Support for DTS:X multi-dimensional audio processing</strong> for filmmakers and sound designers gives multiple ways to create immersive experiences that this soundbar can actually reproduce.</p>



<p>Special attention is given to the <strong>built-in subwoofer as most soundbars in this price range either forgo bass altogether or use a separate wireless subwoofer</strong> that requires floor space and its own power outlet. Amazon manages to house the sub directly within the chassis of the soundbar and with it, you gain deep, punchy low frequencies for everything from explosions to music and ambient rumble-all without adding another component to your setup.</p>



<p>Setup couldn’t be any easier since you only have to hook up the included HDMI cable to your TV’s HDMI eARC or ARC port. The same cable carries both audio and control signals, which means the remote from your television can change the soundbar’s volume for you with no unnecessary controller cluttering up your coffee table. Audio sync issues that plague some soundbar setups simply don’t happen here, since the HDMI connection keeps everything perfectly timed.</p>
<p>It’s compact enough to fit under most TVs without blocking the screen or the remote sensor and has an understated design that lets your entertainment take center stage. For the price, you’re getting tech and performance that’s regularly between $400-$600 from other established audio brands which makes this one of the single best value propositions in home audio at the moment. And for an all-time low price, it’s an even easier decision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’ve finally learned about Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s first DLC—Mega Dimension. It adds new Mega Evolutions and missions, but we’ve also learned that your Pokémon can go above Level 100—a series first.</p>



<p>For decades, the rule on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-year-revenue-estimates-hit-1-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> has been simple: Once your Mon reaches Level 100, it has pretty much reached the peak of its powers. Yes, it will be extraordinarily strong and unbeatable, and one of them can pretty much sit on the Elite Four single-handedly, but Level 101 is out of the question.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-go-over-the-level-100-pokemon-cap-in-mega-dimension-dlc">You Can Go Over The Level 100 Pokémon Cap In Mega Dimension DLC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Level 162?? Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you look at the screenshot above, you can see the new Mega Baxcalibur and its mind-blowing <strong>Lv. 162 status</strong>. So, not only are we breaching Level 100 for the first time, we’re completely jumping the shark.</p>



<p>As shown by the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A DLC trailer for Mega Dimensions</a>, Pokémon can finally breach the max level cap.</p>



<p>An official <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Discover-Hyperspace-Lumiose-and-New-Mega-Evolutions-in-Pokemon-Legends#:~:text=Venturing%20into%20Hyperspace%20Lumiose,strange%20events%20befalling%20Lumiose%20City" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension,&nbsp;Trainers will revisit Lumiose as spatial distortions begin to form around the city. Donut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, will guide players as they explore the mysterious dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose. This not-quite Lumiose City is home to newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokémon and other Pokémon not usually found in Lumiose, <strong>some of which can exceed the normal limit of Lv. 100 with hyperspace levels.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This seems like a gimmick feature exclusive to the Mega Dimension DLC. We’re not 100% how the mechanic works, but it’s likely these will only be temporary level boosts, and your Pokémon won’t be able to stay above Level 100 for the entire game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Simpsons has been a television staple since 1989, spanning over 790 episodes, a theatrically released feature film, another on the way, and a ton of video game adaptations, a few of which were genuinely great. After all, The Simpsons even invented its own in-universe video games, referenced actual video games constantly, and even went to a video game convention. But as a sitcom family featuring members that mostly spent their time at work, school, or hanging around the house, making a video game out of The Simpsons was no easy task, inspiring developers to create entire Simpsons games out of things that maybe appeared in an episode once, or just make up a game idea out of thin air, leading to some truly crazy results. Here is the weird, wild history of The Simpsons video games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t have a cow, man.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart vs. the Space Mutants (1991)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/bart-vs-the-space-mutants-1762431368255.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The very first Simpsons video game is a truly bizarre one. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-space-mutants">Bart vs. The Space Mutants</a> was incredibly ambitious and packed with great references to the show, even if it wasn’t exactly fun to play. The title screen played a chiptune version of the theme song over an 8-bit version of the iconic TV family and their beloved couch, fuzzy voice samples allowed Bart to say things like “Eat My Shorts,” and you could even prank call Moe the bartender from outside of his tavern. By the way, if you don’t like that chiptune cover of The Simpson’s theme song, tough luck, because it plays on loop for the entirety of some of its very long levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It being the first Simpsons video game that players could buy at a store and shove into their NES consoles made it a huge sales success, even though it was notoriously obtuse, punishingly difficult, featured unreliable and floaty platforming mechanics, and was frankly just plain odd for anyone who even had a passing familiarity with the show. Using “They Live” style glasses that Bart can wear to see invisible aliens, he’s able to traverse through the streets (while also dodging visible aliens) so he can spray paint purple objects around Springfield because the aliens... need purple objects... for intergalactic dominance... or something. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a kid, Bart vs. the Space Mutants was probably the first time I realized a video game based on a TV show or movie I loved could be bad, a life lesson that the NES handed out constantly during that era. But hey, we all thought it was the coolest that Bart talked and skateboarded in the game, and we were used to pushing through brutally hard video games at the time, so we all made the best of it... even if I didn’t know a single kid who actually beat this game without using a cheat code device like the Game Genie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides, in 1991 we all knew the real best Simpsons game wasn’t in our living rooms but at the arcade across town…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Arcade Game (1991)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/the-simpsons-arcade-game-1762431461032.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you know how fun your video game has to be to convince a ten year old boy that he should play as a stay at home mother of three with a vacuum cleaner? Really fun, and luckily <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-the-arcade-game">The Simpsons arcade game </a>was an absolute blast, especially with three of your friends huddled around it after devouring two whole pizzas at a birthday party. The early '90s arcade scene was packed with co-op sidescrolling beat ‘em up games based on things like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the X-Men, and The Simpsons fit right in, ready and eager to devour your arcade tokens. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only was The Simpsons arcade game absolutely gorgeous (thanks to the brilliant artists and game developers at Konami) but it was also incredibly funny, packed with obvious and esoteric references to the show. And while its plot (rescue Maggie from Smithers because she thinks a stolen diamond is a pacifier?) didn’t make much sense, who cares? It was a great excuse to send the entire Simpsons family into the streets together to beat the crap out of bad poorly dressed henchmen, zombies, bears, gigantic Krusty the Clown balloons, and whatever else the game decides to chuck at you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately you can’t purchase this game and play it on modern video game platforms, although it was ported to consoles in 2013 before being delisted for good. You can, however, spend hundreds of dollars on a recreated Arcade 1-UP version, a thing I’ve been tempted to do dozens of times in my adult life and somehow been able to resist. 34 years later, The Simpsons arcade game is still one of the best Simpsons video games ever made, and a completely kickass beat ‘em up in its own right. I really hope Konami decides to re-release it so more people can experience this absolute classic.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly (1991)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/bart-simpsons-escape-from-camp-deadly-1762431601917.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile that same year, in my back pocket, the AA battery-devouring machine known as the Nintendo Game Boy got its own exclusive Simpsons game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bart-simpsons-escape-from-camp-deadly">Escape from Camp Deadly</a>. It was once again way more difficult than it had any right to be. Compared to the NES game, though, Bart’s character sprite was at least more than seven pixels tall, even if the Game Boy’s limited palette made his eyes look like he was perpetually stoned. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape from Camp Deadly, as the name suggests, is about Bart fleeing a deranged and dangerous summer camp where people throw knives and forks during cafeteria food fights and guys that look like undercover cops try to beat you to death in a forest. And you thought summer school sucked. This game wasn’t great by any stretch, but it was satisfying enough and also had the benefit of being a portable game you could suffer through anywhere you went, from the school bus to your own terrible summer camp.

But hey, you at least can turn into Bartman and fly around, there are minigames to break things up between levels, Moe the Bartender tries to kill you with beers, and you can throw pies in the faces of Smithers and Mr. Burns for an uncomfortably long stretch of time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart's House of Weirdness (1991)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/barts-house-of-weirdness-1762440191997.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Somehow the <em>fifth</em> Simpsons video game released in 1991, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-barts-house-of-weirdness">Bart’s House of Weirdness</a> brings Konami back into the picture for an MS-DOS game (and if you know what that means, you should schedule a colonoscopy) that once again pits Bart against a bunch of stuff in Springfield that is trying to kill him. Or should I say “uncool” him, since the game’s health bar is actually a cool meter that goes down depending on how much you get hurt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being named Bart’s House of Weirdness, most of the game is actually spent outside of Bart’s house doing the usual Simpson’s video game stuff like fighting aliens or looking at long, awkward poses on loading screens. Overall it’s a pretty good looking game and use of the license in general (although the theme song cover here is completely unhinged) even if it's nowhere near the same level of quality as Konami’s other Simpson’s game that year. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart vs. The Juggernauts (1992)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-1762431860314.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The year 1992 brought us a trio of new Simpsons games, the most unhinged of them being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bart-vs-the-juggernauts">Bart vs. The Juggernauts</a>, a parody of the hit late '80s/early '90s competitive strongman show, American Gladiators, now set in Springfield. Oh, and it’s hosted by resident surly news anchor Kent Brockman and local therapist Marvin Monroe, both of which assume no legal responsibility for the public beating that Bart is about to endure. Bart Simpson - canonically a fourth grader - takes on numerous Juggernauts, hulking behemoths who want to pulverize him for cash and prizes. So yes, exactly the kind of lawsuit factory that infamous Simpsons lawyer Lionel Hutz would’ve loved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the premise is deranged, the writing is genuinely witty and sharp, with all of the adults fully aware that this televised tournament is a reckless and dangerous thing to throw kids into, especially the level where Bart has to punch and jump kick a grown woman at Moe’s Tavern, a dive bar full of cheering alcoholics. Oh, and that’s when he’s not jousting against a different grown up to see who can push their opponent into a pit of toxic sludge down at Mr. Burns’ power plant, which is exactly how The Joker once became a thing. Bart vs. The Juggernauts is essentially a minigame collection strung loosely together lby cutscenes, and while the game as a whole can feel kind of hit or miss, it’s a unique take on the source material. Plus, it ends with Bart winning his very own Truckasaurus for his family to drive home with, and really, how can anyone be mad at that?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Krusty's Fun House (1992)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/krusty-fun-house-1762431982888.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After several Simpsons games starring Bart were released back to back (with many, many more to come) it was time to send in the clowns and give Krusty his own video game. Well, sort of. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/krustys-super-fun-house">Krusty’s Fun House</a> was technically a reskin of an Amiga game called Rat Trap that Acclaim decided to throw Krusty and some other Simpsons sprites into, sort of like how Super Mario characters took over the Japanese game Doki Doki Panic when it was released in the US. If you’ve ever played Lemmings or the Mario vs Donkey Kong games, you’ll quickly recognize that Krusty’s Fun House plays similarly but with a slightly darker outcome for the tiny herdlings: that’s because the player has to lure them into large machines where they’ll be smashed to bits. So probably not quite what you’d expect from a Krusty the Clown game but at the same time <em>exactly </em>the kind of thing you’d expect Krusty the Clown to do in his free time, so hey, why not.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bartman Meets Radioactive Man (1992)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/bartman-and-radioactiveman-1762436202775.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Krusty was dealing with diseased vermin infestations, Bart was busy tackling other potentially deadly health code violations in 1992’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-bartman-meets-radioactive-man">Bartman Meets Radioactive Man</a>, which finally features Bart’s superhero alter-ego Bartman as a permanently playable character rather than a temporary power-up. Unfortunately, it’s marred by the same floaty platforming that plagued the previous Acclaim Simpsons games, and while the Bartman flying levels mix up the pacing a bit, it mostly lands in the middle of that all-too-common licensed NES game ditch of way too hard and not very fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The entirety of Bartman Meets Radioactive Man is set in locations that have nothing to do with any Simpsons episodes and feature little to no Simpsons references or characters at all, so it’s not even like it’s worth pushing through if you’re a Simpsons fan. In hindsight it’s pretty crazy how much Bartman stuff was out there by 1992 considering that character didn’t exactly have a huge presence on the show at the time, and I say that as someone who once successfully begged his parents to buy him a Bartman action figure. God I loved that thing. The Bartman video game, not so much.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart's Nightmare (1993)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/barts-nightmare-1762436333435.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On to the year 1993, where Bart Simpson is once again starring in an absolute fever dream of a Simpsons game, although this time that’s finally a deliberate choice. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-barts-nightmare">Bart’s Nightmare</a> opens with Bart passing out face first into his homework and waking up in an imaginary hellscape where all of the pages have flown out of his bedroom window and on to a chaotic fantasy version of the streets of Springfield. While dodging obstacles with a jumping sound effect that sounds like a sick cat about to retch, Bart must collect his missing homework pages, triggering one of several random doors that lead to even crazier nightmares. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind one door there’s a Godzilla-inspired stage where Bart has to dodge a version of Mothra that looks like his mom (Margethra, I guess?) Behind another, a side-scrolling shoot ‘em up style level where Bartman takes down missiles and Krusty balloons with his trusty slingshot. There’s even a stage where Itchy and Scratchy try to kill Bart with hammers and bazookas while sentient vacuum cleaners tear across the carpet. Does any of this make any sense? No, and nightmares seldom do, so hey, just roll with it and try to get an A+ as your final score so the whole family can stare in awe at your hard work and dedication (although it’s not entirely clear if Bart didn’t just write that grade on the paper himself.)</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Itchy &amp; Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness (1993)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/itchy-scratchy-mini-golf-1762436489017.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, it’s about time that Itchy &amp; Scratchy - The Simpsons’ ultra-violent parody of Tom &amp; Jerry - got their very own video game, although a side-scrolling mini golf game was probably not exactly what most fans expected at the time. Still, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/itchy-scratchy-in-miniature-golf-madness">Itchy &amp; Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness</a> manages to be ultra-violent, which is especially funny for a Game Boy game rated "E for everyone." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Scratchy’s job to whack the ball over various obstacles and into the hole while managing challenging platforming sequences and collecting weapons he can use to blow up, maim, and straight up chop in half his resident nuisance animal, Itchy, who repeatedly makes it a point to annoy and harm him. Somehow this is all Krusty’s fault for reasons that are never clearly explained and ultimately don’t matter, because the end result was unique, especially when you consider your typical minigolf game at the time didn’t involve throwing knives or hitting a mouse so hard his eyeballs fly off of his face and into the 18th hole.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bart &amp; the Beanstalk (1994)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/bart-and-the-beanstalk-1762436544108.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, I promise this is the last Acclaim-developed Simpsons game for the original Nintendo Game Boy. I swear. 1994 was when The Simpsons was right in the middle of its peak of popularity, so obviously the best place to set the next video game starring ‘90s cool kid Bart Simpson was the 1700’s royalty-free British fairy tale, Jack and the Beanstalk. Wait, what? Acclaim, a publisher clearly set on riding The Simpsons license until the wagon wheels fell off, once again gave Bart a short and floaty platforming game for the Nintendo Game Boy, this time a retelling of the classic story of a poor kid selling his family’s cow to make money and then spending said money on a magical bean that grows into a towering beanstalk leading to a giant’s castle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no logical explanation for why any Simpson would be doing any of this unless some ‘90s video game executive heard Bart’s oft-repeated “don’t have a cow, man” line and decided a fable about a family selling their cow was a perfect fit. That’s the best I can do here. Let me know if you’ve got a better idea. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-bart-and-the-beanstalk">Bart &amp; the Beanstalk</a> is once again a strange fit for the license and, outside of the giant looking like Homer and a cloud shaped boss looking like Mr. Burns, there’s not much here for Simpsons fans... although it does finally bring closure to Acclaim’s prolific and peculiar run of Game Boy exclusive Simpsons games.

See, in 1994 virtual reality seemed like the coolest concept in the world, even if nobody really knew what it meant and it was a label thrown around for anything from video games to just... being on the internet and doing virtual stuff like reading websites. The idea of putting on a futuristic helmet or special glasses and suddenly being whisked away to a simulated 3D world was every kid’s dream, and with very early VR experiences starting to trickle out in arcades, and movies like Demolition Man and the Lawnmower man showing their various uses, combining VR and Bart Simpson made a ton of sense if you were a marketing guy trying to get a kid to buy a video game. That said, Virtual Bart is mostly a randomized mini-game collection where Bart does various things every kid thought was cool, like watersliding, dirt bike riding, throwing eggs at teachers, and uhh, turning into a pig and escaping a canned ham factory. Yeah, that kind of stuff. Cool stuff kids love. Virtual stuff.

It’s not really a “game” in that it doesn’t have a defined ending or scoring system, since creative expression is the whole point, but it still manages to yield some very fun and stupid results. Also, I’m completely convinced that several movie directors working today cut their teeth by editing short films in these '90s PC animation programs based on children’s cartoons. Just my theory, though.

Around the same time, the Grand Theft Auto franchise was firing on all cylinders between GTA: Vice City and the soon to be released GTA: San Andreas, so the creators of The Simpsons Road Rage decided to expand many of the foundations they had previously built and created <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-run">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</a>. A GTA inspired open-world Simpsons game, Hit &amp; Run let you steal cars, cause chaos, and explore Springfield to unlock collectibles and meet and/or beat all of your favorite Simpsons characters. This combination of GTA and the Simpsons went together like peanut butter and chocolate, and while it totally sucks that a sequel was pitched, planned, and then ultimately canceled, Hit and Run totally holds up today and has a passionate and dedicated speedrunning community collaborating to finish it as fast as humanly possible over and over again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons: Minutes to Meltdown (2007)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/minutes-to-meltdown-1762439688162.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When The Simpsons Movie arrived in theaters in 2007, Electronic Arts published a pair of games to ride off of the hopeful success of the film, banking on nostalgia from longtime fans and newcomers alike. The first Simpsons Movie tie-in game was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-minutes-to-meltdown">Minutes to Meltdown</a>, a top-down mobile game played in 30 minute sessions, the same length of time it takes to watch an episode of The Simpsons with commercials. The art style is great, looking like a long-lost isometric Sega Genesis Simpsons game, once again proving that The Simpsons often works well in pixel art. But with only three levels and some very basic puzzles, most fans bounced off this one pretty quickly. Either way, Minutes to Meltdown is officially in the abandonware category, as you can no longer legally purchase it or play it. But hey, at least now you know it once existed. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Game (2007)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-game-1762438924972.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-game">The Simpsons Game</a> was a much bigger and more ambitious swing, launching on nearly every console and handheld in 2007 and giving The Simpsons a big, fun action platformer to coincide with the release of the film. The game is broken up into 16 episodes, with each family member appearing as a playable character and a specific set of goals. The writing was fantastic and funny thanks to the direct contributions of The Simpsons writing staff, the cel shaded polygonal art style was a perfect fit, and each stage was packed with tons of nods to gaming, like references to Grand Theft Auto, The Sims creator Will Wright, Frogger, Space Invaders, and more. Unfortunately the camera was a bit hard to control and the overall game length left much to be desired. A sequel was originally planned but ultimately scrapped, so here’s hoping we see something new when the second Simpsons movie comes out in 2027, 20 years after the release of the first film.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons: Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land (2009)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/itchyscratchymobile-1762439621077.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A year later, EA Games published another isometric pixel art Simpsons game for mobile phones called Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land, which despite its title, doesn’t actually let you play as Itchy or Scratchy. Instead, the Simpsons family does their best to survive their local theme park, which is now overrun with deadly Itchy &amp; Scratchy robots along with a plethora of traps and hazards designed to kill them. While managing to be a bit deeper than EA’s previous Simpsons mobile game, it’s still a fairly simplistic offering that you also can’t download on your phone these days since support for it ended long ago. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons Arcade (2009)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-arcade-1762439513707.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember the 1991 Simpsons Arcade game I praised near the start of this list? Well, in 2009 EA made a mobile exclusive tribute to it, or really, a spiritual successor that was missing lots of spirit. EA’s take on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-arcade">The Simpsons Arcade</a> was still a side-scrolling beat ‘em up where players pulverized various goons and Simpsons characters across Springfield, but with no local multiplayer and only Homer featured as a playable character, it missed out on much of what made the original so fun. Still, since Konami had never (and still hasn’t) ported the original arcade game to mobile, it was fun having a new take on it on the go, even if it wasn’t nearly as great.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Simpsons: Tapped Out (2012)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/simpsons-tapped-out-1762439452759.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’ve seen by now, numerous Simpsons games let you explore Springfield, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simpsons-tapped-out">The Simpsons: Tapped Out</a> let you design and build it yourself to your own liking, and the results were shockingly fun for a mobile game, even if it was occasionally plagued by the usual microtransaction nonsense. Checking in daily to unlock new building, reorganize your town layout, and go through your large pile of Simpsons villager requests was an obsession of mine while waiting for a bus or train to arrive on my morning commute, so much so that I once figured out how to build gigantic 8-bit Nintendo sprites of Super Mario and the Legend of Zelda’s Link made entirely out of Simpsons washing machines, bushes, and mailboxes. Sadly after 12 years of steady updates and content drops, the game’s support officially ended recently and it’s since been delisted from mobile stores, meaning it's a bit tricky if you want to try and play it for the first time this year. But man, when it was at its best it was really cool to carry around my own personal version of Springfield in my pocket.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Dimensions (2015)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/lego-dimensions-simpsons-1762439399129.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Between amiibo, Skylanders, and more, the “toys-to-life” genre of real life physical collectibles you could scan into digital games were all the craze in 2015, and LEGO decided to get in on it big time. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-dimensions">LEGO Dimensions</a> played like your typical LEGO game at the time, combining co-op action platforming and light puzzles, but instead of focusing on one franchise they decided to combine tons of them, including the Ghostbusters, DC Comics, The Goonies, Beetlejuice, and of course, The Simpsons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Real life LEGO sets corresponding to each franchise could be purchased, built, and scanned into the game to unlock in-game characters and rewards, giving us a trio of Simpsons “fun packs” featuring Homer, Bart, and Krusty. You probably already guessed, but this meant absolute hell for both collectors and anyone trying to 100% the game since it required the purchase of tons of different LEGO sets to complete it all. By 2017 the toys to life genre was completely oversaturated, sales fell short for LEGO Dimensions, and future additions were cancelled. Still, it’s pretty cool that this is the only Simpsons game on this list to give us new toys to go with it, and you can still regularly find them for pretty cheap these days, in case you’ve always wanted a tiny LEGO Homer car to put on your shelf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it, a complete history of every Simpsons video game so far, spanning several decades, consoles, handhelds, PC, and more.

                <p>The worlds of Silent Hill and Castlevania have crossed over with Dead by Daylight before, but the latest collaboration between Konami and Behaviour Interactive is taking things even further into The Fog. This time, Silent Hill's Pyramid Head and Castlevania's Dracula are teaming up as The Executioner and The Dark Lord. And they aren't the only guest characters in this 2v8 battle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoxhwNgPaGk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SoxhwNgPaGk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Dead by Daylight's Silent Hill X Castlevania collaboration starts today, November 6, and extends through November 20. Both of the series' respective villains will be joined by a pair of returning heroes: Silent Hill 3's Cheryl Mason and Castlevania's Trevor Belmont. All four characters are available for free during the 2v8 battles for the duration of this event.</p><p>There are also four new outfits--one for each of the returning characters. Trevor's Legendary Outfit essentially transforms him into his descendant, Richter Belmont. Dracula's alternate look is called the Scorched Terror Outfit. Basically, it's what Dracula looks like when he's left in the sun long enough for his skin to blister and peel.</p><p>Cheryl's alternate look is the Awakened Order outfit, which features her as she "embraces a sinister ritual." As for Pyramid Head, he's a glutton for punishment with his Flayed Torturer outfit, which is exactly what it sounds like.</p><p>Earlier this year, Dead by Daylight had crossover collaborations with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-walking-dead-heroes-are-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/1100-6533018/" data-ref-id="1100-6533018">The Walking Dead's heroes</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-hits-new-player-count-record-with-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover/1100-6532544/" data-ref-id="1100-6532544">Five Nights At Freddy's murderous animatronics</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evils-greatest-monsters-unite-in-first-look-at-new-dead-by-daylight-collaboration/1100-6529360/" data-ref-id="1100-6529360">Resident Evil characters</a>. Knowing this game, there are almost certainly more crossovers coming after this one.</p>

As of today, GTA 5's multiplayer mode, GTA Online, is included with the membership on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>GTA Online became a standalone game in 2022, and it was free on PS5 for a period of time.

The subscription service is available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but GTA Online is not included with GTA+ on PC, only console.</p><p>One of the perks of GTA+ is access to a library of Rockstar games, and GTA Online is just the latest. The others include GTA: Vice City - The Definitive Edition, GTA 3 - The Definitive Edition, GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, Bully, Red Dead Redemption, LA Noire, GTA: Liberty City Stories, and GTA: Chinatown Wars. These games are playable as long as your subscription remains active.</p><p>Beyond access to games, GTA+ gives members an in-game cash infusion of GTA$ 500,000 each billing cycle, access to in-game discounts, exclusive in-game vehicles, and special perks in GTA Online like a 100-car garage and a member-only app.</p><p>It remains to be seen what will happen with GTA Online and GTA+ when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> arrives in 2026. As of yet, Rockstar has not announced a multiplayer mode for GTA 6, but given the runaway success of GTA Online, it's as close to a sure thing as possible that GTA 6 will incorporate a multiplayer mode.</p><p>Rockstar Games has been in the news lately after the company fired dozens of workers, saying they leaked company secrets.

Her studio had been working on games with a sustainability focus and she was excited to deepen her knowledge on the topic. I kicked off the jam with a lecture about the need for systemic approaches to sustainability instead of greenwashing, and in response, this indie founder explained that her studio had gotten funding from Meta. Her mood shifted from excitement about her studio and the jam to something more somber as she explained that yes, her team was aware that their game was part of the broader greenwashing efforts of Meta. The social media corporation, she explained, was funding smaller European game studios to fake a commitment to different areas of sustainability, mostly in order to avoid sustainability legislation from the European Union.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most centrally, Meta wanted to be able to argue for industry self-regulation instead of legal sustainability requirements for social media and digital platforms, largely so that they could continue their unsustainable practices unimpeded. She clarified that if the giant corporation really had wanted to work for systemic sustainability, then it could have put its enormous weight behind real, material, and systemic means to achieve that. Her excitement about her project visibly dimmed as she explained that their game and studio was part of the calculated greenwashing efforts of a cynical tech corporation. This was tough to see, and it left me wondering how many more game makers are feeling the same way: standing behind their game and its pro-environmental message in isolation, but also realizing that in its systemic context the game studio is even contributing to the greenwashing of a big corporation. There is just no good solution here: Not taking money from Meta to make a game they were believing in is not good either. This is a rock and a hard place, and from the perspective of a single developer, it can feel as if there is no good way of working towards meaningful sustainability.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-subsidiary-bad-brain-game-studios-is-shutting-down" target="_self" data-discover="true">NetEase subsidiary Bad Brain Game Studios is shutting down</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And indeed, we in the games industry are not satisfied with our industry’s climate change and sustainability efforts.

Despite an abundance of norms, egregious human and environmental rights violations [...] continue."</span></p><p>Figure 1: Game Developers Conference and GameDeveloper.com (2023:24). 2024 State of the Game Industry.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The data that the Game Developers Conference (GDC) &amp; Game Developer shared here also reflects that people in the game industry are well aware of the difference in impact that a small studio can make in comparison to the tech corporations that own the platforms we create and play on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Indie studios aren’t the problem.

On the contrary, they have gotten to work: the Climate SIG of the IGDA is one example. This special interest group has been visible at GDC in presentations and workshops, has published their Environmental Game Design Playbook in 2023, and has been running game jams and regular meetings since 2021. The group has also been connecting with research and teaching on a number of intersections, for example by inviting relevant researchers into their meetings and having them write about the process &nbsp;in the excellent Ecogames book featuring a wealth of academic work on game content and climate . Members have been presenting at academic conferences like the Clash of Realities &nbsp;conference in Cologne in 2022 and been running workshops and panels at GDC .</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other examples of the game industry and academia together tackling sustainability issues include a book about the environmental footprint of the game industry with a focus on the real, material world, the Greening Games Project, which presented its final report in 2023 &nbsp;among a number of scientific publications, &nbsp;and Nordic universities have banded together to discuss how to teach about sustainability, resulting in a yearly game jam and exchange that shows students the somber reality and yet still inspires hope and creativity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The material reality of the games industry is dire. The significant carbon emissions and energy usage of the developers, distribution, and players are only the beginning. &nbsp;Digital games are also made possible by and in turn enable the colonial exploitation of the planet and its people &nbsp;all while normalizing designed obsolescence in the very core of our tech and cultural industries, even though there are recent signs for a move away from this approach. In a later chapter, Busch et.al. offer an extensive overview over the various sustainability crises that games and gaming are connected to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In summary: We need to radically change the ways in which we produce society on a systemic level to address the challenges of climate change. This also means that we need to take a close look at not only what messages we build into our games, but also at how we make these games. Because games and the industries they are a part of, tech and culture, are so intimately connected to the climate crisis, we also need to examine the context in which they are produced. There is already grass-roots work being done both in building organizations, collecting knowledge, and building connections between research and industry. However, if it is literally possible that entire game studios are the greenwashing of big tech corporations, even while making legitimate sustainability games, then we really need to think outside of the box to reach the kind of holistic and systemic change that we need. In the face of these challenges this chapter asks:&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"What would constitute successful and meaningful climate action in the games industry?"</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Systemic Change">Systemic Change</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The report Making Peace with Nature from the United Nations Environment Programme explains that the needed "Transformation will involve a fundamental change in the technological, economic, and social organization of society, including world views, norms, values and governance." &nbsp;From this perspective, if there is to be any chance to avoid climate catastrophe, climate change needs to be addressed through real, material changes in our global production systems, mechanisms of governance, and in the way we structure our economic systems and incentives. These changes need to be accompanied by cultural, societal, and normative changes, but those immaterial elements cannot stand alone. In short, we need to radically rethink how we produce society.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here, the fact that games are, as mentioned above, in one way or another connected to many of the biggest sustainability issues we are currently facing, might also put us in a position to create positive change in many places. Especially digital gaming could be an influential starting point for said material as well as discursive sea-change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This perspective already exists in the games industry. Taking again the data from the 2024 State of the Game Industry (GDC &amp; Game Developer, 2023), the report chooses to cite a number of very interesting quotes, for example this one:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They have been diligent but there is still the silent belief that ‘first we make money, then we clean after ourselves,’ without accepting that this is pretty much the mindset that brought the global society to this state. The environmental crisis seems a much larger problem that my current company believes to be able to tackle."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This shows that there already is an understanding that the climate crisis and sustainability issues need to be addressed system-wide, with actions that go beyond the level of the individual studio. The quote also calls for us to not consider sustainability as an after-though but to treat it as a priority from the start. As a takeaway here, a sustainable games industry would have to be part and object of a radical and systemic change in how it operates. This change needs to also encompass the material world and needs to extend beyond discourse and discussion.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Impeding Transformation">Impeding Transformation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, the UN report also explains that "some attractive and feasible actions can impede transformation", &nbsp; and transformation here means the fundamental change to how we build society that is mentioned in the paragraph above. As a mechanism for this impediment of transformation, the report explains that "The changes that appear most feasible may be those that do not contribute to, or even impede, transformative change, for instance by retaining or even consolidating the power interests vested in the status quo (see Section 5.3)." &nbsp;Here it says that "Some individuals and organizations also have substantial stakes in maintaining the status quo. These vested interests may oppose changes that disrupt their livelihoods, market shares and future revenues." &nbsp;This is the United Nations stating two things:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1. People and groups in positions of power will obstruct meaningful and systemic climate action because it would impact their wealth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2. They can distract us from focusing on the necessary systemic change through ineffective, but enticing alternative actions, e.g. greenwashing</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parts of this warning can be applied in a fairly straight-forward manner to digital games. Games are published by and played on the platforms of some of the most powerful and influential international corporations on the planet. They, at least in the short term, benefit from the continuation of the hardware race that they are currently winning. Chapter 5 will offer more pragmatic ways to think about systemic change and there we will come back to the responsibility of powerful actors and organizations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Green Washing and Individualization – Why we need Collective Action</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What are the "attractive and feasible actions [that] can impede transformation"? &nbsp;One way of understanding this formulation relates to a common narrative about climate change in both contemporary culture and games that presents it as the responsibility of individuals instead of groups and mostly a question of what we believe instead of how we collectively act. In a call for action, preceding the urgent warning of the United Nations by 20 years, Maniates &nbsp;states that "the forces that systematically individualize responsibility for environmental degradation must be challenged." This narrative positions individuals and their actions as the final and sole responsible for climate catastrophe and, importantly, individual behavioral change as the only avenue for change. It disguises material and systemic problems as exclusively issues of individual virtue and character and makes it impossible to even consider the role of the vested industrial interests that benefit from the status quo, like the fossil fuel industries. &nbsp;This raises the question of whether the individualization of climate responsibility then is not only an involuntary consequence of neoliberalism, &nbsp;but a purposeful distraction and greenwashing by the fossil-fuel industry. &nbsp; Even the concept of the "carbon footprint" is a development of the Exxon Mobile concern as a distraction, &nbsp;so that we all focus on the responsibility of each individual instead of coming together to change the world. Again: The carbon footprint, the entire metaphor, is toxic greenwashing from oil companies. This is what the UN is warning us about, the vested interests benefiting from the maintenance of the system that is destroying the planet, and that those might hinder effective and systemic climate action.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here then, the individualization of climate action can be seen as a kind of purposeful greenwashing: an attempt to create a narrative in which the systemic change of society cannot even be imagined, and so the necessary systemic and radical transformation becomes impossible to even consider. Maniates’s &nbsp;call might not have been meant to address games specifically, but it remains relevant while one of the proposed uses of games is the education of players. Research about sustainability education has shown that it is both possible and necessary to go beyond placing the responsibility for climate change at the feet of customers in a market and to address sustainability, together with the students, from a systemic and inter-disciplinary perspective. &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, games are perfectly suited to portray the workings of systems and to open them up for critical reflection in ways that other media are incapable of. &nbsp; &nbsp; Educating players to see the workings of destructive and exploitative systems and the ways in which they are implicated (and the games they are currently playing are implicated) is definitely a good start and something that we will come back to later. However, the conclusion here for defining a sustainable games industry is that it has to resist individualization and include collective and organized action. This is also something that the industry on some level already understands.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Others spoke to feelings of disillusionment, frustration, and helplessness when it comes to making a positive impact on the environment—especially related to the issue of personal versus collective responsibility."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Beyond Discourse towards Material Change">Beyond Discourse towards Material Change</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is a good step to show, also in the content and message of the games that we make, that we must approach sustainability questions collectively and that it is counterproductive to focus on individual responsibility. This is also typically the first thing we think about when considering games and sustainability. Games as culture can change the way players think and feel about their environment and can in this way create societal change. The possibility of changing the way players see the world and to inspire them towards systemic change is valid. That said, it should not be seen as a reason to keep polluting or being part of the systems that create climate change. It is not only about making games for sustainability, but also about making games sustainably. This is a central point, and one that other authors in this book discuss from different perspectives. David ten Cate discusses the need for ecological games to also consider how they are being made as a part of an economic system and Jennifer Estaris discusses from the view of a designer how she sees the potential of games for her concept of sea change and the connections of what is in our hearts and how we act. So how can we make sure that we together also take that next step, reach beyond discourse, and collectively change our systems?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Material and Collective Change">Material and Collective Change</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the first planning meeting for the Nordic sustainability-themed game jam, a member of the Finnish game industry presented the work they had done to get their studio to address sustainability issues. Amazingly, and at that point ahead of their time, they included emissions by the players who were playing their game into the carbon emission calculations of their studio. These emissions during play are often one of the biggest sources of emissions related to digital games and considering these the responsibility of the studio shows an honest and real engagement for sustainability. They then bought carbon offsets from the highest-rated sellers that they could find to make up for their emissions. However, this is also where their efforts ended. First it is important to say that this is not intended as an example of a member of the game industry being naïve or doing something stupid. On the contrary, I would consider this an exemplary effort to do their part in addressing the climate crisis. That being said, it is important to also admit that, in this discursive prison of the individualization of climate responsibility that has been built in contemporary culture for decades, approaches to material change have also been only allowed to be imagined in limited ways. Here, material change starts and also ends with carbon offsets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Carbon offsets have been heavily criticized for various reasons in research. Offsets frequently do not really work, binding carbon only for short periods but calculated as if the carbon would stay quasi-permanently bound, and with a lack of oversight are open for exploitation, cheating, and the continuation of the same colonial and logics that constitute the climate crisis. &nbsp; &nbsp;They even continue to perpetuate the mindset and system of trading the right to pollute, along with the mindset of individual customer responsibility that the polluting industries promote . At this point, issues with carbon offsets are so widely known, and in their worst excesses so absurd as to be funny, that they were a topic of the comedy show "Last Week Tonight" in 2022. &nbsp;At the time of writing in late 2024, we’re once again in a round of CEOs getting sued because their companies over-estimated their emission reductions by an average of 1000%. &nbsp;Here carbon offsetting is an example for the "attractive and feasible actions" that "can impede transformation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This shows that even a collective, systemic intervention like carbon trading and the offset industry can be insufficient or even something that impedes transformative change, especially if done instead of reducing energy use or a restructuring of technological infrastructure. The perspectives from the industry already share this conclusion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We do some carbon offsetting, but that feels like a Band-Aid on a bleeding wound. Not much is being done, or not that I know of, to address deeper issues like the energy consumption taken up with processor-intensive game development and maintaining our massive internal networks."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is why it was heartbreaking to see the honest and commendable effort of our Finnish colleague end with carbon offsets.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Thinking in &quot;Systemic Change&quot;">Thinking in "Systemic Change"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time when this happened, I was not prepared to offer real alternatives. Honestly, it would still be difficult. This speaks to how effective the individualization discourse is that we have difficulties even thinking about collective changes. Systemic change is tricky because we are used to the systems we live in, and it can be challenging to see a bigger picture. It also often requires some kind of safe space and trust to be able to pitch systemic change, because any suggestion of systemic change can frequently result in having to present and justify a ready and solved alternative system which is of course impossible to do. If the justifications that are demanded from any change and alternative are not also required from the status quo, which is currently destroying our planet to the point that the UN calls for fundamental change, then this indicates a bias towards the existing system that is likely in some way in the head of each of us, and possibly an unsafe space. This book then also tries to both offer some examples for what such change could look like, so that we can all use them in conversations and in our thinking, and it tries to grow the community of game workers who already care about this conversation and who can be this safe space for all of us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a later chapter I will offer more examples for collective, material, and systemic change that are meant to be starting points for finding new ways of meaningful climate action. This is work in progress.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But let us consider this example: Some games already offer an Eco Mode. This means that players can choose to play the game at lower performance to reduce emissions and energy costs. What if we argued, together, for legislation that required games to show the player a summary of their gaming energy use and estimated emissions at the end of each week, kind of like your phone shows you which apps drain your battery the most when it is about to die? Now we would take a first step into a conversation around the environmental responsibility of designers and players and start a competition for creating the most frugal games that get the most amazing performance out of the least amount of emissions. There could be collective achievements for players connected to the use of Eco Mode, and then at a later step, once we have built acceptance for eco modes, they could become industry default and even policy. This would be a longer process, but we have already taken the first steps and with our eyes set to collective, material and systemic change we can continue this path together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conclusion:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This chapter asked the question: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"What would constitute successful and meaningful climate action in the games industry?"</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Based on the discussion of industry feedback in connection to research and the reports of the United Nations, successful and meaningful climate action in the games industry would:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1. move from individual to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>collective responsibility and action</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2. go beyond the discursive towards </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>material change</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">3. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>resist greenwashing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that (purposefully) impedes transformative change and</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">4. lead to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>systemic change</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the way we produce society.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Returning to the story of the indie developer working on a sustainability game with money from Meta, I would like to argue that many of us can on some level relate to their experience.
