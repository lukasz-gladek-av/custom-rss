<p>In a series of posts made on social media by dataminers, the immediate future of XDefiant was outlined – but bear in mind that it’s still subject to change. In recent days, a slew of dataminers published imagery online revealing what factions are coming soon to XDefiant, Ubisoft’s brand-new first-person shooter, and what weapons will help flesh out the upcoming seasons.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-seasons-ahead">Seasons Ahead</h2>



<p>In a series of images <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-xdefiant-year-1-weapons-season-2-faction-highwaymen-and-a-lot-more-leaked-via-datamine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">uncovered by MP1ST</a>, it was discovered by dataminers that the second season of XDefiant will introduce Far Cry New Dawn’s Highwayman faction. Per the claims, this faction will run <a href="https://x.com/TxLimiited/status/1809340910515163263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an on-theme turret system</a> as an ability – but nothing more is known at present. Further, it was claimed that the weapons for season two will be the PP19 (SMG), SPAS (shotgun), and an unnamed LMG.</p>



<p>Days ago, the game’s first season was released, introducing Rainbow Six Siege’s GSK as a playable faction and bringing in the LVOA-C assault rifle, L115 sniper, and the Sawed-off Shotgun.</p>



<p>The dataminers went a little further than just season two, though. In a few shots posted online, we were given a rough look at what’s sketched out for further down the road. It was suggested that season three will introduce a new DMR, the M1A, and the FAMAS. It might be a misprint by dataminers, as the M1A, in some cases, <strong>is </strong>a DMR.</p>



<p>While season two focuses on the Highwayman faction (per the claims), the third season of the game will pivot to look at Assassin’s Creed – which was always inevitable for XDefiant. Down the road, we’ll see Ghost Recon become the sole focus of season four, and the earliest reports suggest that season five <a href="https://x.com/AgainTxL/status/1808615127739973869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will be based around Rabbids</a>. It’s all on the table – Ubisoft recently said that every game could be considered as an XDefiant faction in some way.</p>

All she wants to do is play with her bizarre powers and see lots of people suffer. This led her to join Amnesia, which she’d heard was full of interesting people. But when it turned out that the leader of Amnesia was obsessed with gaining further power in order to become a Re-Birth, Uzuki lost interest. The solution was simple: All she had to do was rip things apart until the fun came back. Thus begins her story of rebellion.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a> allows you to slow time and slice objects into pieces, their 3D models bisecting precisely along the lines of your swipes. For this reason alone, I think you should own it. Now you can own it DRM-free on GOG.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Metal Gear spin-off <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metal_gear_rising_revengeance">arrived on the digital store</a> earlier this week. It's currently 40% reduced to a mere £12, just as it is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/235460/METAL_GEAR_RISING_REVENGEANCE/">over on Steam for the summer sale</a>.
</p>
<p>Revengeance communicates most of what you need to know by being called "Revengeance". It's a Metal Gear spin-off that leans heavily on that series' high camp and bombast, starring cyberntic pretty boy Raiden as he does third-person knife crimes against enemies, some of whom are robot dinosaurs, some of whom are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-7-worst-us-presidents-in-video-games">Presidents</a>. 
</p>
<p>Another shorthand description: Revengeance is also peak period Platinum Games.
</p>
<p>Alice0 was a big fan, in particular for a moment we can colloquially refer to as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-better-feelies-or-rules-of-nature">RULES OF NATURE</a>. Rich Stanton <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/replaying-revengeance-difficulty-obsession-and-fighting-games">was also a big fan</a>, going into detail about the strengths of the genre and Revengeance's particular combat system:
</p>
<blockquote>Revengeance is of a genre that's never found a natural home on the PC, and so perhaps deserves a little more attention than it's received – because it's one of the greatest 3D combat systems ever, a precision masterpiece built around an irresistible hook. This genre is also often misunderstood in terms of total running time or the cutscene-based narratives, both of which are irrelevant next to the true purpose. Stylish fighting, and plenty of it.</blockquote>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-team-has-sent-multiple-builds-to-gog-and-is-waiting-for-the-green-light-to-launch.920658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-has-sent-multiple-builds-to-gog-and-is-waiting-for-the-green-light-to-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long awaited Fallout London total conversion mod for Fallout 4 may be really close to launching, at long last. Sure, we first heard that tune a year ago, but then the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to delay</a> it due to the impending release of Bethesda's Starfield.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the modding team set a new April 2024 release window, but Bethesda once again inadvertently <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-mod-is-officially-delayed-due-to-bethesdas-upcoming-fallout-4-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused a delay</a> when it updated Fallout 4 for the next-generation version.</p>
<p>Fallout London fans have been waiting for around three months, but today, the team <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1809555735681913115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a small update, hinting that the time is nigh. GOG, which has partnered with the modders to release the total conversion, has received multiple release candidate builds. Once they have been verified and approved, the launch will take place.</p>
<p><em>There has been a lot of speculation regarding our upcoming release, and we wanted to open up and clear the air for our core supporters. The bottom line is that we've sent several builds over to GOG for QA testing and are waiting for the final green light. Once they've completed the process of double-checking that Fallout London and its installer work on all supported machines, we should be good to go. (Yes, we have our own installer, and downgrader too!) It is in all of our interests that this final QA process is carried out in full, and we are very thankful that GOG is assisting. </em></p>
<p><em>While it may seem like not a lot is going on, we can assure you that the heads of the department have been working non-stop behind the scenes during this time to make the release build as good as it can be. The end is in sight.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Fallout London requires Fallout 4 and all its DLCs. Its playable area is as large as the base game plus the Far Harbor DLC, hosting 53 main quests, 35 side quests, 25 faction quests, 64 miscellaneous quests, 16 branching gang quests, 7 companions (5 of which are fully voiced with detailed relationship levels and their own companion quests), and over 90K recorded voice lines.</p>
<p>Are you excited to play it soon?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/team-falcons-wins-first-ewc-trophy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Saudi Esports-backed organisation, Team Falcons, has secured the first trophy at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh. The three-man team consisting of Biffle, Shifty, and Soka stormed to success against 21 other teams, beating the likes of Fnatic, Guild Esports, and Natus Vincere to the punch to secure a $200,000 prize and 1,000 Club Points.</p>



<p>This was the first trophy to be handed out at the prestigious event, which boasts a whopping $60 million prize pool. With more than 20 esports games being showcased at the event, it’s on track to become the most historic ‘tournament’ in the industry’s relatively short history.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-first-champions">The First Champions</h2>



<p>There were some murmurings in the community when the first Esports World Cup trophy went to a Saudi-backed organisation, but there’s no denying that the trio at Team Falcons played remarkably well. In the Group Stage of the Warzone portion of the EWC, Team Falcons managed to secure a staggering 255.2 points, putting them more than 100 points ahead of the runner-up organisation, SvGe Esports.</p>



<p>As the finals closed in, Team Falcons retained that lead, putting up a total score of 227.9, sitting 20 points ahead of Fnatic – and almost 200 points in front of Team Heretics, the bottom-most team in the table. On July 5, the news hit social circles that the Falcons had won every one of the three matches they’d entered, putting up some of the best plays in the tournament.</p>



<p>Biffle has long been considered one of the best Warzone players in the world. He won the World Series of Warzone 2023 Global Finals alongside Shifty and Sage, netting a $100,000 prize. He’s been competing in Warzone since the scene opened its doors to the idea of an esports ecosystem, and he shows no signs of slowing.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, we’ll see the <a href="https://esportsworldcup.com/en/competition/tournament-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">League of Legends Grand Final</a> unfold at the Esports World Cup – so stay tuned.</p>

            <p>The success of Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC was only possible due to the base game's "negative reception".</p>
<p>That's according to senior quest designer Paweł Sasko, who acknowledged that if the original game's 2020 release hadn't been "as negative as it was", "it couldn't have been possible" for expansion Phantom Liberty to have "worked significantly better at launch".</p>

<p>"Phantom Liberty worked significantly better at its launch because we completely changed the production style, something that couldn’t have been possible if the initial reception of the game wasn’t as negative as it was," Sasko told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-controversial-launch-helped-phantom-liberty-success/">TheGamer</a> at Gamescom Latam.</p>
<p>"It changed me and us as a studio."</p>
<p>Three-and-a-half years after its disastrous December 2020 debut, after dozens of patches and the launch of last year's Phantom Liberty expansion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">CD Projekt Red no longer has anyone working on Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>As Tom summarised for us at the time, just 17 people had been working on the game still as of 29th February this year. As of 30th April, that number dropped to zero.</p>
<p>It's a small but significant moment for CD Projekt as it finally leaves Cyberpunk 2077 behind - with the vast bulk of its development might now focused on its next game in The Witcher series, currently still codenamed Polaris.</p>

            <p>EA Sports FC 25 will release in September 2024, with a seven-day early-access period expected to launch on 20th September.</p>
<p>That's according to French website <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1dw1ozu/ea_sports_fc_2025_releasing_september_27/">Dealabs</a> and prolific leaker billbil-kun, who has accurately leaked gaming intel ahead of time in the past.</p>

<p>"EA Sports FC 25 will be released on 27th September, 2024," the website claims. "The game will be available in 2 editions, Standard and Ultimate. Owners of the Ultimate edition will benefit from 7 days' early access, starting on 20th September, 2024. EA Play members will also benefit from this early access with a 10-hour trial."</p>
<p>According to the same site, the Standard and Ultimate editions are expected to retail for around £60/€70/$70 and £90/€100/$100, respectively.</p>
<p>PlayStation Game Size has also since publicly corroborated Dealabs' claim that the football game will be released on PS4, which may mean it's also coming to Xbox One, too.</p> <div>

            <p>Former LA Noire developers are reportedly working on a new psychological thriller set in 1940s Los Angeles, "Sowden House".</p>
<p>Two separate posts have popped up on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4FK9_NS4cH/">Instagram</a> from performer, composer, and producer Freyja Garbett, who says they've been working on a "HUGE" project "writing for a video game [...] from the creators of LA Noire".</p>

<p>"From the creators of LA Noire comes Sowden House, a psychological thriller also set in the 1940’s in LA that will have you questioning your sanity," Garbett <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4FK9_NS4cH/">teased</a>.</p>
<p>"This project has been HUGE and it is still unravelling and revealing itself to me. I never thought I’d be writing for [a] video game but I’m grateful for the opportunity!"</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanoire/comments/1dp0m8l/potential_leak_of_upcoming_sowden_house/">Potential Leak of Upcoming “Sowden House” Psychological Thriller (From Creators of L.A Noire)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gennaroandriani/">u/gennaroandriani</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanoire/">lanoire</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p>
<p>Whilst the 1940s setting will immediately take fans back to Team Bondi's excellent thriller 2011 LA Noire, it's unclear if Sowden House is a direct sequel, prequel, a spin-off, or an entirely new game that draws on the team's experience.</p>
<p>However, as the sleuths at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanoire/comments/1dp0m8l/potential_leak_of_upcoming_sowden_house/">GamingLeaksandRumours subreddit</a> posit, Sowden House was the home of Dr. George Hodel, a physician who was long-suspected of the Black Dahlia murder… which again links us straight back to LA Noire, of course.</p>
<p>Is this cast-iron proof that a new LA Noire game is on the way? Sadly not. But even if it's only a rumour for now, it should be welcome news indeed for fans of Team Bondi. The studio sadly shuttered in 2011, the same year in which LA Noire was released.</p>

            <p>You can't purchase Outrun 2006: Coast 2 Coast digitally on PC anymore, because the Ferrari license expired and it was removed from sale back in 2010. We live in a cruel universe. The excellent, stylish racing game is still playable if you do own a copy, however, and it just received a fan update that'll make it run better on modern machines.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The update, created by developer emoose, is a "wrapper DLL" and a replacement executable that should work with either the Steam or disc versions of the game. The standout tweaks include improved reflections, borderless windowed mode, a UI that supports new aspect ratios, framerate fixes and improved loading times.
</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/blob/master/README.md">full change notes</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Graphics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>UI can now scale to different aspect ratios without stretching (requires UIScalingMode = 1 in INI)</li>
<li>Game scene &amp; UI textures can be dumped/replaced</li>
<li>Allows disabling vehicle LODs, reducing the ugly pop-in as they get closer</li>
<li>Fixed Z-buffer precision issues that caused heavy Z-fighting and distant object pop-in</li>
<li>Lens flare effect now loads from correct path without needing to change game files</li>
<li>Stage objects such as traffic cones now only disappear once they're actually off-screen</li>
<li>Fixes certain effects like engine backfiring which failed to appear when using controllers</li>
<li>Anisotropic filtering &amp; transparency supersampling can be forced, greatly reducing aliasing around the edges of the track</li>
<li>Reflection rendering resolution can be increased from the default 128x128</li>
</ul>
<strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Built-in framelimiter to prevent speedups, framerate can be partially unlocked with game running at 60FPS internally</li>
<li>Restored XInput rumble code from the Xbox release, allowing gear shifts/drifts/crashes/etc to give feedback</li>
<li>Xbox Series impulse triggers are supported and can be tweaked inside INI</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bugfixes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Prevents save corruption bug when remapping controls with many input devices connected</li>
<li>Fixed C2C ranking scoreboards not updating on Steam and other releases due to faulty anti-piracy checks</li>
<li>Pegasus animation's clopping sound effect will now end correctly</li>
<li>Text related to the now-defunct online service can be hidden</li>
<li>Automatically disables DPI scaling on the game window to fix scaling issues</li>
</ul>
<strong>Enhancements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Game can now run in borderless windowed mode; mouse cursor will now be hidden while game is active</li>
<li>Load times heavily reduced by disabling framelimiter/vsync during load screens</li>
<li>Music can now be loaded from uncompressed WAV or lossless FLAC files, if they exist with the same filename</li>
<li>Allows intro splash screens to be skipped</li>
<li>Music track can be changed mid-race via Q and E buttons, or Back/RS+Back on controller (CDSwitcher must be enabled in INI first)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If I could snap my fingers and bring a racing game back, it would be Coast 2 Coast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-beautiful-game-inside-outrun">It is art</a>. To my mind it's the best OutRun game, and it would be wonderful to play it on Steam Deck without needing to buy a physical copy or to ask an older boy for help first. 
</p>
<p>You'll find the latest release of OutRun2006Tweaks and install instructions <a href="https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/releases">over on GitHub.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/clayster-dropped-by-royal-ravens/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clayster-says-it-%E2%80%98might-be-time%E2%80%99-as-he%E2%80%99s-dropped-by-royal-ravens.920577/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/clayster-dropped-by-royal-ravens/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Now that the Carolina Royal Ravens’ CDL season has ended, the organisation is sizing up the road ahead. It was revealed that the team is dropping James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks, one of the most veteran personalities in the Call of Duty esports scene and one of the most impactful competitors still actively playing. This means that the iconic player, who has been competing in Call of Duty for more than fifteen years, won’t appear at the Esports World Cup, where he was due to represent ReKTGlobal.</p>



<p>Following the release of the news, Clayster posted a string of emotional messages on Twitter, one of which mentioned the line ‘think it might be time.’ At the start of this CDL season, Clayster referenced retirement should he need to once again face the anxiety and politics of ‘Rostermania’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-an-era">End of an Era?</h2>



<p>Clayster has spent many years at the top of his game, and in what could be considered his twilight years, he has remained a stalwart IGL in the Call of Duty League space. He has played through this season with the Carolina Royal Ravens, and while the team failed to make it to COD Champs, the squad contributed plenty of entertaining scenes to the year’s action.</p>



<p>To date, he has won three world championship titles, making him one of the winningest Call of Duty players of all time.</p>



<p>When the news regarding his departure from the Royal Ravens broke, Clayster said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Really feel like my life has been crashing down over the last couple years and this just might be the final nail in the coffin. Immense sadness and so much regret when all I do is pour myself into my job and my loved ones, just never feel like it’s enough. No f***in point.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then mentioned ‘disappearing’ social media rather than dealing with another period of desperately hoping he’ll be picked up by a team. Clay has long been known to wear his heart on his sleeve, being one of the most vocal players in the business. During the last Call of Duty League Major, Clay clashed with Toronto Ultra’s Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst, suggesting the young player should ‘kill himself’ after a bout of trash talk.</p>



<p>Claster capped off his slew of messages on Twitter by writing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Any opportunities outside of playing bang my line, literally open to anything at this point. Think it might be time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When this season kicked off, Clayster said he’d rather retire than go through Rostermania again. This is the between-season period that sees organisations mess with their rosters, and it typically results in many players being dropped – and hopefully picked up again by some other squad. Clayster was hoping he’d stick with the Royal Ravens during the off-season, but it’s clear that won’t be the case.</p>

<p>"We are in ongoing communications with Tencent, and there are some projects that are underway but I will refrain from commenting on any details at present, including in terms of any output over the next three years," Square Enix's president, Yosuke Matsuda, <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/library/docs/210618/page04.html">said</a> back in 2021.</p>
<p>Neither company have formerly confirmed what these projects are, but it's thought the Final Fantasy game is in development after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">an unannounced Nier mobile game was shelved</a> last year.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi recently said he's reluctant to work on a Final Fantasy game again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creator-would-prefer-to-keep-enjoying-final-fantasy-14-as-a-player-than-work-on-the-series-again">as he's having too much fun playing Final Fantasy 14</a>.</p>
<p>"If I take on the Final Fantasy brand again, I don't know if I'll be able to genuinely enjoy Final Fantasy 14 as much," he said.</p>
<p>Talking of Final Fantasy 14, director and producer Naoki "Yoshi P" Yoshida recently offered his "sincere apologies" for the issues identified in the early access build of its highly-anticipated expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>In a blog post published shortly after the expansion went live for early access players last weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-apologises-for-issues-identified-in-the-early-access-build-of-dawntrail">Yoshida thanked players for playing and assured them that the team was "investigating" the causes of the most pressing issues</a>, including transition freezes on Xbox, and broken animations across all platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-lead-says-snowdrop-engine-still-needs-to-be-improved-a-lot-for-an-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tom Clancy's XDefiant, Ubisoft San Francisco's first game as lead studio since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a>, launched this May, around three years after the original announcement.</p>
<p>The free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game immediately registered strong player counts, becoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-is-reportedly-the-fastest-ubisoft-game-to-reach-1-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft's fastest game to reach one million players</a>. Last week, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-registered-11-million-players-in-five-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that XDefiant had hosted 11 million players over its first five weeks.</p>
<p>Despite the large fan base, the game has some issues, especially bugs. When a fellow player <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1809020713954914444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> to XDefiant Executive Producer Mark Rubin that the game might have been rushed, the developer replied with a lengthy explanation that the engine (Ubisoft Massive's Snowdrop) wasn't envisioned for that genre and, therefore, still needs a lot of improvement.</p>
<p><em>Rushed out? No. What we have is an engine that has only ever been an MMO. And so all of the infrastructure for an FPS has had to be built up from the ground floor. Even Call of Duty started on ID tech, which was a shooter engine. Apex Legends started on a shooter engine. But for us, we are working on developing all new tech in an engine that was designed for something else. That being said, the engine is really great, but it does require a lot of work, and with that work comes a lot of bugs that other engines have already worked out. We're not a shooter that's been out for 20 years. If you like what we are trying to do, stick around, and you'll see things improve and new features get added. But if the game isn't for you, that's ok; you can move on.</em></p>
<p><em>It's not that it's outdated. It's more just that it wasn't made to do first-person shooters, so there is a lot to do and to improve.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Snowdrop was devised for Tom Clancy's The Division. Later, its incredible potential convinced Ubisoft to use it in many other games, such as Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle and its sequel, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, and The Settlers: New Allies, among others. XDefiant is not the first game powered by Snowdrop to launch, as Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launched in December 2023. However, that game was a single player title with optional co-op, whereas a competitive multiplayer shooter has far different needs.</p>
<p>How long will Ubisoft San Francisco need to iron out Snowdrop's kinks remains to be seen. Meanwhile, XDefiant launched Season 1 earlier this week, launching the GS Kommando faction from Rainbow Six, three new maps (Clubhouse, Daytona, Rockefeller), three new weapons available through the free Battle Pass tier, two new modes (Capture the Flag and Bomb, the latter of which is coming later in the season), and Ranked Play.</p>

            <p>Construct 'n' destruct sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/besiege">Besiege</a> recently got a splashy expansion in The Splintered Sea, which Nic enjoyed a lot in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/besiege-splintered-sea-review">his review</a> while calling it compact, small and brisk. Apparently Nic wasn't alone in this opinion: its developers now say they're working on a free update that will expand the expansion and make its campaign 50% longer.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The update will add five new levels to The Splintered Sea and will release on July 22nd.
</p>
<p>One of the levels will feature a tentacle beast that can rip apart your vessels, as seen in one of the previous Splintered Sea trailers. Another will challenge your steering, by having you build a small ship you need to guide through a series of closing gates. Apparently another will feature a battle against a swarm of sharks.
</p>
<p>"We’ve also been experimenting with the idea of adding additional challenges to levels that, while not required for completion, can offer a much greater test of your ability," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/346010/view/4237406000171593409">the announcement</a>. The offered example is a series of crates the player can choose to smash through while still completing a level within the time limit.
</p>
<p>It's nice to see Spiderling Studios taking feedback onboard and working to make the expansion more substantial - particualrly because it wasn't at all bad in the first place, and it would have been easy to leave it as it was. Aside from those dinkonyms above, Nic already referred to it as "an awesome and incredibly complex and worthwhile thing."</p>

It’s boring, plot points aren’t explained properly, and it is by and large unimportant, or so go the criticisms. Of course, what those complaints don’t tell you is that a lot of the people behind them are also skipping through large swaths of the story. It’s not a new problem to <em>Final Fantasy 14</em>, but it is one that <em>Dawntrail </em>is bringing back to the forefront. Some <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> players have a problem of their own, and it’s a lack of willingness to engage with the game’s methodical storytelling in its entirety. - Willa Rowe <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-players-need-to-read-a-book-1851573545&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-players-need-to-read-a-book-1851573545">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e37b9f3aee44b9cc02fcfde6b4c5313" data-recommend-id="image://9e37b9f3aee44b9cc02fcfde6b4c5313" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A PS5 and PS4 sit in front of a colorful background.
