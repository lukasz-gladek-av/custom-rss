                <p>Coffee Stain, the publisher behind Goat Simulator, Valheim, and Satisfactory, has announced a new roguelike called Into the Unwell. In development at Swedish studio She Was Such A Good Horse, the game is designed to look like an early 20th-century cartoon.</p><p>Built around cooperative hack-and-slash mechanics, Into the Unwell focuses on chaotic gameplay and over-the-top enemies and environments. Its most striking feature is its art style, which specifically pulls on "rubber hose" animation associated with cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom and Jerry, and early Looney Tunes. Its aesthetic also seems evocative of the imagery of animated films like Alice in Wonderland.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2tBGtZXwM8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s2tBGtZXwM8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>While similar in inspiration to </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cuphead/" data-ref-id="5000-285254">Cuphead</a><span>, Into the Unwell is distinct in that it features 3D combat and platforming. The announcement trailer shows off some of the environmental challenges and boss fights that players can expect from the game, which seem from this short glimpse that they might be quite punishing.</span></p><p>According to a press release, the gameplay will also embrace the weird and psychedelic vibes of the aesthetics. Coffee Stain writes, "Players will find themselves in a cartoonish fever dream where they'll encounter eccentric anthropomorphic enemies, and attempt boss fights as bizarre as they are belligerent."</p><p>Into the Unwell is built to be played solo or with up to four players in co-op, and it is launching in Steam Early Access in the near future. It is the debut game from studio She Was Such A Good Horse, which is composed of a handful of veteran developers from across the games industry. No details have been shared about whether it is coming to other platforms beyond PC.</p>

Now dubbed Stranger Than Heaven, the game takes place in Japan during 1915. In the trailer, we get some looks at the scenery and nightlife of the time period, along with some glimpses of hard-hitting, bloody action gameplay.</p><p>The story trailer showcases our main character in a smoky nightclub watching a performance before going outside for a panoramic view of Japan, showing how modernization and increased international influence have transformed the country. While the previous trailer for Stranger than Heaven showed the time setting as 1915--the Taisho Era--this trailer indicates the action is taking place in 1943, which would be in the midst of World War II.

At the end, Daito converses with a clearly Western character--who even drops a 1940's slur asking about Daito's ethnic origins--only for Daito to reveal that he has blue eyes, something associated with Western heritage.</p><p>No platforms or a release date were mentioned, but we assume that Stranger than Heaven will be targeting current-gen consoles and PC.</p><p>Developing....</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-studios-project-century-gets-a-proper-name-and-a-stylish-new-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Cast your mind back to the distant days of last December, and you might remember Sega unveiling Project Century, a curious new venture from Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. Well, it's not been given a proper name alongside a new trailer.
</p>
<p>
Project Century's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-new-virtua-fighter-sonic-racing-and-like-a-dragon">initial showing</a> was eye-catching but not entirely informative, revealing it to be a Yakuza-style third-person action game with real-time combat set in an open city located somewhere in 1915. And honestly, its latest appearance isn't a whole lot more illuminating. But! We've shifted to 1943 this time around, perhaps suggesting the game - just like its codename implies - does indeed unfold across the course of 100 years.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that curiosity, we get an extremely evocative new trailer, featuring some era-appropriate music, a whole lot of fisticuffs, and more of that lovely warm art style. More crucially though, Sega has jettisoned the Project Century moniker in favour of its final title, Stranger Than Heaven.

<p>
But, unfortunately, that's your lot. There's no hint of a release date, or even the platforms Stranger Than Heaven might be coming to, so for now about all we can do is soak up the ambience of its new trailer and patiently wait to learn more.

		<p>Semblance developer Nyamakop has revealed Relooted, a heisting game that has ties back to a very real issue facing cultures around the world. Relooted is in development for Xbox and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Relooted Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KgPxPfXb734?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in the near future where a treaty has been signed that is meant to force museums to repatriate artifacts to their home countries – most significantly for this game, to Africa – museums have found a loophole that only artifacts on display need to be repatriated, so shove everything back into storage.</p>
<p>In Retooled, you manage a team based in Johannesburg in South Africa, following leads and cooking up plans to break in to museums and private collections around the world and steal those artifacts back.</p>
<p>While the game is in a fictional future, the 70 artifacts from Western museums and private collections are real, each with history to learn about in-game. There’s been estimates that some 90% of sub-Saharan African artifacts, including human remains, are in museums and collections.</p>

<p>For the game itself, you’ll have to figure out a way to sneak into each level, before grabbing the artifact and then racing out as fast as you can, avoiding hazards, drones and traps as you go.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that this raises awareness of this issue so that, next time Greece asks if they can have the Elgin Marbles back, maybe the UK gives it half a thought?</p>

		<p>It’s time to go back to higher education with Escape Academy: Back 2 School, as Coin Crew Games has revealed their escape room sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School - Summer Game Fest 2025 Announcement Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/owh9OAeOMYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Escape Academy 2 looks to go bigger and broader than the original. Yes, there’s still the individual escape room challenges to take on, but this game has an all-new campus that you can wander around, filled with free roam puzzles. Can you unravel the conspiracy that swirls around the school again?</p>
<p>As with the original, you’ll be able to play solo, or get a buddy to play with you in either online or local co-op.</p>
<p>The first Escape Academy was an escape room delight, Coin Crew putting their real escape room designing chops to use in video game form. In our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/13/escape-academy-review/">Escape Academy review</a>, I said, “Escape Academy captures the spirit of escape rooms in excellent fashion, wrapping up a string of thoroughly enjoyable puzzle-filled levels in a light and quirky story. Puzzle aficionados might find it a little easy, but it’s a commendable first effort that left me wanting more.”</p>

			<p>Capcom has finally revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-good-chance-of-being-revealed-during-summer-game-fest-rumor/">Resident Evil 9</a>, officially titled Resident Evil Requiem. Not only did Capcom finally reveal RE9, but it also gave us a release date of February 27, 2026, for its arrival on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>The rumors leading into Summer Game Fest 2025 were indeed true, though we definitely got more than we expected considering that we already have a release date to look forward to, and we saw what is almost definitely the most terrifying trailer for a Resident Evil game in the series' history.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for Resident Evil Requiem, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the announcement for Resident Evil Requiem answered a main question that players had around the game (when it'll be out), it left plenty more questions. For example, the trailer stars someone named Grace, not Rose, which is what players who got to the end of Resident Evil Village might've expected.</p>
<p>We don't have too many concrete story details, but we do know that Grace will be going back to the same hotel where her mother was killed, and that Raccoon City is somehow involved once again. We also didn't see any concrete gameplay, so we still don't know if this will be a first or third-person game.</p>
<p>We'll continue to have questions about Resident Evil Requiem until February 27, 2026, when it's finally out on consoles and PC and we can all play it. Until then, it's at least good to know what it is officially called, and to have a date to look forward to.</p>

            <p>What's this? A game with big robots smashing each other to tiny little pieces above a large sci-fi cityscape, and we have <em>not</em> yet covered it. For shame. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabreak">Mecha Break</a> is a free-to-play multiplayer robo-battler in which you fly around and wreck online foes at speeds no mere human should ever be exposed to, and it now has a release date, as announced in a flashy trailer at the Summer Game Fest. I have no idea if playing this will be as intense as the visual heart attack it looks to be. But maybe when it comes out next month I'll try it out. </p>

<p>It's due out on July 2nd. Mecha Break is set on our planet, post-catastrophe, where a shadowy organisation called, uh, S.H.A.D.O.W. have hired you as a pilot and cannonfodder in a grand and doubtless unending war. </p>
<p>"Assault, melee, sniper, reconnaissance, support," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/">the Steam page</a>. "Choose your preferred mech and take on enemies across three distinct combat modes: 3v3 Deathmatch, 6v6 Hero Shooter, or PvPvE Extraction Shooter." </p>
<p>Why that's basically all the flavours of live service you could possibly want, squished into one game. I don't know whether to be worried or impressed.</p>
<p>The shame I feel for not having covered Mecha Break thus far is only half a joke. Institutionally speaking, RPS has long welcomed the giant robots and robotic suits that smoke with the embers of battle. Whether that's the greeble and grit of ye olde <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hawken">Hawken</a>, the fearful mechmommies of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a>, or the cocaine-infused mechamurder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/psycho-patrol-r">Psycho Patrol R</a>.

<p>Nice fedora. The character we follow looks to be detectiving a bit. Knocking on doors and inspecting a cigarettes which will "draw immense hostility" if you choose to smoke them. Disgusting habit. The player also gets a petrol bomb thrown at them, they dodge a bullet, they throw a man off a bridge. Just everyday hijinks they got up to last century, those lovable scamps.</p>
<p>Although this sample of fighting goons and clearing out alleyways is set in wartime Japan, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-makers-of-yakuza-are-working-on-project-century-a-new-third-person-brawler-set-in-1915">the previous trailer</a> was set in 1915. That means there's some jumping around in history going on. It'll be intersting to see what's going on here. An intergenerational story of fmaily, betrayal and redemption that'll span the entire 20th century? I'm not saying that's what's definitely going on - just speculatising - but if anyone can do that, the folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio probably can.</p>
<p>Ah, but will it be on PC? Probably, although Sega aren't telling us how or when. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Wu-Tang Clan has long since been a multimedia group, putting their name behind comic books, a TV show, video games, and more. Now they're headed back to the world of gaming again with Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver, a co-op brawler that has you rescuing the Clan from the Deceiver. Check out the latest trailer shown at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826WlpkBZOQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/826WlpkBZOQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This 3D brawler has three core pillars according to developer Brass Lion: Rebuild Shaolin, Battle with the Wu, and Protect Ya Neck. Ghostface Killah asks you to rescue his Wu brothers so that you can battle alongside them and use their legendary skills to restore Shaolin, the home of Wu-Tang. As you progress, you'll collect jewels to customize your fighting style and from the description of the game, it sounds like you'll see your work reflected in the community of Shaolin.</p><p>The game sports an "afro-surrealist meets anime-inspired" art design and increasingly difficult battles against fantastical enemies through the "Chambers" of the world. The game sports a soundtrack that includes classic Wu-Tang tracks and new material overseen by producer Just Blaze. You can play with up to two friends for three-player co-op gaming.</p><p>No release date is available so far, but the game is set to come to PC via Steam and Epic Games Store when it does release.</p>

                <p>The highly anticipated mecha online shooter, Mecha Break, finally got a release date. Revealed during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> show, players will be able to go toe to giant mechanical toe on July 1. And considering all of the "wonderful" feedback fans gave during its global open beta, the game seems primed to deliver an action-packed experience.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2MJY08p_ZE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z2MJY08p_ZE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Developed by Amazing Seasun Games, Mecha Break is set in an alternate future where various factions fight over Earth's sole energy source: a highly toxic mineral called Corite. Due to its volatile nature, Corite can only be handled by mechs. This forms the basis for the team-based battles in the game's main competitive mode. Potentially compelling story beats aside, players won't need a ton of motivation to jump into these large flying machines and wage war against each other across various battlefields next month.</p>

It revealed this during today's Summer Games Fest showcase with a new gameplay trailer.&nbsp;</p><p>Set in the years 1915 and 1943 (at least), this action game oozes the style and substance of RGG's Like a Dragon series, but with some 20th-century noir flair, and it looks awesome. When we first saw Project Century last year, we saw a game set in 1915, but in today's trailer, Stranger Than Heaven brings us to 1943, a different decade. Fortunately, all the fisticuff combat from 1915 remains in this 1943 look at the game, and if these two trailers together are any indication, it seems Stranger Than Heaven will jump between different time periods.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the Stranger Than Heaven reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There's no release date or projected platforms for Stranger Than Heaven.

            <p>Two of my words are colliding, people! Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is currently updating Hitman with a new elusive target - it's only ruddy La Chiffre from Casino Royale!</p>
<p>The news was revealed this evening, with actor Mads Mikkelsen joining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> and IO boss Hakan Abrak to announce the Hitman x Bond collaboration. Le Chiffre will be available to hunt for free via PC and consoles soon. As in, very soon - the devs are getting it all prepped as we speak, so in a few moments or so we are go!</p>

<p>Above is a little trailer for the whole thing, which takes place in Paris, and yes I am reacting perfectly normally about it all and not getting overexcited at all.</p>
<p>And, below's an infographic for Agent 47's next elusive target. As you can see, playing and killing La Chiffre will unlock awards for 007: First Light. </p>
<p>"Le Chiffre is a character I have always enjoyed - he's calculating, cold, and ruthless," said Mads Mikkelsen. "Bringing him into the world of Hitman makes for a thrilling collaboration. Players can expect mind games, high stakes, and twists that only this character could orchestrate. To succeed, they'll need to play their hand wisely."</p>
<p>"We are beyond thrilled to welcome Mads Mikkelsen to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>," added IO's Hakan Abrak. "Players are really going to enjoy this new mission, which marks the return of Le Chiffre after nearly 20 years. I'm excited to see our players jump into this small taste of bigger things to come in the Bond franchise from IO Interactive."</p>

<p>IO, of course, also recently lifted the lid on its upcoming Bond game. Earlier this week, we got a reveal trailer which introduced us to the young Bond at the start of his life as an agent.</p>
<p>But, while it may be an origin story, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-may-be-an-original-story-but-you-might-have-missed-plenty-of-homages-to-the-bonds-that-came-before">007: First Light already has plenty of nods to the Bond books and films that came before</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2’s</a> launch today, 1047 had one more surprise for their portal-infused shooter: a whole battle royale mode! Even if that isn’t your thing, the rest of this Halo-inspired portally arena shooter could well be up your alley, and it’s out today across PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splitgate: Battle Royale Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The announcement of the battle royale mode came with some big ttalk on the stage of Summer Game Fest, as 1047 boss NAME decried playing “the same” Call of Duty every year, and wished that we could just finally get a Titanfall 3, please.</p>
<p>But that’s beside the point, really. Splitgate 2 is out now. From what I’ve played of the beta, it’s pretty fun.</p>
