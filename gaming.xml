			<p>Following our previous reports on John Gibson's stance regarding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-gibson-ex-tripwire-ceo-underrepresented-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"underrepresented majority" in gaming</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-tripwire-ceo-remote-work-game-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the efficiency pitfalls of remote work</a>, we are now presenting the <strong>full transcript</strong> of our lengthy conversation with the executive, which lasted more than 60 minutes and has been slightly edited and condensed for brevity.</p>



<p>John Gibson isn't just a veteran with 25 years in the trenches of the industry; he is a co-founder of Tripwire Interactive (<a href="https://wccftech.com/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-following-backlash-against-john-gibsons-views-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he stepped down in September 2021</a>) with a track record of several consecutive profitable titles. Now at the helm of <strong>Templar Media</strong>, Gibson has made no qualms of critiquing what he calls a "monolithic political block" in modern game development, advocating for a return to the <strong>"Entertainment First</strong>" philosophy of the 80s and 90s.</p>



<p>In the following transcript, Gibson pulls no punches on the <strong>"video game apocalypse"</strong> of layoffs and delays, the current development progress and challenges of making the Bible-based adventure game <strong><em>Gate Zero</em></strong> (Templar Media <a href="https://wccftech.com/templar-media-acquires-bible-x-studio-making-gate-zero-where-you-play-the-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased developer <strong>Bible X</strong></a> last month), and his pragmatic approach to utilizing <strong>AI in development</strong>. </p>

<h2 id="pivot-entertainment-first"><a href="#pivot-entertainment-first">The Pivot to Templar Media: From Tripwire to "Entertainment First"</a></h2>



<p><strong>John, for those who haven't followed your recent transition, could you tell us about your journey from leading Tripwire Interactive to founding your new venture, Templar Media?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Sure thing. I was formerly the co-founder, co-owner, and CEO of Tripwire Interactive. Now, I am leading Templar Media. I founded Templar Media earlier this year. After selling Tripwire, I took a break, but I realized I wanted to get back into games. I noticed that in a lot of media, the focus had shifted away from pleasing the player or the viewer. Instead, it was often about whatever commentary or message a developer or entertainer wanted to convey. This is where our slogan, <strong>"Entertainment First,"</strong> originated. I wanted to establish a company focused on creating great content that people truly enjoy. While everyone aims to make something great, players can tell if your primary focus is not on building an entertaining and fun game. Our goal is to make great, entertaining content.</p>



<p>We are catering to an underserved mainstream market. In America and somewhat in Europe, the people creating entertainment often represent a monolithic political block. However, consumers are not a monolithic block and do not necessarily share the same views as those making the entertainment. There is an underrepresented majority that wants entertainment without a specific agenda. When I was growing up, movies like <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> or games like <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Metroid</em> were about entertaining you, not an agenda. This has been lost in much of modern entertainment. For example, in the new <em>Dragon Age</em> game, there is a cutscene where the player is lectured about pronouns. We experience entertainment to forget about day-to-day politics and just have fun. Entertainment needs to go back to focusing on entertaining people. While our first game is faith-based, we are not afraid to tell those stories to an underserved market and to anyone who simply wants great content without modern agendas. As a company owner and designer, you must focus on what the customer will enjoy, not just your own preferences.</p>

<h2 id="underserved-faith-based-market"><a href="#underserved-faith-based-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gate Zero: Tapping into the Massive Underserved Faith-Based Market</a></h2>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> The first game we are developing tells biblical stories, allowing players to experience the Bible firsthand. This is not the only type of content we will produce, but we are not ignoring it either. In the television and movie industries, faith-based content is currently massive. It has gained mainstream success with projects like <em>The Chosen</em>, <em>Jesus Revolution</em>, and <em>House of David</em>. This mirrors the 1950s in America, when movies like <em>The Ten Commandments</em> were mainstream box office hits. <strong>Regardless of a person's faith, these are foundational stories of Western society and are simply great, entertaining narratives</strong>. We will not shy away from such content, but our primary goal remains to entertain people. </p>



<p><strong>How did your relationship with the Norwegian studio Bible X begin? Were you always a believer in the project from day one, or did it take some convincing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> I initially reached out to the Bible X team a couple of years ago after seeing videos for <em>Gate Zero</em> in my social media feed. To be candid, I had low expectations for faith-based entertainment, assuming it would not be very good. However, the project kept appearing in my feed, and I eventually decided to reach out. Although I was retired and did not need to work anymore, this project seemed interesting. I quickly got to know the team, and they asked me to serve as their executive game consultant to help make the game better.</p>



<p>When I played what they were working on, I saw a team that was excellent at storytelling and art with a great vision, but they needed help making the game truly fun. BCC Media, the parent organization of Bible X, has long-standing experience in media, including satellite television, film, and animated features. They already used Unreal Engine technology for their animated features. They had the technical and storytelling background, and I brought 25 years of video game design and execution experience to the table. I worked with them for a while to improve the game.</p>



<p>When I started Templar Media, I looked for titles to publish. Aside from the quality of the game, I looked for leading indicators of success. It is challenging to determine what will be successful years in advance. One indicator I look at is social media response. At my previous company, after 17 years, we had about 40,000 social media followers across all platforms. In a short amount of time, <em>Gate Zero</em> and Bible X had 500,000 grassroots followers. My previous company had games with 35 million players that sold millions of copies, yet we only had 40,000 followers. This indicated a very high level of interest in <em>Gate Zero</em>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GateZero_GC_Screenshot-18-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="kickstarter-proved-gate-zero-hype"><a href="#kickstarter-proved-gate-zero-hype">Why Kickstarter Success Proved the Gate Zero Hype</a></h2>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Another business indicator I examined was Kickstarter. While Kickstarters usually do not fund an entire project, they help gauge public interest. Most video game Kickstarters fail, raising an average of about $2,800 to $3,000. When Bible X prepared their Kickstarter, a consultancy firm suggested setting the goal at approximately €30,000. The team decided that was not enough to prove potential success and set the goal at €200,000. They hit €200,000 in less than three days and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gatezero/gate-zero-a-bible-exploration-video-game?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=Gate%20Zero&amp;total_hits=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>reached €300,000 by the end of the 30-day campaign</strong></a>. This was a smash hit that proved an audience wants this kind of entertainment.</p>



<p>These indicators led me to sign the game as a publisher. As development has progressed, I have looked for further signs of success. In 2008, when I looked at <em>Killing Floor</em> for my previous company, we saw massive potential and decided to buy the IP. That first game eventually sold 6 million copies. <strong>I am seeing even higher indicators for <em>Gate Zero</em>, and as I play what we are creating, I see that something special is being made</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Game-Delays-Remote-Work-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="remote-work-and-inflated-salaries-fueling-game-delays-and-layoffs"><a href="#remote-work-inflated-salaries-delays-layoffs">The "Video Game Apocalypse": Remote Work and Inflated Salaries Fueling Game Delays and Layoffs</a></h2>



<p><strong>What do you think about the state of the industry? There's a lot of discussion on the layoffs that have hit big and small companies alike in the past few years, shortly after the COVID-induced boom ended.</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> The industry faced a "video game apocalypse" in 2023 and 2024 as things collapsed following the pandemic boom. Games were not always of high quality or were taking much longer to develop. For instance, the sequel to <em>Killing Floor 2</em> took five years to make. <strong>I believe part of the reason for these delays is distributed work</strong>. While working from home feels great, people are often less efficient and less creative. Some of the greatest ideas in the games I have worked on came from random encounters in the hallway. Two people might have different parts of a great idea, chat in the hallway, and create a whole concept for the game. As part of this acquisition, the core team on <em>Gate Zero</em> is relocating to our offices in Georgia. Having everyone in the office will allow us to iterate quickly to finish the game. This business decision will result in a more entertaining and fun game for the player.</p>



<p><strong>Another challenge was overinflated salaries during the pandemic</strong>. Companies with high COVID-era profits were overpaying for talent. For instance, an engineer might be offered a million dollars for their first year. This was unsustainable, and many of those companies eventually conducted massive layoffs. There is now a reset occurring where people must readjust their salary expectations to fair, sustainable levels.</p>



<p>We are also focused on right-sizing budgets. My lead producer once asked how we could make a game for $100 million, and my response was, "How do you spend $100 million making this game?". <strong>Companies sometimes go bankrupt because they spend too much and lose focus. You have to be pragmatic and scale up with the market</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Fortnite</em> is a major factor in the industry, "sucking a lot of the air out of the room". To exist alongside it, you must offer a unique experience. It is not necessarily about direct competition. When I made <em>Killing Floor</em>, <em>Left 4 Dead</em> had just come out, and people questioned if the market could support another zombie game. We sold six million copies because the games were different enough.</p>



<p>But the market has grown significantly. When I signed the first Steam agreement in 2005, Steam had perhaps 3 to 5 million users. Now it has about 180 million, and <em>Fortnite</em> has 150 million. In the past, a million units was a massive success; now, successful games can sell 30 to 50 million units. There is room for games that sell 1 to 5 million copies. A rising tide lifts all ships, and a generation raised on games wants diverse experiences. A single-player experience like <em>Gate Zero</em> can find its place in the market. I am also not opposed to making live service games, as we were successful with titles like <em>Chivalry 2</em> alongside <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>



<p><strong>How many developers are currently working on the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Between developers and contractors, <strong>there are 25 people on the team, plus about 10 from Templar, totaling 30 to 35 people</strong>. While we do not have a <em>GTA</em> budget, this is not a small indie game. It will compete with AAA titles and <strong>has a budget greater than $10 million</strong>. This is the studio's first game, so we are careful with spending, intending to increase resources for subsequent versions if the first is successful. I think of it like <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> was a high-quality movie, but once it was a hit, they could put significantly more resources into the second and third films. <em>Gate Zero</em> will be a quality game built on a healthy, reasonable budget.</p>



<p>When I first met the Bible X team, I noted that during my time as CEO and co-owner of my previous company, I was involved in 15 games, every one of which made a profit. Part of that success involves right-sizing the budget and picking a great title. I told the team we should make something undeniably great, and I informed them that it would require doubling their original budget. </p>



<p><strong>Can you share any details about Gate Zero's pricing and launch window estimates yet?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Regarding pricing, it is too early to share a specific price, but it will be more budget-friendly than other big AAA games. It will not cost as much as an $80 game or a new Switch game, but it will not be a $19 game either. <strong>We are over halfway through development; it is not coming out next week, but it will not take two years either</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Gate Zero has drawn some comparisons to Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed. How do you define the gameplay style, and what other major titles influenced the game's design?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> While there are some of those elements, <strong>I describe it as a mix of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, the newer <em>Zelda</em> games, and <em>Shadow of Mordor</em></strong>. The comparisons to <em>Assassin's Creed</em> are natural because we have a time machine and are going back to ancient history. Furthermore, we have several former <em>Assassin's Creed</em> developers on the team, including an art director who worked on several entries in that series. We also have the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> contract art team and developers from other major games. I worked on <em>Killing Floor</em>, <em>Maneater</em>, and <em>Chivalry 2</em>. We have people from Rockstar who worked on <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>GTA</em>, as well as a developer from the original <em>Thief</em> game. The game includes stealth, action, exploration, and puzzles. It will be a unique combination of genres with a deep narrative and narrative trees.</p>



<p>I love narrative and stories, and I am a fan of games like <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, where choices matter. In <em>Gate Zero</em>, <strong>the character Max is a 15-year-old who is not a person of faith. He uses a time machine to end up in 30 AD during significant events. He grows through moral decisions that are not always cut and dry. These decisions impact the story, dialogue choices, and who aligns with him. We want the player to have agency in their story</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Given the target audience of faith-based entertainment, I have to ask how much action (and potentially blood) there will be in your game.</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> We are holding off on discussing the action in detail until early next year because we believe we have something compelling that people have not seen before. <strong>There is compelling action in the game; it is not a "walking simulator" or strictly a puzzle game</strong>.</p>



<p>By the way, we also have specific rules for time travel to avoid messing up the timeline. Max looks like he could be of Italian or Roman heritage. If he goes around killing Roman guards, he might inadvertently kill an ancestor and cease to exist. Designing around these constraints forces us to be creative. It is similar to the challenges we faced making the shark gameplay in <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/maneater-rough-waters-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maneater</a></em> fun. Because the game is set in 30 AD rather than a time of open war like the eras of Samson or David, putting action into it is an interesting design problem.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gate-Zero-Co-Play-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>







<p><strong>I've read that the game will feature a co-play element that works with smartphones. What can you share about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Often, when someone plays a single-player game, their friends get bored and look at their phones. The co-play feature engages everyone in a party atmosphere. Friends can play mini-games on their phones that help the player on the screen. This scales to larger groups of up to 10 people. I have never seen this done well before, as mobile apps for games often just feel like an extension of the HUD. <strong>Because of the faith-based elements, youth groups could play the game together, which is a unique group element for the target audience</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="ai-debate-accelerate-creativity-without-sacrificing-truth"><a href="#ai-debate-accelerate-creativity-without-sacrificing-truth">The AI Debate: Using Tools to Accelerate Creativity Without Sacrificing Truth</a></h2>



<p><strong>Finally, let's discuss the proverbial elephant in the room: the usage of AI in the games industry. Some developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently came under fire from fans after disclosing their usage of AI</a>. Where do you stand on this topic?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> When used properly, <strong>AI is a tool that speeds up human creativity rather than replacing it</strong>. For <em>Gate Zero</em>, our concept artists might hand-draw a concept and then use AI to generate 10 other versions to accelerate development. It helps augment the increasing costs of development. We are still very far from a "Star Trek holodeck" that can generate entire games on command.</p>



<p>In the 1990s, teams had to create their own game engines. Later, the licensing of engines enabled smaller teams to make better games that could compete with big developers. Similarly, AI can give smaller teams an edge. More broadly, AI presents challenges that governments may not be ready to tackle. If AI and robotics converge alongside quantum computing, economies and the world will change significantly. It might not be <em>The Terminator</em>, but it could be <em>I, Robot</em>.</p>



<p><strong>In Templar Media, my policy is that AI answers cannot be considered truth</strong>. Employees can use tools like ChatGPT to find a direction, but they must always find and share the primary source for any fact. ChatGPT often gets things wrong. For example, I once searched for the production numbers of a rare 1983 Pontiac Trans Am I own. The AI stated that about 600 were made, which was correct, but its primary source turned out to be my own Instagram post. AI is a tool, but do not assume it knows everything or is always correct.</p>



<p><strong>Definitely. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Animal Crossing New Horizon 3.0 Update - Everything You Need to do Day One</p>
      </div>
<p>"The fateful day has come for the new update, and the local resident-run hotel has fallen on hard times thanks to the illegally constructed hotel on the pier," wrote Redditor ll_LoneWolfe_ll in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qdah21/the_new_pier_hotel_spells_doom_for_my_islands/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>. "These are truly troubling times for the residents of my island!"</p><p>Hotels have long been a popular attraction for Animal Crossing players, even though the game has never provided the infrastructure to build a functional one. Instead, players relied on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/20-years-ago-animal-crossing-finally-showed-what-it-could-be/1100-6536728/" data-ref-id="1100-6536728">creativity</a> and illusion. Some terraformed multi-room interiors and used partitions to simulate hallways and suites, while others leaned into visual trickery, creating hotel facades meant to be admired from a specific angle.</p><p>One such example can be seen in a Reddit post documenting the final day of an island’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qdmq9a/the_last_day_of_my_islands_hotel_dodo_hotel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dodo Hotel</a>, a lovingly crafted facade that existed purely for aesthetics. These facades have become works of art in their own right, allowing players to build convincing cityscapes that evoke sun-soaked Greek islands, dense urban skylines, or luxury five-star resorts looming in the distance.</p><p>The 3.0 update finally brings those hotel fantasies into the game in an official capacity, but it does so with a rigid, one-size-fits-all design. The new hotel is anchored to a specific pier at the front corner of each island, limiting where and how it can exist. Players were quick to discover, however, that while the structure itself is fixed, the surrounding area is not.</p><p>As expected, players immediately got to work customizing their piers to stand out from countless of other islands around the world. One Redditor, jorgom, used custom designs, fences, castle pillars, and themed furniture to transform their pier into a hotel inspired by the Sanrio character <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qeim2x/my_attempt_at_a_pompompurinthemed_hotel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pompompurin</a>, turning a standardized feature into something personal.</p><p>In many ways, the new hotel represents Animal Crossing’s ongoing tension between player creativity and developer-imposed boundaries. Nintendo has given players more tools than ever, but those tools still arrive with clear limits. The community’s response-- decorating around, over, and in spite of those limits--remains as inventive as ever.</p><p>Player-made hotels may be disappearing, but the instinct behind them hasn’t gone anywhere. Even when the game builds something for players, they’ll still find ways to rebuild it in their own image, proving once again that New Horizons is less about what Nintendo adds and more about what players do with it.</p>

                <p>This Sunday's NFL playoffs divisional round matchup between the New England Patriots and the Houston Texans will feature a World of Warcraft-themed attraction for tailgaters, and it's because Blizzard's data shows that its players love sports.</p><p>The World of Warcraft: Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern, as it's called, is a marketing activation that's meant to promote WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion. Inside the tavern, people can get a drink and watch World of Warcraft livestreams. They can also meet cosplayers and influencers; the Orc cosplayers will be inside the stadium for the game itself.</p><p>The Midnight expansion adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-future-housing-plans-include-co-decorating-and-a-long-requested-feature/1100-6537427/" data-ref-id="1100-6537427">player housing</a>, which is something fans have been requesting for years. Blizzard is also partnering with real estate company Zillow on this branded partnership, according to <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/sb-blogs/newsletter-gaming/2026/01/16/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sports Business Journal.</a></p><p>People can find the Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern outside Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Mass. Blizzard Entertainment CMO Monica Austin said the team has been building the tavern at Blizzard's headquarters in Anaheim, California for months, and only just recently decided to host the event in Foxboro as opposed to Denver, where another Divisional round game will take place.</p><p>But why have this kind of marketing campaign in the first place? Austin said  Blizzard's research has shown that lapsed and active WoW players also enjoy watching sports.</p><p>"We've done a tremendous amount of deep dives to understand who are our players, lapsed and active. One of the things we see consistently is that our players are over-indexed in watching sports. And for the NFL, it's top-three over-indexing sport," Austin said. "We know our players are there. We know they're watching. This is a strategic way that we want to use to reach them."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">Midnight launches on March 2</a>, and will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/" data-ref-id="1100-6534043">revamp the game's nearly two-decade-old Blood Elf zones</a> as well as introduce new areas, dungeons, and raids.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-update-1-1-3-5-add-polish-and-consistency-ea-battlefield-studios/</link>
            <guid>1408735</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>EA</strong> and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> have released the latest patch notes for the next update coming to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a></strong>, numbered <strong>Update 1.1.3.5,</strong> which aims to bring a bit more "<em>polish and consistency</em>" to the game, with refinements to melee attacks, movement, jet combat, and more.</p>



<p>"<em>With Update 1.1.3.5, we’re delivering a smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency across Battlefield 6</em>," <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-5">a blog post on the Battlefield 6 website</a> detailing the changes in the update reads. "<em>This update enhances melee responsiveness, refines jet combat, improves ladder interactions, and resolves UI and HUD issues in Multiplayer and REDSEC, alongside fixes for Battle Royale and Gauntlet stability</em>."</p>



<p>It's not the biggest update in terms of scale, but it does include several significant updates, like fixing a bug that could see a vehicle explode if an enemy player lay on top of it and performed a Takedown, and a major reduction in jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, which brings a huge balance to the game's air combat.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other notable improvements include the attack speed for knife attacks being faster, and improvements to the buffering behaviour for both knife and sledgehammer attacks. More consistent behaviour for recoil modifiers when using a controller, and perhaps the one that players will notice the most: sprinting will now only be interrupted when your melee attack reaches its target, instead of what would happen before, where you would sprint towards your enemy, only to have your sprint interrupted just before you were in range because you pressed the melee button.</p>



<p>This update and its fixes will be live next week on <strong>January 20, 2026</strong>, so you still have to play through the weekend before they're implemented. It's also the first update the game is getting since EA and Battlefield Studios confirmed that the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/"><strong>Season 2</strong> would be delayed and pushed to <strong>February 17, 2026,</strong></a> which means players still have another month to wait before any new content, including new maps, weapons, and vehicles, is added to the game. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new Secret Lair superdrop for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. The new Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop brings in more cards from Bethesda's post-apocalyptic sci-fi franchise, <em>Fallout</em>.</p><h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop Announcement</h2><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-rad-superdrop" rel="nofollow">announcement post</a>, Wizards of the Coast detailed four drops of cards as part of the Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop. These four drops will focus on different elements and facets of the <em>Fallout</em> series.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The first drop, <em>Secret Lair x Fallout: Beyond Vault 33</em>, focuses entirely on the <em>Fallout</em> TV Show on Prime Video. This drop will contain six cards. Three of these cards are original designs featuring the show's leads: Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus. The other three are equipment cards, <em>Pre-War Formalwear</em>, <em>Spirit Mantle</em>, and <em>T-45 Power Armor</em> reimagined as <em>T-60 Power Armor</em>.</p><p>Notably, this drop is the first Secret Lair made available on Amazon. This is most likely an extension of marketing for the show's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-season-two-doesnt-just-go-to-new-vegas-it-builds-on-it" rel="nofollow">second season</a>.</p><picture>

The drop, <em>Secret Lair x Fallout: Welcome to New Vegas</em>, is more standard fare. Older <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> cards featuring Fallout-themed artwork and card names.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-starfield-bethesda-tes-2000660653</link>
            <guid>1408696</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A veteran designer recently sat down with</span> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> to discuss his surprise departure from Bethesda Game Studios in 2023 after two stints and over 20 years at the company. He cited what he saw as detrimental changes in the </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>maker’s development process due to Bethesda’s continued expansion as the driving impetus behind his decision.</span></p> <p><span>Kurt Kuhlmann, who worked for Bethesda as a junior designer in the late 1990s before rejoining the studio as a senior designer in 2003, made waves in the industry when he decided to step away from the role. By that time, he had worked on every major game in the </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls</span></i><span> series<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->apart from the first, </span><i><span>Arena<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></span></i><span>and was responsible for building out much of its setting and lore.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was almost certainly time for a change,” Kuhlmann told </span><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span>. “There were some things that had been going on for a long time that I’d not been super happy with.”<br> </span></p> <h2>Communication breakdowns on<em> Starfield</em></h2> <p><span>Much of this unhappiness, Kuhlmann explained, revolved around Bethesda’s growth from a handful of developers making games in a basement office to hundreds of people across four studios that were managed by Microsoft. No longer could they just pop in on each other to discuss something and get a quick decision from trusted leaders like executive producer Todd Howard.</span></p>

 <p><span>Instead, senior developer responsibilities were becoming more managerial, and everything had to go through several layers of bureaucracy. Kuhlmann described the environment as prone to “communication breakdowns,” attributing some of Bethesda’s recent development struggles to this bloated, hands-off structure. </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span> teams, for instance, were often confused about what they were supposed to be doing as discussion filtered through the various studio leads.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The expectation was your job can’t be also making content if you’re actually managing that scope of the project,” Kuhlmann said. “I didn’t want to work that way, because I like making games and being hands-on. It had gotten to a scale beyond where I was really enjoying working in that environment.”</span></p>

 <h2>An <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> cliffhanger</h2> <p><span>This shift in priorities, combined with Howard retracting a previous promise to make Kuhlmann lead designer on </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>, signaled to the veteran it was time to leave Bethesda. Kuhlmann, for his part, does acknowledge it was a smart decision to change his potential responsibilities on the still unreleased game, as he probably wouldn’t have liked the job much due to Bethesda’s new development woes.</span></p>

 <p><span>As for what he envisioned for </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>, Kuhlmann likened his rough ideas to </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> sequel </span><i><span>The Empire Strikes Back</span></i><span>: The bad guys would have won, setting up the main conflict of </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls 7</span></i><span>. The protracted AAA release schedule, however, would likely have made a cliffhanger of that magnitude “unfeasible.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“That’s not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we’ll see you in 10, 15 years,” Kuhlmann said.</span></p>

<p>According to a new report, the God of War live-action series has secured its Sif, and it’s none other than Teresa Palmer. </p>



<p>Things have been shaping quite well for Amazon’s God of War live-action series, with new castings being announced over the past day. Yesterday, we were informed that the man taking on the iconic role of the God of War will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sons-of-anarchy-star-cast-kratos-god-of-war-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Anarchy’s Ryan Hurst</a>, who will pick up the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos as Kratos. </p>







<h2 id="h-teresa-palmer-to-play-sif-in-god-of-war-s-live-action-series">Teresa Palmer to Play Sif in God of War’s Live-Action Series</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> reveals that Teresa Palmer will play Sif/Phoebe, Thor’s wife. Amazon has declined to comment on whether this news is true. Fans will remember Palmer from movies like Sorcerer’s Apprentice, Lights Out, The Fall Guy, and more. </p>



<p>The report on this casting has also made fans wonder about the series’ timeline. Players who have played both games will remember that Sif and Thor do not make an appearance until God of War: Ragnarok. So, will the live-action series follow the game’s events or set its own flow? </p>



<p>Additionally, a report from last month discusses who will play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur and Thor</a> in the upcoming series. It seems Max Parker from Boots will be taking on the role of Baldur. At the same time, Olafur Darri Olafsson from Severance will be playing the God of Thunder, Thor. </p>



<p>There are still many essential characters left to cast, including Atreus, Odin, Freya, Mimir, Sindri, Brok, and more. Which characters do you think will best fit these roles? </p>

                <p>Earlier this month, some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC. Instead, the problem arises when Monster Hunter Wilds checks for DLC.</p><p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> debunked the notion that more DLC was speeding up Monster Hunter Wilds. Instead, DF discovered that there's an automatic check for DLC that greatly impacts Wilds' performance. According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself "checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor" in less than a minute.</p><p>Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC. That's slowing everything down, even if there isn't any DLC to be found.</p><p>Other players have already noticed this and released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a less DLC checks mod</a> that helps alleviate the issue. It doesn't solve all of Monster Hunter Wilds' underlying issues on PC, but it can solve this one until Capcom decides to eventually address it.</p><p>Capcom had previously promised that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update released this winter</a> would directly target the biggest problems with Monster Hunter Wilds on PC. Many of those issues still persist, and it's unknown when or if they will be fixed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amazon is having a busy week for its TV series adaptations of video games. On top of showing off our first look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-tv-show/">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a></strong> and confirming the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-fallout-shelter-reality-competition-show-confirmed/">rumoured <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong>-based reality competition show to be real</a>, it also confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst</strong>, who played Thor in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, would be playing <strong>Kratos</strong></a> in its upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>. Now, we have our latest cast member for the God of War series, with Warm Bodies star <strong>Teresa Palmer</strong> tapped to play <strong>Sif</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/">Deadline</a>, and arrives just one day after Hurst was named as Kratos for the show. The series is reportedly set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, and if that is still the case, then we'll likely start to see more casting announcements as we get closer to the series kicking off production.</p>



<p>What's also interesting to note about this casting announcement is that it gives us more insight into the approach the show is taking with the story. We already knew that this series wouldn't be addressing Kratos' story from the original set of Greek mythology-based games, and that it would be jumping right into the Norse era.</p>



<p>But now that we know the show will include Sif, who players will remember is a Norse goddess in her own right and the wife of <strong>Thor</strong>, we know that the show is pulling from both the 2018 God of War and Ragnarok. Sif doesn't appear in Ragnarok, so now at least know whatever version of Kratos and Atreus' story we get in this show, it'll involve more than just the few Norse gods we meet in the first game.</p>



<p>The series is being led by <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong>,</a> who took over as showrunner after PlayStation Productions scrapped the initial version of the show over creative differences with its previous leads. The first couple of episodes will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-two-seasons-shogun-director-to-direct-opening-episodes-amazon/">directed by Shogun director, <strong>Frederick E.O. Toye</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and hopefully, we'll have more official news about the series, and when we'll get our first look of it soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/851165/ces-2026-what-to-expect">As we predicted</a>, the world’s biggest consumer electronics show was a bit of a bust for gamers this year! CES 2026 brought us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/848331/8bitdo-ultimate-3e-controller-xbox-wireless-tmr-swappable-joysticks">several</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7593953104756821262">neat</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860346/force-feedback-steering-wheel-in-a-gamepad-feels-surprisingly-great">gamepads</a>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853587/lenovo-legion-go-2-steam-os-annoucement-price-release-date">barely</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860992/onexplayer-ces-2026-liquid-cooled-strix-halo-apex-super-x-handheld-egpu">any</a> handhelds and no new desktop GPUs — not from Nvidia, not from Intel, and not from AMD.</p><p>But if you dig deep, AMD said two things at this year’s show that are worthy of attention. Did you catch that the company’s about to make socketed <em>mobile</em> chips again? Or that its answer to Intel is to lower the price of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/791460/gpd-win-5-corded-handhelds">monster Strix Halo silicon</a>?</p><p>Publicly, AMD barely acknowledged consumers at the Consumer Electronics Show. “AMD failed us,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsCrKGY9F1o">decried Gamers Nexus</a>, pointing out that the company’s keynote was almost entirely fixated on AI. Outside the keynote, the company’s few consumer-friendly announcements — including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855188/amd-ryzen-7-9850x3d-processor-boost-clock-announcement">the Ryzen 7 9850X3D</a> for gaming desktops and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855343/amd-ryzen-ai-400-release-date">Ryzen AI 400</a> for laptops — are all retreads of existing components.</p><p>AMD also didn’t announce a new chip for handheld gaming PCs, no successor to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">the Z2 and Z2 Extreme it introduced</a> a year ago, even as Intel publicly announced plans for an “entire handheld gaming platform” and Qualcomm teased its own handhelds for a possible March reveal.</p><p>Intel didn’t miss a chance to jab: “They’re selling ancient silicon, while we’re selling up-to-date processors specifically designed for this market,” Intel client product management director Nish Neelalojanan <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3024634/theyre-selling-ancient-silicon-intel-warns-handheld-war-is-coming.html">told <em>PCWorld</em></a>.</p><p>Yet AMD claims those so-called “ancient” processors are more than a match for Intel’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854519/intel-core-ultra-3-panther-lake-18-a-release-date-decoder-ring">Panther Lake silicon</a>. AMD client chip boss Rahul Tikoo <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-is-unphased-by-panther-lakes-big-integrated-gpu-its-not-even-a-fair-fight-to-compare-the-arc-b390-to-strix-halo-amd-exec-claims">told<em> Tom’s Hardware</em> </a>that AMD’s Strix Halo / Ryzen AI Max chip “will kill” Panther Lake. He said, “It’s not even a fair fight at that point, because it’s discrete-level graphics.”</p><p>Tikoo also told <em>Tom’s</em> <em>Hardware</em> that Intel’s gaming-grade Panther Lake chips might be pricier than you expect: “And, oh, by the way, that 12 Xe [Panther Lake]... Wait until you see the price point on that. It’s gonna be, you know. Enough said.”</p><p>Price has been the problem with AMD’s Strix Halo too — every <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/791460/gpd-win-5-corded-handhelds">powerful Ryzen handheld</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">mini desktop</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/621947/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-laptop-amd-strix-halo-review">monster tablet</a> we’ve seen has cost around $2,000, even before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/839353/pc-ram-shortage-pricing-spike-news">the RAM crunch</a>. But that brings me to <strong>the first exciting thing for gamers</strong> AMD quietly revealed at CES: The cost of its powerful Strix Halo systems is almost certainly about to come down.</p><p>AMD introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855463/amd-strix-halo-ai-max-plus-388-392-handheld-gaming">two new cut-down versions of Strix Halo</a> last week with their full-fat graphics intact; Tikoo told us that gaming companies specifically had been asking for parts like the new Ryzen AI Max Plus 388 and 392.</p><p>And when I caught up with AMD’s Jason Banta, who’s in charge of interfacing with those companies, he said AMD genuinely expects the two new chips will lead to lower Strix Halo system prices, below $2,000 even when you factor in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">the runaway price of RAM</a>. (I asked the question several different ways to be sure of his answer.)</p><p>Banta would not tell me if the company has any <em>other </em>plans to defend its tiny handheld empire (the Steam Deck, Xbox Ally, Legion Go, and more all use AMD chips, as do the PlayStation and Xbox) when Intel and Qualcomm come knocking later this year. “We believe imitation is a great form of flattery,” is all he’d really say. “When we’re creating the segment, innovating the segment, we expect others to enter.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->9</strong><span><figcaption><em>OneXPlayer brought liquid-cooled Strix Halo handhelds and tablets to CES. This is the “Frost Bay” external cooler.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Banta isn’t afraid of Intel and Qualcomm handheld chips taking his customers away. “What they’ve seen is we’ve proven we can execute, and not just execute: When we see a quirk with a game, we follow up, we update, we optimize. […] That has a very big influence on those design decisions for every one of these OEMs,” he said. Banta said AMD’s handheld business is still growing, too, and the company still plans to keep investing.</p><p>Most PC makers don’t seem ready to climb aboard Intel’s handheld bandwagon just yet. If you take a close look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/857252/intel-handheld-gaming-pc-panther-lake-custom-cpu">Intel’s keynote slide</a>, the only major vendors listed are Acer and MSI, and the only boutique handheld makers are GPD and OneXPlayer, both still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860992/onexplayer-ces-2026-liquid-cooled-strix-halo-apex-super-x-handheld-egpu#comments">big on AMD</a>. The rest of Intel’s partners (Compal, Foxconn, Inventec, Pegatron, Quanta, and Wistron) aren’t brands, but rather the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_laptop_brands_and_manufacturers#Original_design_manufacturers_(ODMs)">ODM contract manufacturing companies</a> that’ll be fighting for their business.</p><p>While I was chatting with AMD’s Jason Banta at the show, he brought my attention to one more piece of news that was <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-shows-first-renders-of-ryzen-ai-400-for-am5-socket">easy to miss</a>. <strong>The second potentially exciting thing for gamers</strong> is that AMD is making <em>socketed</em> mobile processors again — Ryzen AI 400 laptop chips that aren’t soldered down, but fit into a socket like a desktop CPU, so you can replace or potentially even upgrade them in the future.</p><p>He said they’ll begin to appear in desktops in the early part of this year, specifically targeting Q2. Banta thinks socketed mobile chips are going to unlock gaming and productivity designs of all shapes and sizes: “That socketed Ryzen AI 400, we’re expecting to see that everywhere from 1-liter designs all the way to 30-liter designs,” he says. (<a href="http://ming/606006/nvidia-rtx-5090-egpu-gaming-handheld-oculink-test-pcie-minisforum-deg1">Mobile processors can be a good match for beefy desktop GPUs</a>, since most games don’t require all that much CPU power at high resolution.)</p><p>These socketed chips aren’t just for gamers, mind; it sounds like they were actually targeted at AI PCs to start. “What we’re seeing is folks that want the flexibility of the socketed design, but they want to try out Copilot Plus, they want to try out some local models that can actually leverage the NPU and run directly on that,” he said.</p><p>When I asked if the socket means we should expect upgradable <em>laptops</em>, Banta gently throws some cold water on that idea. “In general, what we find is people want the thinnest system they can get, even if they’re enthusiast users,” and that both the socket itself and a socketed CPU’s integrated heat spreader add unwanted thickness to a laptop.</p><p>But he seems to think it’ll happen in mini PCs: “What we’re seeing is BGA, LGA, everyone’s experimenting in a lot of different ways within those 1-liter, 2-liter designs, things you can fit on your desk.”</p><p>While I didn’t spot a mini PC with a socketed CPU at the show, I bumped into one with tiny modular desktop graphics cards — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/831106/minisforum-g1-pro-mini-pc-price-release-date">this Steam Machine competitor from Minisforum</a> — and it makes me excited for a possible future where we can upgrade the CPU, too. Why should only larger PCs be fully upgradable? The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">new Steam Machine</a> isn’t, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">Framework Desktop</a> requires you to upgrade a whole mainboard at a time, but it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>For that to happen, though, AMD would also have to <em>sell</em> its socketed mobile processors at retail the way it sells its desktop ones, and AMD’s not yet willing to commit to that today.</p><p>“What can I say… we have active partnerships with OEMs on Ryzen AI 400 socketed designs. DIY is not something we’re communicating information about at this time, so more to come later,” Banta said.</p><p>Here’s hoping.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/862861/amd-ces-2026-socketed-laptop-chips-strix-halo-price]]></content:encoded>

The MMO was delisted from stores yesterday, January 15, but existing owners can still play the game until it’s shut down for good.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect">blog post</a> on New World’s official website, the developer explains that New World: Aeternum’s official shutdown date will be January 31, 2027. An FAQ states that although the game has been removed from sale, owners can still install the game from their library. In October, Amazon Games announced the game would stop receiving new content, but it will continue to monitor bugs and performance for the remainder of the game’s lifetime.</p><p>Additionally, players can purchase New World's in-game currency, Marks of Fortune, until July 20. However, purchased currency cannot be refunded. Those who recently bought the game will need to contact customer support for their respective platform's storefronts to seek a potential refund.</p><p>“We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion,” reads the blog post. “We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.”</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzKWFP9dPFQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzKWFP9dPFQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>New World: Aeternum originally launched as simply <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2020/07/10/amazons-upcoming-mmorpg-new-world-delayed-to-spring-2021">New World</a> for PC in 2021. The game centers on players inhabiting and surviving on a fantasy island, Aeternum, amid the 17th century during the Age of Exploration. &nbsp;It came to consoles in 2024 with the Aeternum subtitle, along with major updates to the experience. The game was also featured in an episode of Amazon Prime’s <em>Secret Level</em> anthology series.</p><p>This news comes only a few months after Amazon <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/amazon-lays-off-more-than-14000-including-significant-role-reductions-across-its-gaming">laid off over 14,000 employees</a> across its various divisions, including its gaming division. According to Amazon, the layoffs were made to streamline the company's workflow and management layers to ensure increased investment in its "biggest bets" as part of its push to embrace AI, which it called "the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet" at the time of the layoffs. Today's news about New World: Aeternum's impending closure comes in the same week that BioWare's Anthem was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/anthems-servers-are-shutting-down-in-january-rendering-it-completely-unplayable">shut down for good</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/16/new-world-aeternum-will-be-shut-down-in-january-2027]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-switch-2-multiplayer-ditto-2000660646</link>
            <guid>1408624</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s the 30th anniversary of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> this year, and while there are probably big RPG announcements on the way, the first major game we know is coming this year is something a little bit different. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a> <span>is an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-tips-guide-2000660180"><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span>-style life sim</span></a><span> in which you help rehabilitate a desolate town into a habitat livable for Pokémon. It seems to be </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s play at the “cozy” genre, but it may have some dark undertones based on what we’ve seen. Here’s everything we know so far.</span></p> <h2><b>The premise</b></h2> <p><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>stars a Ditto who transforms into a human, whose form you will be able to customize. It is heavily implied that this human form is meant to embody Ditto’s trainer, who is missing as of the beginning of the game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>They meet a graying Tangrowth called Professor Tangrowth, with whom they decide to help rebuild a desecrated town into a livable space, complete with specialized habitats to attract new Pokémon residents. Along the way, Ditto will learn new abilities that will help it cultivate its growing town, using water attacks to water plants and fire ones to cook and burn objects. Ditto can also transform into other Pokémon for traversal’s sake, turning into a Lapras to swim between areas, for instance, or a Dragonite to fly across great distances.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As you build your plot of land back up, Pokémon will flock to it and soon you’ll have a little community of critters. They’ll come to you with requests for how to make the town better, and that will attract more Pokémon to your space. The more people that show up, the more you’ll need to build homes and other buildings to fill up the town, such as houses, Pokémon Centers, and other utilities.</span></p>

  <h2><b>New Pokémon</b></h2> <p><span>While there haven’t been any new Pokémon species announced for </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, a few returning monsters have named variants. Peakychu is a pale-white Pikachu that has an almost ghostly aura about her. Professor Tangrowth has white vines on the top of its head as if it’s an older grass-type Pokémon, and it also wears glasses and a broken Technical Machine on its head to look like a human doctor. Mosslax is a Snorlax that has been asleep for so long it’s been wrapped in vegetation. And lastly, Smearguru is a Smeargle covered in plant splotches. As best as we can tell, these are just named characters and are still considered members of the same existing species. I would be surprised if any of them showed up in the RPGs as usable party members, though.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Is it post-apocalyptic?&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>There’s a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalypse-snorlax-pikachu-fuschia-2000644400"><span>running theory</span></a><span> that </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>might be set in some kind of dark, post-apocalyptic future version of the Kanto region from </span><i><span>Pokémon Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>. Professor Tangrowth says he hasn’t seen humans in a while, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-map-kanto-region-post-apocalypse-leak-2000650529"><span>some of the areas</span></a><span> we’ve seen do seem to resemble areas from the original games. Also, each of the “new” Pokémon has some element to them that is giving post-apocalypse. Mosslax has been sleeping so long that nature is reclaiming it, Peakychu is either dead or dying, and Smearguru has seemingly been painting so much that it hasn’t had a proper shower in a while. Will the game actually explore this, or will it just be a haunting truth in the background of an otherwise cozy game? We’re not sure yet.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Multiplayer</b></h2> <p><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>will include a cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players, either by connecting online with multiple game owners, or using GameShare to play with a second player who doesn’t own the game. When using GameShare, the second player can play on the original Switch system, but the game will only be natively playable on Switch 2.</span></p>

 <h2><b>It’s a game-key card</b></h2> <p><span>Unfortunately, </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>’s physical copies will include </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-pokopia-game-key-card-2000642940"><span>a game-key card</span></a><span>, which means the cartridge you put in your system won’t actually contain the game data. Instead, it will just act as a key to tell your Switch 2 to download the game onto your system through the eShop.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>But when is it coming out?</b></h2> <p><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia </span></i><span>is coming to Switch 2 on March 5.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/16/ubisoft-to-update-old-far-cry-games-to-run-at-60fps/</link>
            <guid>1408594</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft have revealed, via the unusual method of pictogram, that three old Far Cry games will be getting an update to 60 frames per second. The games are Far Cry 3, Far Cry Blood Dragon, and Far Cry Primal, but there is no date or format information for updates.</p>



<p>Excellent use of a cat purring emoji there, Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Far Cry 5 was updated to run at 60fps <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/16/far-cry-5-free-60fps-upgrade-free-weekend/">in 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/far-cry-6/">Far Cry 6</a> launched with a 60fps mode.</p>
<p>In 2023 it was rumoured that Far Cry 7 was to be two games, Project Blackbird which is Far Cry 7, and also Project Maverick, a new stand alone multiplayer game which may be linked to Far Cry 7.</p>

<p>Ubisoft are very fond of massive multiplayer live service games that they can run for many years with content update so it makes sense they would try and make a Far Cry multiplayer title. Sources have also revealed that the game will use the Frostbite engine rather than the aging Dunia engine. Again, this makes sense, one engine for all of Ubisoft’s games means less money spent on maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<p>Far Cry 7 is said to be set in the “Alaskan wilderness” and is an extraction-based shooter” with mechanics such as permadeath, a backpack system, contracts, and more.”</p>
<p>In September 2025 Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot gave a presentation at the New Global Sport Conference and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/far-cry-7-will-focus-more-on-multiplayer-ubisoft-confirms/">said</a> that the goal with Far Cry 7 is to “really to bring the multiplayer aspects” and that it would be “more predominantly pushed so that it can also be played for a long time.”</p>
<p>Far Cry was one of three games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">folded in to a brand new compan</a>y along with Assassin’s Creed and Rainbow Six. The business unit is the new home for Ubisoft’s teams in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. The new subsidiary will control each game from these series in the back catalogue, as well as any new games that are in development going forward.</p>

			<p><strong>New Blood Interactive </strong>co-founder and chief executive officer <strong>Dave Oshry</strong> has made a name for himself, not just as the head of the indie publisher, but on the <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry">social media platform X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where he often shares his thoughts and sometimes industry insights. Today, we have the latter, as Oshry revealed the latest example of how much people <strong>hate using the Epic Games Store</strong> and would much rather use <strong>Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>In response to a meme video about how players would rather pay for a game on Steam than grab it for free off the Epic Games Store, Oshry offered a real-life example of the scenario the meme was poking fun at.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/">Blood West</a></strong> is an indie first-person shooter published by New Blood Interactive, and it was also one of the games that was given away <strong>for free on the Epic Games Store</strong> during Epic's annual holiday giveaway period, where it gives away one free game per day leading up to the new year. Blood West <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">was free for December 20, 2025</a>, and by the time the giveaway promotion had ended, it was one of the <strong>20 games</strong> that contributed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/">Epic saving players from spending <strong>$550 </strong>if they wanted to purchase all 20 games at their full, non-sale price</a>.</p>



<p>(Speaking of free games on the Epic Games Store, as a quick aside, <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-two-styx-games-are-free-on-epic-games-store/">you can currently get <strong>Styx: Master of Shadows</strong> and <strong>Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong> for free on the store</a>.)</p>



<p>But that doesn't matter to players, because they're not using the Epic Games Store anyway. They're using Steam, and when given the chance to buy a game on sale on Steam or get it for free on the Epic Games Store, they'd rather buy it on Steam. </p>



<p>"<em>Blood West was free on EGS over the holidays and sold like 200% more on Steam that day</em>," Oshry wrote in response to the meme post. "<em>I used to think EGS was a Marketing Black Hole but turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Oshry continued to explain that when a game is made free on the Epic Games Store, Epic offers developers a lump-sum royalty payment for the period it's available for free, all of which went directly to Blood West's developer, <strong>Hyperstrange</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>New Blood doesn't get any royalties from EGS we let Hyperstrange take 100% of that - so they got the $$$ bag for the free giveaway, are putting that money into developing the new DLC and we got more Steam sales too</em>," Oshry said. In response to another user, Oshry revealed he had conducted an interview earlier in the day, where he said, "<em>Epic could give devs 100% of sales and it doesn't mean shit if there's no sales lol. WHAT'S 100% OF $0</em>."</p>



<p>Back in December, while Epic was in the middle of its end-of-year giveaways,<a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/"> <strong>The Astronauts</strong> founder <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong> put it bluntly, and perhaps best:</a> "<em></em><em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community</em>." Oshry's example today is just the latest to make it clear that players are choosing to stick with their communities. </p>

              <p>Since the New Year, discussions about <em>Arc Raiders</em> have shifted from near-unadulterated praise (for everything but its use of AI voices) to growing concerns over the game’s cheating problem. Developer Embark has already started making moves to improve this, first removing access to the console in the PC version, and now issuing some quite surprisingly dramatic bans to those it’s catching stream-sniping.</p> <p>Things started getting heated around January 6 <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-ninja-shroud-embark-patch-2000657708">when streamer Shroud expressed his frustration</a> during a live broadcast, uttering “What’s the point of fuckin’ playing?” as he encountered so many issues. He was joined by other big names like Ninja and Nadeshot in making it clear that if something didn’t change soon, the high-profile players were likely to move on to other games.</p>

 <p>At the same time, others were complaining that PC players were able to access the Unreal Engine console within the game and switch off various visual settings such that they could see other players with effectively supernatural vision. By January 13, Embark released a new patch that nerfed a couple of elements that were spoiling PvP, while also preventing key card spoof cheats. This followed a hotfix that removed the console from the PC build, with the explanation that it was never supposed to have been available. And this all followed an announcement on the game’s Discord that <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-devs-say-they-have-big-plans-to-stop-the-current-wave-of-cheaters-2000658425">there were longer-term plans in place</a> for addressing the wider cheating concerns.</p>

 <p>Today, it seems, Embark has begun better wielding the banhammer. According to various posts on Reddit and X, streamers have reported that those players engaging in stream sniping are finally receiving retribution, while others have been posting images of ban messages to social media.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">not even 30 minutes later and theyre banned😭 <a href="https://t.co/QxBqjMaGo5">https://t.co/QxBqjMaGo5</a> <a href="https://t.co/aY2AtwALEC">pic.twitter.com/aY2AtwALEC</a></p> <p>— aimkey (@aimkeyx) <a href="https://twitter.com/aimkeyx/status/2012139292001448355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>And these aren’t 24-hour slaps on the wrist, either. One image of a ban posted to X by user @aimkeyx begins, “Permanently suspended,” with accompanying text reading:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Your account has been permanently suspended for behavior that violates our code of conduct. Due to the severity of your violation, access to your account will not be restored.”</p></blockquote> <p>This is a big step up from the 30-day bans that were being issued previously.</p> <p>The few examples we’ve been able to find so far seem to focus on stream snipers. These are people who either deliberately try their luck to get into the same lobby as a streamer, or use external software to ensure they do should the streamer make the mistake of leaving the UUID for their game session visible at the bottom of the screen. While the former might seem unlikely to work often enough for a person to ensure to match up, you have to factor in that should a streamer have tens of thousands of viewers, there could be a couple of hundred people attempting to cheat this way, making the chances of <em>someone</em> managing it a lot higher. And of course once in the same lobby, they can use the livestream footage to gain an advantage over the streamer. But it does seem to suggest that Embark is taking the issue seriously.</p>

 <p>One streamer who claims to have been caught in the crossfire of all this is Tfue, who found he had a 30-day suspension from <em>Arc Raiders</em> a few days ago. Many suggested it could be because Tfue brought up the console on his stream to show how it could be exploited, although he claims he didn’t actually use it. Others made unsupported accusations about the use of various macros, which Tfue strongly denied. Eventually the Twitch streamer with 11.4 million followers had his account restored, seeming to suggest it was an error.</p>

  <p>Who knows! Tfue’s ban was clearly one of the more regular 30-day sin-binnings, rather than these new permanent exclusions. It’ll be interesting to see if things improve for streamers, and then hopefully for the wider PvP audience for the game.</p> <p>Meanwhile, can I suggest a far better way to play? This is my favorite&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>clip of all time:</p>

BF Studios describes the update, which has a January 20 release date and serves as the first update Battlefield 6 has seen in a month and a half, as “a smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, patch 1.1.3.5 delivers a set of improvements, gameplay tweaks, and balance changes fans have anticipated since launch arrived in October. Jet combat will feel quite different going into the extended Season 1, with cannon damage against other flying vehicles significantly reduced, requiring “approximately 40% more hits” to destroy targets. There’s currently no sign of the previously mentioned dedicated air radar, which was promised to arrive after Season 1 in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios has had a jet balance pass in its sights for some time, but the January 20 update for Battlefield 6 is also said to come with what sounds like a pretty wide-ranging update for melee combat. As players have complained of inconsistent knife and sledgehammer attacks, patch 1.1.3.5 aims to improve responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for those who like to get up close and personal. Another set of smaller changes targets the Assault Ladder, which should behave, well, more like a ladder going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 Season 1 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1110-now-live-on-all-platforms-ahead-of-season-1-and-battle-pass-progression-later-today">launched</a> October 28 and was scheduled to bring its REDSEC offshoot, maps, weapons, modes, and more to the experience through early-to-mid January. As the three-part debut season came to an end, players were left wondering how Season 2 might reinvigorate an experience that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community">steadily falling out of favor with fans</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t until January 13, much later than many expected, that BF Studios was finally ready to speak on Season 2, but the news update wasn’t exactly the one many were expecting. Instead of a roadmap, the team announced that Season 2 had been delayed to February 17, with its contents to be detailed at a later date. In its place, Season 1 will roll on, with smaller updates and bonuses to be delivered during the downtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.5 will keep the ball rolling, even if it’s just a slight nudge toward the next major content drop. In other news, it was announced this morning that The Division lead Julian Gerighty had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-week-after-saying-the-division-3-was-shaping-up-to-be-a-monster-franchise-boss-julian-gerighty-leaves-ubisoft-for-battlefield-developer-dice">left Ubisoft and to join BF Studios developer DICE</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can read the full 1.1.3.5 patch notes below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 Patch Notes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With Update 1.1.3.5, we’re delivering a smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency across Battlefield 6.

But while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gulikit-elves-2-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-wake-up-support-cant-make-up-for-the-downgrades">Elves 2</a> certainly boasts a unique design, it's ultimately lacking in other areas and looks somewhat ‘cheap’ compared to other models.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067szvkyj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>With the TT Pro / TT Max pads, however, Gulikit has created its best controllers yet at $59.99 / £59.99 and $69.99 / $69.99 respectively; two that, in my opinion, just edge out 8BitDo’s Pro 3 as the strongest third-party offering for Switch 2 so far.</p>

<p>One glance at the Pro or Max — I'm covering both here — and you’d be forgiven for thinking, 'But this is just an Xbox controller!' And yes, Gulikit has been leaning heavily on Microsoft’s design for a while now, so the overall shape is much the same. Putting it side-by-side with an official Xbox pad reveals that the Pro/Max is slightly lengthier, but otherwise you’d be hard pressed to find much difference with the form factor.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> different, however, is the D-pad placement, which has been swapped with the left analogue stick for a more symmetrical design akin to the PlayStation DualSense (and, fortuitously for comparison's sake, the Pro 3). Whether this is a good thing or not really depends on personal preference, but I like it. Having the D-pad up high makes the Pro/Max a wonderful choice for both fighting and retro games, but if you do want to use it for 3D titles with both analogue sticks, this still feels really good.</p>
<p>The D-pad includes two floating designs that you can swap out on the fly. One is more traditional, with a cross on its face, while the other is basically just a concave disc. When I saw the latter in promotional images, I feared the worst, but it’s actually my go-to option. You can still feel the tactile response from the eight directional inputs, and it just feels really nice to waggle about. Overall, the D-pad is responsive and satisfying to use, while lacking the annoying ‘clicking’ sound of the Pro 3.</p>

<p>The analogue sticks feel great, too, and the TMR tech <em>should</em> keep dreaded stick drift at bay for many years to come. Gulikit has also included RGB lighting around both sticks if you’re into that kind of thing, and you can change this via the controller itself to display a basic blue, a rainbow multi-coloured effect, or have it light up depending on the direction you’re moving the sticks. If you don’t want any of this, you can turn it off entirely.</p>
<p>This is also where the Pro and Max differ the most. The latter contains an extra four stick caps of varying heights. In my time testing the controllers, I didn’t really come across any scenarios in which a lengthier stick cap proved necessary, but it’s nice that these are included.</p>
<p>The Max also includes the option to swap between four and eight-directional inputs on the D-pad, while the ‘Auto-Pilot Gaming’ (APG) functionality — which lets you record and play back specific input combos — includes longer time options.</p>
<p>The ABXY buttons all feel exactly as you’d expect, though like the D-pad, these are generally a bit quieter than the Pro 3. If you fancy using the Pro/Max on PC, you can also swap out the buttons for the standard Xbox layout using the included tweezers. Spacing is slightly closer than what you’d see on Nintendo's official Pro Controller and the Pro 3, so everything is easily within reach, while the convex shape of the buttons themselves feels pleasant enough.</p>

<p>Up on top, you’ve got Xbox-inspired triggers, and just like the Pro 3, you can toggle between micro-switch inputs and pressure-sensitive Hall Effect inputs with the relevant switches over on the back. Both options feel great, and I found I’ve been swapping between the two depending on what game I’m playing. So I’d have the full Hall Effect triggers activated for something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, while the micro-switches feel better on more retro offerings like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>. To be clear, Mario Kart doesn't make use of analogue triggers; they just feel more natural to me in modern games.</p>
<p>Both pads come with additional paddles that you can add into the four slots on the back. These are nearly identical to what you’d find on the Xbox Elite Controller, and so they’re designed in a way that your two middle fingers rest comfortably on them without accidentally pressing them in.</p>
<p>Again, mapping inputs to these is all done via the controller itself by utilising the settings button in the centre of the device. Gulikit includes a manual for any settings you might want to fiddle around with, and it’s much preferable to loading up an app. If you’re not keen on having the paddles, then the controllers still feel comfortable without them.</p>

<p>In addition to all the bells and whistles you’d expect to find, the Pro and Max have a plethora of additional options. I mentioned a few already, but you’ve also got a range of rumble settings depending on how much feedback you want. I can’t stress enough just how good the rumble really is; it’s just a hair away from being on par with the official Pro Controller 2.</p>
<p>You can also adjust gyro sensitivity, dead zones, and more, and there's a capture button for snapping those sweet Mario Kart World wins. In terms of exclusions, it lacks a headphone jack, NFC amiibo support, and a dedicated chat button. I don’t personally consider any of these essentials, but you may feel different.</p>
<p>Gulikit states wireless latency of 2.62ms with a 730Hz polling rate (the frequency at which data is sent from the controller to the console), while plugging the controllers in reduces this even further to 2.16ms. I've found them to be remarkably responsive in practice.</p>
<p>The retail models also come bundled with Gulikit's own <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1534859.html">Hyperlink 2 Adapter</a>, so if you want to go Bluetooth wireless while eliminating the possibility of interference from elsewhere, that's an option too with a quoted polling rate of 820hz at 2.95ms (and if you <em>really</em> want to, you can use the adapter to link up a PS5 Dualsense to the Switch 2 – wild stuff).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ve used the Max specifically almost every day for over a month and only needed to recharge it once. Gulikit claims between 14 - 26 hours between charges depending on settings, and that sounds about right; it easily lasted for longer than 20 hours or so in practice. It’s head and shoulders above most competition, then, and is perhaps second only to Nintendo's Pro Controller.</p>

<p>So overall, the TT Pro and Max are absolute beasts. Not only do they have wake-up support for Switch 2, but they're easily two of the most comfortable controllers I've ever grasped in my grubby mitts. The D-pad placement works nicely for me, but I could certainly understand if you prefer the offset approach. And with the TMR sticks, Hall Effect triggers, RGB lighting, and loads of settings to fiddle around with, Gulikit has provided almost everything you could reasonably want or need from a third-party pad.</p>
<p>Most folks will be quite happy with the Pro model here, with only a minority finding genuine use for the additional stick caps found in the Max. Heck, at $70 though, the Max provides pretty much everything you'd find in Xbox's own Elite Controller at more than half the price. It's insane value for money, and in my opinion, the best third-party controller for Switch 2 so far.</p>
<p>Now, if companies could stop using the word 'Pro' to name their controllers, that'd be <em>great</em>.</p>
