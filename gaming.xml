            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbro has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>development team is currently working on an AAA game based on one of the tabletop giant's "tentpole" IPs.</p>

<p>The news comes courtesy of an earnings call to mark Hasbro revealing its fourth-quarter financials earlier today (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/saber-interactive-developing-aaa-game-based-on-tentpole-hasbro-ip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>). In that call, CEO Chris Cocks said the new game, which will be developed by&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>studio Saber, will combine "high-octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer".</p>

<p>Cocks went on to say that the game will utilize Saber's Swarm technology, presumably referring to the Swarm Engine on which&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>runs, alongside games like&nbsp;<em>SnowRunner&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>World War Z</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip-shooting.jpg?itok=-4Dr23Sw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip-shooting.jpg?itok=V0ZNWTKF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s development studio will be working with Hasbro on one of the latter's "tentpole" IPs.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Swarm tech to which Cocks refers doesn't necessarily mean we'll be seeing the same kind of massive hordes of enemies present in both&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>World War Z</em>; it's the name for the engine, after all, rather than just that one feature.</p>

<p>As for which IP Cocks is referring to, Hasbro is naturally playing those cards very close to its chest, and I use those words advisedly.</p>

<p>IPs the company controls include&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">getting a Legendary Pictures-produced movie</a>, potentially making it a solid candidate for a new AAA video game.</p>

<p>Other potential IPs might include&nbsp;<em>Transformers</em>, although the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">cancellation of Splash Damage's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">Transformers: Reactivate</a>&nbsp;</em>might put a dent in that theory, as well as&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Power Rangers</em>, and, uh,&nbsp;<em>Peppa Pig</em>. Yeah, it's probably that last one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/power-rangers-ritas-rewind-hasbro-ip.jpg?itok=7s_77ECX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/power-rangers-ritas-rewind-hasbro-ip.jpg?itok=tyaykkAP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could a new AAA&nbsp;<em>Power Rangers&nbsp;</em>game be on the cards?</figcaption></figure><p>If Hasbro and Saber are working on a single-player&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game, then it'll be in good company, slotting alongside the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live service multiplayer game</a> currently in the works at&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>studio Starbreeze.</p>

<p>Of course, if it is&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-related, Saber and Hasbro will have to make sure they don't repeat the mistakes of the genuinely awful&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february" rel="nofollow">being delisted next week</a>.</p>

<p>It is, however, probably safe to assume that we're not about to see a major AAA game based on&nbsp;<em>Monopoly&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Cluedo</em>, as sad as I am about that. It's also unlikely we'll hear anything more about this one for quite a while, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Dune: Awakening is releasing for PC on May 20, 2025. Release date for PlayStation and Xbox will be revealed later.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-pc-release-date-and-price-revealed">Dune: Awakening PC Release Date and Price Revealed </h2>



<p>Dune: Awakening developers revealed their PC release date today, along with details about the pricing and pre-order bonuses for the game. Once the pre-orders start, players can purchase the game for $49.99/€49.99. Pre-ordering Dune: Awakening on PC will also reward players the Terrarium of Muad’Dib, which is an in-base decoration that houses a desert mouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from Dune: Awakening’s PC release date, the developers revealed that players can start their journey in Arrakis today, with the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">character creator and benchmark mode</a>. Players can download and try out the character creator right now by, where they can customise every aspect of their appearance, along with their home planet, caste and mentor. The benchmark mode will help test your PC performance before the game arrives.</p>



<p>Moreover, using the character creator and benchmark mode in Dune: Awakening will also provide another reward, a free key to unlock the Flameblade knife skin at launch. After their character creator shenanigans are over, players can import their character in the full game once Dune: Awakening releases on March 20.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s nearly time to preload Monster Hunter Wilds, and we need to show you its file size across console and PC so you can install it safely on your chosen platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is aptly going to be a wild ride. The already creatures look bigger and badder than ever before, for one thing. This is only the beginning as Capcom has already surprised players by revealing some of Wilds’ forthcoming content via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-roadmap-mizutsune-dlc-update-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap and DLC plans</a>.</p>



<p>Before we get close to this point, we need Monster Hunter Wilds preloaded. Let’s check its file size on different platforms and assist you with this—you’re on your own with monsters though!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-monster-hunter-wilds">How to Preload Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Scary. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to pre-purchase any edition of Monster Hunter Wilds, wait until two days before launch, click to download Monster Hunter Wilds, and it should be ready for release.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> preload process is straightforward enough. But if you’ve never done this before or need a little reminder, we’ve got you covered:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose which platform you want to play Monster Hunter Wilds on.</li>



<li>Go to the storefront and search for <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong>.</li>



<li>Select one of its several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-editions-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editions</a>.</li>



<li>Complete your purchase to secure exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-monster-hunter-wilds-pre-order-bonuses-how-to-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order bonuses</a>.</li>



<li>Wait for the preload option to go live on <strong>February 26</strong>.</li>



<li>Once it does, click the download option.</li>



<li>When it’s complete, Monster Hunter Wilds is now ready to play the second it goes live!</li>
</ol>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1886931557304144111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds X page</a> has said accurate start times are coming. At the very least, you know you have up to 48 hours before launch to prepare and preload Monster Hunter Wilds to get it installed.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-file-size-explained">Monster Hunter Wilds File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds is 52.826 GB on PS5, requires at least 75 GB on PC, and Microsoft still hasn’t made it clear how much memory is required on Xbox.</strong></p>



<p>You can read more about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-file-size-how-many-gb-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wilds’ file sizes with our handy guide</a>, but this should give you a good idea of what’s required. </p>



<p>The Xbox page has been devoid of accurate memory information for a while now. I can’t imagine it being more than 75 GB, so expect it to be somewhere between the PS5 and PC file size.</p>



<hr>



<p>Will you be jumping on the Monster Hunter Wilds train early? Are the file size requirements quite general compared to many other modern-day sizes?</p>



<p>Even though we don’t have the Xbox file size, we have the latest on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds appearing on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> fans concerned about the game's future under new ownership have launched a campaign highlighting the need to protect the app and its community from the addition of predatory monetisation practices.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, a Bloomberg report stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">Pokémon Go developer Niantic was looking to sell its gaming portfolio to Scopely</a>, the Saudi-backed mobile publisher behind Monopoly Go.
</p>
<p>
The news sent shockwaves through Pokémon Go's community, and generated fears that the move would be a profoundly negative one for the game's long-term future and its players.
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, while criticising Pokémon Go developer Niantic is a common past-time for many of the game's fans, it didn't take long for players of other Scopely games to sound the alarm that things were likely to get a whole lot worse. 
</p>
<p>
"For those unfamiliar, Scopely is known for games like Marvel Strike Force and Star Trek Fleet Command," reads a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1itre34/write_to_the_pok%C3%A9mon_company_if_youre_concerned/">thread by user Tetrylene on top Pokémon Go fan reddit TheSilphRoad</a>. "Many from those communities have voiced concerns over the overtly aggressive monetisation tactics, including paywalls and pay-to-win mechanics. I know this potential shift personally fills me with dread."
</p>
<p>
"Oh... dear..." wrote Pokémon Go fan misskass, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1ist4dr/pok%C3%A9mon_go_maker_nears_35_billion_deal_to_sell/?sort=confidence">responding to the initial report that Niantic's games were up for sale</a>. "I play another Scopely game (Marvel Strike Force) and the quality is declining year after year. Pokemon Go is effectively free to play, but Strike Force is powerfully pay to win. Like, no access to any of the top characters for 6+ months after they release kind of pay to win. And then when you can access them, they're instantly powercrept."
</p>
<p>
Another fan pointed back to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStrikeForce/comments/esoh5m/looney_ambassador_moderator_from_scopely_here/?share_id=0T1s0bOj8yB2SnjeE5sbS">post on the Marvel Strike Force reddit</a> from five years ago, similarly warning fans of that game what Scopely would likely change based on how it had previously taken on Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem and tightened the screws of monetisation.
</p>
<p>
"Was coming here to say the exact same thing," agreed reddit user Todd999430. "I played Marvel Strike Force prior to Scopely acquiring the game and then a year or two afterwards. Marvel Strike Force went from a game for light spenders to compete to 'unless you're dropping $500 a month, you can't be in a top alliance'."
</p>
<p>
For Pokémon Go players, many of whom play the game as part of real-world communities made up of friends and acquaintances met over the past nine years, the idea of the game's ownership changing is real concern.
</p>
<p>
"Beyond being the only real game I play anymore, it serves as a major conduit for me and my friends socially to connect and meet-up over," Tetrylene's post continues. "I run a local group with them, and the idea of the group eventually dwindling as people are alienated (instead of slowly and gradually growing as is now) is genuinely bleak to think about. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm sure it's the same for many of you here - the game is a big reason a lot of us have been motivated to exercise, make friends and explore new places. I know I don't want to lose that to a faceless group of investment fund board members."
</p>
<p>
In response, the Pokémon Go community is being encouraged to make its feelings known to The Pokémon Company - the franchise's overall owner, who will undoubtedly have an opinion on which company takes on the still lucrative and high-profile game.
</p>
<p>
"The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and old school <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> communities have shown several times that it's worth kicking up fuss about negative changes. Those communities have managed to redirect the course of their respective games on several occasions," Tetrylene continued.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, trying to exert some influence on such large-scale business deals between entities like these might seem daunting, but we have to try. Bad press / user complaints will at least be a factor of consideration, however small, it will surely be noted in discussions. If nothing else, it might make TPC more cautious and tighten the reigns of a new representative of their carefully managed brand."
</p>
<p>
Tetrylene's thread encourages Pokémon Go players to <a href="https://support.pokemon.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=17787426192916">message The Pokémon Company</a> to express the need to preserve the game's integrity without additional monetisation features, highlight the community-driven nature of the game, and flag the potential damage to The Pokémon Company's own brand should Scopely be allowed to do to the game what it has already done to others.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted The Pokémon Company for comment on the potential sale, but did not receive a response. A Niantic spokesperson declined comment.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/vanya-national-theatre-scott</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-thing-to-happen-to-me-this-week-was-andrew-scott%E2%80%99s-one-man-uncle-vanya.1114512/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/vanya-national-theatre-scott<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am, I guess, middle-aged, which is a bit hard to define when you’re queer and single, or in the absence of the milestones that are supposed to mark this time of my life. I feel pretty good about getting older, but I do sometimes have middle-aged thoughts: Have I done the right things with my life? How likely are the things I still want to do? Am I as happy as I could be; am I less happy than I was in the past? Will I be happy in the future, a question both about whether the future will have happiness-creating circumstances and if I have the appropriate capacity for happiness left inside me.</p><p>It’s hard to feel hopeful about the future these days, even though I’m <a href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">far</a> from giving in to despair. At the protests I’ve been to in recent weeks, the idea of “trans joy” often gets brought up as vital, without much defining of what “joy” is. Is “joy” now something different than it was before 2016, or 2020, or 2024? Is it waking up every day proudly trans despite a government that wants me dead? Is it that I can write the things I want despite a <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-media-journalism-layoffs-gamurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crumbling industry</a>? Have “simple” things like this become radical acts, and is that a meaningful life lesson about gratitude and change and satisfaction? Or is it a sign of how shortened our horizons are becoming, that “still trans” and “not being humiliated by private equity goons” are now major achievements? Are things going to be this bad, or worse, forever?&nbsp;</p><p>One good thing about being middle-aged is that I’m regularly reminded that I’m not the first person to have any thought or feeling, even if it’s my first time having it. I was reminded of this last night while watching <em>Vanya</em>, a one-man adaptation of Chekhov’s <em>Uncle Vanya</em> by Simon Stephens and starring Andrew Scott of <em>Sherlock </em>and <em>Ripley</em> fame. After running in London, the play is coming to <a href="https://vanyaonstage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York</a> in March; I was excited about this until I learned that tickets cost over $300. But for a much more reasonable $12 I could watch the show through the <a href="https://www.ntathome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Theatre’s subscription program</a>, something I’ve been meaning to do for a while but which the absurd price of the in-person tickets finally got me to bite the bullet on.</p><p><em>Uncle Vanya</em> is about a group of people obsessed with age and happiness and whether life has passed them by and why. <em>Vanya</em> sticks to the plot of Chekhov’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Vanya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1897</a> play, though it modernizes the language and anglicizes the names. The play takes place on a country estate that once belonged to titular character Ivan’s sister Anna, who died. Now, Ivan and his niece Sonya care for the estate to support Anna’s elderly widower Alexander, here a washed-up filmmaker, who has married a much younger second wife, Helena. Ivan is attracted to Helena, as is the country doctor Michael, whom Sonya has long had a crush on. Things come to a head when Alexander declares that he wants to sell the estate and live off the proceeds, threatening to upend the miserable routines everyone’s been trapped in since Anna’s death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Vanya | Exclusive Clip | National Theatre Live" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QseI_vdq7s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Everyone in <em>Vanya</em> loves each other, and hates each other, and longs for change, and will do anything to keep staying stuck. Everyone is so anxious about their own happiness and curious about the happiness of others, but only insofar as how that possible happiness might reflect on their own happiness or lack thereof. Frustrated ambition is everywhere: Ivan worships Alexander’s films, despite the fact that he hasn’t made any in nearly two decades, and he also blames Alexander’s success for his own miserly life, feeling like he could have been great if only he hadn’t had to spend his life tending to the estate. Sonya has never told Michael her true feelings; when she makes the overture of a confession, Michael can barely tell what she’s talking about. Michael himself waxes lyrical about his hobby of planting trees to stave off the environmental degradation of the countryside, but the only version of him we see is one who drinks too much and constantly threatens to leave but never seems to. Everyone picks constantly at what it means to be happy, or to be talented, or to be interesting or fulfilled or old or young or pretty or plain, needing someone else to be or not be those things to justify why they are or aren’t those things. Everyone is tremendously complicated, but also so painfully simple, so earnestly full of longing for the love and fulfillment that they think they deserve but can’t have.</p><p>But “everyone” here is just Andrew Scott, who plays all the characters. It’s frankly astonishing to watch him: for a play that feels so deeply concerned with decrepitude and aging, he is inspiringly vital and alive in the roles. It’s never hard to tell who’s talking; characters are sometimes differentiated by a prop like a tennis ball or sunglasses, by playing with a necklace or twisting a dish towel, but they’re just as often portrayed by the slightest change of voice or widening of the eyes. (As jealous as I am of anyone who can afford to see the show live, the filmed version is able to focus on these subtle gestures and facial expressions in a way that would be lost in a theater.) It’s incredible that it’s never goofy to watch Scott have a conversation or fight with himself; at several points he portrays one character holding another back, or sharing an illicit kiss, and it somehow works perfectly even though it absolutely shouldn’t.&nbsp;</p><p>I was intrigued by the idea of the show, but I never quite got why it had to be a one-person cast. Especially with a major star at the helm, it could easily be a vanity project, or the kind of <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twist</a> a revival shoehorns in to justify itself. But here, the solo cast amplifies the way <em>Vanya</em>’s characters are both obsessed with and ignorant of each other’s internal lives, how it feels like they’re fighting over the world’s limited amount of happiness like a game of capture the flag. You could read it, maybe, as a metaphor for our country these days, one body being torn apart by competing desires, the arm blaming the leg for why it can’t reach what it wants. You could see it, as I did in this viewing, as a symbol of how hard it is to follow our desires when we can want so many things, of not becoming bitter over our own choices, of seeing all our possibilities. Real circumstances do conspire against the play’s characters–the nature of peasant life in Chekhov’s Russia, poverty and tragedy–but they have more agency than they think, if only they’d get out of their own ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Vanya | 'No light in the trees' | National Theatre at Home" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Vm1hiBroG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>After Alexander brings up the idea of selling the estate, Ivan tries to shoot him; to his own amazement, he misses, twice. It’s a great bit of theatrical structure that this isn’t the end of the play; there’s another act, where everyone decides to pretend nothing happened, and Alexander and Helena go back to the city, and Ivan and Sonya get back to their work on the estate. Things could, and should, have changed, but nothing does. Near the end, Vanya gives a monologue:</p><blockquote><p>Could you imagine if it was possible to completely change the way you live your life? To look at your life and ask yourself what you would do if it had ended? Your old life, it’s over. And then take what’s left of your real life and live it properly. How do I do that? Where do I start?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Through Scott as all the characters, asking himself this question, it’s a sad one–if caring for the estate has held him back all these years, he could have let Alexander sell it–but it’s also a reminder that it <em>is</em> possible, at any time, to overcome at least some of the barriers we put in our own ways. I can grudgingly get why <em>Vanya</em> is worth all that money to see, but it was a delight to get to see it for much less due to <a href="https://playbill.com/article/national-theatre-at-home-launches-on-demand-streaming-platform-with-coriolanus-medea-amadeus-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">innovations in arts access that came out of covid</a> and somehow still persist. (My list of other plays to watch with my subscription is now very long.) These days, I’ll take my joys where I can get them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-twitch-stream-big-book"><h3>Contrary To Popular Belief, Streaming On Twitch Is Work</h3></a><p>"Streaming is more enjoyable in some ways, but work is work no matter what the job is that you’re doing"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamestop-stonks-shares-closures-store"><h3>GameStop Is A Very 21st Century Company</h3></a><p>And also has the most predictable trajectory</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Steel Hunters was announced at the end of last year, a sci-fi break away from Wargaming’s bread and butter historical warfare games. This is a PvPvE game in which six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, stomping around in their imposing mechs, doing battle with the drones that patrol the contaminated world, looking to collect enough Starfall resources, and then get out while battling other human players.</p>

<p>There’s seven Hunters to choose from, including the all-rounder Razorside, quadruped&nbsp;Ursus and Fenris, sniper Heartbreaker, combat medic Trenchwalker, and drone-summoning Prophet.</p>

			<p>The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V is getting a free upgrade on PC in a few days that will introduce, among other things, ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion and support for NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR.</p>
<p>The new update, which will go live on March 4th, will bring all the latest improvements introduced on consoles, including a range of new vehicles and upgrades at Hao's Special Works, Premium Test Rides, HSW Races, and HSW Time Trails, Ambient Animals that can be photographed to participate in the daily Wildlife Photography Challenge, the ability to obtain special benefits for GTA Online via a GTA+ Membership, a renewed Landing Page, a free GTA$4,000,000 and a few more additional items to get started in GTA Online and more.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the biggest improvements the Grand Theft Auto V March 4th upgrade will bring are new technical enhancements, such as the PC-exclusive ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion, plus the ray-traced shadows and reflections also available on current generation consoles, NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 1 and 3 support, faster loading times using an SSD with DirectStorage, DualSense controller support, and enhanced audio. Following the launch of the update, however, Rockstar Games will continue to support the previous version of the game, allowing those with hardware that does not meet the new minimum requirements to keep playing. The updated requirements can be found below.</p>

<p>Lots of recent features added to&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>on consoles, like kernel-level anti-cheat for&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>and "proactive voice chat moderation", will also be available for the PC version, as well as a number of technical enhancements.</p>

<p>Loading times should also be improved if you're playing on an SSD and using DirectStorage, and the game will now also support "higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates" across the board.</p>

<p>If you're a PS5 controller owner, you'll be happy to know that&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>will now support the DualSense controller on PC, complete with adaptive trigger compatibility.</p>

<p>The game's first trailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">aired back in December 2023</a>, racking up a staggering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-achieved-crazy-90-million-views-in-24-hours" rel="nofollow">90 million views</a> within a 24-hour period.

<p>According to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two,&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">still on track to launch in fall this year</a>, but until then, you can content yourself with this upcoming&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>PC update.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-brings-open-world-survival-to-arrakis-in-may.1114491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Funcom has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>release date, and if you're eager to begin your journey of survival on the desert world of Arrakis, then you can get stuck into the character creation tool right now.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches on PC on May 20th. Unfortunately, it won't be landing on consoles at the same time; Funcom says a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release date for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>As a sweetener, however, you can try out the game's character creation tool right now. It also comes complete with a benchmark tool, so you can check whether your PC is beefy enough to run the game in the first place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=1B-mbdvd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=fFNP_ldX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>officially lands on PC in May.</figcaption></figure><p>When it launches,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will set you back $49.99 or your regional equivalent. Pre-orders aren't live just yet, but when they do go live, pre-ordering the game will net you the Terrarium of Muad'Dib, which you can use to decorate your base with an adorable little desert mouse.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you check out the character creator and benchmark tool for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>ahead of launch, you'll get a Frameblade knife skin that you'll be able to redeem once you pick up the full game. Of course, you can transfer your created character into&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>when it launches.</p>

<p>Using the tool, you can not only make your character, but also decide which caste, home planet, and mentor you want. Which mentor you pick will determine your starting abilities, but you'll be able to mix and match as well, so you can be a Swordmaster with some Bene Gesserit abilities if you want.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>, it's an open-world survival game with an emphasis on multiplayer. The game takes place on the desert planet of Arrakis and sees you "embark[ing] on a journey from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-reveals-spectacular-gameplay-and-details" rel="nofollow">scavenging and survival to controlling the planet itself</a>".</p>




<p>Funcom says&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will be perfect for both fans of Frank Herbert's original&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>novels and those who've never picked up one of the books or watched one of the movies.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on May 20th. You can check out our hands-off preview of the game from back in March last year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dune-awakening-preview-pax-east-2024" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Whatever comes out of Brendan Greene’s sprawling 10-year trilogy of projects at PlayerUnknown Productions, it won’t be a successor to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds</a>, popularly known hereabouts as Plunkbat - the grandfather of battle royales, which Greene developed as creative director at Bluehole, a subsidiary of Krafton.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to me at the company's Amsterdam offices this month, Greene referred briefly to the project that made his reputation. As you’d expect, he’s been bombarded over the years with requests to make a new PUBG, but having left Krafton in August 2021 to lead PlayerUnknown Productions as an independent studio, he’s under no real pressure to do so.
</p>
<p>
“We got seed funding when we left Krafton, and we're still independent fully,” he told me. “I have control of the business. I have no investors telling me to make things. People have over time tried to get me to just make another PlayerUnknown game, but that's not what I'm interested in. And they just think another PlayerUnknown game would essentially be an FPS game, right - go do that. I'm like, okay, no.”
</p>
<p>
Instead, Greene is currently working on Prologue: Go Wayback!, an exasperatingly named wilderness survival sim, out in early access this spring, which makes use of in-house machine learning technology.</p>
<p>I’ve played a WIP version of Go Wayback – preview to follow – and can tell you that it lacks such Plunkbatty features as shrinking maps or, erm, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tour-de-jeux-pubg-bicycle-commuting-is-fun-silly-and-sometimes-even-smart">bicycles</a>. Instead, it’s a lonely, challenging game of navigation, in which players have to find their way to a radio tower without perishing of cold, hunger, thirst or falling off cliffs. It's also a stepping stone along the way to another game, Artemis, which will offer bigger maps and higher headcounts, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-creator-wants-to-build-a-metaverse-but-says-it-might-take-15-years-and-cant-explain-what-it-will-look-like-yet">amongst other things</a>.
</p>
<p>
PlayerUnknown Productions has already released a sample of Go Wayback’s machine learning technology in the form of a tech demo, Preface: Undiscovered Worlds. I’m obviously pretty suspicious of anything that involves machine generation in this, the era of ChatGPT and Midjourney, but PUP’s tech isn’t quite in the same bracket. It's based on in-house art, publicly available GIS (geographic information system) data, and satellite photography of the Czech countryside. I’ll be talking more about that in my preview.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/1_jfCXiAL.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>PlayerUnknown Productions</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Since launching Preface, which has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/">a Mostly Negative user review consensus on Steam</a> at the time of writing, PUP have faced additional calls to work on something Battlegroundsy, together with shows of support for Greene’s new direction.
</p>
<p>
“There was a comment on our Discord the other night where it was like, ‘just make PUBG 2’,” creative director Scott Davidson told me at the Go Wayback event. “And then a lot of people from the community piled on and said, ‘well you can just go and play PUBG’, you know, they're trying to build something different here.
</p>
<p>
“You're always going to have people who are like, ‘why didn't you just do the thing that you did before, that we really liked’ and you're like, ‘but the reason you liked it is because it was different than everything else’. So that's what we’re doing again.” 
</p>
<p>
It's possible, however, that Go Wayback might become more Plunkbatlike with age. It'll grow during early access in response to feedback, with the possibility of guns and multiplayer features.
</p>
<p>
While Greene may have moved on from PUBG, the same can’t be said for his old employer Krafton, who are trying to pioneer a "PUBG Universe" of games including mobile game New State. The PUBGverse once included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> spiritual successor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>, but this eventually became its own thing. Other forthcoming Plunko-stravaganzas include the recently announced top-down 5v5 shooter PUBG: Blindspot, aka <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-pubg-developers-new-pvp-shooter-looks-like-top-down-rainbow-six-siege-with-a-bit-of-hotline-miami">Project Arc</a>.

                <p>In a shocking <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-mgm-studios-james-bond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement</a>, Amazon MGM Studios has announced that it is taking over creative control of the James Bond series as part of a deal with series stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. What does this mean for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-dev-talks-about-new-james-bond-007-game-and-its-completely-original-story/1100-6489783/" data-ref-id="1100-6489783">Hitman developer IO's new James Bond game</a>, or any other future Bond projects? We don't know as of yet, but given just how long Broccoli and Wilson have led the franchise, changes could be afoot.</p><p>Broccoli and Wilson had managed the James Bond franchise for almost 60 years, following it being passed down from their father, Cubby Broccoli. The pair have been the driving force behind the entire Bond franchise during that period, including selecting the actors who would play the iconic spy.Their work has extended beyond just the movies, as Broccoli at least has been involved in decision-making for the games; it recently came to light that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-producer-didnt-want-guns-in-goldeneye-007-wii-remake-bobby-kotick-says/1100-6529397/" data-ref-id="1100-6529397">Broccoli raised a number of concerns about the GoldenEye game for Wii.</a></p><p>In a statement, Amazon said Broccoli and Wilson have created a new joint venture where the James Bond IP rights will live, and they will continue to co-own the James Bond series. However, Amazon MGM Studios will "gain creative control of the James Bond franchise" once it closes the deal. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p><p>"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world," Amazon MGM Studios boss Mike Hopkins said.</p><p><span>IO's new James Bond game tells an origin story for the character, and that's never been done before. When the game was </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-007-game-in-the-works-at-io-interactive/1100-6484609/" data-ref-id="1100-6484609">announced in 2020</a><span>, IO said it was working collaboratively with the James Bond rights-holders on the project, and it subsequently came to light that IO intended for the game to </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">kick off a new trilogy.</a><span> What impact the new leadership at Amazon MGM Studios could have on IO's game is unknown, but GameSpot has contacted the studio in an attempt to get more details. We've also reached out to Amazon MGM Studios.</span></p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Project 007 won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," said Abrak. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slAhuh21ii8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/slAhuh21ii8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A number of companies have made James Bond video games over the years. One of the most memorable and iconic James Bond games was Rare's 1997 GoldenEye 007 for Nintendo 64. Electronic Arts made James Bond games, too, including Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, and Rogue Agent. Activison took over for a period of time, publishing titles like Quantum of Solace and Blood Stone. There hasn't been a new James Bond game for console since 2012's 007 Legends, though Cypher 007 came out for mobile in 2023.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447114-screenshot2025-02-20at9.57.21am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4447114" data-ratio="0.55920484010372" data-width="1157" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447114-screenshot2025-02-20at9.57.21am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4447114"></a><figcaption>Amazon MGM Studios will have creative control of the 007 series.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447114-screenshot2025-02-20at9.57.21am.png"></figure><p>Wilson said he plans to "focus on art and charitable projects," while Broccoli said she will focus on "my other projects."</p><p>Amazon bought MGM in 2002, and since then, it has owned the distibrution rights to the James Bond movies. There hasn't been a new James Bond movie since then, however, with 2021's No Time To Die being the most recent entry in the series.</p><p>Given this big shakeup, no one should expect the next James Bond movie anytime soon. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/amazon-mgm-studios-joint-venture-michael-g-wilson-barbara-broccoli-james-bond-1236295821/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline reported</a> that "no decisions have been made on the future Bond films including who will star, direct or write the next film."</p><p>Amazon MGM Studios taking over full creative control of the series could pave the way for a decision about the franchise's future to be made more easily. With Broccoli and Wilson no longer getting to decide the future of the series, many are wondering (and worrying) how this could all shake out.</p>

<p>Support for the previous version will continue, Rockstar promised, for those players whose hardware does not meet these minimum requirements.</p>
<p>However, players on the previous version of GTA Online will not be able to play in sessions with those in this newer version.

		<p>Funcom has announced that the hotly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> will launch on 20th May 2025 for PC, priced at $49.99, with the console release remaining TBC.</p>
<p>In the meantime, PC gamers can get a slight headstart with the freely available Character Creator and Benchmark Mode to test your hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gl6Wi20fSp0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The character creator and benchmarking tool is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">available now via Steam</a>, with gamers that download and open it up able to receive a free Frameblade knife skin.</p>
<p>The character creator is themed around the Reverend Mother’s test of the Gom Jabbar, letting you fiddle with ever aspect of your appearance, select your home planet, caste and mentor. This can then be imported into the full game at launch.</p>

<p>The benchmark sequence will use a fly-through of a player-built base in the desert, racing through to Harko Village – the Harkonnen player hub – and conclude with an encounter with a huge sandworm that defines this iconic sci-fi world. This should give a decent baseline to determine your PC performance and adjust graphics settings to meet your goals.</p>
<p>With the success of the recent films, Dune video games have been popping up left and right, with Dune: Awakening one of the most exciting and intriguing in development. Coming from Conan Exiles developer Funcom Oslo, this is a big open world survival MMO.</p>
<p>It definitely feels like survival will be quite tricky here, given the setting. Worms are just one unkillable threat to contend with, as sandstorms, the heat and sunlight, and just finding water in this desert all being particular challenges. Of course, you can band together with other players, sharing resources, building bases, going on raids and quests, and deciding which of the factions vying for control over the planet you wish to align with.</p>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation support is being integrated into Indiana Jones and the Great Circle with a new game update. As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, players can take advantage of the new transformer-based DLSS AI model, which improves image quality compared to the previous CNN-based model. Users with the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards can also enable Multi Frame Generation, reaching much higher frame rates on their configurations. And even GeForce RTX 40 GPU owners can take advantage of the updated Frame Generation model, which delivers higher frame rates and consumes less video RAM.</p>
<p>Moreover, MachineGames improved the game's visuals by adding fully ray traced shadows to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If you own an RTX GPU and use ray tracing, the update also adds DLSS Ray Reconstruction, which replaces multiple denoisers with NVIDIA's unified AI model, improving surface detail, drawing more precise shadows are more precise, enhancing lighting and delivering more accurate reflections. Lastly, the game also includes native DLAA support for those with spare headroom (GeForce RTX 5090 owners, in all likelihood). However, it seems like the new RTX Hair feature didn't make it into this update as previously planned.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle™ | DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation &amp; Ray Reconstruction" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/laTPVKs0nqA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation will also be available tomorrow in Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, the campaign mode of the shooter game developed by Team Jade. According to NVIDIA, a GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card can get up to 265.9 average frame rate per second in the game with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode (CNN model). For more about Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, check out Kai's hands-on preview of this mode.</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in an earlier article today, DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation will also be available starting tomorrow in NetEase's Marvel Rivals with the new patch.</p>
<p>Today is also the launch day for Don't Nod's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-records-bloom-rage-part-1-and-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 1</a>, which supports DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation and the DLAA, and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-did-sega-already-drop-the-gaiden-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, which features the same NVIDIA technologies.&nbsp;Lastly, Wemade's Unreal Engine 5 powered MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-to-support-dlss-3-ray-tracing-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legend of Ymir</a>, inspired by Norse mythology, is also live today in South Korea with DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation support.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also released a new Game Ready driver (version 572.47) today to&nbsp;<span>accompany the official launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/colorful-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-battle-nx-16-gb-gpu-review-enthusiast-performance-at-749/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/615263/xbox-game-pass-microsoft-cloud-gaming-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hello, and welcome to a special episode of <em>Decoder</em>! This is David Pierce, editor-at-large at <em>The Verge</em>. Nilay is off this week for a much-deserved break from what I can only describe as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/612069/fcc-brendan-carr-elon-musk-donald-trump-first-amendment-free-speech-censorship">pretty bleak</a> news cycle. So I’m filling in for him, and the <em>Decoder</em> team thought this would be a good opportunity to switch gears a little bit from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24348851/donald-trump-presidency-tech-science-news">political apocalypse beat</a> and talk about something completely different. </p><p>So today we’re diving into the video game industry and discussing a particular set of thorny problems facing Microsoft and its Xbox division. Microsoft is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and for nearly half of that history, Xbox has been a central pillar of the company’s consumer hardware and software businesses. The first Xbox launched in 2001, and it has sat alongside Sony’s PlayStation and Nintendo as the Big Three of console gaming for the last quarter century. </p><p>But things in Xbox land have not been that great lately. In fact, Xbox has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242790/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-turmoil-notepad">struggling for quite some time now</a>. And a lot of the issues it’s facing can be traced back to core problems at the heart of software distribution: as video games get more expensive to make, and the demands for their scope, size, and quality become greater, how do you produce certifiable hits that get people to buy your hardware? How do you finance those hits, and when they launch, how do you get them into the hands of more consumers — consumers who may not want to buy an Xbox anymore and balk at the idea of shelling out $70 for a new game?</p><p>Nintendo and Sony seem to have this pretty much figured out, and both companies have been reaping the benefits of dominating the console-gaming market, albeit in different ways, since at least 2017. That’s when the first Switch launched and when it became clear Sony’s PS4 had cemented the PlayStation as the clear winner of the 2010s. But 2017 is also when Microsoft launched Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service designed to be a bit like Netflix for gaming. </p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer developed a master plan to shift the Xbox business model. After the better part of 20 years having proprietary hardware at the center of its strategy, Microsoft pivoted. The idea was it would lean on its expertise in cloud computing and its considerable war chest of software profits from Windows to try something new. It would mix subscription gaming, cloud streaming, and a willingness to put its software on competing platforms to try and break free from a losing race against its rivals. </p><div><p>Listen to <em>Decoder</em>, a show hosted by <em>The Verge</em>’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-decoder/id1011668648?i=1000496212371&amp;itsct=podcast_box&amp;itscg=30200&amp;ls=1&amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;ct=verge091322">here</a>!</p></div><p>Eight years later, and well… it hasn’t quite worked out like we might have thought. Xbox is still in a distant third place in the console race, with some estimates putting Xbox hardware sales at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">less than half the number of PS5’s Sony has sold</a>. That’s despite some record-breaking game studio acquisitions that have cost Microsoft almost $100 billion dollars. </p><p>Meanwhile, Nintendo is off in a league of its own. It has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">sold more than 150 million Switch units</a> since that console launched, and the eventual Switch 2, coming later this year, is also expected to be a smash hit.</p><p>So, sure, GamePass is reasonably successful for what it is — but it definitely hasn’t changed the world like Netflix did to Hollywood. People are still mostly buying new games, sometimes even still on a disc from Best Buy or Walmart. Streaming a game to your phone or TV over the cloud remains pretty niche. </p><p>So, what exactly happened here? Why did Microsoft’s master plan not pan out? And can it still succeed if the right combination of factors comes together over the next several years? To break all this down, I invited Ash Parrish, <em>The Verge</em>’s video game reporter, on the show to talk all about the struggles of Xbox and Game Pass, as well as where she sees the future of the game industry headed next. </p><p>If you’d like to learn more about the topics we discussed in this episode, check out the links below:</p><div><ul><li><span>Xbox continues its push beyond consoles with new ad campaign | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Why the video game industry is such a mess | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>The next Xbox is going to be very different | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>2025 looks like a great year for Xbox | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351055/xbox-game-pass-releases-2025-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft prepares to take Xbox everywhere | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft and Google are fighting over the future of Xbox | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313976/microsoft-google-xbox-app-android-future-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft was the No.1 games publisher in the world last December | <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-was-the-no-1-games-publisher-in-the-world-last-month/"><em>VGC</em></a></span></li><li><span>Xbox games in Game Pass ‘can lose 80% of premium sales’ | <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-games-in-game-pass-can-reportedly-lose-80-of-premium-sales/"><em>VGC</em></a></span></li><li><span>Phil Spencer: No ‘red lines’ over Xbox games coming to Switch, PlayStation | <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft’s Xbox turmoil isn’t slowing down | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242790/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-turmoil-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft says Game Pass is profitable as subscription growth slows | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23425029/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-profitable-revenues"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li></ul></div><div><div><h2>Decoder with Nilay Patel</h2><p>A podcast from <em>The Verge</em> about big ideas and other problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://pod.link/decoder"><span>SUBSCRIBE NOW!</span></a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developer Funcom announced that its upcoming multiplayer survival game <em>Dune: Awakening</em> will be launching on Steam on May 20th. But there are a pair of apps launching today that will help tide you over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112467/dune-awakening-survival-game-preview-xbox-ps5-pc">until you can drink the blood of your enemies</a>.</p><p>First up is the character creator, which appears to take the form of <a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Gom_Jabbar">the infamous Gom Jabbar test</a>. According to the developer, you’ll not only be able to set how your character looks but also choose “your home planet, caste, and mentor, be it Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, or Trooper,” which, in turn, will impact the abilities you have to start the game. Your choices can then carry over when the full game launches.</p><p>Also available today is a benchmark mode, which lets players test their systems to see if they can handle the game. Funcom says that players will be “treated to some epic scenes from the game, including soaring with an ornithopter and a dramatic encounter with a colossal sandworm.” Both the benchmark tool and the character creator are available <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1172710%2FDune_Awakening%2F" rel="sponsored">via Steam</a> for free.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/616019/scuf-valor-pro-hands-on-impressions-wired-xbox-controller<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Scuf just announced its latest pro-style controller for Xbox and PC, the first to come close to the $100 price point. The $99.99 Scuf Valor Pro — <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D1025X1701640%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fscufgaming.com%252Fxbox%252Fscuf-valor-pro-steel-gray" rel="sponsored">available for purchase starting today</a> in 15 different styles — isn’t exactly a budget controller in its own right, but context matters.</p><p>I’ve tested the delightfully translucent version of the controller for nearly two weeks now to see where exactly it fits among Scuf’s current Xbox lineup, consisting of the $169.99 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instinct-Custom-Wireless-Performance-Controller-Mobile/dp/B06VTRJGCP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Instinct</a> and the $219.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627413/scuf-instinct-pro-microsoft-xbox-controller-wireless-series-x-s-one-pc-features-price">Instinct Pro</a> (our previous pick for the best pro-style Xbox controller), both wireless. The wired-only and Valor Pro somehow sits in the middle. </p><p>It has the Instinct’s smooth thumb sticks with replaceable tops, now with Hall effect magnetism to reduce the chance of developing stick drift. It also borrows the flagship Instinct’s four programmable rear buttons, its dedicated switch for swapping between its three mapping profiles, and the interchangeable faceplates. </p><p>At the same time, you get the Instinct Pro’s rubberized rear grips (adding comfort while retaining that premium feel) and trigger stops. And yet, neither has the Valor Pro’s dedicated dials to adjust game volume and chat mix, nor the dedicated mute buttons embedded beneath both.</p><p>As a long-time Xbox gamer, I felt at home using the Valor Pro, which still largely takes after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210403/microsoft-xbox-controller-translucent-blue-model">the official Xbox Wireless Controller’s</a> ergonomic design. Scuf’s refinements to that winning formula seem minimal, but can make a meaningful difference. For example, the bumpers are a bit wider and a few millimeters longer than you’ll find on most controllers, draping further down each side. This makes it easier to shift my finger from the trigger to the bumper. </p><p>I don’t even have to remove my fingers from the triggers to press the bumpers. The design allows me to use the sides of my index fingers to actuate them with a light press. That meant I could lob grenades in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> while staying at the ready for a gunfight or jump out of fights as Doctor Strange in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> without lowering my shield. The travel and feel are consistent across the entire surface, so it doesn’t feel stabby or straining. </p><p>I immediately noticed the redesigned rear paddles, which felt off to me on the Instinct Pro. They’re in roughly the same position as the Instinct’s, designed for all four buttons to be comfortably reachable where your middle and ring fingers drape when gripping the controller.</p><p>But the two inside buttons have a bit more topside surface and use a downward vertical force for actuation instead of the horizontal motion required on the Instinct Pro. They’re easier to press while maintaining control over the bigger side paddles. They also don’t require as much force as they did on the Instinct Pro, but the give isn’t so light that misfires become problematic (and you can disable them entirely, if so).</p><div id=":R5irarr6:"><div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div></div></div><p>As much as I’ve tried, I’m simply not a back-button gamer. My proportionally stubby fingers combined with cast iron skillets I call palms make it difficult for me to use them effectively in most games. The Scuf Valor Pro is the first controller with four rear buttons that feel natural and don’t make me feel cramped.</p><p>PC gamers will soon get support for a 1KHz polling rate in a post-launch update. That update wasn’t available as of writing, but I’d wager you’d find the intended reduced input lag imperceptible if you aren’t the type to qualify for tournaments. I sure couldn’t tell the difference on other controllers I’ve tested with the feature.</p><p>Should you buy a Valor Pro? That depends. Although you can swap thumbstick sizes and remove two of the rear paddles, it’s not quite as customizable as something like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Xbox Elite Series 2</a>, but also not nearly as expensive. There are also considerably cheaper wired options with comparable features I’ve tested recently like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-FUSION-Controller-gamepad-Windows-Console/dp/B0D8T82K5C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$69.99 PowerA Fusion Pro 4</a>, which offers four rear buttons, Hall effect sticks with adjustable height, <em>and</em> Hall effect triggers with three stop levels. </p><p>Most don’t remain as faithful to the patented Xbox shape, however, and that might be a deciding factor. Perhaps after an eventual sale, the Valor Pro can be a great first stop for someone new to Scuf, so long as you don’t mind playing with a cable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But sometimes it’s not enough. Say, for example, you finish a season early. What then? Well, you could roll a new character and grind to max level a second time…or you could swap games for a bit while you wait for the next <em>Diablo 4 </em>season start date. That’s likely some time in April, so what to do with the next month? Here are a bunch of other ARPGs to enjoy. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b347666fb82b7a736efe660d1498214e" data-recommend-id="image://b347666fb82b7a736efe660d1498214e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sparkly blue lightning is used to kill a baddie on some brown steps." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sparkly blue lightning is used to kill a baddie on some brown steps." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b347666fb82b7a736efe660d1498214e" data-recommend-id="image://b347666fb82b7a736efe660d1498214e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sparkly blue lightning is used to kill a baddie on some brown steps." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> How can we talk about <em>Diablo IV</em> without mentioning the reigning free-to-play ARPG champ that launched into Steam Early Access at the end of 2024? <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is a monolith in the genre, with the most impressive, yet daunting, passive skill tree in history, a genuinely massive build variety, multiple end-game modes, and a challenging story mode that borrows from the ever-growing Soulslike genre. You can easily spend 100 hours per character, and there are six of them already in Early Access.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5e4fd0db91ed5e31e0aff4823e029d6c" data-recommend-id="image://5e4fd0db91ed5e31e0aff4823e029d6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player fighting satyrs on a bridge in Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player fighting satyrs on a bridge in Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Iron Lore Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e4fd0db91ed5e31e0aff4823e029d6c" data-recommend-id="image://5e4fd0db91ed5e31e0aff4823e029d6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player fighting satyrs on a bridge in Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s nothing wrong with nostalgia. Do you remember your very first ARPG? For many, it was the original <em>Diablo </em>or one of the numerous <em>Forgotten Realms</em> titles on consoles. But how about <em>Titan Quest</em>? The Greek mythology inspired hack-and-slash holds up well today, especially considering it still receives occasional expansions and updates through its Anniversary Edition. Plus, <em>Titan Quest 2</em> is on the horizon, so delving into a battle against the Greek gods never felt more pertinent.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="42fd7e48426196da90f6c40be2890c76" data-recommend-id="image://42fd7e48426196da90f6c40be2890c76" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Purple magical mayhem surrounding a red portal gate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Purple magical mayhem surrounding a red portal gate." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wolcen Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42fd7e48426196da90f6c40be2890c76" data-recommend-id="image://42fd7e48426196da90f6c40be2890c76" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Purple magical mayhem surrounding a red portal gate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Yes, even so long after its release, <em>Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem</em> retains its ‘Mixed’ rating on Steam due to poor design choices, bugs, and lackluster end-game content. That said, this is easily one of the most gorgeous ARPGs in the genre, thanks to the power of CryEngine 3, which also powers <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> and <em>Crysis 3</em>.

It’s a spiritual successor to the countless hack-and-slash titles many of us grew up playing, like <em>Diablo 2</em>, and it’s a favorite for a reason. The game offers hundreds of items and affixes, crafting, base-building, quests with choices and consequences, and build diversity that allows you to tailor the game to your liking by combining multiple classes into an amalgamation of power and prospect!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d9312eab48b8201c098a91ae919285a6" data-recommend-id="image://d9312eab48b8201c098a91ae919285a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colorful spells being cast in a Torchlight 2 battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colorful spells being cast in a Torchlight 2 battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Runic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d9312eab48b8201c098a91ae919285a6" data-recommend-id="image://d9312eab48b8201c098a91ae919285a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colorful spells being cast in a Torchlight 2 battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Seriously? It’s <em>Torchlight 2</em>! The colorful aesthetic may throw some players for a loop, as its cartoonish appearance belies a serious game created by some of the genre’s grandfathers. The gameplay loop in this exceptional ARPG holds up so well, many years after its release. To many long-time fans, it’s the last in the series. They don’t consider any of the new releases canon. With unique pets, straightforward builds, enthralling loot, and a handful of side activities (like fishing) which can transform and evolve your pet, there’s much to see and do in this old-school hack-and-slash. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="309f99f31729013113b2bd6e2ba233f6" data-recommend-id="image://309f99f31729013113b2bd6e2ba233f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A plague space marine in Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plague space marine in Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NeocoreGames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="309f99f31729013113b2bd6e2ba233f6" data-recommend-id="image://309f99f31729013113b2bd6e2ba233f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A plague space marine in Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> Why did developers take so long to smush together the hack-and-slash genre within the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> universe?

<p>According to a new job listing, Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel will feature “the most realistic and reactive crowd system in any game to date.”</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-most-realistic-and-reactive-crowd-system-job" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, the new information was revealed through Pawel Sasko’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1892298966961725540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, which talks about seven job openings for the “next Cyberpunk.” If you dig a little deeper into the daily responsibilities of Lead Encounter Designer, the listing implies that CD Project Red is working on creating the most advanced crowd system to date for the next Cyberpunk, with a focus on the realism and reactiveness of the NPCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The community has started sharing their views on this upcoming crowd system for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1itiifo/cyberpunk_sequel_has_new_opening_for_lead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cyberpunkgame</a> subreddit. The players are discussing whether the developers should work on an entirely new city or improve and evolve the existing Night City to flesh it out even more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many have compared the crowd system for games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V with the original Cyberpunk 2077. Some also wonder whether the next Cyberpunk’s crowd system will be able to beat what Rockstar cooks up with GTA 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the details about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel are currently unknown. All we know is that it is internally referred to as Project Orion. The developers have also stated that Cyberpunk’s plot is a “uniquely American story” with “punk energy”, and thanks to the Boston studio, the sequel <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-sequel-more-american/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feel&nbsp;more American</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2077 was th<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-becomes-first-game-to-support-dlss-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e first game to support DLSS 4</a>.

When I first heard about the game, I was absolutely thrilled, and now that it has become a reality, I couldn’t be happier. I was especially surprised to learn that the game is being developed in the Netherlands! It felt amazing to say ‘Tenkamuteki no Daishōri!!’ (‘Unrivaled, ultimate victory!!’) again. I love Yattarou so much!”</p><p><strong>What was it like reuniting with the original cast? And what are your thoughts on Seiichiro Yamashita joining as the new voice of Sukashii?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamaguchi:</strong> “Hearing Kon-chan (Ko’on-no-Kami) and Gen-chan (Gennarisai) banter, Kenyū-san’s witty narration, and the Nyankī squad’s signature introductions—it was like stepping back into the recording studio from all those years ago. I was also blown away by how faithfully the trailer recreated the original animation style. The love and dedication from the Dutch development team truly shine through. And of course, a big thank you to Seiichiro Yamashita for bringing Sukashii to life!”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as <em>Samurai Pizza Cats</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamaguchi:</strong> “Congratulations on 35 years of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>!

And what are your thoughts on Seiichirō Yamashita joining as the new voice of Sukashii?</strong></p><p><strong>Orikasa:</strong> “Even after 35 years, this series remains as vibrant as ever in my heart. The moment I stepped into the studio with Kappei-san and the rest of the team, Pururun’s lines just came naturally. Seiichirō Yamashita did a fantastic job as Sukashii—he really captured the character’s essence.”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as Samurai Pizza Cats?</strong></p><p><strong>Orikasa:</strong> “Even our post-recording gatherings (laughs) were a blast!

What was your experience recording for the trailer?</strong></p><p><strong>Seiichiro Yamashita:</strong> “To be honest, I wasn’t familiar with Kyatto Ninden Teyandee before this project. It’s incredible to be involved with a series that predates my birth. The recording session was truly special—I had the privilege of performing alongside legends like Kappei Yamaguchi, watching them work up close in such a dynamic setting.”</p><p><strong>How did you feel about taking over the role of Sukashii from your senior colleague Jurota Kosugi?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamashita:</strong> “Even now, I feel like it’s too great an honor to say I’ve ‘inherited’ the role. This is my first time stepping into a character previously portrayed by another actor, and I was deeply conscious of preserving the image of Sukashii that fans hold dear. The encouragement from the production team was invaluable, and this has been a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me.”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as <em>Samurai Pizza Cats</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamashita:</strong> “Stories have a way of leaving lasting impressions on people, and the love for <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em> has endured over decades.

<section><p>Comfort, function, and convenience come together to produce a phenomenal option for Xbox and PC players if you don't mind the wire</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In order to be successful, a controller needs three things: comfort, function, and convenience. There's a reason why the Duke--the notoriously large controller that accompanied the original Xbox in 2001--was eventually replaced with a smaller design, durable as it was. The Duke was heavy and huge, with buttons spread out a little too far across the interface.</p><p dir="ltr">Scuf's newest controller, the Valor Pro Wired Controller for Xbox and PC, nails all three of these elements. Its light weight and smooth front faceplate makes it easy to carry and hold without irritation. The design of the bumpers and triggers on the top of the controller make it very simple to alternate between, while the four rear paddles offer extra control in tight situations. A few other additional features--like built-in audio controls--add additional convenience. It's not reinventing the wheel, but the Valor Pro is a great choice for Xbox and PC players alike, provided you can live with a wire attached to whatever you're playing on.</p><p dir="ltr">Right out of the box, the Valor Pro felt great in my hands, which are larger than most. The placement of the buttons and sticks seem to slot right into the positions my hands want them to be. It's surprisingly light in the hands too, to the point where it feels like a toy rather than a pro controller. That's not to say it feels cheap, though, as the sticks, buttons, and d-pad feel strong to the touch. The smooth faceplate creates a tight grip, and the nonslip grips work as advertised, no matter how sweaty the palms get--and I, a person with pretty sweaty hands, would know.</p><p dir="ltr">The sticks on the Valor Pro are especially comfortable thanks to a ridged fabric-like border on the outside rim. There's no hard edge to irritate the thumb; instead, that fabric serves as a nice cushion when I'm blasting people in Fortnite or Call of Duty. The sticks should last a while too, as the Valor Pro contains Hall Effect anti-drift measures to keep them precise longer. There was no drift to speak of during this review--which, if there were, would be a huge issue for a brand-new controller--and hopefully it'll stay that way for a while. Meanwhile, the d-pad's contoured shape fits the thumb nicely, and where other controller d-pads sometimes feel flimsy, this one has some weight to it with every touch.</p><p dir="ltr">The four back paddles on the controller are the most impressive thing on it, as each one avoids a common pitfall I've experienced with back buttons for some time: They resist accidental button presses. I've routinely pressed a button on the back of a controller at inopportune times, usually in quiet moments where stealth is key, and it immediately turns my strategy into mush. These paddles feel more like front face buttons than any I've used before, and that feeling has resulted in zero accidental activations during this review period.</p><p dir="ltr">The Valor Pro also offers controller profiles, where you can alternate between three different button designations for the back buttons. One is specific for shooters, and puts the change-weapon and reload buttons in the back; another is for sports games and assigns the A and B buttons back there, which helps with, for example, easy shooting and passing in NBA 2K. The third profile is for racing games, turning each back button into a different direction, and while I wasn't quite as enamored with that profile, the experience wasn't so bad that it killed the convenience of the other two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446762"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If none of those profiles fit for you, the Valor Pro’s custom remapping feature lets you set each profile to the buttons you use the most in the games you play the most. Remapping is simple; each profile is set to a different color, and if you hold in the profile button on the back until the colored LED blinks, you can then assign paddles to buttons however you like. Controller customization is increasingly becoming the standard, and the Valor Pro's version gets the job done.</p><p dir="ltr">If you plug a headset into your Valor Pro, you’ll have extra control over the audio thanks to the controller’s built-in volume knobs. The left knob on the bottom of the controller handles in-game audio, while the knob to its right focuses on chat volume, and both can be pressed down to mute the corresponding audio. Having these controls onboard the controller is super convenient, not to mention the knobs are, like the rest of the buttons on the Valor Pro, placed in a comfortable spot for your fingers to reach.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite its execution, the Valor Pro doesn't provide much in the way of <em>new</em> features. At $99, it sits in the "budget pro" controller tier with options like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-xbox-pc-controller-review/1100-6526158/">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition</a> and Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot--or, at about two-thirds the price, the 8BitDo Ultimate. Those offer similar features to what the Valor Pro is doing here. Still, Scuf has done a great job designing this controller to feel like the top of the line rather than the less expensive option.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also the matter of that pesky wire. Wired controllers are fine if your gaming setup allows for it, but wireless controllers are also popular for a reason--and something like the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra, Razer Wolverine V3 Pro or Xbox Elite 2 offers those options on a wireless controller for a similar price. It's true that latency is reduced with a wired controller, and Scuf's focus on precision calls for a low-latency solution, which something like a wire provides.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, people with close-quarters gaming setups won't be worried about this, but if your Xbox is across the room from your couch, the Valor Pro being shackled to the system likely won't work for you--even with the 10-foot USB-C cord included with the controller; a wireless controller works better than a potential tripping hazard.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, I am very pleased with the Scuf Valor Pro. It's one of the most comfortable controllers I've ever used, with buttons placed so naturally that it's as if the controller was made for my hands specifically. The back paddles are fully customizable and resistant to frantic accidental pushes, the smooth grip keeps the controller in my hand no matter how wild a gameplay session gets, and the built-in audio controls give me easy access to both game sound and chat audio. A wireless version would have been great, but even with the wire, the Scuf Valor Pro is a fantastic option for your next Xbox or PC controller.</p><p dir="ltr">The Scuf Valor Pro Wired Controller is available now for $99 at select retailers and at scufgaming.com.</p>
