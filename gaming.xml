<p>PlayStation Network being down is a catastrophic issue for the company and players. Millions of users (myself included) are subscribed to PSN and use PlayStation services regularly. But PSN is down, so let’s look into why this and how long the outage is expected to last.</p>



<p>I still fondly remember the great PlayStation Network outage of 2011. From April 20 to May 14, the community could not use PSN services. This meant no online play, messaging friends, or buying games using the PlayStation Store. It was an awful time, and I wanted to play Call of Duty and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield</a> with my friends.</p>



<p>Déjà vu has struck again in 2025. On February 8, PSN suddenly went down without notice, and it’s been off ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-playstation-network-down-right-now">Why is PlayStation Network Down Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not again. Credit to PlayStation</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The only thing any of us have been told so far is Sony is “currently experiencing issues” with its PlayStation Network service.</strong></p>



<p>A closer look at the PSN server status tells us “Some services are experiencing issues,” and this applies to all PSN media: Account Management, Gaming and Social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Social, and PlayStation Direct.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask PlayStation X page</a> posted a single message <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888041723831484682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saying</a> “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN</strong>,” on February 8, and has neglected to comment since. PlayStation further cemented this mystery by having its main X page repost the Ask PlayStation message to its 42 million followers on the platform—but provide no statement itself.</p>



<p>Sony nor PlayStation have commented on the issue. Like PSN right now, we are all in the dark, and the community is understandably getting frustrated at the lack of updates. </p>



<p>With the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-play-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 getting a free weekend</a> and Double XP to boot, many gamers were probably looking forward to kicking back over the weekend and enjoying some gaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-psn-coming-back-online">When is PSN Coming Back Online?</h2>



<p><strong>We still don’t know when PSN is coming back online, and there are zero updates or hints as to when.</strong></p>



<p>I wish I could give you more information, and we are doing our best to get the latest on the outage. Keep checking back as we intend to inform you as soon as we can. Furthermore, we have a separate page letting you know the latest on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Network being down</a>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for updates as we hope and pray PSN comes back online sooner rather than later.</p>

		<p>PlayStation Network is suffering a major outage, affecting the full gamut of online services that it provides.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update 12PM 08/02</strong> – PSN has now been offline for at least 12 hours. Not exactly breaking news, but noteworthy.</em></p>


<p>it seems that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psn">PSN</a> dropped offline just before midnight in the UK, with <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/">DownDetector noting a huge spike</a> of reported issues. That naturally tailed off as people went to bed, but our own PlayStations are reporting that PSN is offline as of 9:30AM GMT.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Network status page is red across the board including account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Store, and even PlayStation Direct.</p>


<p>I think the “some services” is understating things a little, Sony…</p>
<p>So, if you were hoping to get some online gaming in this Saturday morning, you might need to turn on a PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch or change plans to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XDFKfdi84Co">watch the 24/7 Tom &amp; Jerry anniversary stream instead</a>. I suppose you could always play something single-player instead.</p>
<p>We’ll try to keep an eye on things and update this page when PSN comes back.</p>

			<p>Former Insomniac Games founder and CEO Ted Price revealed that the studio had pitched Resistance 4, but Sony refused. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWKbHKCUkpw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, when asked about something the studio had come up with without getting it greenlit, Price picked this game:</p>
<p><em>Resistance 4. We did pitch that one, and it was a wonderful concept. It's just that, in terms of timing and market opportunity, it didn't work out, but it was the result of a lot of Insomniac team members being passionate about extending the story further. I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are. We spent a lot of time working on the backstory and kind of brainstorming on where we could take this in the future, and personally, I love this franchise.</em></p>
<p><em> I was fortunate enough to be Creative Director of the first few Resistance games and I will remember many, many moments, good and bad. When it comes to development, it taught us all a lot about how we could elevate ourselves under some pretty heavy and some pretty difficult situations. Fortunately, we love the fan response and we know that fans ask pretty regularly if we're going to do another Resistance. There's no answer to that, but I will say we pitched Resistance 4 and it was cool.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>When asked whether he thought Resistance 4 could still happen at some point in the future, Price replied:</p>
<p><em>Honestly, I hope so. I would love to see this story taken further, it's near and dear to my heart. There are so many cool things about it. [...] Resistance 3 was intended to end that chapter of the franchise with the way that we ended with Capelli and closed a lot of loops on various smaller story items. We wanted to do that so we would have more options in the future, whether we were to go ahead with more Resistance games or take another turn. When you work on a franchise for a long time, it's nice to have a chance to move on to something else. At the same time, it's also nice to be able to come back to it. Fortunately, because we're part of Sony and Sony owns the intellectual property of Resistance, we will always have that opportunity to revisit Resistance. If it works out again, as a fan, I'm going to be pretty excited.</em></p>
<p>Technically, the most recent franchise installment is the spin-off Resistance: Burning Skies, developed by Nihilistic Software and released in 2012 for the PlayStation Vita.</p>
<p>As for the likelihood of a new game by Insomniac, Sony appears committed to the partnership with Marvel. At the same time, the enormous licensing costs (following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac Games leak</a>, it was reported that Sony may have paid Disney around $109 million for the Spider-Man IP) may eventually lead Sony back to its own franchises, which might re-open the door for a new entry in the first-person shooter franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shotzzy-haunted-interview-london-cod-league/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Shotzzy is one of the most decorated esports players in the business. He’s one of just two competitors to secure a world title in <strong>two </strong>games, and he’s a multi-time champion and MVP. In the Call of Duty League, he’s known as one of the most consistently entertaining and capable players, taking up a key spot on OpTic Texas.</p>



<p>But he’s still not over the interview he gave in London in 2020. During the Madrid Major between January and February 2025, I sat down with Shotzzy and Huke behind the scenes, asking them where they’d like to go next in Europe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-redemption-story">Redemption Story</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas fell hard in the Madrid Major, being knocked out of the elimination bracket by a dominant Carolina Royal Ravens side. For a while, OpTic Texas was the favourite to win, coming into the season hot off a win at COD Champs 2024. The team put up a solid fight, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the competition.</p>



<p>Most recently, OpTic Texas was in the news because Pred, who went on a hiatus from the squad in December 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pred-optic-texas-call-of-duty-league-retur/">rejoined the team</a>, knocking Huke out of his temporary spot on the roster.</p>



<p>In 2020, Shotzzy journeyed to London with Dallas Empire, the team with which he’d win the Call of Duty League Championship later that year. He gave an iconic interview, but it seemed that the bright lights of the big stage put the young superstar on edge, and this was the result:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MOST AWKWARD ESPORTS INTERVIEW EVER!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZ6fz8StG8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Shotzzy</a> in Madrid, I learned that the interview had never left his mind. When I asked if he and Huke would consider going to London for another Call of Duty tournament, Shotzzy said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d say London, yeah. I need to do — I had a really bad interview back then, in London. I’ve got to get my get back on that interview.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since that interview, Shotzzy has gone on to win two world championships in the Call of Duty space and is one of the most entertaining and charismatic players on the mic, so it’s safe to say that if he goes back to London, he’ll be able to ‘get his get back’.</p>

<p>The Six Invitational 2025 is unravelling in Boston, and the group stage has already provided stacks of entertainment. Most recently, I covered comments made by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/m80-gunnar-team-liquid-six-invitational/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M80’s Gunnar</a> following a win over Team Liquid. Thanks to the work of M80, Team Liquid sits in the bottom of the bracket going forward.</p>



<p>The full bracket is now locked in and we have our first matches confirmed for the Six Invitational 2025 playoffs. There are some gems hidden within the fixtures, including a clash between M80 and DarkZero and a face-off between FaZe Clan and SSG that’ll see one team move on to face G2 Esports, the tournament favourite.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-six-invitational-playoffs-are-finally-here">Six Invitational Playoffs Are Finally Here</h2>



<p>G2 Esports has stormed to the top of the standings ahead of the Six Invitational 2025, securing the top seed and earning a bye. The team performed masterfully in the group stage, refusing to drop a map and effortlessly walking all over M80, Liquid, JOEL, and Unwanted.</p>



<p>Alongside Team BDS, Virtus, and FURIA, G2 earned that all-important bye to automatically move one step further in the bracket at the Six Invitational.</p>



<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Team Falcons, Liquid, Oxygen, and CAG have all found themselves in a critical spot in the elimination bracket.</p>



<p>Here are the opening matches for the Six Invitational 2025 playoffs bracket:</p>



<ul>
<li>w7m Esports vs. Unwanted</li>



<li>FaZe Clan vs. Spacestation</li>



<li>Razah vs. Shopify Rebellion</li>



<li>M80 vs. DarkZero</li>
</ul>



<p>From the group stage, JOEL, Team Secret, PSG, and SCARZ were all sent home without making it out of their respective groups. It’s unfortunate, but both SCARZ and JOEL failed to win a single map in the tournament – but they don’t go home empty-handed. Even the bottom-placing teams win $35,000 apiece.</p>



<p>The grand final of the Six Invitational 2025 will take place in Boston on February 16, and it’ll feature an intense best-of-five series. The winning team will secure $1 million, which is one of the biggest single prizes in esports. For the second-place team, there’s still a handsome prize worth $450,000 waiting for them.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-playstation-network-down-%E2%80%93-how-to-check-psn-server-status.1103886/</guid>

<p>The PlayStation Network is the critical backbone of Sony’s entertainment infrastructure, supporting tens of millions of gamers worldwide. Today, our digital, ever-connected world depends on these services staying online – and if they go down, players everywhere will panic. In this guide, I’ll teach you how to check the PSN server status in a couple of seconds.</p>



<p>If you’re sitting there enjoying a game and suddenly discover you’ve been thrown offline, your first question will be: ‘Is PlayStation Network down?’ That’s just common sense – but it might not be immediately obvious how to check service status of PSN.</p>



<p>Read on to learn what you need to do if PlayStation Network is down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-check-if-playstation-is-offline">Check if PlayStation is Offline</h2>



<p>The easiest way to know if the PlayStation Network is down is to check the central <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN service status page</a>. This is the most common way gamers will check if the PlayStation Network is offline or experiencing any issues.</p>



<p>On the network service status page, you’ll see a breakdown between various services, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Account management</li>



<li>Gaming and social</li>



<li>PlayStation Video</li>



<li>PlayStation Store</li>



<li>PlayStation Direct</li>
</ul>



<p>It might be that one area of the PlayStation Network is down while the rest is online as normal, so make sure the PSN server status page is your first port of call in a suspect outage.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-to-check-if-psn-is-down-on-twitter">How to Check if PSN is Down on Twitter</h2>



<p>If you want to use Twitter (X) to determine if the PlayStation Network is offline, you’re best off following the <a href="https://x.com/askplaystation?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘Ask PlayStation’ profile</a>. This page is managed directly by Sony PlayStation, but admittedly, it’s not the swiftest solution to get updates on PSN server status issues.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Otherwise, you can conduct general searches across social media to see if any gamers are experiencing PlayStation Network outages, or you can use a service <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/playstation-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">like Down Detector</a> to gauge the situation.</p>



<p>If the PlayStation Network is down worldwide, you’ll soon know about it. With the way modern gaming solutions work, when the PSN goes offline, you won’t be able to access <strong>anything </strong>worthwhile on your PlayStation console. It’s a huge pitfall for today’s ever-connected world, and it’s a crux we have to handle as gamers.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-playstation-network-down">When was PlayStation Network Down?</h2>



<p>On February 8, 2025, the PlayStation Network was plunged into darkness for several hours, with gamers worldwide taking to social media to vent their frustration. One of the kickers of this situation was that almost nothing was addressed by Sony, and just a comment was made on social media – and then nothing more for <strong>hours</strong>.</p>



<p>You can read more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about this PSN outage here</a>.</p>



<p>In October 2024, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-issue-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outage lasting several hours occurred</a>, with players losing access to every area of the PlayStation Network.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A live-action <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> movie is in the works. Hasbro Entertainment has partnered with Legendary Pictures to produce an official feature film of the acclaimed card game. In addition, they will help produce television shows based on the property.</p>

<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Movie Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Hasbro and Legendary will be focusing on producing a live-action <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> film. Given that <em>Magic</em> is Hasbro's $1 billion brand with over thirty years of rich characters, settings, and stories to adapt, there is plenty of source material ripe for adaptation.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-aetherdrift-insect.jpg?itok=82qh4RAN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-aetherdrift-insect.jpg?itok=BGBWz_VE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Once the feature film has led the charge, the two companies will help produce live-action television shows and other content as the universe of the property expands.</p>

<p>Legendary Pictures has a solid track record producing film and television for beloved brands. They're the studio behind the "Monsterverse" which adapted Toho's <em>Godzilla</em> monsters into blockbuster feature films alongside the Apple TV series, <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em>. A second success is producing the two live-action <em>Dune</em> movies and the spin-off show <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> for the Max streaming service.</p>

<p>This approach is similar to another brand that Hasbro tried to expand: <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. After producing the critically well-received but commercially underwhelming <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em>, they had plans for spin-off shows, one of which was being produced by Joe Manganiello.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><br>
&nbsp;Mary Parent, Legendary’s Chairman of Worldwide Production, said, “We pride ourselves on being thoughtful caretakers of singular, beloved IP, and no property better fits that description than Magic: The Gathering. Alongside the fantastic Hasbro team, we look forward to creating a multimedia universe that thrills longstanding fans and creates a broad wave of new ones.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hasbro and Legendary attempting to make a<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> movie may be the next chapter in companies trying to adapt the brand. It is a dense, imaginative world full of interdimensional wizards, evil dragons, demonic crime syndicates, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">high-octane racing competitions</a>. Netflix announced an animated adaptation in 2019, but that project was quietly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">canceled</a>.</p>

We are currently investigating the issue and working to restore service, so please be patient.” It’s an especially unfortunate time for the network to go down with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1887911802853327236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1887911802853327236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last free <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>beta test weekend</a></span> currently underway. </p><p>There’s no information yet on what the cause of the outage is, how many people are affected, or when the service might come back online. While some service disruptions can last for just a few hours, others could go on for much longer, with spotty connection quality even as the network comes back online. The PlayStation status page <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://status.playstation.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently lists</a></span> all online services as being down. </p><p>And so far this certainly seems to be one of the bigger outages PSN has suffered of late. Players started reporting getting disconnected shortly after 6:00 p.m. ET and so far there’s no sign of anyone being able to get back on. The outage also appears to be worldwide, rather than being isolated to certain countries or continents. </p><p>The nightmare scenario for Sony would be a malicious hack or some deeper problem that causes the outage to persist for days or even weeks. That’s been unheard of in the modern era, but that’s what happened back in the infamous 2011 PlayStation Network outage. So far at least, there’s no sign that something on that scale is happening again. Hopefully, the system comes back online shortly. I, for one, was supposed to be spending tonight with my buds in <em>Rocket League</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>LATEST UPDATE 9:00PM ET: </strong>Sony has published on social media that it is “aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN.” They then point people to the official PlayStation Network status page for updates where it says they are “working to resolve the issue as soon as possible.” </p>



<p>As of this update, the service remains offline.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: It’s not just you. The PlayStation Network is down for everyone.</p>



<p>Outages began appearing around 6pm ET, according to multiple reports. A visit to the official PlayStation <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status page shows</a> that all services are down, including the PlayStation Store, gaming,  account management, and more.</p>



<p>As of writing there is no official word from PlayStation regarding the outage. Nor is there any idea as to when service will be restored.</p>



<p>Based on a preliminary check, it appears to be only PlayStation Network suffering issues. Other major online services such as Xbox Live, Nintendo Online, and Steam appear to be working as expected. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to provide updates as they become available.</p>

<p>Earlier today, M80 dominated Team Liquid in the group stage of the Six Invitational 2025 tournament. This super-sized event boasts a $3 million prize pool and is one of the most important tournaments in the annual esports calendar, so it comes as no surprise that emotions can run wild.</p>



<p>Following the 2 – 1 win over Team Liquid, M80’s Shaun ‘Gunnar’ Pottorff blew up behind the scenes, with the moments after the victory just about being captured by M80’s social team. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-doesn-t-matter-what-team-i-m-on">‘It Doesn’t Matter What Team I’m On’</h2>



<p>Gunnar has been around the block against Team Liquid. The comments he made following M80’s win in the group stage of this year’s Six Invitational were backed up by cold, hard numbers. In recent years, Gunnar has taken down Team Liquid while being a part of three separate rosters.</p>



<p>He did it with Soniqs, then against with beastcoast, and now with M80.</p>



<div><article><p><span>After our WIN vs LIQUID 

➞ Take a look INSIDE the ARENA! 🏟 </span></p></article></div>







<p>In 2024, Gunnar and beastcoast stormed to success at the BLAST Manchester Major, securing the organisation’s first major win. That victory included the brutal knocking out of Team Liquid. Beastcoat eliminated the Brazilian squad without dropping a map, before going on to beat Team BDS 3 – 2 in the grand final.</p>



<p>Gunnar had sharp words for Team Liquid following today’s win:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You can’t beat me! You guys just can’t beat me. It doesn’t matter what team I’m on.</p>



<p>That’s three different teams – you can’t beat me.</p>



<p>Three different teams, three different rosters, same f***ing results, bro.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>M80 picked up the former beastcoast roster following the disbanding of the team in the run-up to the Six Invitational 2025. Thus far in the tournament, M80 has performed pretty well, and at the time of writing, the team sat in second place in the group, just a few points behind G2 Esports, the favourite to win the event.</p>



<p>This weekend, the Six Invitational will depart the group stage and enter the playoffs bracket, with the bottom teams in each group being effectively eliminated from the running.</p>

            <p>
It's been over 14 years since developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>' fondly remembered alternate history shooter series drew to a close with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resistance-3">Resistance 3</a>, but it turns out fans might have seen a fourth mainline entry if the studio had got its way. Outgoing Insomniac boss has revealed the studio pitched a "wonderful concept" for Resistance 4 - but Sony ultimately said no.
</p>
<p>
Price - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-studio-boss-ted-price-announces-retirement-from-games-industry">announced his retirement last month</a> after more than 30 years at Insomniac - was speaking to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZWKbHKCUkpw">Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>. When asked if he had a favourite pitch the studio had made over the years - a "one that got away" - Price dropped the Resistance 4 bombshell.
</p>
<p>
"We did pitch that one," he revealed, "and it was a wonderful concept... It was the result of a lot of Insomniac team members being passionate about extending the story further... I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are. We spent a lot of time working on backstory and brainstorming on where we could take this in the future."

<p>
Unfortunately, Sony couldn't be convinced, with Price citing "timing and market opportunity" as the reason the project didn't progress beyond its pitch. Exactly when all this happened is unclear based on Price's comments, but a glance through the archives reveals he told Eurogamer the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniac-not-slated-to-do-resistance-4">studio was "not slated" to do Resistance 4</a> all the way back in 2011. A year later and Price was ready to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniac-confirms-it-wont-make-more-resistance-games">draw a line under the series in considerably more definitive terms</a>, saying, "We won't be making any more Resistances."
</p>
<p>
And while that's proven to be the case so far, Price revealed to Kinda Funny he'd love to see a Resistance revival, calling the series, "Near and dear to my heart."
</p>
<p>
"When you work on a franchise for a long time," he explained, "it's nice to have a chance to move onto something else. And at the same time, it's also nice to be able to come back to it. So fortunately, because [Insomniac is] part of Sony and Sony owns the intellectual property to Resistance, we will always have that opportunity to revisit Resistance."
</p>
<p>
But while fans may be disappointed to hear about the Resistance 4 that almost was, Price remains philosophical. "I do strongly believe there's a reason everything happens," he told Kinda Funny, "and when I look back at the games that we've made - the ones that were received well, the ones that weren't received well, the ones we didn't get to make - all of those have led us to where we are today. Which is an amazing relationship with Marvel and working on games we are truly excited about."

Insomniac's next game is Wolverine, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">teased back in 2021</a> and is still without a release window. "We've announced Wolverine, and we'd love to talk more about Wolverine," the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">studio said earlier this year</a>, "but we have to be like Logan today, and remain very stoic until it's time to pop the claws down the road. As much as we have pent up excitement, we've got to hold on to it. So that's about as much as we could say about our upcoming projects today."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kingdom-come-deliverance-gamergate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whether you consider it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/520012/first-2025-goty-contender-kingdom-come-deliverance-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a GOTY contender</a> or not, we’ve certainly got our first big game of the year in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, an open-world RPG that goes for it despite the inevitable jank that comes with such immense scale. This week, many were surprised to learn that the game’s director, Warhorse Studios founder Daniel Vávra, was a big supporter of the first Gamergate movement. This felt like <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-owes-its-popularity-to-realism-and-conserv-1823420208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common knowledge</a> back when the original <em>Kingdom Come</em> (kingdom) came out, but years later, that crucial context has faded into a footnote. What happened? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We’re joined by special guest Rowan Zeoli of <a href="https://www.rascal.news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rascal</a>, an independent, reader-supported, worker-owned outlet for journalism about tabletop roleplaying games not unlike Aftermath. The site is celebrating one year of life on the increasingly tumultuous planet Earth with <a href="https://www.rascal.news/rascal-celebrates-its-first-birthday-with-a-pledge-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a subscription drive</a>, so we ask Rowan how things are going (pretty well!) and then dig into a harrowingly powerful piece she recently wrote about <a href="https://aftermath.site/fight-for-america-j6-rascal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roleplaying the January 6 insurrection</a> in a Brooklyn warehouse. What can we learn from living out these moments in a controlled, game-like environment? And why don’t wargames recreate modern history more often?</p><p>Then we discuss <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> and its director’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lhcer4oo322q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support of the original Gamergate movement</a>, which everybody seems to have forgotten about. Why, though? And what does it mean for a sequel that&nbsp; seems at least somewhat interested in exploring more diverse stories – despite the objections of an audience that’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-developer-is-fed-up-of-being-dragged-into-the-culture-war-it-seems-like-someone-is-always-trying-to-brand-us-somehow-and-we-are-just-trying-to-make-a-cool-videogame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partially turned on it</a> for that very reason? Finally, at listeners’ request, Nathan gives everyone a special pre-release preview of a passage from <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-stream-big-book-nathan-grayson-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his book</a> (<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder now</a>!), and he’s not nervous about it at all.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can grow this humble website into a vast kingdom that will deliver you from the horrors of the modern internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The new <em>Kingdom Come</em> kind of goes back on that idea of [an almost entirely white cast] and says “Actually we are gonna have characters of other backgrounds and from other places, and we’re going to engage in these ways that – at least based on the reviews I’ve read – sound kind of interesting and nuanced.”</p><p><strong>Rowan: </strong>They turned woke!</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>So it feels like the director of this studio is one thing, and some of the people working for the studio are another thing, and you’ve got people at the studio being like “Man, we <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-developer-is-fed-up-of-being-dragged-into-the-culture-war-it-seems-like-someone-is-always-trying-to-brand-us-somehow-and-we-are-just-trying-to-make-a-cool-videogame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t want anything to do with all this culture war shit</a>. We just want people to like our game and play it on its own terms.” And this is the funniest part: Back in the day, the Gamergater types were like “Yeah, this game is doing whites only! We love that shit!” And now that the series has added other people of different backgrounds into the series, they’ve turned on it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rowan:</strong> The leopards would never eat my face, though!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I know, right? So then you have some of the other developers disavowing the culture war and asking why people are doing this to them. Well, because you’re working with a guy who set a lot of this stuff in motion [and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lhceupzapc2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kept behaving that way</a> in the intervening period]. How can you be surprised?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>It’s been confusing to me. People are writing about it and talking about it in a way that makes me feel a little bit crazy, where I’m like “Doesn’t everybody remember what happened before?” And because I’m broken inside, I want to leave space for the idea that times have changed and maybe the guy has changed. Nathan tells me the guy has not changed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, if you look at his posts, it doesn’t seem like he’s changed substantially.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> But it seems like the game itself [is fine]. I remember that was the controversy with the game the first time, too: There are things in the game that are probably good and interesting. It’s not a wholesale write off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Definitely not. That’s the dilemma that I think a lot of people who are more left-leaning are facing. You have this context around how the game was made and who made it, and then the game itself is not the horrible polemic you’d expect it to be. It’s more nuanced than that. And of course, as with any video game of this scale, it was made by hundreds of people – many of whom probably do not share that director’s opinions. But they also did choose to work at that studio.</p><p><strong>Rowan: </strong>Do you guys have this issue in video games? In tabletop games, there’s a real lack of institutional memory. Like even maybe the people writing about this game just have no idea.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, everybody keeps getting laid off, which certainly doesn’t help.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Times have also changed. When the first <em>Kingdom Come</em> came out [in 2018], a lot of the conversation around games was still happening on websites and blogs and stuff. YouTube was definitely a presence, but it was a little more nascent. Now that dynamic has totally flipped. Now most of the conversation is happening on YouTube and Twitch and Discord, and video game websites are becoming more and more dinosaur-like by the day.</p><p>So I think part of it is probably the age of the audience and the demographics of who was present for that first conversation [about the original <em>Kingdom Come</em>], and the other part is just where it’s all happening – how much more diffuse it is. That means, especially with websites closing down and people getting laid off, that there’s really no institutional memory whatsoever. So even people who’d want to know about this and who’d care about this are not finding out, at least until the very last second.</p><p><strong>Rowan:</strong> I feel like tabletop journalism is about 15 years behind video game journalism, because I’m like “Ah yes, I know exactly what you’re talking about. It’s gonna take us a decade to figure out.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, exactly. And even then, so much of it is cyclical. So many of the conversations happen again and again and again, and nobody fully figures it out.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/trump-tariff-china-ugreen-max5c-noise-canceling-headphones"><h3>These Headphones Were A Great Deal When I Bought Them</h3></a><p>The Ugreen Max5c were an absolute steal when I got them for about $35 dollars, but I have no clue how long that'll be true.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esa-iicon-e3"><h3>Vowels Are Back As ESA Announces New Conference</h3></a><p>The Interactive Innovation Conference will focus on where games connect to other industries</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take-Two stocks have reached an all-time high after reconfirming that GTA 6 will be releasing fall 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1887983768201298182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">videotechuk_</a> on X, after CEO Strauss Zelnick reaffirmed a fall 2025 release date for GTA 6 at their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent earnings call,</a> Take-Two’s stocks started climbing, creating a new record today. Take-Two Interactive Software’s stock opened at $198, reached a high of almost $213, and closed at $208.77.&nbsp;The company’s confidence has reassured investors. </p>



<p>GTA 6 is the most anticipated release in the gaming industry, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many publishers</a> do not want to release their games close to Rockstar’s new instalment. Players were worried, as no news about the game had been revealed since the trailer in December 2023. The community speculated that a delay could be imminent. However, since the game was announced, the developers have stayed strong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-2025-release-promoted-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the 2025 release window</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the CEO of Take-Two recently made a statement, players hope Rockstar will provide more information soon to get them even more excited about Fall 2025. It would be exciting to see some new gameplay and glimpse all the fresh innovations Rockstar may have implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same earnings call, Take-Two’s CEO spoke about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-plans-to-support-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s upcoming console, Switch 2</a>. However, it wasn’t confirmed whether their upcoming games, like Grand Theft Auto 6 and Borderlands 4, will be released on the platform. Also, NBA 2K25’s player spending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-says-nba-2k25-surpassed-player-spending-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“greatly surpassed” expectations</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's the year 2000 all over again, because I've just spent the past week playing <em>The Sims</em>, a game that could have had a resurgent zeitgeist moment if only EA, the infamous game publisher, had put enough effort in.</p>
<p>A few days ago, EA re-released two of its most legendary games: <em>The Sims</em> and <em>The Sims 2</em>. Dubbed the "The Legacy Collection," these could not even be called remasters. EA just put the original games on Steam with some minor patches to make them a little more likely to work on some modern machines.</p>
<p>The emphasis of that sentence should be on the word "some." Forums and Reddit threads were flooded with players saying the game either wouldn't launch at all, crashed shortly after launch, or had debilitating graphical issues. (Patches have been happening, but there's work to be done yet.)</p>
<p>Further, the releases lack basic features that are standard for virtually all Steam releases now, like achievements or Steam Cloud support.</p>
<p>It took me a bit of time to get it working myself, but I got there, and my time with the game has reminded me of two things. First, <em>The Sims</em> is a unique experience that is worthy of its lofty legacy. Second, <em>The Sims</em> deserved better than this lackluster re-release.</p>
<h2>EA didn’t meet its own standard</h2>
<p>Look, it's fine to re-release a game without remastering it. I'm actually glad to see the game's original assets as they always were—it's deeply nostalgic, and there's always a tinge of sadness when a remaster overwrites the work of the original artists. That's not a concern here.</p>
<p>But if you're going to re-release a game on Steam in 2025, there are minimum expectations—especially from a company with the resources of EA, and even more so for a game that is this important and beloved.</p>
<p>The game needs to reliably run on modern machines, and it needs to support basic platform features like cloud saves or achievements. It's not much to ask, and it's not what we got.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The Steam forums for the game are filled with people saying it's lazy that EA didn't include Steam Cloud support because implementing that is ostensibly as simple as picking a folder and checking a box.</p>
<p>I spoke with two different professional game developers this week who have previously published games on Steam, and I brought up the issue of Steam Cloud and achievement support. As they tell it, it turns out it's not nearly as simple as those players in the forums believe—but it still should have been within EA's capabilities, even with a crunched schedule.</p>
<p>Yes, it's sometimes possible to get it working at a basic level within a couple of hours, provided you're already using the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api">Steamworks API</a>. But even in that circumstance, the way a game's saves work might require additional work to protect against lost data or frequent problems with conflicts.</p>
<p>Given that the game doesn't support achievements or really anything else you'd expect, it's possible EA didn't use the Steamworks API at all. (Doing that would have been hours of additional work.)</p>

<p>I'm not giving EA a pass, though. Four years ago, EA put out the <em>Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection</em>, a 4K upscale remaster of the original C&amp;C games. The release featured a unified binary for the classic games, sprites and textures that were upscaled to higher resolutions, quality of life improvements, and yes, many of the Steam bells and whistles that include achievements. I'm not saying that the remaster was flawless, but it exhibited significantly more care and effort than <em>The Sims</em> re-release.</p>
<p>I love <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>. I played a lot of it when I was younger. But even a longtime <em>C&amp;C</em> fan like myself can easily acknowledge that its importance in gaming history (as well as its popularity and revenue potential) pale in comparison to <em>The Sims</em>.</p>
<p>If EA could do all that for <em>C&amp;C,</em> it's all the more perplexing that it didn't bother with a 25th-anniversary re-release of <em>The Sims</em>.</p>

<h2>Single-player games, meet publicly traded companies</h2>
<p>While we don't have much insight into all the inner workings of EA, there are hints as to why this sort of thing is happening. For one thing, anyone who has worked for a giant corporation like this knows it's all too easy for the objective to be passed down from above at the last minute, leaving no time or resources to see it through adequately.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But it might run deeper than that. To put it simply, publicly traded publishers like EA can't seem to satisfy investors with single-purchase, single-player games. The emphasis on single-player releases has been decreasing for a long time, and it's markedly less just five years after the release of the <em>C&amp;C</em> remaster.</p>
<p>Take the recent comments from EA CEO Andrew Wilson's post-earnings call, for example. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/electronic-arts-ceo-andrew-wilson-argues-that-the-future-of-single-player-games-is-a-live-service-hybrid/">Wilson noted</a> that the big-budget, single-player RPG <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-the-choices-you-make-while-saving-the-world/"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a> failed to meet sales expectations—even though it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam">apparently</a> one of EA's most successful single-player Steam releases ever.</p>
<p>"In order to break out beyond the core audience, games need to directly connect to the evolving demands of players who increasingly seek shared-world features and deeper engagement alongside high-quality narratives in this beloved category," he explained, suggesting that games need to be multiplayer games-as-a-service to be successful in this market.</p>
<p>Ironically, though, the single-player RPG <em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</em> launched around the same time he made those comments, and that game's developer said it made its money back in <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/days-after-ea-ceo-suggests-players-crave-live-service-guff-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-boss-says-their-single-player-rpg-made-all-its-money-back-in-one-day/">a single day of sales</a>. It's currently one of the top-trending games on Twitch, too.</p>
<p>It's possible that <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> director Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-blasts-publisher-greed-behind-layoffs">hit the nail on the head</a> when he suggested at the Game Developers Conference last year that a particular approach to pursuing quarterly profits runs counter to the practice of making good games.</p>
<p>"I've been fighting publishers my entire life, and I keep on seeing the same, same, same mistakes over and over and over," he said. "It's always the quarterly profits. The only thing that matters are the numbers."</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1770834130852315517">Later on X</a>, he clarified who he was pointing a finger at: "This message was for those who try to double their revenue year after year. You don't have to do that. Build more slowly and make your aim improving the state of the art, not squeezing out the last drop."</p>
<p>In light of Wilson's comments, it's a fair guess that EA might not have put in much effort on <em>The Sims</em> re-releases simply because of a belief that single-player games that aren't "shared world experiences" just aren't worth the resources anymore, given the company's need to satisfy shareholders with perpetual revenue growth.</p>

<h2>Despite all this, <em>The Sims</em> is worth a look</h2>
<p>It's telling that in a market with too many options, I still put the effort in to get the game working, and I spent multiple evenings this week immersed in the lives of my sims.</p>
<p>Even after 25 years, this game is unique. It has the emergent wackiness of something like <em>RimWorld</em> or <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, but it has a fast-acting, addictive hook and is easy to learn. There have been other games besides <em>The Sims</em> that are highly productive engines for original player stories, but few have achieved these heights while remaining accessible to virtually everyone.</p>
<p>Like so many of the best games, it's hard to stop playing once you start. There's always one more task you want to complete—or you're about to walk away when something hilariously unexpected happens.</p>
<p>The problems I had getting <em>The Sims</em> to run aren't that much worse than what I surely experienced on my PC back in 2002—it's just that the standards are a lot higher now.</p>
<p>I've gotten $20 out of value out of the purchase, despite my gripes. But it's not just about my experience. More broadly, <em>The Sims</em> deserved better. It could have had a moment back in the cultural zeitgeist, with tens of thousands of Twitch viewers.</p>
<h2>Missed opportunities</h2>
<p>The moment seems perfect: The world is stressful, so people want nostalgia. Cozy games are ascendant. Sandbox designs are making a comeback. <em>The Sims</em> slots smoothly into all of that.</p>
<p>But go to those Twitch streams, and you'll see a lot of complaining about how the game didn't really get everything it deserved and a sentiment that whatever moment EA was hoping for was undermined by this lack of commitment.</p>
<p>Instead, the cozy game du jour on Twitch is the <em>Animal Crossing</em>-like <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, a former Apple Arcade exclusive that made its way to Steam recently. To be clear, I'm not knocking <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>; it's a great game for fans of the modern cozy genre, and I'm delighted to see an indie studio seeing so much success.</p>

<p>The takeaway is that we can't look to big publishers like EA to follow through on delivering quality single-player experiences anymore. It's the indies that'll carry that forward.</p>
<p>It's just a bummer for fans that <em>The Sims</em> couldn't have the revival moment it should have gotten.</p>

The card match was streamed online and the winner would receive a very rare gold Mickey card worth between $10,000 and $20,000. The winner would also move on to the Top 4 and have a chance to make it into the first <em>Lorcana</em> world tournament, so this was a big moment and a lot of people were watching. </p><h2 id="h262012"><a id=""></a>What happened during the event</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2369924180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2369924180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the third and final round of the match</a></span>, Lentini “quested” with a magic broom card, gaining a point towards victory. Then he played Goat Merlin, a card that grants you a victory point for simply playing it. And then he went to banish his broom card to his discard pile because that card has an ability that lets you destroy it when you play another character and you then draw a card. That’s when his opponent, Fusade, complained and asked for a judge to step in. </p><p>Fusade’s argument was that Lentini had missed his chance to trigger the broom’s ability when he grabbed Goat Merlin’s point and moved on. If you’ve played <em>Lorcana </em>even casually you’ll know that is, uh, bullshit. In fact, in the official rules, simultaneous triggers can be handled in any order as long as you are clear with the other player. A longtime judge and <em>Lorcana </em>expert confirmed that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Mfpt3QNIsgc?t=305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Mfpt3QNIsgc?t=305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no rule was broken in a video with <em>Lorcana </em>content creator Joe “Speci” Curley</a></span>. In fact, as pointed out in that same video, Lentini did something very similar earlier in that same match which wasn’t flagged by the judge or Fusade. </p><p>That didn’t matter, however, because during the match the judge incorrectly sided with Fusade and made Lentini put his broom back on the board, not letting him discard it to gain a draw. This ended up costing Lentini the match and a chance to qualify for the world tournament. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DisneyLorcana/status/1885969386676379884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DisneyLorcana/status/1885969386676379884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fusade then made it to the final match</a></span> and lost, but still qualified for the world final.

While it has yet to be confirmed whether Fusade was actually disqualified or just dropped out himself, based on how Ravensburger provided Lentini with a gold Mickey card, I think it’s safe to assume that Fusade was removed from the event.</p><p><em>Lorcana </em>is still a relatively new trading card game compared to <em>Magic </em>and <em>Pokémon</em>, so the community is happy to see this controversial situation be resolved in a mostly satisfactory way. The hope is that this is an indicator that Ravensburger is serious about protecting the game and the quality of its future events. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's pretty expensive, but Amazon has just dropped the price to a new low with a 20% discount.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller Sale</h2><div catalogid="1620c457-409e-42b8-91af-d7f30570614f" id="214952"><div id="214952" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When this controller first came out back in May 2024, it sold out very quickly. This is largely because there just aren't really any new guitar controller options available outside of this one.
