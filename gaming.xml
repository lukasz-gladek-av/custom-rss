            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sandisk-makes-zero-profit-play-on-2tb-ssd-flagship-storage-drops-to-pennies-on-amazon.1364779/</guid>

              <p>Backing up files or moving large projects between devices should not feel like paint drying but traditional hard drives (HDD) make you wait what felt like forever as they spin and click their way through transfers. External SSDs changed the game when they reduced those wait times to mere seconds instead of minutes and the <strong>SanDisk 2TB SSD takes the speed advantage</strong> and wraps it in a package that is tough enough to survive your daily chaos.</p>
<p>This drive hits <strong>read speeds up to 1050MB/s and write speeds around 1000MB/s</strong> which means transferring a 4K movie takes about 30 seconds instead of several minutes. Its 2TB capacity gives you plenty of room for your entire photo library and a solid collection of games. And the good news, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/">Amazon dropped the price to $179 from the usual $209 for Black Friday</a> (and it was launched at $250) which marks an all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed That Matches Your Workflow</h2>
<p>The <strong>NVMe solid-state performance</strong> inside this compact drive delivers the kind of transfer rates that make backing up your laptop or editing 4K footage directly from the drive practical. You can drag and drop a 50GB project folder and watch it complete before you finish your coffee which beats the old-school external hard drive experience where you’d start a transfer and go make lunch.</p>
<p>The <strong>USB-C connection works with both USB 3.2 Gen 2 and backward-compatible ports</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not locked into only the newest devices. This level of performance allows video editors to work with high-resolution footage without needing to pre-copy everything to their internal drive first and allows photographers to cull through thousands of RAW files without the lag that makes you want to throw your mouse across the room.</p>



<p>The <strong>IP65 rating protects against water splashes</strong> and dust intrusion which matters more than you think when you’re tossing this drive in bags, leaving it on outdoor shoot locations, or just living your normal clumsy life. SanDisk upgraded the drop protection to 3 meters, so those accidental falls from your desk or even that low tree branch on a hiking shoot aren’t going to turn your entire project archive into a paperweight.</p>
<p>The rubberized exterior provides grip and <strong>another layer of shock absorption</strong> while the included carabiner loop lets you clip it to your backpack or belt loop if you’re the type that needs gear within arm’s reach at all times. Tha<strong>t 256-bit AES hardware encryption</strong> with password protection keeps your files secure in case the drive goes missing, giving you one less thing to panic about if you leave it in a coffee shop.</p>



<p>The SanDisk Memory Zone app will help you figure out what’s taking up space and automatically back up your phone content so you don’t have to remember to do this every few months. Because of solid-state technology (not generating the heat from spinning platters), the drive keeps cool during long transfer sessions, and a compact form factor means it disappears into any bag pocket.</p>
<p>For $179, 2TB of fast, rugged storage <strong>costs less than 9 cents per gigabyte</strong>, and that’s exactly the kind of value that makes upgrading your entire backup strategy a no-brainer instead of a budget debate.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-series-casts-euphoria-actor-as-lead.1364776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The upcoming Netflix live-action adaptation of Assassin’s Creed has cast a co-lead for the show. Furthermore, it’s an actor whose resume includes projects like Euphoria and The Bikeriders.</p>







<p>The Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going strong since 2007. Spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story, it’s had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a decent streak recently</a>. A film adaptation starring X-Men: First Class’ Michael Fassbender came out in 2016 to negative press. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a>, Netflix is working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but it seems traction has been gained on at least one of them.</p>



<h2 id="h-toby-wallace-to-co-lead-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series">Toby Wallace to Co-Lead Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/assassins-creed-toby-wallace-cast-netflix-series-1236628211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, actor Toby Wallace is set to co-lead Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series. While no date or story was announced, it’s stated that he will be a series regular.  Even more so, the report says that filming will occur in Italy, which may serve as the main setting. </p>



<p>Toby Wallace is a fairly new actor, only having a few big roles under his belt, like The Bikeriders and Eden. However, the actor is set to star as a series regular in the new season of HBO’s Euphoria. An interesting tidbit is that Wallace will co-lead, so another actor, not yet known, will star alongside him. Given the game’s usage of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-assassins-creed-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">present and past</a>, perhaps another actor will play the ancestor or present-day descendant. In the film, Michael Fassbender played both parts, so maybe the co-lead is a Templar head or another role. Either way, it’ll be interesting to see how the cast, and show, shape up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Toby Wallace’s casting in Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series? Do you think the show will work out? Who do you want to see cast in the series? Any actor in particular?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Destiny 2 is a week away from launching its Star Wars expansion, Renegades, which frankly looks more Star Wars-y than when Destiny did its first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV4qakZgCHY">Star Wars collab in February</a>. Ahead of that launch, it hosted a live stream today where it delved into everything arriving in next week's expansion and showed off a new launch trailer.</p>



<p>Renegades introduces a slew of new weapons, including the Praxic Blade, which is Destiny's version of a lightsaber. Blasters are also an entirely new weapon archetype introduced in Renegades, and feature a heat-based firing system that can overheat instead of having to reload magazines.</p>



<p>The expansion will also introduce the Lawless Frontier, a new activity for players that's meant to be replayable and lets players rise through different Syndicate factions through the new Notoriety system.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Destiny 2: Renegades | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PqicEwg2qEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The three factions are the Pikers, Tharsis Reformation, and Totality Division. Each has missions you can undertake for them, either by yourself or in groups of three. Different missions include bounty hunts, smuggling runs, sabotage excursions, and a new Invasion mode, which is a feature you opt into that allows a Guardian to spawn into the playing field to try and disrupt your progress.</p>



<p>Bungie also showed off the new dungeon, Equilibrium, which will arrive shortly after Renegades on December 13, 2025. There's also a new video documentary with the team going behind-the-scenes on the making of Destiny 2: Renegades.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Destiny 2: Renegades ViDoc | Making of a Renegade" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_07pVzO5no?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Overall, it looks like it'll be an engaging expansion for Destiny 2 players to dig into, but that's not the question really, for Renegades. The question is whether it can bring the players Destiny 2 has lost back to the game.</p>



<p>Just last month, the game reached an <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/">all-time low concurrent player count on Steam</a>, and it's not as if those players have returned. The last time it hit over 100K players on Steam was in July, and since early September, it's stayed significantly below 50K.</p>



<p>Of course, Steam concurrent numbers aren't everything and only show a portion of the whole picture. But it's not exactly a good sign for the game, and with<a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/"> everything else that Bungie is dealing with</a>, a poor launch for Renegades could mean even darker times ahead for the beloved studio. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Battlefield 6 Map Ranked From Worst To Best]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/every-battlefield-6-map-ranked-from-worst-to-best-2000647370</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-battlefield-6-map-ranked-from-worst-to-best.1364755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> has been out for about two months now, and in that time, I’ve played around 90 hours or so of EA’s big new online military shooter. I really, really like it! But, as with any <em>Battlefield</em> game, not every map is great. In fact, some are downright awful.</p> <p>So, after playing every map more times than I count and following EA’s addition of two new maps in the game’s first season, I’ve sat down and ranked them all from worst to best. We’ll update this list as EA adds new maps over the next few months.&nbsp; Oh, and I mostly play Conquest and Escalation, so keep that in mind as you scroll through the list.</p>

 <h2>12 – New Sobek City</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647402"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647402">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>I don’t play this map anymore because I enjoy my life and don’t enjoy fighting 20+ snipers on rooftops and helicopters that hide at their base to avoid being destroyed. But when I did play it, I hated nearly every moment! I’d rather eat glass.</p>

 <h2>11 – Blackwell Fields</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647403" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647403"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647403">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve played so many matches on Blackwell Fields since it was added to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-players-please-capture-control-points-2000646929"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> as part of season one.&nbsp; Half the time, it’s a boring blowout, and the other half it’s a miserable slog through an empty hellscape as you pray for your tickets to run out and the match to end. Snipers are everywhere, doing nothing to help either team win. Everybody else picks engineer as an overreaction to all the vehicles. Bleh. Bad. Ugly, too! Hate it.</p>

 <h2>10 – Empire State</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647404"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647404">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Empire State only sneaks past Blackwell Fields because it has no vehicles. That makes it especially interesting as a Conquest map. It’s not good, mind you, as having no tanks or APCs means every push into occupied territory is done on foot. This is also a map where it never feels like a frontline is established. Instead, I just get domed from every direction and curse myself for not removing this bad map from the custom search pool.</p>

 <h2>9 – Saints Quarter</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647405" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647405"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647405">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>If you only play BF6’s big modes, like Conquest or Rush, you might not have even seen this map. But it’s there and is the one map exclusive to small modes. It serves its purpose as a meat grinder maze for smaller modes and looks pretty doing it. But that’s about all I have to say about Saints Quarter, a map I usually forget about.</p>

 <h2>8 – Manhattan Bridge</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647406" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647406"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647406">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Unlike Empire State, this other NYC map isn’t a painful experience. In fact, I’ve had some solidly fun matches on here. Its real problem is how small it is. If this map had a few more streets and alleys, it might be higher on the list. At least it ain’t Empire State. So it has that going for it.</p>

 <h2>7 – Iberian Offensive</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647407" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647407"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647407">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>There’s a good map in here. I know it. I think if some of its control points got spaced out a bit more, or the main HQs were pushed back a tad, it would help. As is, most matches devolve into teams fighting over E and C. Some of those fights are fun. Some are not. I’m usually not too mad to play this one, but I’m not looking forward to it.</p> <h2>6 – Siege of Cairo</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647408" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647408"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647408">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>The first “great” map on this list. Siege of Cairo isn’t massive, but it feels bigger thanks to areas that are clearly designed for big fights and vehicles, and smaller, congested sections focused on infantry warfare. You feel like you are moving in and out of various conflicts as you cross this map. And the main street in the middle often becomes a hard-fought piece of ground where I’ve experienced many memorable moments.</p> <h2>5 – Operation Firestorm</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647409"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647409">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>A <em>Battlefield</em> classic returns, and <em>Battlefield 6 i</em>s better off for it. I do have some issues with some of the control points and how big they are, and how easy it is for a single player to hide away to hold them or take them. But I can overlook that because this big map has so much space to work with and features all the vehicles you’d expect, plus plenty of places to escape or even ambush them with rockets. Let’s add Caspian Border next, please.</p>

 <h2>4 – Fort Lyndon</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647410"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647410">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>I <em>nearly</em> didn’t include this map because it’s only (officially) available in Redsec aka <em>BF6</em>‘s battle royale mode. But it’s still a damn fine map and a big one, too. I don’t play much Redsec as I prefer solo battle royales, but when I do hop in, I’m always impressed at how large Fort Lyndon is and all the visual variety. Then I get sad that <em>BF6</em> seemingly supports big maps, but we still don’t have many, and none close to this scale.</p> <h2>3 – Liberation Peak</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647411" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647411"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647411">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Just a damn good map. This mountainous corridor of chaos has just enough open landscape to let vehicles have fun without devolving into a sniper controller wasteland (looking at you, Blackwell Fields), but smartly includes plenty of infantry-focused areas for combat, too. One of those classic Battlefield maps where every piece of the game seems included. And a shoutout to all you soldiers who help my friends and me hold D. A tough job, but important.</p>

 <h2>2 – Mirak Valley</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647412" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647412"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647412">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Wonderful stuff here. Mirak Valley is big, but not empty. It sports a few control points in the center that are right next to each other and offer up some hectic and deadly building-to-building skirmishes. But if you prefer more long-range combat, it has control points that offer up plenty of that kind of fighting, too. Vehicles feel powerful on this map, but not overpowered, thanks to just enough indestructible structures that provide infantry with hiding holes. Every time Mirak Valley shows up, I smile a bit and hope the match is a close one that takes a long time.</p> <h2>1 – Eastwood</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647413" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647413"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647413">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547">This is (as of November 2025) <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s newest map, and it’s also the game’s best</a>. It checks all the boxes that I need checked for a good <em>BF</em> map. Big? Yup. A variety of spaces to fight in and run through? Yes. A cool location with a strong, visually intriguing theme? I mean, it’s a map set near a fancy golf course and rich McMansions. Doesn’t that sound fun to blow up? You can even drive around Eastwood in a golf cart. If future <em>BF6</em> maps are as good as Eastwood, we are going to be in for a real treat.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-quietly-liquidates-millions-of-mac-mini-m4-on-amazon-compact-desktop-now-selling-for-pennies-2000647379</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-quietly-liquidates-millions-of-mac-mini-m4-on-amazon-compact-desktop-now-selling-for-pennies.1364752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple traditionally avoids discounts and maintains full pricing on its official website and retail stores, treating Black Friday like any other day to preserve its premium brand image. Amazon doesn’t share that restraint and just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">slashed the price of the brand-new Mac mini M4 with 256GB storage to $479 from the usual $599</a>, which <strong>marks a record low</strong> on one of the most powerful compact desktops currently available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>This<strong> latest Mac mini tucks the M4 chip into a five-by-five-inch</strong> enclosure that delivers desktop-class performance while taking up less space on your desk than a large coffee mug. The $120 discount is a rare opportunity to grab Apple’s newest silicon at a reduced price instead of waiting months or years for depreciation to make it affordable.</p>

<h2>Desktop Performance in a Tiny Package</h2>
<p>The<strong> M4 chip brings a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU</strong> that handle everything from coding and video editing to casual gaming and AI tasks without breaking a sweat. You get 16GB of unified memory, different from traditional RAM because it allows both the CPU and GPU to draw from the same memory pool, eliminating bottlenecks that slow down graphics-intensive work.</p>
<p>The<strong> 256GB SSD provides fast storage</strong> for your operating system and applications, though you’ll want external drives for large media libraries since that capacity fills up in a hurry with 4K video projects or extensive photo collections. Built for Apple Intelligence, on-device AI processing keeps your data private while delivering features like intelligent writing assistance and advanced photo search without sending information to cloud servers.</p>



<p>The <strong>redesigned chassis puts USB-C ports and a headphone jack on the front</strong> for the first time, ending the annoyance of reaching around back to plug in devices or headphones multiple times per day.<strong> Thunderbolt ports</strong> on the rear support up to three displays simultaneously, letting you build a proper multi-monitor workspace that boosts productivity for coding, design work, or financial analysis. <strong>HDMI output connects directly to TVs</strong> or older monitors without requiring adapters and <strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong> provides stable wired networking for situations where WiFi just doesn’t cut it.</p>
<p><strong>Apps optimized for Apple silicon</strong> run at an incredible speed with the unified memory architecture and efficient chip design that delivers laptop-level power consumption while providing desktop performance levels. Microsoft 365, Adobe Creative Cloud, and thousands of other applications perform seamlessly-whether you’re running complex spreadsheet calculations, editing multi-layer Photoshop files, or compiling code. Native macOS applications feel instantly responsive with zero lag between clicks and actions, creating a computing experience that makes older Intel-based machines feel sluggish by comparison.</p>



<p>With<strong> integration to your iPhone and other Apple devices</strong>, you can create one big ecosystem: copy on one device, paste on another; mirror your iPhone screen to work with mobile apps on a bigger display; or answer FaceTime calls from your Mac while your phone charges across the room. Continuity features eliminate friction from moving between devices: start an email on your phone during a commute and finish it on your Mac when you reach your desk.</p>
<p>At $479 instead of $599, you’re saving $120 on Apple’s latest desktop silicon which brings the entry price for M4 performance down to a level that competes favorably with Windows mini PCs that deliver less power and worse software integration.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Things change a lot in game development. Entire segments get cut, characters who were part of the concept phase never make it into the final product, and sometimes mechanics that were meant to be touchstones of the moment-to-moment disappear after a particularly intense meeting. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> best scene, however, was always part of AdHoc Studio’s superhero workplace comedy.</span></p> <p><span>In Episode five, “Team Building,” protagonist Robert Robertson III goes from chatting with his team of reformed villains over a headset behind an office desk to joining them in a villain bar called the Sardine. Though Robert has (temporarily) retired from his time as a crime-fighting hero, the patrons at the bar don’t take too kindly to his presence, and things get violent. The b</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-5-best-bar-scene-song-prism-thot-squad-2000645192"><span>ar fight that follows is one of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s most memorable sequences</span></a><span>, both for its violent excess and its cramming some of its best jokes and character showcases into a fleeting five-minute frenzy.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>So how did AdHoc manage to pull this scene off? That’s what I wanted to find out when I sat down with co-directors Dennis Lenart and Chris Rebbert, who told me that, while episode five’s bar fight was always meant to be a tentpole moment in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s story in which Robert won over his team of ex-criminals on their own turf, it actually came together fairly late in the game’s development because the Z-Team itself was still being finalized.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We actually ended up doing a lot of the action scenes last because we were figuring out the powers of everyone along the way,” Lenart said. “As we were working on the dispatch shift mechanic, we were constantly iterating and sometimes swapping powers between heroes if someone was too overpowered. So, a lot of the actiony stuff, especially the bar fight, we wanted to leave until a little bit later, so all the sort of cement had dried for the characters.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000647375" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647375"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647375">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Putting a group of super-powered heroes into a small space like a bar is not an easy task, and coming up with individual setpieces and mini-narratives for each of them required a complete and solidified team with definitive powers. Some characters didn’t make it into the game, including one who had ice-based powers that were storyboarded in an early mock-up of the bar fight. But even the characters that were in the final game weren’t entirely set in stone. Malevola, the devilish woman who can open portals, was originally telepathic and able to read people’s “bad” thoughts, which would have changed how she used her talents in a bar fight.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There was like two guys, she’d basically made one goon admit to the other goon that he was in love with his girlfriend or something like that,” Rebbert said.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Some of the smaller moments were tweaked over the course of development as Z-Team members solidified, but some of the bar fight’s most effective tricks weren’t in the original script at all. The scene uses a non-linear structure, showing Robert and his crew decompressing at a legally distinct Taco Bell after a fight the player never saw unfold. Then, as Robert tries to make the most of his late-night dinner, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>gives you QTEs that transition from food preparation to the unseen violent bar brawl. The original pitch was much more straightforward.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I think it was Dennis’ idea, and we were looking at films like </span><i><span>The Wrestler</span></i><span>, [which] was a big influence,” Rebbert said. “There’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAsn2mw9abE"><span>this locker room scene</span></a><span> where they have a match and it keeps cutting back and forth with them getting staples taken out of their head, and then it cuts in to show how that happened in the actual match. We looked at more samples from that. I found one from </span><i><span>30 Rock</span></i><span>, which is one of my favorite shows. There’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCpw5edmYBw"><span>a scene where Kenneth has a party in that show</span></a><span>, and then nobody talks about it and just cuts to the aftermath where everybody’s looking at each other in the cold light of day, and all the things they did to one another. We just like that energy, right? It was just unexpected, and it kind of opened up what we could do with the QTE system.”</span></p>

 <h2><b>Fourth meal</b></h2> <p><span>Those “unexpected” QTEs include Robert putting a straw in his drink only to hard cut to stabbing a goon in the face with a handful of darts, tearing a cybernetic implant out of someone’s head when you were supposed to be opening a sauce packet, and biting a baddie’s thumb off instead of the end of your taco.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I think the straw might have been the first one,” Lenart said. “I was just like, ‘Wouldn’t it be funny if you were doing this mundane thing that turned into some horrific thing?’ Then Chris and I started talking like, ‘Oh, okay, that’s interesting. Well, maybe, in order to do that, you’d have to have this flashback structure.’ I think originally we planned like, five or six flashbacks.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000647380" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647380"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647380">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The violence is a funny, gross-out gag, but it was also an attempt to make sure </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s QTEs weren’t a “chore.” Compared to the team’s work at Telltale on games like </span><i><span>The Walking Dead </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wolf Among Us</span></i><span>, where “everything stops in the middle of a chaotic scene” while the game waits for a player’s input, Lenart said he wanted </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s action to flow and be “as entertaining as watching a good action scene in a TV show.” Rebbert added that relying on those slowed-down action sequences would have felt especially odd given the team-based fight scenes in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We’re cognizant of what we always call internally </span><a href="https://fables.fandom.com/wiki/The_Woodsman_(video_game)"><span>‘The Woody Windup,’</span></a><span>” Rebbert said. “It’s a reference to </span><i><span>Wolf Among Us</span></i><span>, where the villain goes like this [imitates a slowed-down winding up for a punch], and it just kills the pacing. I think in this context specifically, it was like, ‘well, what the hell is the Z team doing?’ Well, they’re waiting for you to punch this guy. We’re trying to combat those shortcomings that we found with the mechanic in the past.”</span></p> <p><span>Comparatively, </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s action scenes, though a bit more sparse than the average Telltale game, are more fluid, which gives AdHoc more opportunities to pull off fast-paced, comical violence when it fits while also letting the player participate in something precise and choreographed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The sort of arc of the interactivity of the scene is to shock you at first, then go up one level with the second flashback,” Lenart said. “Then the third time, where he lifts the taco to his mouth, the hope was that people would be sitting there going, ‘Oh God, what is he going to do?’”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000647381" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647381"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647381">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Based on the reactions of players and streamers, Rebbert and Lenart reckon those gory back-and-forths accomplished what they set out to do, though they were worried people might hate the entire scene. The three moments that are in the game are only half of the ones the team planned for, which was partially due to budgetary concerns. </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s animation pipeline is comparable to an animated film, according to Lenart, which means that scenes like the bar fight got so expensive that AdHoc had to cut frames and seconds of the scene to fit it into its runtime and budget.</span></p> <p><span>Budget restrictions, in this case, worked in the scene’s favor. The structure was partially envisioned to “relieve the burden” of animating the fight from beginning to end, which Lenart says allowed them to look for “just the highlights” of each section. This is why Robert can be doing something terribly violent to a completely different villain at each transition, as it’s implied you’re jumping into a much longer fight when it’s getting good. However, some pretty major gameplay moments ended up getting scrapped in the process, from narrative choices to a live, in-person riff on the game’s dispatch mechanics.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There was a valiant effort to try to do—we called it ‘Live Action Dispatching’ where Robert was sort of like Coach Cartering in the bar fight,” Rebbert said. “Players could choose to send Malevola that way, send Punch Up that way, and it just became too unruly, and it was like one of those things where the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze, production-wise.”</span></p> <p><span>One cut segment had players choosing whether to team up with one member of the Z-Team or the other as the fight got dicey, which would have led to some character-specific moments that didn’t make it into the final game.</span></p> <p><span>“One beat that I’m kind of glad got cut was a point where Robert actually comes out of the bathroom after he’s fighting, and there was a choice that we ended up excising was you saw that Prism was on stage and a shapeshifter had taken the form of one of her holograms, so it was sneaking up on her,” Rebbert said. “Then on the other side of the bar, Punch Up, I can’t remember exactly what was happening with Punch Up, but it was a choice on who to save, right? Who do you go after, and it just ended up being one of those things that felt a little bit more arbitrary, which I think ultimately is why we excised it, but there were fun beats around it where Robert gets in a fight with the Prism hologram if you go on Prism’s side. Then Prism jumps in and saves you, but it’s clear that she just took a guess and accidentally saved you.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000647382" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647382"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647382">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Some characters were cut from the fight, both because of their conditional status as Z-team members and because they narratively didn’t fit the scene’s scrappy vibe. Waterboy and Phenomaman, two heroes the player can choose to add to their team earlier in the season, are omitted from most of it</span></p>

 <p><span>“We ended up deciding that they don’t get involved for various reasons,” Rebbert said. “A, because they’re not villains, and B, because of where they were story-wise in there. Phenomaman is depressed, and Waterboy hasn’t come into his own yet as a hero, so it kind of made sense to put either of them in a cage.”</span></p> <h2><b>Making the most of five minutes</b></h2> <p><span>When you’re working in such a short, five-minute window, AdHoc had to be economic and strategic with the moments it did include, which means that most of one-liners and gags came straight from the script, rather than being improvised. Rebbert jokes that he would be “surprised if [the voice actors] even understood what was happening,” as the chaotic scene was still without visuals during the voice recording sessions. This included Prism’s now iconic “The fuck you mean, ‘temporarily?’ Bitch, you blind foreva” line when she uses her light powers on a goon who exclaims that she “temporarily blinded” him.</span></p>

 <p><span>While her incredible line is not improv, Prism is one of the stars of the fight because her voice is in the background of the entire brawl. The light-manipulating pop star hero is singing “Hoes Depressed” by Thot Squad throughout the fight (Prism is voiced by Thot Squad rapper Blvck Bunnie). Thot Squad’s music is featured multiple times in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, but the cheerleader-like, singsongy “Hoes Depressed” has become synonymous with the bar fight’s rowdy roughhousing. According to Rebbert, Thot Squad’s music was already in consideration for </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>‘s soundtrack before Prism was cast in the role, and once the team realized that a microphone was going to be in the room during the bar fight, one thing led to another, and “Hoes Depressed” became the soundtrack of the scrimmage.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000647383" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647383"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647383">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“She was just so much fun and full of energy and just so excited to be there, too,” Rebbert said. “Once those things happened, it was like, ‘Well, now we’re definitely going to put a song of hers [in the game]. She’s gonna be on stage singing because we don’t get a chance to do that otherwise in the scene.’ Karaoke was already in the script, and then it was like, ‘Well, there’s a microphone right there. We have a pop star. Why would she be doing anything else right now?’”</span></p>

 <p><span>Prism isn’t the only Z-teamer singing at the Sardine, though. Flambae, the flamboyant, flame-manipulating ex-villain, also has his moment singing an embellished version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ivt_N2Zcts">Meredith Brooks’ “Bitch.”</a> At first, Flambae sings an antagonistic rewrite of the 1997 rock anthem that turns the “Bitch” from a self-referential term of endearment into a derogatory one aimed squarely at his boss.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I’m a bitch, my name’s Robert</span></p> <p><span>Such a bitch, whose name is Robert</span></p> <p><span>I’m a bitch, yeah I’m a bitch</span></p> <p><span>I’m such a fucking bitch</span></p> <p><span>I have no hopes, I have no dreams</span></p> <p><span>And a tiny little peen</span></p> <p><span>And it doesn’t even function anyway</span></p> <p><span>Because I have erectile dysfunction</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>At first, Flambae was going to sing a completely different song, but Rebbert and Lenart were hesitant to name it when I asked them what it was. This mystery song would have served the same role, juxtaposing the much heavier flashbacks of an old fight between Flambae and Robert in which the hero severed the fire-bender’s fingers with a cheery-sounding song everyone knows.</span></p>  <p><span>“It’s one of those things where you’re like, ‘Maybe we can get this. This band probably has enough money that they don’t really care about charging a ton for some weird indie game to use this thing,’” Lenart said. “Once the rights were investigated, it was just immediately shut down. There’s no way we could ever afford it.”</span></p> <p><span>Rebbert said that this mystery song was the “first idea” and “more of the obvious choice,” but AdHoc had a “whole spreadsheet” of song ideas and spent months investigating other songs. Whatever they chose had to be a song “enough people [would] be able to recognize from jump.” Rebbert says he takes full credit for using “Bitch,” which he said is a song he sometimes sings to his wife as an inside joke (in first person, thus referring to himself as the titular “Bitch,” he stresses).</span></p>

 <p><span>“Once it was clear that that could be an option, I was like, ‘Guys, I’m not gonna entertain other songs,’ and everybody else had to put up with me,” Rebbert said.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000647384" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647384"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647384">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Though they were able to get the rights to “Bitch,” the process of getting it and Flambae’s cover into the game itself was another ordeal. Rebbert rewrote the lyrics, but Flambae voice actor Lance Cantstopolis ended up deviating from it and improvising a full version of the song heard in the episode’s credits.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Obviously, a lot of the stuff is written and nailed down months in advance, and then with some of the actors, you also just kind of go, ‘cool, just give me some of your takes on these different lines,’” Lenart said. “[Cantstopolis is] one of the ones that loves it, and then you just kind of want to like let him loose and just say ‘Do what you want.’ I feel like, with a lot of the actors who recorded, we get four hours of voice files from them at the end; he has probably eight hours of stuff. He’ll just riff on everything and keep going, and it’s sad that it’ll never see the light of day, but it’s hilarious for us just to go through the folders and just listen to all the, all the hilarious stuff he said.”</span></p> <p><span>However, the “Bitch” instrumental Cantstopolis riffs over is a homebrew MIDI made by Lenart because AdHoc “couldn’t pay for the karaoke recording” along with acquiring the rights. When Lenart was syncing Flambae’s vocals to his makeshift instrumental, he found Cantstopolis’ improvised version that made it into the credits.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I was like, ‘Holy crap, this is so funny,”’ Lenart said. “I just started sending it to Chris, Nick, and a bunch of folks like just being like, ‘Isn’t this hilarious? Like, God, he just did the whole thing, and there’s so much great stuff in here.’”</span></p> <h2><b>The devil’s in the details</b></h2> <p><span>Flambae isn’t shown as much in the bar fight itself because the brawl is chaotic enough, and filled with small moments spotlighting each member of the Z-Team. Punch Up uses his short stature to punch the dick of every goon he can, leading to one guy voiced by Rebbert shouting “He’s only punching dicks!” over the noise of the bar. Malevola throws a grunt through a portal after he remarks that he’s “totally into” being choked by her devil tail, and Golem, who isn’t allowed into the bar at first, uses that portal to come and wreck shop with his giant mud-filled arms.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s commitment to its rehabilitated scoundrels’ personalities comes through in most environments, but a bar is also the perfect stage for showcasing a cast of this size, especially when they’re mostly together in a workplace.</span></p> <p><span>“You have a few drinks, you let your guard down, you’re having fun, you loosen up—it’s the antithesis of an office environment,” Rebbert said. “I mean, not that this team by any means behaves properly according to HR protocol, but you know, it’s really we kind of let your hair down. Public houses and watering holes have always been a place where people kind of come together.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000647392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647392"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647392">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The bar was especially helpful in illustrating the contrast between Robert’s stoic, well-mannered heroics and his untamable crew. Lenart points to the clean, local Crypto Night bar seen in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s first episode as a stark contrast between the person Robert has always been and the Sardine’s seedy underbelly he’s trying to navigate now. To the team, this was the best place to finally let Robert and the Z-Team see each other as equals because getting over that barrier wouldn’t be easy.</span></p> <p><span>“The goal of the episode was to have Robert win over the Z-team and cross a relationship barrier with them, for lack of a better way of describing it,” Rebbert said. “It just felt appropriate to put him in enemy territory and make that as hard for him as possible. This is a place that’s their old stomping grounds. He’s an ex-hero.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Despite all of AdHoc’s fears about whether or not the bar fight would work, it’s one of the most memorable sequences in this first season. Lenart says that all that worry was worth it.</span></p> <p><span>“I stuck my neck out for that one,” Lenart said. “I was like, ‘I think this could be funny, we’ll see.’ I think even internally, folks who were used to the original version of the more linear bar fight also had some apprehension internally about it. It was taking a bet of like, ‘Do people think this is funny or really just dumb and annoying?’ I was stressing about that moment for, I don’t know, the last six or seven months. The first playthroughs I was watching, it was like, ‘okay, here we go.’ Then, seeing reactions being positive and people enjoying it, it was like, ‘Now, whatever happens with the rest of the season is fine.’</span></p> <p><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s eight-episode season is available now on PC and PlayStation 5.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-5-bar-fight-scene-making-of-song-prism-2000647373]]></content:encoded>

                <p>This may be the winter of discontent for some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> players. Activision has been notably quiet about the game's sales, and has yet to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">share metrics or statistics</a>. There's also been an uptick in anger from fans over conspiracy issues related to the game's Skill-Based Matchmaking mode. That's led Charlie Olson--the creator of CoD's SBMM--to directly address some of those concerns himself.</p><p>OIson--who spent a decade at Raven Software under Activision--shared a lengthy video on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpCmr8a9uuE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> channel that dives into how his SBMM is supposed to work. He also took the time to explain why Activision's announcement about bringing "open matchmaking" to Black Ops 7 didn't mean the game was dropping SBMM. If fans were expecting the chance to cut down inexperienced or casual players, they've been disappointed. Olson argues that it means the game has been dominated by "sweats," or experienced players, rather than rookie players.</p><p>"Some players are leaving because they thought this tweet meant SBMM had been completely removed from the game, and then they felt betrayed by the inclusion of one standard matchmaking playlist, and then blamed it for stealing 'fodder' from the open playlist," explained Olson. "What's really going on here is there aren't enough casual players at launch to make open matchmaking the pubstomp that was expected or promise. If open lobbies are sweaty, it's because it's mostly sweats playing."</p><p>He added that casual players are sticking with the modes they're comfortable with, and suggested players try open TDM playlists "if you're looking for noobs to stomp."</p><p>Olson went on to say that the "sweaty" open lobbies, longer wait times, degraded connections "are just trade-offs from bringing back persistent lobbies for launch, assuming they don’t want low-pop playlists to starve." He also predicted that the game's players will "get sweatier" and that he believes the game will mirror the cratering numbers of XDefiant. Olson even held out the possibility that Activision may switch to a two-year model for Call of Duty, rather rushing a new game out every year.</p><p>Black Ops 7 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-update-adds-disconnect-protection-for-endgame/1100-6536513/" data-ref-id="1100-6536513">received a small update</a> for its Endgame content this week, which also added disconnection protection.

<p>So long, dear SBLJ</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="997d9702e24cd"><a title="Super Mario 64" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/997d9702e24cd/super-mario-64.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> might be one of the most popular speedrun games of all time, and it's still absolutely huge. You'd think runners would know absolutely everything about this almost-30-year-old game, but recently, a brand new trick was discovered that will potentially change the nature of speedruns, particularly the 1 Star Speedrun, forever.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDIxb6FX3RU">Bubzia</a>, a speedrunner who specialises in blindfolded speedruns, has documented the discovery of this new technique that has essentially wiped out one of the most famous skips in the game, the side backwards long jump (SBLJ, as it's more commonly known), which is used to skip the 30-star door in the basement of Peach's Castle. It's incredibly tricky to pull off but it's been a staple in the community for years.</p>
<p>But two speedrunners — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FramePerfection">FramePerfection</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Crackhex">Crackhex</a> — have found a workaround that eliminates the need to even do this. Amusingly, it's been dubbed the "crackslide" by the community, and while the the original trick was created using emulation tools, runner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@haribo3937">haribo39</a> managed to recreate the trick.</p>
<p>You can see Bubzia demonstrating the trick at around <a href="https://youtu.be/IDIxb6FX3RU?si=e4dqY71OkuNwqUiY&amp;t=489">8:53 minutes in</a> (warning for strong language), and even he's surprised at how quickly he pulls it off.</p>

<p>Essentially, "all" you have to do is line yourself up against a particular wall in the basement, backflip up against it, butt slide on the railing next to the wall, and you'll be catapulted up to the door and, after some text, go through the wall.</p>
<p>While this is a <em>huge</em> discovery for the basic 1 Star run, it's especially big for blindfolded speedruns, a category which has been trying to crack the 10 minute mark for a while. Now, it could very well be possible.</p>
<p>Bubzia has already managed to get below 11 minutes while making a few big mistakes, and only a few seconds off the current world record. Sounds like Super Mario 64 speedruns are going to be <em>extremely</em> competitive.</p>
<p>If you want to have a crack at it yourself, then Bubzia has laid out all the steps in a <a href="https://youtu.be/IDIxb6FX3RU?si=OKXIMtr5X8wPU0J_&amp;t=814">tutorial at the end of his video</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Santa Ragione, the Italian indie studio co-founded by Pietro Righi Riva and responsible for beloved indies like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/916350/Saturnalia/">Saturnalia</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103680/Mediterranea_Inferno/?curator_clanid=6876205">Mediterranea Inferno</a>, is about to launch its latest title, Horses, on the Epic Games Store, GOG, the Humble Store, and Itch.io. It's not, however, coming to Steam, and for that reason, Horses might be Santa Ragione's last game.</p>



<p>That's not because Santa Ragione doesn't want to release it on Steam. It very much so does, and submitted the game well within the appropriate time frame. The problem is, as Pietro Righi Riva explains in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/santa-ragione-co-founder-pietro-righi-riva-on-horses-steam-and-possible-closure-of-the-studio">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, that Horses has been banned from Steam.</p>



<p>"<em>After review, we will not be able to ship your game Horses on Steam</em>," an automated message received by Santa Ragione reads, which was shared in the interview and <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/">on the game's website</a>. "<em></em><em>While we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we found that this title features themes, imagery, or descriptions that we won’t distribute. Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>While every product submitted is unique, if your product features this representation—even in a subtle way that could be defined as a ‘grey area’—it will be rejected by Steam. For instance, setting your game in a high school but declaring your characters are of legal age would fall into that category and be banned. This app has been banned and cannot be reused. Re-submissions of this app, even with modifications, will not be accepted</em>."</p>

<p>Valve has fallen entirely silent to Riva, and has not explained what scenes in the game it has an issue with. Riva also explained that when he first submitted Horses to Valve for approval, Valve requested that Riva send them a full build of the game so they could play through it in its entirety. Not only is this a rare occurrence, but at the time, the game was only half finished, meaning Riva had to rush to submit an unfinished version of the game that could, at the very least, allow Valve to play through an incomplete version of the final game.</p>



<p>Which is where Santa Ragione believes the ban came from. "<em>We think that the ban may have been triggered during the initial Steam submission by an incomplete scene on day six, in which a man and his young daughter visit the farm...What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag</em>."</p>



<p>Santa Ragione clarifies that the scene was changed since the initial submission, which was, again, an unfinished version of the game. It now depicts an adult woman in her twenties rather than a young girl, both "<em>to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of HORSES, works much better when delivered by an older character.</em>"</p>



<p>With the ban being permanent, and Santa Ragione likely unable to recoup the development costs of Horses without the game being available on Steam, it's likely that the studio will close after Horses is released, barring Horses becoming the best-selling game on other digital storefronts.</p>



<p>"<em>I don't want to make a final decision before seeing how the game does on launch. But if things go the way that I expect them to go, then I think [studio's closure] is inevitable</em>," said Riva in the interview. "<em>All the money we'll earn is gonna go to the author and to the people who have offered money to finish the project. So there will likely be no money left to make a new [game]… Unless a miracle happens and Horses does very well</em>."</p>



<p>Riva continued, "<em>It's always been meaningful seeing that our games resonated with people. We've always known that we never made a game that had mass appeal. So everyone who connected with our games, I feel personally connected to in a profound way. And if this is the last game that we get to make, I would tell them not to be sad, because it [is a game that] can stand on its own</em>."</p>



<p>Horses will release on PC on GOG, the Humble Store, the Epic Games Store, and Itch.io on December 2, 2025.</p>

<p>Below, you’ll find a list of the best Xbox Ally X accessories and add-ons available, from travel cases to screen protectors to thumb grips. Everything here is compatible with both the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. So, if you want to get more out of your system, these are the accessories worth checking out this year.</p>



<p>For even more holiday shopping guides, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a> for the best deals available.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-best-xbox-ally-x-accessories-for-2025">The Best Xbox Ally X Accessories For 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Anti-Glare Screen Protector</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the system costing $600-$1000, the first thing you should do is protect the most important part of the handheld: the screen. Available in a two-pack, these screen protectors retail <strong>for under $15</strong> and are made of tempered glass that cover the whole display.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>NINKI Silicone Skin</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to have some protection around the device without a big hard shell? This case might be just what you’re looking for. It’s form-fitting on the Ally X while offering added grip on the sides and protection around the system. It comes with a kickstand as well, allowing you to set it down nicely wherever you happen to be. You can pick up <strong>the case for $20.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Travel Case&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want a nice carrying case that can not only hold your Xbox Ally X handheld but the charger, stand, and more? This case features a compartment that is designed for carrying everything you need for the system. It’s <strong>less than $30</strong> and feels as durable as something two-to-three times the cost. It was one of the first thing’s purchased when the handheld came in and has gone on every trip since.</p>











<hr>



<p><strong>Docking Station</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This docking station from JSAUX has everything you need to hook up your Xbox Ally or Ally X to a TV or monitor. It features an HDMI 2.1 port for up to 4K at 120Hz as well as two USB-A 3.2 ports, a USB C 3.2 port, a fast-charging USB-C 100W port, and a gigabit ethernet port. The dock is <strong>on sale for $28</strong> now, but has a <strong>regular price of $40.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Thumb Grips</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the thumbsticks on the Xbox Ally X are solid, there are some that wish they had a bit of a different feel. These silicone grips help with slipping and moisture, and are <strong>available for under $12.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Samsung PRO Plus microSD</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You’ve seen this card in a lot of Insider Gaming’s holiday guides this year, and that’s for good measure. The Samsung PRO Plus MicroSD is the best one on the market for the price. This card offers read/write speeds up to around 180 MB/s for reading and 130 MB/s writing. The card starts at <strong>$26.99</strong> for 256GB but is also available in 512 GB for<strong> $49.99</strong> and <strong>$79.99</strong> for 1TB.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong><strong>Sony INZONE E9 Wired In-Ear Monitor</strong></strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another device you’ve seen countless times on these guides, the Sony INZONE E9 Wired In-Ear headphones are perfect for listening to what you want without interrupting anyone else. They connect via 3.5MM or USB-C port, and don’t have the problems of wearing a bulky headset just for sound. If you want gaming headset-level detail without wearing a bulky headset, these are a fantastic pick. They are on the pricey side <strong>at $149.99</strong>, but they can’t be recommended enough.</p>

Each deck contains a booster pack, too, so you’re really getting six in total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Lorcana now rotates sets.

We’re not going to list all of them here, it would take forever. But there are dozens of different games available; if you’re a collector of a particular game, chances are good you can find it on TCGplayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an in-depth filtering system that will allow you to get very specific about what you’re looking for, and those filters change depending on what product line you pick. For example, when you choose Pokémon, the other filters will change to target specific Pokémon card categories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So you can select things like holofoil or reverse holofoil, shiny rares, first edition, etc. And you can pick card types, like trainer, energy, or stadium. Or target specific sets, like World Championship Decks, Prismatic Evolutions, or Paldean Fates. You can make selections across all these categories at the same time and find only the cards that fit your filters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you only have one specific card in mind, you can always skip that whole process and just type it into the search bar.

          <p>It’s not a bad time to upgrade your gaming PC. Graphics card prices in the 2020s have undulated continuously as the industry has dealt with pandemic and AI-related shortages, but it’s actually possible to get respectable mainstream- to high-end GPUs like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/review-at-349-amds-16gb-radeon-rx-9060-xt-is-the-new-midrange-gpu-to-beat/">AMD’s Radeon RX 9060 XT</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-rdna-4-fixes-a-lot-of-amds-problems/">9070 series</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-and-5060-review-putting-the-mid-in-mid-range/">Nvidia’s RTX 5060</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-no-its-not-4090-performance-at-549/">5070</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review-more-like-a-4080-super-super/">5080 series</a> for at or slightly under their suggested retail prices right now. This was close to impossible through the spring and summer.</p>
<p>But it’s&nbsp;<em>not</em> a good time to build a new PC or swap your older motherboard out for a new one that needs DDR5 RAM. And the culprit is a shortage of RAM and flash memory chips that has suddenly sent SSD and (especially) memory prices into the stratosphere, caused primarily by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/perfect-storm-of-demand-and-supply-driving-up-storage-costs">the ongoing AI boom</a> and exacerbated by panic-fueled buying by end users and device manufacturers.</p>
<p>To illustrate just how high things have jumped in a short amount of time, let’s compare some of the RAM and storage prices listed in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/ars-technica-system-guide-back-to-pc-building-for-back-to-school/">our system guide from three months ago</a> to the pricing for the exact same components today. Note that several of these are based on the last available price and are currently sold out; we also haven’t looked into things <a href="http://These%20companies%20buy%20components%20in%20large%20quantities%20and%20they%20typically%20do%20so%20ahead%20of%20time,%20dulling%20the%20impact%20of%20the%20increases%20in%20the%20short-term.">like microSD or microSD Express cards</a>, which could also be affected.</p>

<p>In short, there’s no escaping these price increases, which affect SSDs and both DDR4 and DDR5 RAM kits of all capacities (though higher-capacity RAM kits do seem to be hit a little harder). If you’re thinking about an SSD upgrade, those increases haven’t become <em>too</em> ludicrous just yet, but if you were thinking about a RAM upgrade, your best bet is to hold on tight to whatever you already have and hope that nothing breaks any time soon.</p>

<p>Memory and storage shortages can be particularly difficult to get through. As with all chips, it can take years to ramp up capacity and/or build new manufacturing facilities. Not only do we need to meet today’s demand with supply levels that were decided years ago, but manufacturers also must try to decide tomorrow’s supply levels based on today’s demand. This was part of the problem during the pandemic-fueled chip shortages of 2021 and 2022—most companies weren’t prepared for the pandemic-fueled spike in demand for consumer tech, or for the lull in normal buying and upgrade patterns that followed (just look at PC sales, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/pc-sales-finally-saw-big-growth-in-2020-after-years-of-steady-decline/">went way up in 2020 and 2021</a>, then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/analysts-say-mac-sales-are-down-40-as-post-pandemic-pc-sales-slump-continues/">crashed for a while</a>, and then eventually returned to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/pc-gaming-market-is-set-to-grow-again-after-pandemic-and-overstock-corrections/">something resembling a normal pattern</a>).</p>
<p>And memory makers in particular may be slow to ramp up manufacturing capacity in response to shortages. If they decide to start manufacturing more chips now, what happens if memory demand drops off a cliff in six months or a year (if, say, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/googles-sundar-pichai-warns-of-irrationality-in-trillion-dollar-ai-investment-boom/">an AI bubble</a> deflates or pops altogether)? It means an <em>oversupply</em> of memory chips—consumers benefit from rock-bottom prices for components, but it becomes harder for manufacturers to cover their costs. Memory <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ssd-hdd-shortage-nand-market,33112.html">shortages</a> in <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/semiconductor-spending-hits-five-year-high-2017/">late 2016 and 2017</a>, for example, led to oversupply and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/DDR4-RAM-prices-continue-to-fall.415777.0.html">big price cuts</a> in 2018 and 2019, and some <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/04/25/memory_glut_savages_sk_hynix/">pretty awful earnings reports</a> for manufacturers like Samsung and SK Hynix.</p>
<p>The upshot is: Not only are memory prices getting bad <em>now</em>, but it’s exceptionally difficult to predict when shortage-fueled price hikes might end.</p>

<h2>It’s not just PC builders</h2>
<p>PC and phone manufacturers—and makers of components that use memory chips, like GPUs—mostly haven’t hiked prices yet. These companies buy components in large quantities, and they typically do so ahead of time, dulling the impact of the increases in the short-term. The kinds of price increases we see, and what costs are passed on to consumers, will vary from company to company.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports that Lenovo is “stockpiling memory and other critical components” to get it through 2026 without issues and that the company “will aim to avoid passing on rising costs to its customers in the current quarter.” Apple may also be in a good position to weather the shortage; analysts at <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4522911-morgan-stanley-downgrades-multiple-hardware-companies-due-to-surging-memory-prices">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-most-immune-to-memory-price-rises-others-more-impacted-bernstein-4373305">Bernstein Research</a> believe that Apple has already laid claim to the RAM that it needs and that its healthy profit margins will allow it to absorb the increases better than most.</p>
<p>Framework on the other hand, a smaller company known best for its repairable and upgradeable laptop designs, <a href="https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1993202082795733134">says</a> “it is likely we will need to increase memory pricing soon” to reflect price increases from its suppliers. The company has also <a href="https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1993202080744718609">stopped selling standalone RAM kits</a> in its online store in an effort to fight scalpers who are trying to capitalize on the shortages.</p>
<p>Tom’s Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-to-raise-graphics-card-prices-by-at-least-10-percent-in-2026-price-surge-attributed-to-ongoing-ai-related-dram-supply-crisis">reports</a> that AMD has told its partners that it expects to raise GPU prices by about 10 percent starting next year and that Nvidia <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-rtx-5000-super-could-be-cancelled-or-get-pricier-due-to-ai-induced-gddr7-woes-rumor-claims-3-gb-memory-chips-are-now-too-valuable-for-consumer-gpus">may have canceled a planned RTX 50-series Super launch entirely</a> because of shortages and price increases (the main draw of this Super refresh, according to the rumor mill, would have a bump from 2GB GDDR7 chips to 3GB chips, boosting memory capacities across the lineup by 50 percent).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ahead of the start of the season, Call of Duty League 2026 has revealed the maps and modes that will be present. Furthermore, a new mode will be added, Overload, spicing up the competition further.</p>







<p>With each new entry, the Call of Duty series has been a great multiplayer experience. Despite Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not doing so hot</a>, one can count on Activision and the teams doing well by the mode. Nothing, though, has said it better than in Esports. Last year, Optic Texas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-champs-optic-texas-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took home the championship</a>, with Mercules scoring MVP. With CDL 2026, it’s anyone’s game, especially with the addition of a brand-new mode to competition.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from <a href="https://x.com/CODLeague/status/1993347588654018822?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty League</a>, the full lineup of maps and modes for the 2026 season has been unveiled. Additionally, the full competitive rules and settings can be <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/competitive-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found here</a>. The full list of maps and modes can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hardpoint
<ul>
<li>Blackheart</li>



<li>Colossus</li>



<li>Den</li>



<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Scar</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Search &amp; Destroy
<ul>
<li>Colossus</li>



<li>Den</li>



<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Raid</li>



<li>Scar</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Overload (NEW)
<ul>
<li>Den</li>



<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Scar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>As mentioned before, Overload is a brand-new mode added to the Call of Duty League. From Black Ops 7, the 6×6 mode acts like Capture the Flag, as teams will try to get the Overload Device to a designated objective. It’ll be interesting to see how it evolves within the competitive scene. Either way, it’s definitely one to watch on December 5th-7th.</p>







<p>What do you think of CDL’s map and modes lineup? Excited to see Overload added to the modes? Which map do you think will be great for competition?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Already a major hit with record-breaking franchise sales, EA has kicked off a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Free Trial. This is live now and running from today, 25th November, until 2nd December at 4 a.m. PT (12 p.m. UTC)</p>
<p>To play the Free Trial, you need to download the free-to-play Battlefield REDSEC, which will have access to more modes and maps granted for the coming week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 | Free Trial Week" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NllG1jzar4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Battlefield 6 Free Trial features a subset of the maps and modes in the full game, putting an emphasis on the Season 1 content, and obviously doesn’t include the single player campaign (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/should-you-skip-the-battlefield-6-campaign/">but you can probably skip that</a>). Free-to-play players will get to check out&nbsp;Siege of Cairo, Blackwell Fields, and the newly released Eastwood, and get to try them out in modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, Team Deathmatch, and Sabotage.&nbsp;Of course, you also already have the free-to-play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/28/battlefield-redsec-is-the-long-rumoured-free-to-play-battle-royale-and-its-out-now/">Battlefield REDSEC battle royale mode</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, there’s already cross-pollination of unlocks and levels. Anything unlocked in REDSEC can be used in the Free Trial, and anything you unlock in the Free Trial is kept and carried through should you buy the full game.</p>

<p>The timing of this is pretty much perfect for EA to capitalise on the missteps made by their biggest rival, and as we head into the Thanksgiving holiday weekend in the US. It’s a great time to try and convince more people to join this shooter and not the other.</p>

			<p>A recent Windows Update, identified by the code KB5066835, has indeed caused substantial performance drops in PC games.</p>



<p>A few days ago, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-hotfix-driver-resolves-lower-performance-bug-windows-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new GeForce hotfix driver, version 581.94, following reports from several gamers of lower performance in some titles. Now, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/11/proof-that-recent-windows-update-harms-gaming-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has looked into the issue</a> and verified that, without the hotfix and with the aforementioned Windows Update, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows takes a major frame rate hit. In Digital Foundry's test, the game ran between 33% and 50% worse on a PC equipped with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and an Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU after installing that Windows Update. The GeForce hotfix resolves the situation, so you should definitely install it if you are currently playing the game. Another option would be to remove the Windows Update, but the existence of the hotfix makes this redundant.</p>



<p>Anyway, we have sent an inquiry to Microsoft to understand what happened here. It's not the first time a Windows Update creates issues in games, but to this extent, it is perhaps unheard of.</p>

<p>In other news, Assassin's Creed Shadows just received its 1.1.6 Title Update. It introduces a special collaboration with the Attack on Titan franchise, featuring a new time-limited quest that will only be available through December 22. Alongside the story quest, an Attack on Titan Dual Pack is also available for purchase from the in-game store. Drawing inspiration from the Attack on Titan universe, this pack will include outfits, weapons, trinkets, and a new mount.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A new regular side quest called A Puzzlement is also available. In this mission, protagonists Naoe and Yasuke will each learn a move from the other. Naoe will learn how to perform her own spectacular version of Yasuke's war kick ability, while Yasuke will learn how to dispatch enemies in a non-lethal, stealthy way.</p>



<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows, which Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently confirmed</a> has performed well so far, will launch next week on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Horses </em>is an upcoming narrative-driven horror game you’ve probably never heard of set to launch next month on the Epic Games Store, Humble Store, GOG, and Itch.io. But you won’t be able to find the creepy indie title on Steam, and the Italian studio behind <em>Horses</em> claims it doesn’t know why Valve is blocking the game from its PC storefront.</p> <p>On November 25, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/santaragione/">indie studio Santa Ragione</a> published a trailer for Horses that revealed the game’s December 2 release date. However, it also sports an interesting badge at the end claiming the game has been banned from Steam. <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html">At the same time the trailer went live, the studio updated its website</a> to include a lengthy FAQ about <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6ht5yj3ss23"><em>Horses</em> being banned from Steam</a>. It claims Valve has provided little clarity on what’s going on and that the whole situation could result in developer Santa Ragione, which made <a href="https://kotaku.com/2022-goty-underrated-hidden-gems-best-games-1849936105">2023’s excellent <em>Saturnalia</em></a>, shutting down entirely.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">Speaking with <em>IGN</em></a>, co-founder Pietro Righi Riva explained that in 2023, the studio submitted a request for a Steam Coming Soon page for <em>Horses</em>. However, Valve told the company to submit a playable build. “We were only about halfway through development and had scrambled together a build that could be played start to finish, solely to satisfy Steam’s request for a playable version to open a Coming Soon page, something we had never been asked for before,” Riva said. According to the studio, this is when Valve rejected <em>Horses</em> from being sold on Steam.</p>

  <p>But Santa Ragione was not told why <em>Horses</em> had been banned from Steam. The company’s FAQ claims Steam told the studio that <em>Horses</em> had been barred from the storefront because it found that it featured “<i>themes, imagery, or descriptions that [Steam] won’t distribute.”</i> The message also included a line that Valve won’t distribute games that contain content depicting “sexual conduct involving a minor” regardless of intention or if it is done in a “subtle way that could be defined as a ‘grey area.'”</p>

 <p>The studio called this explanation “deliberately vague and unfounded” and claimed that <em>Horses</em> does not contain any content that would fall into this so-called “grey area.” However, it did admit that initially a scenario in the game did involve a young kid riding on the shoulders of a naked woman in a mask, as horses in the game are depicted as naked people, but that scene has since been changed to remove the child.</p>

 <p>“Steam’s decision came without detailed feedback, and the ban notice did not cite any specific scenes or elements,” Riva told <em>IGN</em>. “For months, we repeatedly asked what triggered the ban and received no answer. We also offered, unsuccessfully, to change any content deemed unfit, especially since the game was still early in development at the time of submission.”</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted Valve, but didn’t hear back before publication.</p> <p>According to Santa Ragione, this ban has nothing to do with the ongoing and recent issues involving alleged pornographic games being removed from Steam due to bad-faith actors pressuring credit card companies and payment processors.</p>

 <p>Santa Ragione claims that <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam"><em>Horses</em> not being able to launch on Steam</a> could make it very difficult for the company to recoup development costs, and the studio admits that it might shut down in the near future. The developer has set aside funds to support Horses for around six months after launch, but beyond that, it is unsure of what the future holds, as being banned from Steam will keep <em>Horses</em> away from “<span data-testid="content-text">more than 75 percent of the PC gaming market.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><em>Horses</em> launches on basically every other PC gaming storefront besides Steam on December 4. It will cost $5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Ranked Play is at the top of the wishlist for many of you. After all, it’s where the best of the best prove they are above the rest. Black Ops 7 Ranked Mode release details are coming your way.</p>



<p>Ranked is a staple of any recent Call of Duty release. Eventually, traditional lobbies can only offer so much competition, and there needs to be something to grind for—outside of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer Camos</a>.</p>



<p>This is where Black Ops 7 and Ranked Mode go hand in hand.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-ranked-mode-coming-to-black-ops-7">When Is Ranked Mode Coming To Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Party like it’s 2025. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s been announced that Black Ops 7 is getting its long-awaited Ranked Mode in Season 2.</strong></p>



<p>This might come as disappointing news for those of you who want Ranked now. There are a few weeks to go until Ranked Play hits BLOPS 7. The devs have previously announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-7-season-2-maps-have-already-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2</a> will see the addition of Ranked Play for both of Activision’s main games: Black Ops 7 and Warzone.</p>



<p>You might be even more aggrieved to know that no one knows when in Season 2 it’s happening. It could be with the season’s launch, it could be midway through, or Treyarch could suddenly announce the day before.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates and announcements on Ranked Play coming to Black Ops 7. If you don’t have it already, you can always use <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">Insider Gaming to buy Black Ops 7 much cheaper</a>.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For those asking, Treyarch has previously confirmed Ranked Play for both Black Ops 7 MP and Warzone will launch with Season 02.</p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1993029985452671461?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-is-black-ops-7-ranked-play">What is Black Ops 7 Ranked Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Ranked Play is a competitive mode where your performances in Call of Duty matches determine your ranking, and good performances and wins are rewarded with skill points and promotions, whereas losing usually can result in demotions to inferior ranks.</strong></p>



<p>For example, in Black Ops 6, you had eight ranks to work your way through: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250. Think of it like a worst-to-best scale. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen if Black Ops 7 adopts the same ranks, names, and divisions, but this is usually how it works. Furthermore, certain maps, weapons, and equipment are restricted in Ranked. Treyarch will inflict limitations on various aspects of Black Ops 7, meaning you need to be adaptable and prove your skill at will.</p>



<p>Reasons for this include meta weapons, to stop everyone from defaulting to them.</p>



<p>Is Ranked something that should launch with CoD on day one? Are you impatient for Ranked Play right now?

To mark the expansion’s release next week on December 2, 2025, the team premiered the <em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em> launch trailer and a second ViDoc, “Making of a Renegade,” highlighting their creative process and collaboration with Lucasfilm Games to create an all-new <em>Destiny 2</em> experience with clear homage to <em>Star Wars</em>.</p><p>Renegades introduces an arsenal of new weapons and gear, including the Praxic Blade, <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s lightsaber-inspired kinetic Exotic Sword. This new weapon offers multiple customization paths that meaningfully impact gameplay, along with earnable cosmetics that alter the color of the blade. Renegades also debuts a new weapon archetype, Blasters, which features a heat-based firing and reload system that replaces traditional magazines.</p><p>New Exotics arriving with Renegades include:</p><ul><li><strong>Kinetic Sword</strong> – Praxic Blade (inspired by lightsabers)</li><li><strong>Solar Crossbow</strong> – Heirloom (inspired by Chewbacca’s iconic weapon)</li><li><strong>Strand Machine Gun</strong> – Service of Luzaku</li><li><strong>Warlock Helmet</strong> – Deimosuffusion</li><li><strong>Hunter Legs</strong> – Fortune’s Favor</li><li><strong>Titan Chest</strong> – Praxic Vestment</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>During the stream, members of the <em>Destiny 2</em> developer team dove deep into the Lawless Frontier, a new activity designed for replayability and scalable challenge.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie today offered a deep dive look at the new Destiny 2: Renegades release, which is scheduled to arrive for players next week, on December 2. The new major release for the game is an unusual one, as it’s rooted in a partnership with Star Wars. A quick look through the early visuals of the game don’t leave much room for doubt on that, as there are lots of things that look like lightsabers, stormtroopers, and villainous Sith.</p><p>But as today’s vidoc makes clear, Bungie is trying to thread a more nuanced line with this release that it first appears. While plenty of features may look like Star Wars, the team is going to great pains to make sure it remains a true and canon Destiny experience. Those aren’t lightsabers but rather Praxic Blades. Those aren’t stormtroopers but instead members of the surging Barant Imperium. And that’s not a Sith – it’s a dangerous new big bad named Dredgen Bael.</p>

<p>Whether the developer can pull off keeping those distinctions or not will be a matter to decide once we can play the game, but the early descriptions and footage offer good reason to be excited.</p><p>The storyline appears to focus strongly on Drifter as a central character, acting as a conduit into some of the criminal underworld of the solar system. With his scoundrel demeanor, Drifter pretty clearly nods a bit toward characters like Han Solo in the Star Wars fiction.</p><p>We also get to know a character that has been mentioned in the past in written lore entries for Destiny. Aunor Mahal is about as close as the game is likely to have to a Jedi, with her Praxic Blade that she is using to fight against Dredgen Bael.</p><p>Players will pledge to a faction and build up reputation as they fight across the Lawless Frontier, an explorable space with a dedicated social hub in the form of Tharsis Outpost. Factions include the anarchist Eliksni biker gang called The Pikers, the group of sentient Vex call the Tharsis Reformation, and the rogue Cabal called Totality Division. You’ll run jobs for these factions like smuggling, bounty hunts, and sabotage-focused missions.</p>

<p>While Aunor is shown in some pretty slick lightsaber-esque battles, NPCs aren’t the only people getting fun new Star Wars-themed toys to play with. Players will also be able to wield Praxic Blades, and will even be able to try out different fighting styles, very much like a Jedi. With the exotic primary, kinetic Praxic Blade, you can deflect attacks, melee attack enemies, and even throw. And, just to set clear expectations, Bungie has shared that the Praxic Blade won’t be unique to this content drop; it will continue to be a relevant weapon in future expansions to the game.</p><p>Renegades also introduces new Blasters inspired by Star Wars, including several distinct variants, from dynamic blasters that hit harder with brute force, to more fast-firing balanced blasters. Blasters overheat and must cool down, rather than have a traditional magazine reload. We also learned about a special solar exotic crossbow called Heirloom, inspired by Chewbacca’s weapon in the movies.</p><p>Players will also be able to pick up different “renegade abilities,” that seem in some way to tie together with the faction you work for.</p><p>Across all the new content Bungie showed off today, one of the features that stood out the most was the music. By drawing direct inspiration from the Star Wars scores, arguably some of the most extensively varied and beloved of all film music, the new Destiny themes that were part of this preview presentation were, quite simply, riveting. The Renegades experience may be worth returning to play if only to hear more of that great music in action.</p><p>There's plenty more to learn in the complete rundown. Check out the full vidoc below to get a comprehensive look at what Bungie is cooking up. Destiny 2 continues its march into the future with Renegades on December 2.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_07pVzO5no"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_07pVzO5no" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/25/bungie-shares-deep-dive-on-star-wars-inspired-destiny-2-renegades]]></content:encoded>

And if you ask fans, they might use a word like rivals.&nbsp;</p><p>I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, last month to visit Square Enix's Shibuya offices, play <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, and interview the team behind the remake for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined"><em>Game Informer's </em>latest cover story</a>. But as part of this trip, I interviewed Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii for 90 minutes about all kinds of topics, including the aforementioned competition between his franchise and Final Fantasy. He didn't call it "competition," as I did, but admits, "I was definitely paying attention to it."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Way back then, when Final Fantasy originally came out, I was definitely paying attention to it because it was something we needed to look out for," Horii tells me. "But there's one key difference that I really saw back then: the protagonists in the Final Fantasy titles, they speak a lot. Whereas for Dragon Quest, the key objective for [the games], or the experience it offers for the player, is that the player becomes the protagonist themselves.</p><p>"In Final Fantasy, you kind of observe the protagonist, but you're not necessarily becoming the protagonist in the games. So I thought that was a really interesting and stark difference between Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, but I didn't necessarily see them as a rival back then."&nbsp;</p><p>Horii says in Dragon Quest, protagonists don't "just start talking on their own."&nbsp;</p><p>"Final Fantasy, again, [the protagonists] just talk a lot," he continues. "I do like Final Fantasy, though.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/demonschool%E2%80%99s-credits-show-rest-of-games-industry-how-it%E2%80%99s-done.1364611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>It’s an <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-credits-battlefield/"><u>all too common story in the video game industry</u></a>: A developer spends months or years working on a game, the game comes out, and despite all the sleepless nights and stressful days, their name doesn’t even make the credits. Sometimes it’s the result of petty political squabbles; other times, companies are trying to quietly incentivize workers to stick around until a project’s completion, <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129?ref=aftermath.site"><u>even though they might be dissatisfied</u></a> with pay, crunch, or other conditions. Consider <em>Demonschool</em>, the newly released <em>Persona</em>-inspired tactics RPG from Necrosoft, a course correction.</p><p>Despite a relatively small core dev team, <em>Demonschool </em>lists all 145 people who contributed to it in any capacity over the course of its multi-year development cycle. Not only that, its credits explain, in an uncommon amount of detail, what each developer’s respective work on the project entailed. For example, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3m6fuipkh4k2u?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the credits describe</u></a> Brent Porter, the game’s 3D art lead, as having done “most of the 3D modeling and rigging as well as creating most backgrounds. Also developed the lighting scheme and the visual style used in tiling and texture work. Created a number of the 2D battle and NPC sprites and visual effects, as well as preproduction concept art, including determining the final proportions of battle characters.”</p><p><em>Demonschool </em>director Brandon Sheffield told Aftermath that he’s been chewing on how to solve the crediting issue since the completion of Necrosoft’s last game, <em>Hyper Gunsport</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We worked [on <em>Hyper Gunsport</em>] with a localization company that refused to give the names of the people that actually did the work; they just wanted to have their company name in there,” Sheffield said. “They say they do that because ‘It's the standard’ and ‘to avoid poaching’ or whatever, but I hate that and think it's total BS. … I've also seen a lot of folks complain about how they weren't credited on a game because they'd left the studio before the game they worked on was finished. And indeed, our lead 3D artist left two years ago. But he's still the first artist credited because he set the style and visual tone for a lot of the game. Not working on the game to the very end doesn't negate the work he did.”</p><blockquote>"Our lead 3D artist left two years ago. But he's still the first artist credited because he set the style and visual tone for a lot of the game."</blockquote><p>The more Sheffield thought about how to meet the needs of so many different types of contributors – and discussed the matter on social media – the more a comprehensive, detail-oriented approach to crediting started to make sense.</p><p>“That had all been percolating in the back of my mind as we got close to finishing, and then it just sort of hit me as it came time for me to write the credits,” he said. “I discussed this approach with the team and everyone was fine with it, so we just went for it. We always want to credit everyone that touched the game, so even though the core team was 7 or 8 people at any given time, we credited around 145 people in <em>Demonschool</em>. Who cares if it's a lot of people? Who cares if it's long? They all did something and they deserve credit. And you basically can tell who the core team was by reading the descriptions. None of us are precious about that anyway.”</p><p>This resulted in some developers getting credited on an individual basis for the first time in their careers: “We made sure to ask every partner we worked with to give us every name of everybody who touched the game,” said Sheffield. “In the case of Bit Egg out of Thailand, they told me this was going to be the first actual credit for some of their staff.”</p><p>Sheffield hopes that providing greater detail than a simple title helps both players and prospective employers understand exactly what goes into a game’s development.</p><p>"We wanted to do this for a few reasons: One is that you don't usually know what a title means by itself,” he said. “Take ‘Artist.’ OK, what kind of art? What part of the game was that art in? It's useful for players to know that if they're interested in game development. But also say one of these people wants to get hired somewhere and is using <em>Demonschool </em>on their resume. Now everything they did is in the credits clear as day. ‘I created several of the enemy sprites and animations’ is more descriptive and useful than ‘I did some pixel art.’ And now what you've done is supported directly by the credits."</p><blockquote>“Take ‘Artist.’ OK, what kind of art? What part of the game was that art in? It's useful for players to know that if they're interested in game development."</blockquote><p>Sheffield is unsure if Necrosoft is the first studio to approach credits this way. He hopes someone else has at least done something similar. Regardless, he doesn’t think there’s anything <em>stopping </em>other studios from following in <em>Demonschool</em>’s footsteps – even if they wind up needing to credit substantially more people.&nbsp;</p><p>“I know in a Ubisoft game, something like this would be unwieldy, but maybe [if you did it] just for the core team of 300 or so?” Sheffield said. “If we can do this for 145 people to varying degrees of detail, a team with 100x the resources can do it for their core team of 300.”</p><p>So far, said Sheffield, the response to <em>Demonschool</em>’s credits has been exceedingly positive.</p><p>“I've mostly gotten responses from game developers saying they like how the credits are done, but I've seen a few things from players too – like ‘So that's what a game director does’ or generally just feeling like they're getting a look behind the scenes when they read this stuff,” said Sheffield. “A few people have asked questions in our Discord or Bluesky like ‘Who did all the art of the demon fish [in the fishing minigame]?’And other players can just answer them right away: ‘Oh, it's in the credits, that was Gustav Samuelson.’ I just think that's neat.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-credits-battlefield/"><div><p>Everyone Who Worked On A Video Game Needs To Be In The Credits - Aftermath</p><p>I am once again asking you to respect people’s time and work</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>
