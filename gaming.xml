Since two of the three main modes are objective-based, you’re likely to run into multiple enemies simultaneously. The last thing you want to happen is to die as soon as you pull up. To combat this, always stay with your friends and push up together. This will increase your chances of surviving the bigger fights throughout the game.</p><h2 id="h14697"><a id=""></a><strong>Spawns reset</strong></h2><p>One thing that’s fun about <em>Space Marine 2</em> multiplayer is that it has old-school spawns—that means both teams will spawn on opposite ends of the current map. If you ever get spawn trapped, don’t worry, because as the game continues spawns will gradually reset to help combat this. But if you are the one spawn camping, keep this in mind, too.</p><h2 id="h14698"><a id=""></a><strong>Look up more</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-recommend-id="image://475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-recommend-id="image://475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Always take the time to look up while fighting. Because more times than not, you’ll find an Assault class up in the air, building up the strength to kill you. If they land, they’ll inflict enough damage to turn the tide of that battle.</p><h2 id="h14699"><a id=""></a><strong>Melee damage cuts through shields</strong></h2><p>One of the things that makes melee attacks so dangerous is that they ignore shields altogether. The second you’re hit with one, your HP will automatically be affected by this, and your shields will remain the same (unless you’re being shot at, too).</p><h2 id="h14700"><a id=""></a><strong>Find ammo boxes</strong></h2><p>Once you spawn in, you won’t be able to pick up ammo from fallen players. But it’s not all doom and gloom, because every map has ammo boxes scattered around. These won’t completely refill your ammo, but they’ll give you enough to get back into the fight.</p><h2 id="h14701"><a id=""></a><strong>You only get one grenade</strong></h2><p>Each time you spawn, you can only have one grenade at a time. So, if you plan on using it, make sure it’s worth it—you won’t be getting another one until you spawn back.</p><h2 id="h14702"><a id=""></a><strong>Spam your abilities</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-recommend-id="image://bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-recommend-id="image://bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In most online games, when shooters have special abilities, you need to be smart when using them. But that is not the case when it comes to <em>Space Marine 2</em>. You will be fully charged and ready to go the second you spawn in, to the point where you’re encouraged to run into battle with your ability activated—that’ll definitely help give you the upper hand.</p><h2 id="h14703"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s okay to give up ground</strong></h2><p>Now and then, you may find yourself stuck when trying to capture the objective, because the enemy team is holding it down. If that’s the case, giving up the objective is sometimes okay—this will give you and your team plenty of time to get to the next zone without much of a fight.</p><h2 id="h14704"><a id=""></a><strong>Be open to changing classes mid-game</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-recommend-id="image://cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-recommend-id="image://cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sometimes, you’ll find yourself in a game and make no progress. If you find yourself dying repeatedly, it’s probably a sign that you should change classes and try something new. Your current class just isn’t working right now.</p><h2 id="h14705"><a id=""></a><strong>Bulwark shields absorb a lot of damage</strong></h2><p>Bulwarks are extremely useful because, on top of being able to heal up teammates, their shields can absorb almost anything thrown at them, including grenades. This is great, especially if you’re trying to capture a zone. You can have them run up the field and take all the damage.</p><h2 id="h14706"><a id=""></a><strong>Learn melee combos</strong></h2><p>It’s crucial to take the time to learn the melee combos. If you and another enemy are going blow for blow, and you’re spamming basic attacks, they’ll win that fight every time. If you’re unsure of how to perform a combo, pause the game (not mid-fight, obviously!), and you’ll be shown which buttons you need to press.</p><h2 id="h14707"><a id=""></a><strong>Vanguard ziplines can be used to travel</strong></h2><p>The Vanguard zip attack can also be used to travel across the map. If you find yourself on the verge, you can easily escape with the zipline, and on top of that, it can also be used to reach harder places that you couldn’t get to otherwise.</p><h2 id="h14708"><a id=""></a><strong>Assault classes should never be on the ground</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-recommend-id="image://5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-recommend-id="image://5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Assault class has the quickest rechargeability rate out of all of them. This makes sense because their class is built around making aerial attacks. With that in mind, when playing Assault, you should rarely be on the ground, because you’ll have a low amount of armor and no useful skills.</p><h2 id="h14709"><a id=""></a><strong>Use the camera to your advantage</strong></h2><p>Use the camera angles to your advantage! Aiming the camera correctly allows you to look over certain areas without exposing yourself to the enemy. (No, not like <em>that</em>. Grow up.) It gives you the edge. (Stop it.)</p><hr><p>Armed with this information, you should start to get the upper hand when playing <em>Space Marine 2</em> multiplayer.

<p>Game streaming platform Antstream Arcade is the next company in the industry to suffer a round of layoffs.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/antstream-arcade-makes-small-number-of-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the company points to the “very challenging period” in the games industry as well as a “strategic shift” within the company as reasons for the layoffs.</p>



<p>“The games industry is currently facing a very challenging period,” the statement reads. “Due to a strategic shift in focus internally, we have made the difficult decision to make a small number of redundancies within the Antstream Arcade team.</p>



<p>“This decision was not made lightly, and we will be working to support those affected throughout the process. Antstream Arcade remains dedicated to delivering the best possible experience to our players.”</p>



<p>“I have the sad news that I have been made redundant,” PR and communications manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7246812630252752897/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Diane Hutchinson wrote</a> on LinkedIn. “I have enjoyed the time I’ve been with Antstream and appreciate everyone that welcomed me to the company.</p>



<p>Antstream Arcade <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-set-to-get-1300-classic-games-with-antstream-arcade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently launched on PlayStation 5</a> and PlayStation 4 in September. The platform brings over 1,300 classic games to players via a subscription service.</p>



<p>The number of employees affected by the layoffs is not yet known. As of writing, roughly <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13,000 jobs have been lost</a> across nearly 150 companies in the games industry in 2024. </p>

The studio, which is focused on creating content that “pushes the boundaries of storytelling and game design,” is currently developing an “entirely original new game.” <span id="more-919393"></span></p><p>The studio also announced that it has secured its first round of financing, led by major publisher <a title="Companies > KRAFTON [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/krafton">KRAFTON</a>, and with participation from <a title="Platforms > Xbox [24,910 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> co-creator Ed Fries’ 1Up Ventures.</p><p>“When I first fell in love with video games at the start of my career, I saw the power of this new medium to tell stories never told before and create worlds that could transform people,” said Christian Cantamessa in a press release. “Day 4 Night is a return to that innovative spirit, to that innocence, to that unbridled creativity.”</p><p>Davide Soliani added, “What we are <a title="Genres > Crafting [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> at Day 4 Night is a reflection of everything I’ve ever wanted to experience as a player – joy, <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,797 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, poetry, <a title="Genres > Action [2,222 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, wonder, and the pleasure of working with friends. It’s a lullaby for my soul and a serenade to our industry, to the magic and the madness of creating worlds from nothing. It’s a story about triumphs, challenges, dreams, to light the path we walk together.”</p><p>Cantamessa and Soliani are joined by co-founders Cristina Nava, Gian Marco Zanna, and Luca Breda, who previously worked on major franchises including <em>Mario + Rabbids</em>, <em>Just Dance</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and <em>Star Wars</em>.</p><p>“Day 4 Night’s pitch presented a highly engaging and captivating story,” said KRAFTON vice president and head of corporate development Maria Park. “The game’s vision stands out as both original and creative, making it a great match for the type of studios we aim to support at KRAFTON. It aligns well with our mission to ‘Scale up the Creative.'”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>1Up Ventures’ Ed Fries said, “When you see a lot of pitches, like we do, it’s always incredibly fun when you get to hear an idea that’s completely new and original. This was easily the most creative thing we have seen in quite some time.”</p><p>Visit the studio’s official website <a href="https://www.d4nstudios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/bazzite-is-a-wonderful-steamos-ish-port-for-lots-of-non-valve-handhelds/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>I was on vacation last week, the kind of vacation in which entire days had no particular plan. I had brought <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">the ROG Ally X</a> with me, and, with the review done and Windows still annoying me, I looked around at the DIY scene, wondering if things had changed since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/">my last foray into DIY Steam Deck cloning</a>.</p>
<p>Things had changed for the better. I tried out <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a>, and after dealing with the typical Linux installation tasks—activating the BIOS shortcut, turning off Secure Boot, partitioning—I had the Steam Deck-like experience I had sought on this more powerful handheld. Since I installed Bazzite, I have not had to mess with drivers, hook up to a monitor and keyboard for desktop mode, or do anything other than play games.</p>
<p>Until Valve officially <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/valves-bespoke-steam-deck-os-will-be-officially-available-on-asus-rog-ally/">makes SteamOS available for the ROG Ally</a> and (maybe) other handhelds, Bazzite is definitely worth a look for anyone who thinks their handheld could do better.</p>

      Bazzite says that you can swap an SD card full of games between any two systems running Bazzite. This kind of taunting possibility is very effective on people like me.

<h2>More game platforms, more customization, same Steam-y feel</h2>
<p>There are a few specific features for the ROG Ally X tossed into Bazzite, and the Linux desktop is Fedora, not Arch. Beyond that, it is like SteamOS but better, especially if you want to incorporate non-Steam games. Bazzite bakes in apps like <a href="https://lutris.net/">Lutris</a>, <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl">Heroic</a>, and <a href="https://www.junkstore.xyz/">Junk Store</a>, which Steam Deck owners often turn to for loading in games from Epic, GOG, itch.io, and other stores, as well as games with awkward Windows-only launchers.</p>
<p>You don't even need to ditch Windows, really. If you're using a handheld like the ROG Ally X, with its 1TB of storage, you can <a href="https://docs.bazzite.gg/General/Installation_Guide/dual_boot_setup_guide/">dual-boot Bazzite and Windows</a> with some crafty partition shrinking. By all means, check that your game saves are backed up first, but you can, with some guide-reading, venture into Bazzite without abandoning the games for which you need Windows.</p>
<p>Perhaps most useful to the type of person who owns a gaming handheld and also will install Linux on it, Bazzite gives you powerful performance customization at the click of a button. Tap the ROG Ally's M1 button on the back, and you can mess with Thermal Design Power (TDP), set a custom fan curve, change the charge limit, tweak CPU and GPU parameters, or even choose a scheduler. I most appreciated this for the truly low-power indie games I played, as I could set the ROG Ally below its standard 13 W "Silent" profile down to a custom 7 W without heading deep into Asus' Armoury Crate.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/luke-said-to-tell-you-about-my-mandolin.999909/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/oh-no-a-mandolin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the end of yesterday’s Aftermath staff meeting, as we all said the things we were going to do afterwards–primarily having breakfast or dinner, depending on our timezones–I said I was excited to go play my new mandolin. Luke asked what a mandolin was, and as I revved up for my eager answer, he said to put it in a blog instead. So here we are.</p><p>I bought a mandolin! What is a mandolin? For starters, confusingly, it’s not <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-a-kitchen-mandoline-2216598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a food slicer</a>. Instead, it’s like if someone made a ukulele out of two violins. It’s a small instrument that for some reason has a copy of each of its four strings, for a total of eight strings you have to tediously tune and then somehow play together.</p><p>You’ll remember that I took up the <a href="https://aftermath.site/learning-new-stuff-as-an-adult-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ukulele</a> in February, after years of sucking at the guitar. I <em>love</em> the ukulele, whose size and approachability have opened up a world of cool new music styles and things for me to learn. The ukulele has a bit of a reputation for being a simple or limited instrument, though many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYhcN8p4yhg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtuosic</a> players have proven that untrue. While the things I haven’t learned how to do on the ukulele yet will last me the rest of my life, I did work my way to its edges by accident, by getting into bluegrass and Irish music on it.</p><p>The ukulele isn’t a common instrument in those styles, and while there are lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e5sR9klt48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr-ddFZVrtE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arranging</a> for them, it’s not quite up to the task. I went to some Irish and bluegrass jams, or group playing sessions, and while they were tolerant and even welcoming of me and my ukes, it was a bit of a forced fit. To play some of the cool tunes I heard, I’d either have to transpose their keys–which would mean I couldn’t play what everyone else was playing–or move around the fretboard in a way that became challenging and impractical. This is totally doable–there was a very talented banjo uke player at the bluegrass jam–but I started thinking how nice it would be to play an instrument that was more, well, normal. (Well, “normal.”)</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Green Cake - Irish tune on banjo mandolin, written by Jonathan Berkahn" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GkG_GjArA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>We played this song at the Irish jam and I totally fell in love with it. You can see how on this guy’s banjo mandolin (an instrument I am not going to buy, I swear!) he doesn’t leave first position. When I tried to arrange it on my ukulele, I found myself moving all around the fretboard to work around the ukulele’s range and tuning. Not ideal.</figcaption></figure></div><p>So enter the mandolin: small enough to still have some of the qualities I love in the ukulele, but an instrument that suits the kind of music I’m excited to play better. It’s also an instrument my <em>actual</em> musician friends don’t wrinkle their noses at. After months of researching “best beginner mandolin” like a <a href="https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scammy SEO site’s</a> dream, and after biting the bullet on ordering an instrument <a href="https://www.elderly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online</a>, I spent all of yesterday staring out the window for the FedEx truck until my mandolin arrived.</p><p>There are already some, let’s call them, challenges. For one, since you have to play with a pick, it is very loud. This is bad because <em>jesus christ I am </em>awful <em>at it.</em> While I was immediately able to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5di4lbkStE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play</a></em> the ukulele, given its light strings and basic similarity to the guitar, the mandolin is just familiar enough to make me feel like I <em>should</em> be able to play it while being different enough that I can’t play it at all. Its design makes its weight weird and the instrument hard to hold. The fretboard is hella tiny even for my tiny hands, making it easy to hit the wrong notes and challenging to move between strings. Pressing two strings at once simply should not be a thing a person has to do. My goal last night was “make the right noise come out,” a goal I did not accomplish by the time I forced myself to put it away to not torture my neighbors. I’ve watched some people’s mandolin progress videos on YouTube and will admit to thinking “that’s <em>really</em> how you sound after four months of playing?” but oh no I get it now. This thing is tough.</p><p>This is all fine and normal and what learning an instrument <em>is</em>, especially when I’ve only had it for a few hours, but it’s definitely going to take a lot of practice to get to a point where I can even think about playing actual songs on it. It’s humbling to be so thoroughly bested, but also kind of nice: I can just worry about the very basics for now, knowing that once I have them down, there’s an exciting new world of music to explore. I am determined to never use<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> tablature</a> on the mandolin, figuring out how to map my music-reading ability to a fretted instrument so I can use the wealth of <a href="https://thesession.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sheet music</a> out there instead of constantly googling “[song name]+tab.” And I’d like to focus on my scales and ear-training so I can actually play at the jams the way other people do.</p><p>So to answer Luke’s question of “what is a mandolin,” it is a bad but exciting choice I have made that hopefully neither I nor my neighbors will come to regret. It is another addition to the corner of my small apartment I call “the ukulele chair,” which is where I keep all my instruments and music. It is very pretty to look at and, so far, distinctly un-pretty to play. Once I’m better at it, hopefully it will be an excuse to get out of the house and meet new people. If you have tips for how I can stop sucking at it as quickly as possible, please let me know. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Thus far, there are ten day-and-date releases slated for this month, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, one of the most highly anticipated games of the month. NCSOFT's title, THRONE AND LIBERTY, was also released earlier this week, and the game is now accessible in the cloud. THRONE AND LIBERTY is a free-to-play MMORPG where players can explore the world of Solisium, with a class-free weapon-based combat system featuring massive-scale PvP and PvE battles, alongside transformation abilities that allow the player to turn into various creatures for tactical advantage.</p>

			<p>So far, Blizzard has stayed quiet about the Diablo IV season which will go live alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-goes-live-october-8-heres-how-to-prepare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred expansion</a>, but that has now changed with the unveiling of Hatred Rising on the latest<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk2oJC-yX4Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pre-launch developer update live stream</a>.</p>
<p>The background story is that Mephisto's unbridled hatred has made manifest the Realmwalkers, colossal monsters that were so far just the subject of tavern tales. Upon spawning, Realmwalkers can threaten an entire region, spewing nightmares born of hatred from the portal fused into their bodies. Once charged, they will begin stalking the Region for sacred ground. Realmwalkers are invulnerable during this phase, but fearsome Bloodbound Guardians will rush to protect them during their wandering phase. Diablo IV players must kill them to remove chunks of the Realmwalker's health. When the Realmwalkers arrive at the ritual site, they'll slam into the ground, creating three Hatred Spires around him. Dismantle these quickly and make the Realmwalkers vulnerable before they gain too much power.</p>
<p>Blizzard has shared the spawning schedule, too. A Realmwalker will spawn in a region every 15 minutes, alternating locations each time. Once every hour, a second Realmwalker will spawn in Nahantu (the region of Vessel of Hatred), in addition to spawning somewhere in Estuar. Moreover, the first Realmwalker spawned each hour in Estuar will be a Whisper. Every three hours, the Realmwalker spawned in Nahantu will be a Whisper.</p>
<p>Upon defeating a Realmwalker, Diablo IV players will have to go on the offensive, leaping into the portal to the so-called Seething Realm. These are dungeons filled with monsters to slay and treasures to claim. Players must go through the dungeon to find the Realm Gate. Once there, they'll be presented with a choice of materials to offer. Select the Seething Opal you wish to receive as a reward for the dungeon's completion.</p>
<p>A Seething Opal is a new type of elixir that provides a 15% experience boost and other bonuses for 30 minutes. There are a total of 5 Seething Opals:</p>
<p>Seething Opal of Equipment: 25 Murmuring Obols<br>
Swirling Opal of Materials: 5 Murmuring Obols<br>
Swirling Opal of Torment: 200 Sigil Powder<br>
Swirling Opal of Gold: 1 lump of iron<br>
Swirling Opal of Socketables: 3 Angel Breath</p>
<p>Note that the Seething Opal of Torment can only be obtained when playing on Torment Difficulty I or higher. Moreover, the Seething Opal of Socketables cannot be acquired unless you own the Vessel of Hatred expansion and play on Penitent Difficulty or higher in a Nahantu-based Seething Realm dungeon.</p>

<p>The Hatred Rising season of Diablo IV introduces a new quest from the Zakarum Remnants. Players can visit Crusader Damond in Zarbinzet, Hawezar, to start the Creeping Hatred quest, where they'll learn how to annihilate Realmwalkers and harness the arcane power of the Seething Realms to acquire useful Seething Opals. To begin this quest, players must have either completed the final quest in the base game's campaign—Legacy of the Horadrim—or opted to skip the base game's main questline. The Zakarum Remnants are also tied to a new Reputation system. Defeating Realmwalkers will help you improve your Reputation with this faction to get useful rewards.</p>
<p>With any new Diablo IV season, there's also a season journey and Battle Pass. This one starts on October 7 at 4 PM Pacific Time and hosts 90 Reward Tiers (28 Free Tiers and 62 Premium Tiers). The Smoldering Ashes earned from the Free Tiers can be spent on Season Blessings, which provide helpful bonuses in fighting back the armies of Hell. There are three new Blessings for Season of Hatred Rising:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn of Opals: Increases the chance of receiving an additional Seething Opal reward after completing a Seething Realm.</li>
<li>Urn of Remnants: Increase the rate at which you gain reputation from the Zakarum Remnant.</li>
<li>Urn of Curiosities: Increase the chance of receiving a second item when purchasing from the Purveyor of Curiosities.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>Getting the Premium Battle Pass will not only provide the rewards of the Free Tiers, but Soul Drinker’s Armor Set, Platinum, and more also await purchasers, including the Steed of Viz-Jun Present Mount, Curse of Viz-Jun Present Mount, and Ravenous Soul Mount Trophy, which unlocks at Tier 90. The Accelerated Seasonal Battle Pass also contains 20 Tier Skips and the Creeping Hollows Emote.</p>

The series has spanned over two dozen games and five timelines, but because the series is jumping between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-nintendo-breath-of-the-wild-timeline-1851637896&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-nintendo-breath-of-the-wild-timeline-1851637896">its codified continuities</a></span>, the three Triforce bearers are some of the only constants throughout most of the games. So what about all the weirdos and allies Link meets on all his different journeys and in all his different forms? Most of them only last for one game, but even as fans have left them behind with each new entry, they’ve left a lasting impression. Here are some of our favorite <em>Zelda</em> side characters from over the years.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-recommend-id="image://c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1597" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anju and Kafei hug it out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anju and Kafei hug it out." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-recommend-id="image://c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1597" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anju and Kafei hug it out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Anju and Kafei are so beloved because of how involved the player must be in their lives throughout <em>Majora’s Mask</em>. The couple was meant to be married before Kafei disappeared, after being turned into a child by the mischievous Skull Kid. You spend entire in-game days trying to bridge the gap between the two lovebirds while one is too embarrassed to be seen in his cursed form. This includes delivering messages between them, helping them rebuild a bridge, and leaving them with hope that the curse can be lifted. Through all your efforts, the two are reunited and the credits imply that the curse has been broken and Kafei has returned to his adult form. Sadly, we never actually see him as an adult, as their wedding is shown from Kafei’s first-person perspective, but he seems to be much taller. Link’s an excellent wingman. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-recommend-id="image://67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Midna in Super Smash Bros." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Midna in Super Smash Bros." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-recommend-id="image://67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Midna in Super Smash Bros." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Midna, the titular Twilight Princess, had some big shoes to fill as Link’s traveling companion after games like <em>Ocarina of Time </em>had solidified Navi as one of the most recognizable side characters in the series. At first, she is a sassy, demanding character who mostly accompanies Link as a means to accomplish her own goals. While she’s a manipulative opportunist for much of the early game, as Midna and Link grow closer throughout their journey, she’s unable to keep the facade up. Midna has a duty to herself and her people, but finds room in her heart for someone she originally viewed as just a tool to get her way. The gradual softening of her thorny exterior makes her one of the most rewarding characters to see through to the end.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-recommend-id="image://c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2693" data-height="1514" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Link sails on the King of Red Lions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Link sails on the King of Red Lions." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-recommend-id="image://c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2693" data-height="1514" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Link sails on the King of Red Lions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mida and Navi are great, but easily Link’s best traveling companion over the years is the King of Red Lions. The dragon-like talking ship is intimately intertwined with every moment you spend in <em>Wind Waker</em>’s flooded version of Hyrule. He gets you where you need to go, provides meaningful commentary and perspective, and is a constant shoulder to lean on during the darkest times. His friendship with Link is the heart and soul of <em>Wind Waker</em>, but it grows into so much more, as it’s revealed that he is actually the long-lost king of Hyrule. He has watched his kingdom fall throughout <em>Wind Waker</em>, and though he’s haunted by its past, he does all he can,to help guide it to a better future. As an ally to Link, he is without peer. As a symbol of the cyclical nature of <em>Zelda</em> series seeking to free its heroes from the lives they’ve been forced to relive, he is a memorable figurehead within the franchise.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-recommend-id="image://5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-format="jpg" data-width="812" data-height="456" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groose points at Link." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groose points at Link." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-recommend-id="image://5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-format="jpg" data-width="812" data-height="456" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groose points at Link." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Link’s rival in the Wii’s <em>Skyward Sword</em> is a delight. He gives big “dumb jock” energy in the game’s early hours, seemingly out of jealousy that Zelda fancies our hero more than him. But watching him go from a bully to a hero himself is one of the highlights of the divisive, motion-control-driven game. He’s a source of drama, levity, and humor, but he also has a lot of heart to go along with it. Groose makes a meh game better.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-recommend-id="image://05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Champions take a group photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Champions take a group photo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-recommend-id="image://05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Champions take a group photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every time you learn about the Champions in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, it feels like a gut punch. These memorable heroes are all gone by the time you get to know them, and each of them had their own hopes, dreams, and responsibilities as they fought to protect Hyrule from Calamity Ganon’s destruction. Every memory you find in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is tinged with melancholy as you see the gusto and vigor the Champions had in their hearts as they prepared to fight the Calamity just for them be stomped out in its wake.</p><p><em>Breath of the Wild</em> is full of tragedy, but just because the Champions were defeated doesn’t mean their wishes have been completely wiped away. Link takes pieces of them with him when he remembers their time together and when he uses one of their abilities to defeat Calamity Ganon. Their hopes live on in the people still here, and by the end of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, it’s thanks to them that the day is won. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-recommend-id="image://f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beedle carries his wares on his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Beedle carries his wares on his back." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Game Rant</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-recommend-id="image://f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beedle carries his wares on his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nintendo has etched Beedle’s voice into the minds of millions. The recurring shopkeeper who first debuted in <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em> has appeared in several games over the past 20 years, and his exuberant and expressive sound bites have been a backdrop of so many rupee transactions that they’ve taken on a memetic life of their own. Who among us doesn’t still hear his excited “thank you!” in their head from time to time? Beedle has persisted throughout the years, and is even a shopkeeper in <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. As a traveling salesman, he’s seen some shit now, and his hollerin’ has only gotten louder.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-recommend-id="image://3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-format="jpg" data-width="770" data-height="432" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tingle in Hyrule Warriors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tingle in Hyrule Warriors." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-recommend-id="image://3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-format="jpg" data-width="770" data-height="432" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tingle in Hyrule Warriors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of flamboyant recurring characters, Tingle hasn’t been around lately, and I’m torn on whether that’s a relief or a shame. The <em>Zelda </em>series’ most recognizable little freak started out as a map salesman in <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, then went on to be one of the few characters that persists through multiple games. He’s known for his excited, obnoxious behavior, nickel-and-diming Link at every turn, and for the way Nintendo keeps putting him in games even though no one really likes him.</p><p>This little king got his own <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fans-have-finally-translated-the-most-recent-tingle-gam-1821755765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fans-have-finally-translated-the-most-recent-tingle-gam-1821755765">spin-off series during the DS era</a></span>, though the games never made their way to the States. Honestly, kudos to him for sticking around even when people were mad about him. I have to give flowers for persistence. Though his appearances have been fewer and farther between as years have gone on, he’s still a mainstay of the extended <em>Zelda</em> universe in things like <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-recommend-id="image://06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Navi talks to Sheik and Impa." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Navi talks to Sheik and Impa." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-recommend-id="image://06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Navi talks to Sheik and Impa." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like Tingle, whether or not someone thinks Navi is annoying or a staple of the <em>Zelda</em> franchise depends on who you ask. The fairy is Link’s traveling companion in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, and her catchphrase “Hey, listen!” is embedded in gaming culture—someone you know has that as their text tone on their phone, while others would probably roll their eyes if they heard it. As her name implies, Navi is your navigator, your right hand, your blabbermouth friend you wish you could mute. But she’s also a trailblazer for characters like her throughout the series and one of the most memorable companion characters in all of video games.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-recommend-id="image://c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A great fairy rises from the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A great fairy rises from the ground." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-recommend-id="image://c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A great fairy rises from the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Great Fairies have appeared in multiple<em> Zelda</em> games, but their depiction in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> is one of my favorites. The giant women in flashy hair and makeup that would make anyone competing on <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em> jealous are fun, flirty, and always willing to lend a helping hand— if you help them first. Most design iterations of the Great Fairies have been a bit more reserved, which is why the <em>Breath of the Wild </em>versions are a delightful return to the maximalist look of <em>Ocarina of Time</em>’s fairies. Don’t give me generic fairies who will heal me up. Give me drag queen-looking mothers who are here to slay the pain away.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-recommend-id="image://77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Impa as she appears in Breath of the Wild." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Impa as she appears in Breath of the Wild." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-recommend-id="image://77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Impa as she appears in Breath of the Wild." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of all the recurring characters in the <em>Zelda </em>series, Impa is likely the one who has gone through the most wildly different interpretations since her debut in the original game. She’s been a non-combatant elder and a ninja-like bodyguard, but every time she and Link meet she is a source of wisdom and direction. Depending on when you jumped into the franchise, the name “Impa” might conjure a different image in your mind. I still remember her most vividly as the Sage of Shadow in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, but it’s not lost on me that many will know her as an elder in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s Kakariko Village. But no matter which version of her you remember most, her presence as a guiding hand transcends timeline and appearance.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-recommend-id="image://8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-format="jpg" data-width="256" data-height="240" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Error says &quot;I am Error.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Error says &quot;I am Error.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-recommend-id="image://8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-format="jpg" data-width="256" data-height="240" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Error says &quot;I am Error.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Error is a man of few words.

Then if you talk to him again he’ll tell you about a tunnel that leads you to a whole new area you might not have found in the game. Thanks, Error!

Don’t worry, Will.’” The set apparently had to be “evacuated” for over three hours before filming could resume. “He’s a lovely guy, just he farts,” the filmmaker said. “Some do, some don’t.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remakes-leaked-ending-hints-at-possible-sequel/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Until Dawn Remake is not out until October 4, 2024; however, a day before the intended release date, the game’s ending has leaked, which hints towards a sequel.</p>



<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead for players who haven’t played the original game.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/untildawn/comments/1fus4m8/leak_new_ending_for_until_dawn_remake/">untildawn</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">Eurogamer</a>), Until Dawn Remake developers have added an entirely new ending that paves the way for a sequel. In the original game, players could only reach two conclusions: either Josh dying or him turning into a Wendigo. However, in Until Dawn Remake, the developers have added an entirely new ending, where Josh survives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Until Dawn Remake ending plays right after credits, and Dr. Hill addresses Josh, stating, “But it is a game that has driven you to one of your own deepest fears, Joshua. Isolation.” The scene ends with Joshua showing the massive scar on his forehead while Dr. Hill says, “I hope for your sake, Joshua, that you can find redemption.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Until Dawn Remake ending has an additional post-credit scene, where players see how Sam deals with PTSD some years after the game’s events. The scene begins with Sam asleep, and an alarm wakes her up. As she goes to stop the alarm, she finds her arm covered in blood, with someone knocking at the door. The scene ends with a mysterious voice calling her name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A reliable insider has also weighed in on Until Dawn’s sequel. Shpeshal Nick has taken to <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1841831653859328287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to provide more information about the game. According to him, Firesprite will be developing the upcoming title.&nbsp;</p>

And while gamers were largely charmed by the father and son bond that they forged, Atreus was a little overly chatty. That trend continued in the 2022 sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-blood-sweat-and-tyrs/1900-6417993/" data-ref-id="1900-6417993">God of War Ragnarok</a>. But now, a new mod has been created for the recently released PC port that keeps Atreus and other companions from stepping all over the game's puzzles.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-please-shut-up-mod-turns-off-all-companion-puzzle-hints" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, a NexusMods user, Mophead01, has released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/66" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Please Shut Up mod</a>. This expands on Sony's previously released option to decrease the frequency of hints for the puzzles that Kratos has to solve throughout the game. Mophead01 felt that did little to address the actual problem, including recurring instances where Atreus reminds gamers how to perform basic actions. Thus the mod has taken the drastic step of removing over 1,500 lines of dialogue from the game.</p><p>"Tired of companions telling you things you already know? Tired of the game treating you like a child if you don't instantly solve every puzzle? This mod removes over 1,500 pointless, [patronizing] voice lines from the game," wrote Mophead01.</p><p>Unfortunately, this mod is not an option for gamers who have Ragnarok on PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4. Sony hasn't even gotten around to sending out an update for those versions that includes the PC option to cut down on the hints. So for now, only PC gamers have the chance to keep Atreus quiet for any extended length of time. </p>

		<p>A major game set in the Avatar: The Last Airbender and Avatar: The Legend of Korra universe is being developed by Saber Interactive, the studio has confirmed today. The new game will be a triple A action RPG set in the same universe, but it will not follow either Aang or Korra. Instead, this game will be set thousands of years before either of their stories, introducing a new Avatar that has not been seen in the show.</p>
<p><em>“We know loyal fans of&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>: The Last Airbender&nbsp;have been eager for more stories that bring them into the universe of the show, and through gaming, we’re able to expand the world- building and allow fans to experience the new content in a completely immersive way,”</em> said Doug Rosen, SVP, Games and Emerging Media at Paramount. <em>“Saber Interactive has a proven track record in bringing IP-based games to life, and we are excited to co-fund this AAA title alongside them and let fans experience this world first-hand.”</em></p>


<p>“At Saber, we are all truly fans of the IP we work with,” said Josh Austin, Head of IP Development &amp; Licensing, Saber Interactive. <em>“Our team members are some of the most devoted, passionate creatives out there and it’s an honor to join forces with&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>&nbsp;Studios and Paramount Games to further expand the&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>&nbsp;Legends&nbsp;universe in video games. This unique co-fund structure is a result of our ever-expanding collaboration with Paramount, which started over a decade ago with WWZ, and we’re excited for all that’s on the horizon.”</em></p>
<p>Saber Interactive will be working with Avatar Studios to create a story and world which will fit into the lore that has been established by the two shows already, and it will follow a familiar pattern of being a story about an Avatar trying to master all four elements. The game’s description also seems to suggest that there will be choices that will have an impact on the story, and that this Avatar will have their own group of companions too, just like Aang and Korra. No platforms or release date has yet been confirmed.</p>

			<p>Sid Meier's <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/">Civilization VII</a> is the next game to be announced in the Civilization franchise, a beloved franchise that has been going since 1991, with multiple spin-offs in the franchise. The next main game in the franchise was announced during Summer Games Fest 2024 and is slated for a 2025 release. As of today, the official system requirements have been announced, and the Ultra settings are asking quite a lot of players. At the moment, there have been no Mac requirements listed, so it's uncertain whether the game will be arriving on Mac as it releases on PC, if it'll come at a later date, or if there are no plans to put it onto Mac at all. Civilization VI was put onto Mac and Linux, so it's likely that the game will also be released on Mac at some point in its lifespan. Below are the PC system requirements for Civilization VII, as <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced today on X</a>.</p>

<p>While the lower settings are quite reasonable, as are the recommended settings, dedicated fans in the comments are already posting their shock at the intense requirements for the ULTRA settings. Typically, Civilization games aren't that hardware intensive, and players can still run the game on great graphics without their hardware running hot. However, it seems that Firaxis has a different idea for this game.</p>
<p>However, considering that the ultra settings will allow the game to run at 4K60, it seems relatively reasonable that an RTX 4070 would be the recommended graphics card for those who want the utmost graphic fidelity in their 4X experience. Some have been quick to come to the defense of Civilization VII's system requirements, saying that they are justified, but some are saying that it seems unnecessary to need a 4070 for a turn-based game.</p>
<p>At the moment, details about Sid Meier's Civilization VII are quite slim, as the game was only announced earlier in the year. However, as we get closer to 2025, more details about upcoming features and perhaps information about why the system requirements are what they are are bound to be released.</p>

The iconic actor plays a deranged vampire named Severen who wears a biker jacket adorned with badges from different time periods that are likely from all the people he’s eaten.

Bigelow deftly establishes a neo-Western vibe and mood that is gritty, dirty, and downright rotten at times, while expertly balancing its crueler moments with a love story that glistens like a pearl resting on a dank ocean floor. It’s an absolute must-watch, and yet you may not be able to.</p><p><em>Near Dark</em> is the unfortunate victim of the same fate as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692"><em>Strange Days</em></a></span>, another Kathryn Bigelow classic that is difficult to watch but essential to find. Here’s hoping it’ll come back on streaming services before October is up. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s a sad day when another game studio shuts down, making people wonder just how fickle this industry really is. Studio Black Flag, also known as Blackflag Games, is officially shutting down after declaring bankruptcy, while also working on the game, Orphan Age.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-studio-black-flag-declares-bankruptcy-and-shuts-down">Studio Black Flag Declares Bankruptcy and Shuts Down</h2>



<p>With many other esports and gaming companies having mass layoffs recently or shutting down, it comes as no surprise to see another small studio hit the ground. Still, though, it is quite disheartening.</p>



<p>Studio Black Flag declared bankruptcy explaining that “communications broke down” between it and its publisher. The French government then shut down the French indie studio because it did not have any present or future funding.</p>



<p>“It is an inevitable situation. Due to the legal specifics of this case, we were put back in a closed bottle and unable to talk about the situation,” said Studio Black Flag in regards to having to shut down.</p>



<p>This news comes with many other companies shutting down operations within the industry or having to do mass layoffs.</p>



<p>“Ultimately,” the company added, “we appear to be another casualty of the&nbsp;current downturn in the video game industry.”</p>



<p>So, what does this mean regarding the studio’s game, Orphan Age, which has yet to be released?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-studio-black-flag-hopes-to-release-orhpan-age-still">Studio Black Flag Hopes To Release Orhpan Age Still</h2>



<p>Studio Black Flag does not want fans following the production of Orphan Age to be disappointed. The studio announced they are exploring options to release the game in its current state, which is unfinished but still playable.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>They made it very clear, though, that it will not be a close-to-finished version of the game, but still better than the playable demo that was released a while back.</p>



<p>It is very heartbreaking to see a company as such topple, but unfortunately, this is just a part of being in the gaming industry.</p>

<p>Multiple roles have reportedly been affected across the studio, although XR Games has not officially confirmed that it has carried out this round of layoffs. If the studio is down to just 12 people, this likely doesn't bode well for its upcoming games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starship-troopers-continuum/" data-ref-id="5000-645815">Starship Troopers: Continuum</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/zombie-army-vr/" data-ref-id="5000-619399">Zombie Army VR</a>.</p><p>While it's not listed on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic, a quick glance at the reviews for Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded have not done the game any favors. Several critics have noted that it's a poor translation of the excellent PC and console game, while technical issues hamper its appeal further.

                <p dir="ltr">Just in time for spooky season, players of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> got their first in-depth look at the popular life sim's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-confirms-sims-4-life-and-death-expansion-pack-releases-in-october-new-roadmap-unveiled/1100-6526303/">macabre new Life &amp; Death expansion pack</a> via a trailer released by EA. While every major Sims 4 expansion brings something new to the franchise, Life &amp; Death may take the cake as far as expansion-exclusive careers go, as it lets players step into the otherworldly shoes of none other than the Grim Reaper himself.</p><p dir="ltr">But clocking in for a job that revolves around telling other Sims when to permanently clock out isn't the only off-the-wall feature included in the new expansion pack. The trailer depicts a number of wild new activities for Sims to take part in. From planning the perfect funeral to executing the last will and testament of the deceased, The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death expansion pack gives players access to an array of humorous (and at times, heartfelt) content to engage with.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death Expansion Pack: Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, players can now don the hood of the Grim Reaper, an NPC who has been a part of the franchise since the very beginning. The Grim Reaper career path allows Sims to become Grimsterns--mentees of ol' Grim who decide the fate of those who have recently kicked the bucket. (Yes, they even get to wield a scythe.) Grimsterns who meet Grim's "soul quota" can even be dubbed Employee of the Month!</p><p dir="ltr">Sims who build a good enough relationship with Grim may get a chance to see what he looks like under the hood, though his face is amusingly censored by the same pixelated effect that appears when Sims strip down to shower or skinny dip. The new expansion also includes mortician and funeral director career paths, along with an appropriately spooky new in-game world: Ravenwood, a bone-chilling environment featuring three new neighborhoods for Sims to live (or die) in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4378343-grimhood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378343" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4378343-grimhood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378343"></a><figcaption>Sims players can finally see what's going on under Grim's hood. Er, sort of.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4378343-grimhood.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to creepy new locales, fresh-to-death clothing and furniture, and the whole "get paid to be the Grim Reaper" thing, The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death expansion pack also includes a truly life-changing new feature: reincarnation. Sims who have finally shuffled off this mortal coil can shuffle their way back to the land of the living by completing the Soul's Journey aspiration. Sims with this aspiration will be faced with a number of goals ranging from heartwarming (connecting with long-lost loved ones in the afterlife) to heart-stopping (scaring the Sul Sul out of non-dead Sims, just for fun). Completing the Soul's Journey aspiration will earn Sims the "Burning Soul" reward trait, which allows them to return from the dead without having to cook up a plate of Ambrosia or go through the whole "groveling at Grim's feet with a Death Flower" thing.</p><p dir="ltr">The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death expansion pack retails for $40 USD and will be available on console and PC starting on October 31, with a gameplay trailer set to go live on October 17. Players who purchase the game by December 12 will also receive the Mournful Mementos Digital Content Set, which includes the following items:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Lasting Legacy Family Portrait</li><li dir="ltr">Mournful Melodies Music Box</li><li dir="ltr">Plumed Elegance Mask</li></ul>

            <p>
Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-journeying-through-life-and-beyond-in-latest-expansion-this-halloween">few early teases</a> last month, EA has formally unveiled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s spooky new Life &amp; Death expansion, which arrives on 31st October, adding everything from new neighbourhoods where the boundaries between the living and the dead are especially thin to a new grim reaper career and the ability for ghosts to WooHoo in objects small and large.
</p>
<p>
Life &amp; Death looks to be a particularly busy expansion, touching not only on what happens to the living when a loved one is lost - think Wills and more elaborate funerals - but what Sims experience after shuffling off this mortal coil. That includes spectral romances, ghostly powers, the ability to helpfully haunt their old homes as part of the family, even reincarnation.
</p>
<p>
Living Sims looking to make the most of their time on earth can create a bucket list as part of the expansion (which players can populate manually based on specific categories or expand automatically based on a Sims traits), and Sims who don't manage to tick everything off in life can work through that list beyond the veil as Unfinished Business - earning the chance for an especially powerful rebirth, carrying over previously earn skills and traits.

<p>
The living, meanwhile, can also plan elaborate Funeral events for their loved ones, specifying the likes of dress code, time and location, even activities that'll play out during the ceremony. Sims might give a lighthearted eulogy, for instance, serve food, light candles, or plant something in the deceased's memory. Players can even select specific memorial portraits, urns, tombstones, or decorate gravesites however they choose.
</p><p>
All that ties in with new forms of grief Sims can express when a loved one (including pets) dies, including Denial, Holding It Together, Anger, and Blues. Grieving sims can also Reach out for Help with their friends, attend Grief Counselling, console other Sims, or cope positively with grief by doing creative or productive activities.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the Sims 4's Life &amp; Death expansion introduces two new careers; Sims can study to become undertakers, learning grave digging, embalming, and more as they follow their branching career paths toward either Mortician or Funeral Director. Sims can alternatively sign up as Grimterns at the Netherworld Department of Death, working through the ranks to become a reaper, filling their soul quotas, and even decided who to reap or return to life.

<p>
Then there's Ravenwood, a new world split into three distinct neighbourhoods where the dead and living more closely intermingle. Crow's Crossing, for instance, is an eerie village of cobbled streets where haunts are commonplace, while Whispering Glen is an idyllic countryside retreat that hosts a nightly Moon Revelry festival. "Things get a little wild during the Full Moon," EA notes, and "clothing is entirely <em>optional</em>."
</p><p>
And finally for Ravenwood, there's the gloomy Mourningvale, where Sims can find the Bell Tower, sentient plants, even the Baleful Bog, used to achieve an out-of-body experience or transition into Rebirth. It's also possible to join Afterlife Anonymous here if they need a bit of help adjusting to their recent transition to the other side.
</p>
<p>
There's quite a bit more going on in Life &amp; Death too, including a new Ghost Historian Aspiration, horror novels, new traits (Macabre, Chased by Death, and Skeptic), a new Thanatology Skill, and more. There's plenty of additional detail in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/life-and-death-expansion-pack">EA's announcement post</a> if you're curious, and a new gameplay video is set to be released on 17th October.

			<p>Nearly five years after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-in-the-works-maybe-meanwhile-heres-a-playable-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gothic Remake playable teaser</a> was released on Steam, I watched a detailed presentation of the project at Gamescom 2024, followed by an in-depth Q&amp;A with the developers at Alkimia Interactive.</p>
<p>To start with, the developers stressed Gothic's importance from a gaming cultural standpoint, especially in Germany and Eastern Europe, where the fantasy role-playing game immediately garnered a huge following. They also immediately clarified that the Gothic Remake Gamescom 2024 demo was not part of the actual game. Instead, it was a sort of prequel featuring another main character rather than the nameless hero. Alkimia Interactive said they were unsure whether the demo would be released to the public.</p>
<p>Even in this demo, the action still took place in the mining colony under the magic barrier created by magicians to keep convicts under control. The developers said it was very important to keep the original spirit and the daily routines of the NPCs, who do their own things, like having random conversations that you can listen to.</p>
<p>In the original game, the player could dive, but the action was basically useless. In the Gothic Remake, the developers wanted to make this more meaningful, so players can now find loot inside sunken chests. For instance, at the very beginning of the demo, enterprising players can find a sword underwater. Alkimia wants to make the Gothic Remake a highly immersive experience. To that end, UI elements like the health and mana bars will only appear when the character draws a weapon.</p>
<p>If you have played the original, you'll find that many locations are logical extensions of something in the original. Often, there was a blocked path; you would see something behind it, but you couldn't actually go in. Now, the developers have taken these open ends to add more content.</p>
<p>In keeping with the gritty, realistic vibe of Gothic, the main character doesn't really know how to fight at the beginning. His swings are purposely very slow and equally clumsy. That's meant to highlight he has probably never held a sword before in his whole life, so he's untrained and skilled. However, in the demo (and in the final game, too, of course), NPCs were available to teach him sword fighting. You do actually train with them, and it is even possible, albeit unlikely, to beat them.</p>
<p>On a high level, this is one of the important aspects of the world of Gothic: everything is communicated to you either visually or through conversations, so you don't have to look abstractly at your skill tree; you can just look at your character and see that he's getting better.</p>
<p>Cooking was available in the original, but in the Gothic Remake, you can fry multiple pieces of meat at once. You don't have to do it one after the other. Also, if you find more recipes, you can even cook some more sophisticated dishes and sell them or eat them to get some more health points back. Another example is that you can count the number of arrows you've got left by just looking at the quiver.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most NPCs you fight against won't instantly kill you. They are instead only interested in asserting their dominance in the prison colony and they let you leave after they've won. Another peculiarity is that in the quest log, there won't be any separation between main quests and secondary quests.</p>
<p>I also learned from composer Kai Rosenkranz that the music in the original Gothic was only 25 minutes, maybe 30 minutes long, but it was composed out of building blocks that could be rearranged and shuffled around, which made it less repetitive. Still, there was only so much trickery that could be done that way. The Remake already has over two hours of music, including original melodies that are both variations and brand new ideas. Interestingly, Rosenkranz said his daughter also wrote some music for the Remake, so this was a collaborative thing. In the original game, Rosenkranz did the same while his father also worked on it, making it the second time the music is a multi-generational affair from the Rosenkranz family.</p>
<p>Overall, the Gothic Remake demo looked great, running smoothly on Unreal Engine 5. It looks fairly polished, too, even though the developers wouldn't open up on whether the game was close to launch. According to publisher THQ Nordic, it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to be released by March 2025</a>, although plans can always change.</p>
<p>After the presentation, I quizzed Kai Rosenkranz, Alkimia Interactive Director/Studio Head Reinhard Pollice, and Community Manager Timur Khodyrev on various aspects of the game, from its longevity to the changes they've made to specific systems and questlines.</p>
<p><iframe title="GOTHIC REMAKE Open World Demo | New Single Player RPG with INSANE GRAPHICS in Unreal Engine 5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4zj0HcyYphM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Can you explore all the world from the get-go, or do you need to unlock something first?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> Nothing is locked away from you, but some things are found behind a creature that is initially nearly impossible to defeat. Or maybe there is a closed gate, but when you find a transformation spell, you can transform into a little bug to crawl around tunnels and go to places. It's not locked per se as a systematic lock, but it's blocked by in-world obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Can you upgrade your weapons?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> You can in the sense that you can forge your own weapons, and if you find more recipes for better weapons and better materials, you can go back to the blacksmith and forge a bigger weapon, which will look a bit fancier and stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Can you complete most quests in any order?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> Yes. Some quests advance the main story, of course, but there are also secondary quests that affect it. The player can choose what they want to do and what is important to them.</p>
<p><strong>What's the level cap in the Gothic Remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> The level cap will be 50.</p>
<p><strong>I wanted to ask about the game's length. I know you are adding some new areas and making new quests, so how much can we expect in terms of length?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> The original game from 2001 was roughly 20 hours long, but it had a very narrow and linear story in the later chapter, so the mid-game and the end game were much more to the point and much more linear than the previous chapters. So if we manage to extend those chapters, or even give you multiple options that extend the main story and the kind of opportunities to do side quests into the later chapters, that would, I think, lead to a significant increase in playtime to maybe about 30 hours.</p>
<p>The idea is to entice players to play more than just one time so that they can see other outcomes and experience a different fighting style.</p>
<p><strong>I know the game runs on Unreal Engine 5, right? Are you using Lumen and Nanite?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz: </strong>Yes to both.</p>
<p><strong>Will it be possible to have the camera centered on the player character, rather than the player character being so offset to the left, as seen thus far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong> We weren’t sure about the camera position, and in fact, we moved it to the side just a few weeks before GamesCom. But due to feedback starting with the trailer we will for sure add options like locking the camera on the left or in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Will players have different paths in the second and third Chapters if joining the New/Old Camp instead of 'spying' on the Sect Camp?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> There are more optional quests and ways to do things, but the main quest remains similar, meaning that you need to get a grip of the Sect Camp.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be more guild-specific quests compared to the original?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, as in the previous question, we want to expand Gothic Remake in different directions. We want to provide players with more in-depth information about the guilds, their goals, and motivations.</p>
<p><strong>Did you add more diverse character reactions to the Gothic Remake depending on which camp you have joined?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> We have a very complex reaction system and we plan to have different reactions based on story progress, missions you are in, recent events in the world or just the role of characters involved.</p>
<p><strong>Will it be possible to become a water mage earlier?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> Not specifically a water mage, but we want to open up access to magic sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be ways to customize the difficulty?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> The true Gothic experience has a specific difficulty level, but for players who want it differently, there will be options. However, everybody should be aware that it's not Gothic as it's imagined; it's just a variation.</p>
<p><strong>People always ask about the New Game Plus mode. Is that something you are considering for the Gothic Remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kai Rosenkranz:</strong> We will have some options to raise difficulty, but no New Game Plus.</p>
<p><strong>Can NPCs use scrolls in the remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> NPCs use magic.</p>
<p><strong>How will the Brotherhood react to Y'berion's death? In the original Gothic, nothing changes except for Kalom leaving. Is that something you're going to expand on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, absolutely. Actually, after that moment in the original game, you don't really need to come back to the Sect Camp since there is no additional content or quests. This is also what we want to expand in the remake. But we can not spill the beans other than it follows our philosophy of adding depth to the world and making it feel more alive.</p>
<p><strong>How is the skill system changing in the Gothic Remake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;If you mean the progression system, then it will be almost the same as in the original game. You earn XP by completing quests and defeating your enemies. You can learn something only from teachers. So there are no "skill trees" as in many other RPG games. So you need firstly to find a teacher, who is a specialist in this or that category. We have a 3-step progression system for one-handed, two-handed weapons, and ranged weapons like it was in Gothic 1 (not in Gothic 2).</p>
<p>Also, there are some new skills you can learn, for instance - free climbing or diving. For the latter, you can learn how to stay underwater longer.</p>
<p><strong>Will you take advantage of ray tracing effects?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong> Yes, there will be Ray Tracing technology in "Gothic 1 Remake".</p>
<p><strong>Will there be a Performance mode on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timur Khodyrev:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, there will be quality and performance modes on consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to take advantage of the PS5 Pro console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> There will be some improvements for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Will Gothic remake support NVIDIA and/or AMD frame generation techniques on PC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinhard Pollice:</strong> We will for sure support some kind of tech in that area.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>Yesterday, Valve dropped a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4659626709189608599">Steam client beta update</a> focused largely on Game Recording – the beta version’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths">recently added clip-capturing utility</a>. It’s a pretty wide-spanning array of improvements, adding support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide monitor</a> resolutions up to 32:9, the high-quality H.265 (HEVC) video codec – on Windows only for now, apologies to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – and the option to "record a specified game indefinitely with no specified time limit."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You wanna be careful wielding that kind of power, mind you. I once left <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/autoscreen/">Auto Screen Capture</a> running by accident, and only realised about eight hours later, after it’d filled my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> with sixty gigabytes of desktop screengrabs. May you be more attentive in your capturing endeavours.</p>
<p>Here’s the relevant chunk of patch notes:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li> Added support for recording with the H.265 (HEVC) video codec when supported by the machine's GPU. This is enabled by default on Windows and should provide improved recording video quality over H.264 at the same file size. Coming soon to Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for recording up to 4k video resolution when using H.265 (HEVC).</li>
<li>Added a new "auto" quality setting that will set the recording bit rate based on the game's video resolution. This will raise the bit rate when recording games running in 4k, to keep the recorded video sharp, and lower the resolution when running a game at 1080p to save disk space. This setting is on by default for all users.</li>
<li>Added support for recording ultrawide monitors up to 32:9 aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Added a setting to limit the width &amp; height of recorded video.</li>
<li>Exporting a recording (to file, clipboard or chat) will now use the machine's GPU to perform encoding and decoding when available.</li>
<li>Generating screenshots from recordings will now use the machine's GPU when available.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple issues where exporting a recording could fail.</li>
<li>Added export settings dialog to allow custom file size or other settings when exporting a clip.</li>
<li>Added video previews to the Background Recording items in the media manager when hovering them with a mouse or focusing them in BPM.</li>
<li>Added video previews to the Background Recording items in the app details page's screenshot section when hovering them with a mouse or focusing them in BPM.</li>
<li>In per-game settings, add the ability to record a specified game indefinitely with no specified time limit.</li>
<li>Integrated the list of games where recording is disabled into the per-game settings.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>If you missed it at launch, Game Recording is a pretty tidy addition to Steam’s ever-swelling feature set, and this update makes it materially better by adding new options and speeding up encoding and decoding. While I’m not a regular videosmith – I’ll clip a malfunctioning ragdoll to laugh at later over an Old Fashioned, but little else – it is handy to have a recording function built into the launcher, rather than running alongside it as another resource-hungry app. If you currently on Steam’s main stable branch, you can give the beta a whirl by switching clients in Settings &gt; Interface.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In that time, <em>Diablo 4</em> has proved again and again that it might just be the best entry the franchise has ever seen, with an excellent iteration on the core gameplay loop fans love that has only gotten better with consistent post-release updates . Next week, the game’s first expansion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-mercenaries-dark-citadel-1851630602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-mercenaries-dark-citadel-1851630602"><em>Vessel of Hatred</em></a></span>, will release, giving fans even more reasons to dive back in. But if you haven’t bought into<em> Diablo 4</em> just yet then now’s the perfect time, as Steam has a 40 percent discount on the game until October 7.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195150" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Diablo IV - Bear Bender Build" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="526" data-playlist="195150,195326,194907" data-current="195150"><div><p>Diablo IV - Bear Bender Build</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20607.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The fourth <em>Diablo </em>remains true to the core of what makes the series so popular. Its Gothic setting is atmospheric as hell and fun to explore, combat is tightly designed to make every click turn into a satisfying action, and hunting after new loot never gets old. One exceptional improvement over the franchise formula that <em>Diablo 4</em> introduces is a new variation on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023">skill tree</a></span>. After early criticism that the skill tree was too rigid and essentially locked you into a set playstyle, Blizzard created a much more freeing take on the system. </p><p>The current skill tree in <em>Diablo 4</em> allows you much more freedom in how you build your class, meaning that not every person who plays as a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-best-builds-classes-necromancer-rogue-sorcerer-1850518023">Druid</a></span> will have the same toolkit. And you can start your skill tree over at any point, which encourages experimentation with your builds. You might hit on a perfect build early or spend your entire playthrough trying out new things when the mood strikes. With a sprawling world that’s filled with a number of procedurally generated dungeons, that freedom of choice offers an incredibly satisfying combat loop, urging you to try just one more dungeon, or seek out just one more piece of loot.</p><p><em>Diablo 4</em> also has an incredibly engaging story. Sure <em>Diablo </em>has always had a narrative that stretches from game to game, but it’s often melodramatic and shallow. <em>Diablo 4</em> is a more grounded emotional affair with one of the best villains in Blizzard’s rogue’s gallery: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-iv-cosplay-lilith-photos-cosplayer-blizzard-1850541510&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-iv-cosplay-lilith-photos-cosplayer-blizzard-1850541510">Lillith</a></span>. We spend <em>Diablo 4</em> following her trail, always one step behind her villainous plans, and as we progress we piece together her motivations and history. At its core, Lilith’s story is about hatred and the cycles of violence the world of <em>Diablo </em>is trapped in. And Lillith is a more human villain than any in the franchise’s past, posing questions about what we as players think we know about the conflict at the heart of <em>Diablo</em>. </p><p>To me, <em>Diablo </em>has predominantly been a game about killing monsters and mindlessly collecting gear , but <em>Diablo 4</em> transforms that solid gameplay loop into a vessel by which a compelling narrative is delivered. The game’s first expansion, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, releases on October 8, which means if you pick up <em>Diablo 4 </em>on sale right now you can probably finish it over the week (with enough caffeine that is). Sounds like a good time to me.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
