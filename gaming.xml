<p>Ubisoft has returned the boobs to far Cry 4 following a mistake which censored the game worldwide.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-4-censorship-patch-removes-nudity-10-years-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our report earlier today</a> which brought further light to the situation that Ubisoft had apparently censored the nudity in Far Cry 4, the official Far Cry account <a href="https://x.com/FarCrygame/status/1908168738886787356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied to our post</a> to clarify the situation.</p>



<p>“To clarify, the update was the result of a mistake during deployment. Content intended specifically for the Japanese version of the game was accidentally pushed to the global Steam version,” they said.</p>



<p>They continued, “The team has since corrected the error by reuploading the proper global files to Steam. If players are still seeing anything unusual, restarting Steam and checking for updates should resolve it. Just to reassure everyone: there are no plans to censor Far Cry. This was purely a regional packaging error and has now been fully addressed. Thank you“</p>



<p>So fear not, boobs have once again returned to Far Cry 4.</p>



<p>Ubisoft community developer Patricia Brochu-Gagné also took to Reddit to further clarify the situation saying, “This was simply an error tied to a specific regional build, and it’s now been corrected.”</p>



<p>Far Cry 4 went on to sell over 10 million copies during the PlayStation 4 / Xbox One generation and to some, is considered one of the better Far Cry titles in the series. </p>

The Internet, of course, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-play-as-the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-in-mario-kart-world-and-the-internet-is-thrilled">is thrilled about this</a>, already coming up with dozens of memes and fanart of the adorable Cow that, until recently, was nothing more prominent than a fun background character in a single Mario Kart track.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as news of Cow spread throughout the land, fans began pointing out a potential, erm, problem, with another element of the Mario Kart World reveal. In the Nintendo Direct 2 trailer from Wednesday, Mario eats a burger. Burgers are (typically) made of beef. Would Cow, whose people are ostensibly a source of beef, consume beef herself? Fans really wanted to know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well at the Nintendo preview event, we found out. You see, the food items we saw in the trailer are obtainable in Mario Kart World at Yoshi's diner locations scattered across courses. They function like a drive-thru, allowing racers to drive up and grab a bag of take-out just like they would an item box. There are a lot of different food items that can be inside, including burgers, steak kebabs, pizza, and donuts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, Cow can eat them all.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, Cow CAN eat steak in Mario Kart World. <a href="https://t.co/qN5PZ9IIM4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qN5PZ9IIM4</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1908259261769003473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">During our session we also saw Cow eat a number of other items, including the burger. We're still a little hazy on what these items are actually doing for Cow — other racers change costumes when consuming them, but Cow doesn't seem to experience any effects. Could she be eating beef just because she enjoys it? Is there a secret power-up she gets from burger consumption that we just don't know about yet because Nintendo hasn't revealed it? Or perhaps are these veggie burgers and Beyond meat kebabs?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to Nintendo to try and clear all this up, but we haven't heard back yet. I'm sure it's because they're busy at their New York event, and not because this is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5RRyyHsjoU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unhinged question to ask</a> their PR about. Yeah, that's probably it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway go check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">preview of Mario Kart World</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">video version of which</a> features an appearance by our friend Cow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>Movie Games has announced that Drug Dealer Simulator will be coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles on April 16, with a PlayStation 5 release to come at a later date.</p>



<p>In the new press release, it was said that Drug Dealer Simulator has already surpassed over “1 million buyers” on PC – a total amounting to some $16 million in revenue.</p>



<p>Originally, the announcement was made a few weeks ago, but the recent PR email seems, at least at face value, that they are also trying to capitalise on the highly-successful Schedule 1. </p>



<p>Schedule 1 released on March 29, and recently hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak concurrent playercount of 414,000</a>, with a 24-hour peak of 329,000 concurrent players at the time of writing. At the moment, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 is yet to announce a console release</a>, so it makes sense that a rival drug dealer simulator would try and get ahead with an Xbox and PlayStation release… I guess.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-metroid-prime-4-beyond-first-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The opening minutes of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond were a great showcase of Switch 2's mouse controls.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">For seven years, Metroid Prime 4 was just a logo. Fans obsessively tuned into every Nintendo presentation hoping for an update on the game to no avail until 2024 when a trailer was finally released and footage of the game in motion was actually revealed. This year, not only is Metroid Prime 4: Beyond getting released but it’s also getting some really interesting visual and gameplay upgrades on Nintendo Switch 2. We’ve played Retro Studio’s latest installment in the classic sci-fi action adventure series on Switch 2 and we have lots to tell you about. Read on to find out more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Beyond Beautiful</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing we noticed with Metroid Prime 4 was how gorgeous it was. It’s got an incredibly clean and stylish aesthetic and Nintendo was advertising it as running in 120 frames per second on Switch 2. This won’t be the case on Switch 1 and it’s tough to track how much Nintendo will be able to stick to that number on the full game, but it’s an ambitious goal either way. So far, Prime 4 has a really great sense of scale. We fought a bunch of grunt-like enemies, saw a massive, hulking mech strut into the battle, and then took down a large boss that featured several different attack phases. The area we demoed was just a small glimpse at what the full game might offer so we’re hoping we see some grander setpieces and large, open environments, some of which have been teased already in trailers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Metroid games are also about cramped tunnels and dark corridors and we got to see a few of those, too. Like previous Prime games, a quick button press instantly pops Samus from first-person aiming into third-person morph ball mode, allowing her to traverse some areas she can’t reach otherwise. We got to test this out a bit and it works great so we can’t wait to search around every nook and cranny of this game looking for missile upgrades, energy tanks, shortcuts, and more. This is the most detailed Metroid game yet and these sections are no different, giving us a glimpse of battles happening between warring factions happening beneath you as you roll around in tunnels above them. But wait, how does it all play?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Samouse Aran (Or, Of Mice and Metroids)</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most fascinating additions to Metroid Prime 4 on Switch 2 is the optional mouse controls. Looking back, the Prime series has experimented a ton with unique control options across various games. The first two Metroid Prime games were built around the fairly traditional Nintendo GameCube controller (although there was nothing traditional about turning a historically 2D sidescrolling game into a first person action adventure game with third person ball rolling mechanics) but after that, all bets were off. Metroid Prime: Hunters on Nintendo DS had touch screen controls. Metroid Prime 3 on Nintendo Wii had pointer and motion controls. Metroid Prime Pinball on DS shipped with a Game Boy Advance cartridge shaped rumble pack. We don’t talk about Metroid Prime: Blast Ball on Nintendo 3DS. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, Metroid Prime 4 on Switch 2 lets you turn your right Joy-Con 2 sideways, place it on a flat surface, and control Samus’ aiming with a snappy and precise mouse pointer complete with haptic feedback for every shot. Even neater, the game seamlessly allows you to switch from traditional stick controls to mouse controls on a whim, with no need to pause to go into the settings. We could see plenty of people deciding this is their preferred way to play Metroid Prime 4, and the ease of which you can swap back and forth between mouse and pointer controls makes it so you can choose to only plop the Joy-Con 2 on the table when it’s time for a serious combat sequence, and use traditional controls for the more chill exploration segments Prime 4 will surely deliver. Or maybe you’ll want to play the whole game in handheld mode or with a Pro Controller. Either way, you’ve got options.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct April 2025 Games</h3><p>Every game shown in Nintendo's April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 reveal direct event.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" Upgrade Path</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing Nintendo isn’t being totally clear on just yet is where Prime 4 sits in their awkward transitional Switch 1 to Switch 2 titles list. While some original Switch games like Echoes of Wisdom and Link’s Awakening are getting free upgrade patches for Switch 2, others like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are charging $10 for visual upgrades (and a few bells and whistles) while some games like Kirby and the Forgotten Land will receive $20 upgrades that improve visuals and add new content. Which of these categories will Metroid Prime 4’s mouse controls and 120FPS options be in when they come to Switch 2? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, like its release date and base game price, we just don’t know yet. You’ll be able to buy the base game and the “Switch 2 edition upgrade pack” individually or as a bundle in a bright red Switch 2 branded box but as of now, we have no idea how much any of those will cost you. Our best guess is that it will be $10 more for the Switch 2 version given that it’s not coming with an expansion like Mario Party’s “+ Jamboree TV” and Kirby’s “+ Star-Crossed World”, but we’re not 100% sure yet. Samus has unlockable psychic powers in Prime 4 so we might just have to ask her. She’s usually not very talkative, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 4 doesn’t have a release date just yet but it’s coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 in 2025 so hey, at least we won’t have to wait seven years again to find out more.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>At GDC 2025, I watched a walkthrough of one of the early levels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/possessors/" data-ref-id="5000-631833">Possessor(s)</a>, the next game from Heart Machine. The studio typically goes for action games but mixes in a little bit of something else--2016's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-drifter/" data-ref-id="5000-228161">Hyper Light Drifter</a> had RPG elements, 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solar-ash/" data-ref-id="5000-505771">Solar Ash</a> was an adventure-platformer, and 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-breaker/" data-ref-id="5000-561878">Hyper Light Breaker</a> is a cooperative roguelike. Possessor(s) is a metroidvania or, as Heart Machine prefers to call it, a search-action game (which, honestly, is such a better term for the genre).</p><p dir="ltr">A sidescroller, Possessor(s) sees you play as two characters: Luca, a teenage girl, and Rehm, the demon possessing her. I didn't get to see the events that led to their partnership, but the Heart Machine team explained that the start of Possessor(s) sees Luca caught up in an interdimensional catastrophe that rips a hole in the sky and kills everyone she loves--it's only because of the intervention of the strange horned man now within her that she survives.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471289" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471289"></a><figcaption>During Luca and Rehm's journey, they'll encounter objects possessed by feral demons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rehm also gives Luca artificial legs (I don't know what happened to her original legs, but I assume the full game will clue us in), so that she can jump higher and survive falls from any height, and Luca uses these new prosthetics to navigate the now-quarantined city in hopes of escaping it and learning more about how the catastrophe happened. The duo regularly converse about their substantially different views of demons and the corporation responsible for most everything in the city, alleviating much of the sense of loneliness that I've come to expect in other search-action games.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Rehm, Luca is able to hold her own in a world that wants to kill her. Combat is against the possessed objects and people of the city--demons far more feral than Rehm have corrupted all manner of things in the metropolis. I was surprised when a potted plant that had been pretending to be totally inanimate and harmless sprung to life right as Luca walked past it, and the devs said that plenty of demons will adopt that strategy of hiding in plain sight by pretending to be seemingly normal parts of the world. When a fight does break out, mechanically, it looks a whole lot like playing Super Smash Bros., with an emphasis on combos and air juggles. It looks more engaging than Hyper Light Breaker, but I didn't get hands-on time with Possessor(s) so I can't say one way or the other for sure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471290"></a><figcaption>As Luca unlocks new traversal abilities, she and Rehm will be able to reach more areas of the map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like its genre contemporaries, Luca unlocks additional abilities over time, which open up new options in combat and open up new areas of the map. I didn't get a chance to see this in action, but it sounds like it works just like how upgrades are handled in the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nine-sols/" data-ref-id="5000-548741">Nine Sols</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-metroid/" data-ref-id="5000-17693">Super Metroid</a>, and other similar games, with an open-ended, interconnected world that allows players to explore in whichever direction they have access to.</p><p dir="ltr">Stylistically, Possessor(s) is the biggest departure from Hyper Light Drifter's visuals--not bad by any means, but surprising all the same since every subsequent game from the studio has followed that art direction pretty closely. The colors are certainly similar, but Possessor(s)'s characters look hand-drawn, and bolder lines and flashier colors for the animations make attacks and movements appear like something from a comic book or manga. It's very cool, and at least in terms of art direction, Possessor(s) is my favorite of Heart Machine's games. It wasn't at all what I was expecting, but the game intrigues me all the same, and I can't wait to jump into it myself later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Possessor(s) is set to launch for PS5 and PC sometime in 2025.</p>

          <p>This morning's announcement that Nintendo is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">delaying US preorders for the Switch 2</a> immediately increased the salience of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/critics-suspect-trumps-weird-tariff-math-came-from-chatbots/">President Trump's proposed wide-reaching import tariffs</a> for millions of American Nintendo fans. Additionally, the Entertainment Software Association—a lobbying group that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/gaming-trade-org-for-dmca-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-obsolete-game/">represents the game industry's interests</a> in Washington—is warning that the effects of Trump's tariffs on the gaming world won't stop with Nintendo.</p>
<p>"There are so many devices we play video games on," ESA senior vice president Aubrey Quinn <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/esa-responds-to-trump-tariffs-if-we-think-its-just-the-switch-2-then-we-arent-taking-it-seriously">said in an interview with IGN</a> just as Nintendo's preorder delay news broke. "There are other consoles... VR headsets, our smartphones, people who love PC games; if we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously.</p>
<p>"This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry," she continued. "There's going to be an impact on the entire industry."</p>
<p>While Trump's tariff proposal includes a 10 percent tax on imports from pretty much every country, it also includes a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam and a 54 percent total tariff on China, the two countries where most console hardware is produced. Quinn told IGN that it's "hard to imagine a world where tariffs like these don’t impact pricing" for those consoles.</p>
<p>More than that, though, Quinn warns that massive tariffs would tamp down overall consumer spending, which would have knock-on effects for game industry revenues, employment, and research and development investment.</p>
<p>"Video game consoles are sold under tight margins in order to reduce the barrier to entry for consumers," the ESA notes in <a href="https://www.theesa.com/issues/tariffs/">its issue page on tariffs</a>. "Tariffs mean that the additional costs would be passed along to consumers, resulting in a ripple effect of harm for the industry and the jobs it generates and supports.</p>
<h2>Not just a foreign problem</h2>
<p>The negative impacts wouldn't be limited to foreign companies like Nintendo, Quinn warned, because "even American-based companies, they're getting products that need to cross into American borders to make those consoles, to make those games. And so there's going to be a real impact regardless of company."</p>

Players will need an internet connection and must be at least 18 years old to win the prizes:</p><ul><li>1st place: Paul Skenes autographed The Show ball</li><li>2nd place: Elly De La Cruz autographed The Show ball</li><li>3rd place: Gunner Henderson autographed The Show ball</li><li>4th – 10th place: 50,000 Stubs</li><li>11th – 20th place: 40,000 Stubs</li><li>21st – 40th place: 30,000 Stubs</li><li>41st – 100th place: 10 Challenge of the Week Exclusive Packs</li></ul><p>Players will play as Elly De La Cruz against a CPU-controlled Paul Skenes who throws a 200MPH fastball and rack up as many points as possible within three outs.

            <p>
It's been one hell of a wait, but Binding of Isaac creator Edmund McMillen's extremely long-awaited cat breeding game Mewgenics is almost upon us. And with a release looming (comparatively speaking, at least), its first proper trailer is here - and, wow, is it something.
</p>
<p>
Mewgenics (or Mew-Genics as it was originally known) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-meat-boy-developer-announces-mutant-cat-game-mew-genics">first surfaced back in 2012</a>. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/edmund-mcmillen-details-his-upcoming-cat-lady-sim-mew-genics">described</a> as a cat-themed "cross between The Sims and Pokémon with a sprinkling of Animal Crossing and a dash of Tamagotchi", and was supposed to be developer Team Meat's long-awaited follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</a> - until it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-binding-of-isaac-dev-announces-the-legend-of-bum-bo">quietly shelved just a few years later</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, a lot more has happened. After McMillen and Team Meat development partner Tommy Refenes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-meat-boy-forever-and-the-return-of-team-meat">opted to go their separate ways</a>, McMillen went on to create the hugely successful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> Rebirth, plus other acclaimed oddities like The End is Nigh and Isaac spin-off The Legend of Bum-bo. In 2018, however, McMillen <a href="http://bindingofisaac.com/post/169521328569/a-new-years-qa">revealed he'd decided to resurrect Mewgenics</a>, and development has been ticking along ever since.

<p>
We've had a steady stream of updates since then, including confirmation Mewgenics has changed considerably since its original inception 13 years ago. It's now something like a cat-themed tactical RPG, split between breeding and combat, and is currently scheduled to launch this year. But while McMillen says there won't be any release date news just yet, we do have one hell of a live-action trailer to tide us over. It tells the heartwarming story of a struggling couple and the rutting cat-things that brought them closer together. And there's even some gameplay in there too, but given everything else going on - including the catchy little song it's all set to - you might need to watch a few times to take it all in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/switch-2-preorder-tariff<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-direct-price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rollout</a> continues to be weird: As you might have heard by now, Nintendo has delayed pre-orders in the US due to Trump’s tariffs, announced via a press release to various outlets. Why you are first hearing this through the press rather than from Nintendo is a bit beyond me, and further highlights how strange this whole thing has been.</p><p>I first learned this via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameSpot</a>. Subsequent outlets also received a statement, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> attributes to Eddie Garcia for Nintendo, which reads,</p><blockquote><p>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Pre-orders for the Switch 2 were already complicated, explained in an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ</a> that came out after Wednesday’s Direct. Likewise, the Switch's price filtered out after the fact through news writeups and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250402229347/en/Nintendo-Switch-2-Launches-June-5-at-%24449.99-Bringing-New-Forms-of-Game-Communication-to-Life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press releases</a>, and now we have this new information coming out in a roundabout way as well. </p><p>As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/minnmax.bsky.social/post/3llwgj66kn22s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MinnMax</a> commented, all this practical information “is everywhere, because [Nintendo] didn’t name any of the prices for anything… It felt like [Nintendo] didn’t want to take [its] L.” I’m not going to spin some kind of conspiracy theory about the company making the press do its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dirty work</a>, or at the very least its most boring work, but it definitely feels unusual for a company that has a big week of trying to sell me something to be so unclear about how precisely I can buy what it’s selling.&nbsp;</p><p>Now is, of course, not a great time for companies to have to tell people how to exchange money for goods. But doing so in as clear a way as possible is a company’s responsibility, not journalists’. Today’s small debacle feels like one snapshot of the confusion Trump's tariffs are going to continue to cause, and one example of how companies are likely to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-raising-prices-increases-trump-tariffs-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pass the buck</a> for all this onto everyday people. </p><p>Meanwhile, it feels like Nintendo is doing its level best to be business as usual; it's been running its usual Treehouses since the Direct, with chats full of viewers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3llym2u63522u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complaining</a> about the Switch 2’s price. Nintendo of America’s <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter feed</a> is full of hype clips for games, with similar comments underneath. And the rest of my part of the internet is full of people who are angry and anxious-- over a console they're excited about, sure, but also over <em>everything</em>. As the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/esa-responds-to-trump-tariffs-if-we-think-its-just-the-switch-2-then-we-arent-taking-it-seriously" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESA told IGN</a>, “If we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously… There's going to be an impact on the entire industry.” Replace “the industry” with “everyone who buys things,” and you have a better picture of how the weirdness around the Switch, or video game prices broadly, is just one small, clear example of how much needless suffering Trump’s tariffs are going to cause.</p><p>Delayed hardware pre-orders are, in the grand scheme of things, not the world’s biggest deal. But if Switch pre-orders are the thing that makes “the economy” feel <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ramiismail.com/post/3llytzkatmc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real</a> to more people, that helps more people see how cruel and short-sighted Trump’s latest plans are, perhaps the best use of journalists’ time right now is helping our readers make sense of that and figure out what action to take, rather than having to tell them when they can buy a console and for how much.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-switch-2-price-preorders"><h3>Nintendo’s Long Line Of Hits Followed By Misses Might Continue With Switch 2</h3></a><p>"The cycle of Nintendo is that they have an incredible hit, and then they get hubristic and up their own ass a little bit"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts"><h3>Psycho Patrol R Is A Hilarious Dream Of A Brutal Future</h3></a><p>The follow-up to Cruelty Squad is a brilliant, euro-septic vision of a the future and one of the best immersive sims I've played in ages.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstations-horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-adaptation-will-now-be-a-movie-adaptation-instead/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>The previously announced&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-is-in-the-works-by-the-umbrella-academys-showrunner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn TV show</a> adaptation that was being led by the same showrunner behind Netflix's Umbrella Academy is no more, and Guerrilla's open-world robot-dinosaur hunting series will be adapted into a movie instead.</span></p>
<p>At the top of the year, during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV95SMpTW-M&amp;t=1914s">CES 2025</a>, Sony announced that it would be making a movie adaptation of Horizon Zero Dawn. An exciting announcement that fans presumed would be something to go along with the TV show we already knew was in development.</p>
<p>That's not the case; however, PlayStation Productions head Asad Qizilbash confirmed this in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/global/last-of-us-fallout-creators-tv-adaptations-bafta-games-awards-1236352651/">Variety</a>. Speaking to Variety ahead of the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-bafta-games-nominations-list-revealed-astro-bot-nominated-in-8-categories/">BAFTA 2025 Game Awards</a> set for April 8, 2025, Qizilbash shared his thoughts on how prestige adaptations of video game series and franchises have gone so far, and how they could grow in the future.</p>
<p>During that discussion, Qizilbash talked about how these adaptations can be very successful, so long as the approach is right.</p>
<p>"<em>I think what people have seen in Hollywood is that video game adaptations, if done right, can actually be very popular, and they scale really well. That's been a big sea change that I've seen in the last five, six years, since we've really started to come and deliver some great content.</em>"</p>
<p>Having that methodology is why Qizilbash admits that they felt a change needed to be made with how the Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation was developing. Qizilbash says that the TV show version that PlayStation Productions was working on with Netflix "<em>just wasn't creatively going how we wanted to,</em>" prompting the switch to make it a movie instead—and likely a very different project altogether, beyond the obvious differences between making a movie and making a TV show.</p>
<p>Out of the adaptations we've seen from PlayStation Productions so far, it's clear that HBO's The Last of Us has been the most successful. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/twisted-metal-tv-series-anthony-mackie/">Twisted Metal</a> show is set to premiere its second season sometime this summer, giving it another chance to make a mark after the first season failed to set the world on fire.</p>
<p>An even bigger challenge this time around, considering it'll be arriving shortly after the second season of HBO's The Last of Us, which is expected to be better than season one. The film adaptations we've gotten so far in Uncharted and Gran Turismo were able to find high to moderate financial success, respectively, but both were largely slammed by critics.</p>
<p>The switch to making the Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation a film instead of a TV show could transform the project from a middling sci-fi show to a stellar sci-fi film that does wonders at the box office. But at this point, Qizilbash and PlayStation Productions' batting average doesn't inspire confidence.</p>

After 28 years of working at Wizards of the Coast on the world's most popular fantasy RPG, Christopher Perkins is stepping away, leaving a rich history behind.</p>



<p>Christopher Perkins announced his retirement from Wizards of the Coast via social media post on X (formerly Twitter). In the post, Perkins states that after 28 years of the company and wrapping up both Dungeons &amp; Dragons' 50th anniversary and new 2024 core rulebooks, that it was the perfect fairytale ending for him. He states that the franchise is in good hands and that he cannot wait to enjoy D&amp;D purely as a fan.</p>

In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dndbeyond.com/post/3llyx7uz36c2x" rel="nofollow">Bluesky social</a>, the company stated that they were grateful for Perkins' decades of work, stating that the game would not be what it is today without his contributions.</p>

<p>Perkins contributions to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> are substantial. He joined Wizards of the Coast in 1997 as an editor for <em>Dungeon</em> magazine. He later became a senior producer for the game while developing the <em>Star Wars Saga Edition</em> TTRPG. He also authored a blog, titled "The Dungeon Master Experience" on Wizards' website, openly dispensing sage advice about the challenges of being a DM.</p>

<p>But Perkins's biggest contributions came with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition. In addition to being the Senior Story Designer for the game, Perkins was also the lead story designer behind two of 5e's most acclaimed modules: <em>Curse of Strahd</em>, the 5e update to the iconic Castle Ravenloft module, and the whimsical Feywild journey of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wild-beyond-witchlight-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Wild Beyond the Witchlight</em></a>.</p>

<p>Perkins was also an active public figure for D&amp;D. He DM'd Penny Arcade's irreverent actual play series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-start-of-acquisitions-incorporated-first-actual-play-with-jerry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Acquisitions Incorporated</em></a>, hosted the Twitch live stream series <em>Dice, Camera, Action</em>, and guest-starred on several episodes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a>.</p>

<p>The last <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> product credited to Christopher Perkins as product lead is the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Dungeon Master's Guide</a>. An admirable update to the game's strong foundation.</p>

One year later, during the recent GDC 2025, their presence was undoubtedly way more understated, with less flashy partnerships</span> to talk about. That doesn't mean there's no development going on behind the scenes, though. During the recent convention in San Francisco, we caught up with Inworld AI CEO Kylan Gibbs to discover what they've been up to lately.</p>
<p><iframe title="Streamlabs Launches Intelligent Streaming Assistant in Collaboration With NVIDIA and Inworld AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/909h0VZeOMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Let's talk about your company's evolution over the past few years.</strong></p>
<p>We've been around for almost four years now. The first thing we started out with was this character engine that was a server-side application connected to your game engines via an SDK. It was largely meant to abstract away a lot of the complexity of AI, mainly for designers and narrative writers. The biggest learning that we had was that people wanted much more control, and they wanted the logic and everything to run locally.</p>
<p>A big focus for us product-wise has been shifting away from that server-side application to take the logic and tools that we built our own engine with and turn them into a series of libraries that developers can actually use directly in the engine to build their own AI engines effectively. That means it's a C++ runtime that can be transformed as needed for other engines.</p>
<p>That has been the transition from character engine to framework. As part of that, we've had a focus on observability and telemetry. One of the challenges is that, with AI, a lot of game developers don't have the transparency that they need to actually understand when something breaks, what went wrong, and when something is good, what might happen.</p>
<p>That's our portal tool, which allows developers to access the telemetry built into that framework. The big thing, though, is we need to bring not just the logic locally but, ideally, the models locally, which is what every game developer wants, so we've had a huge focus on that as well.</p>
<p>What we've built is a tool that allows us to use our cloud to actually distill down models that can be used locally. Of course, the challenge there is that a lot of consumer hardware is not ready to run everything locally. What we end up building into a lot of these applications is what we call a hybrid inference model where you have the actual model locally stored, but it detects if it can run on the hardware and if not, it backs up to a cloud version. For example, if it lands on a PC with a GeForce RTX 5090, you run it locally. If it lands on a Nintendo Switch, you're going to use the cloud.</p>
<p>The other big focus that we had is what we call controlled evolution. The biggest challenge with AI overall right now for games and for consumer apps in general is if you launch a game today with a given model, and you keep that model, in six months, it will be outdated because AI is moving too quickly. You need to basically constantly be able to select from all the third-party or our own models that are available, figure out which one is the best at that given time, and then do a bunch of optimization on it based on your user usage.</p>
<p>We try to work with developers so that they do not have to make a $20 million commitment to a specific cloud provider model provider but to use whatever the best model is at any given time and optimize that specifically for their use case, because every model is built for these kinds of huge general-purpose tasks. We need to do one thing super well, and so we do a lot of work there.</p>
<p>Because AAA games and all the largest studios that we work at Inworld with have obviously very long development cycles, the biggest launches today are largely mobile browser-based applications. The AAA ones take a little longer. The ones that I think are most exciting are <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=link.socialai.app&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Status</a>, for example, which is from a company called Wishroll. It's a game where you roleplay as a character in another universe's Twitter.</p>
<p>Crazy idea. But they hit 500K users in 19 days from launch with an average spend of an hour and a half per user per day, which is crazy traffic and the whole thing is powered by your achievements, the content. It's just mindblowingly creative in terms of what they built.</p>
<p>The other one is Little Umbrella. They have another part of the company called Playroom, which might be familiar. They built Death by AI as their first game and just released another one called The Last Show, which is effectively a JackBox-style party game powered by AI. Those are super fun because they lean into AI orchestrating multiplayer scenarios in real time.</p>
<p>A few other cool ones are Streamlabs, where we <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-partners-with-nvidia-and-streamlabs-to-unveil-the-worlds-first-intelligent-streaming-assistant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created a streaming assistant</a> in a collaboration between us, Streamlabs with Logitech and Nvidia. The game that we're using for it is Fortnite. In that case, you have this system that's living alongside the game in real time, seeing what's happening in the game, understanding the game's state, observing the user comments, hearing what the streamers are saying and being able to take complex actions, like do I need to overclock the GPU? Do I need to change the camera settings? Do I need to trigger an in-game event? All of those different things can actually happen, and they have to happen with millisecond latency. So, to make it all work performantly, that kind of mix of hybrid and local inference has to be required.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of StreamLabs, does it have functionality for a sort of gaming coach where it can monitor how you're proceeding with the game?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, with Streamlabs, that's basically how it performs. In this case, these are professional streamers often using it, so they really don't need coaching. But if you were a player going into the game, you'd be&nbsp;like, what the heck does this item do, right? What's the best next thing for me to do? It can do all of that.</p>
<p>The biggest class of use cases that we're seeing, which I call companions and assistants, are two different varieties of companions: disembodied and embodied companions. Disembodied is your Streamlabs assistant. It's outside the game, able to observe it, but not actually literally within the game. It's often used for coaching, assistants, questions, and live walkthroughs.</p>
<p>The other is embodied. You would use it for onboarding, which is a huge use case. Instead of having your blocks of text and everything starting, a character sees what you're doing, gives you suggestions, tells you how to play the game, and gives you comments. It can also be used later on, for example, for things like difficulty assistance. Maybe if you're stuck, it can show and tell how you're going to do this.</p>
<p>There are other use cases like player emulation, especially when you're doing multiplayer co-op games and MMOs. You jump in, and you're in hour one. You want to get a feel for the game, but you don't want to die, so how do we make it feel like you're playing with other players, maybe even with speech and everything else? Or, maybe you and I are playing a co-op game and you drop off, and then I want a character that comes along and makes it feel like I'm still playing with you. There are a lot of different use cases in that companion assistance space that are super exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Is the monitoring integrated as an SDK within the program itself, or does it have the functionality to read video inputs, for example?</strong></p>
<p>The logic is integrated into the application itself as much as possible. We actually integrate all the model understanding in it. You can embed local visual models that can understand things in real time. Really, the constraint is what hardware you want to run on. We have a demo that is fully running on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, an AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, or a Tenstorrent QuietBox. In that case, you can run it all locally. In that case, your application is just as old-school as it can be. It just happens to have AI logic in there and models that are embedded. That's where I think the industry needs to be going now, because everybody doesn't have the hardware power, we're still in the case where some of that needs to back up to the cloud. But really, the only thing you're ever using in the cloud is just a stored model, and you have an endpoint to it, but we try and keep all that logic locally because the developers need control over that.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Show | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3u8CX-qEcU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>For video monitoring, one example I've heard from NVIDIA showing off their gaming co-pilot assistant is being able to monitor a region of the screen. Say you're looking at a mini-map, you're playing a MOBA and you want to know when something disappears. How difficult would it be for either an end user or programmer to set up the variables to have it monitored for something like that?</strong></p>
<p>That's a great question. You can think about two things. The ideal for this is to do a full screen view visual language model or OCR. With OCR, you're basically taking screen captures. The reason you want a visual language model ideally is because it gives you that spatial awareness, but we see two ways to do that.</p>
<p>For a developer, what you'd probably do is set it up so that you're having it pointed at specific pixels on the screen and understanding based on those. What we often actually push people to think about as well is that sometimes you don't need to understand vision because you have the game state. You have code on the backend.</p>
<p>People often miss that, or they're like, we're trying to just understand the visuals, whereas actually, the code in the backend is telling me everything I need to know. It's kind of that dance between what I am actually not able to capture based on the game code and what I need that visual for.</p>
<p><strong>What's the possibility of using Inworld AI for quality assurance testing?</strong></p>
<p>You could use it. To be honest, our focus is primarily on player-facing AI. As I engage with more studios, my answer is you should build that yourself. And my reason for that is, I just think it's going to be continually driven down in terms of cost to use these large language models. Anything that's QA is a bit different, but for any kind of content creation productivity stuff, I think they just need to build it in-house and do it themselves.</p>
<p>For QA specifically, we don't build agents for testing or anything else. You could build that yourself using our tech. It's ultimately a more infrastructural piece of technology. We have some groups trying to create player emulating bots that they can send into the world and use.</p>
<p>We don't build a specific solution for QA testing, but we've often seen it used for prototype testing. In this scenario, you might set up a world with a general cityscape, and I want to see a hundred different varieties of this where the agents are responding in slightly different ways. It helps with rapid prototyping so that you can identify, out of that set of a hundred different options, which one is the most fun or engaging.</p>
<p>But in terms of core quality assurance or bug fixing, it's something that developers could build, but my honest response is use our tech if you want for that, but it's probably a good area for you to build yourself because it's going to be a core part of your workflows in the future.</p>
<p><strong>The main reason I was asking for it is that it can monitor the game state, setting up variables where you're looking at, say, unintended interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Right, that's super interesting. As I was mentioning, that telemetry piece that we have is super valuable there. Because it's built into the game code, you can set it up so that you're running telemetry against any part of the game. If you want to detect what types of character responses or NPC interactions tend to result in the player completing the mission, you need to know what kind of AI stuff is actually happening there.</p>
<p>So, I guess I would say this. We don't do general QA. We certainly are really focused on making sure that you can QA the crap out of your AI. Anything that is AI in there, we need to give you all the data, all the metadata, everything that you possibly need so that you can figure out how that actually works.</p>
<p>I think it's essential because I honestly think one of the broken parts of AI today is it's all a black box and if you're building and iterating on a game and doing playtest, you need to know when it breaks, how it breaks, and how that's all connected. We don't do QA for the broader space of game development, but as people are integrating AI, you need to QA the crap out of that. And that's where the telemetry piece comes in.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Crowds are one of those areas that have just not really evolved in about 10 years. For example, instead of just random people walking back and forth, as you kind of see in every game or standing still, they notice each other. Someone says something, someone walks up, they start having a conversation, they decide to do something, and they go off. As a player, you might not be able to put your finger on what is more immersive in that case, but it just feels more alive. We do a lot of that kind of stuff in terms of environmental awareness, too. We don't just power characters; we can power any part of the game state. How does the environment adapt to different people? How do you create different parts of quests or event generation?'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Have you noticed any issues that you're resolving with Inworld AI, such as hallucinations?</strong></p>
<p>Not as much anymore, because we have the ability to distill down these models and train them for specific tasks and run a lot of filters over them. The hallucinations can be controlled as much as you want and you can also perform data structure validation. So if you're outputting, for example, a JSON format, you can constrain it to specific JSON formats, certain lengths, and certain types of words.&nbsp;Where hallucination comes in, for example, is with that game that I mentioned earlier, Status. They kind of take advantage of it to a degree because they want characters to come up with crazy ideas but still stay within character.</p>
<p>It depends on how you define hallucination. In some cases, breaking outside of IP norms is one form of hallucination. Another form of hallucination is coming up with completely made-up stuff that doesn't make sense in the game and breaks the data structures. We focus a lot on that former one because we work with many IP holders who are super sensitive to it. On the other side, that's a pretty solved problem, but both are solvable. One just requires a lot more&nbsp;machine learning depth there.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the dynamic crowd tech that you are working on?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I love this. One of the big problems I encounter when I engage with studio heads who work on any kind of open-world game is that there are two ways that people have tried to build better player experiences. They just make worlds bigger and bigger, and they think a bigger world means more playtime. And I'm like, I can't go on horseback for another 20 minutes. That's one part of it. The other is graphical fidelity. Effectively, they try to consistently increase the graphical fidelity, thinking that if they have a bigger world with higher fidelity, people will like it.</p>
<p>Dynamic crowds is part of the general solution to that, which is how to make the world feel more alive. Crowds are one of those areas that have just not really evolved in about 10 years. For example, instead of just random people walking back and forth, as you kind of see in every game or standing still, they notice each other. Someone says something, someone walks up, they start having a conversation, they decide to do something, and they go off.</p>
<p>As a player, you might not be able to put your finger on what is more immersive in that case, but it just feels more alive. We do a lot of that kind of stuff in terms of environmental awareness, too. We don't just power characters; we can power any part of the game state. How does the environment adapt to different people? How do you create different parts of quests or event generation?</p>
<p>Maybe, if you have just completed a quest, I want to generate an event. For example, OK, I just saved this cat. I'm walking up to an ice-cream vendor. The cat jumps on the ice cream vendor, they shoo it away, and someone comes over. It's those little parts of the world that come more alive and make it feel more immersive, which is almost like a new form of fidelity that we are pushing now.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a toolset that Inworld AI is building so that developers can integrate a sample of the technology?</strong></p>
<p>That's a great question. As I mentioned, we build these templates with our framework. As soon as we start working with developers, we provide them with a sample to get started and understand how the tech works, and then they build around that. But it's not a black box component that they plug in. It's basically a chunk of code that they get to go in and change because how you might want to build crowds is different from another, not to mention how it interfaces with your assets and the rest of your system. That's why we think in terms of templates rather than components.</p>
<p><strong>Absolutely, especially when you're trying to adapt to the same game and engine framework across a broad spectrum of devices, some of which may be intended to be played offline.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. That's where the story of local hybrid is really important, because most people want to launch their games on multiple devices. How do we create a sense of player parity? We all know there's different graphics, right? If I play The Witcher 3 on another device, it's a completely different graphical experience. There's also that kind of level of how do we give the sense of parity while also recognizing the different constraints of the different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think Metahumans are a technology worth investing in, or is it&nbsp;petering out?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I see so many people - especially because people who come to us want to feel innovative, where there's this idea that it needs to be hyper-realistic fidelity. Every time you go to Metahumans, you end up being like, oh man, facial animations are really hard and anything becomes difficult. Also, players get this uncanny valley effect.</p>
<p>Generally, we've seen people migrate away from that direction towards more stylized characters that engage people. For example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> has super high-fidelity&nbsp;characters, but it's not Metahumans. So, I feel like there is certainly a transition in the other direction. I feel like there are certain interested parties who want to maximize that fidelity so you can maximize your GPU capacity, but I personally have just consistently seen stylized characters and worlds play out a little bit better, and it makes the development a lot easier. It also allows you to feel more differentiated for your players because, otherwise, every game feels like it has the same Metahumans in it. I don't necessarily want to say it's petering out, but there's certainly a recognition that it's not the right solution for most players.</p>

<p><strong>Tell me a little bit about what Inworld AI is building with Nanobit for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nanobit.virtuallife&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Winked</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In that case, they had this interactive novel type of game. It's a great experience where they release every few weeks or months a new pack of episodes. Those take a while to develop, and what happens is people get very attached to the characters during those experiences, and then go oh, I'm going to wait for the next month to get my favorite character back in the next episode.</p>
<p>In that case, they integrated these characters as a kind of stopgap. Now, every time you finish an episode, you can have a conversation with a character from the world. The work we did there was, how do we make these beloved characters that people are really attached to feel the same as the ones in the human-written stories so that people can continue experiencing them?</p>
<p>A lot of it was about how to achieve that dialogue quality without breaking&nbsp;the bank. A lot of that was custom model training to fit the specific character persona.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, for players who want to experience Inworld AI technology firsthand, can you talk about the next commercial release in which they might be able to see that technology in a game?</strong></p>
<p>I can't mention any of the AAA games because they all want to be secret, but there's probably going to be some stuff this Summer that will hopefully see some very large titles announced. We will also have another large showcase happening around June where we'll be showing off some new case studies and have our own event. So, I would look around the summer for some big stuff to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Earlier today, Nintendo made the unprecedented decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">delay prerelease orders</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/">Switch 2</a> in the US in order for the company to "assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." The news follows the Trump Administration announcing its plan to implement <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/02/nx-s1-5345802/trump-tariffs-liberation-day" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">steep and controversial tariffs</a> across the globe, with nations such as Japan, Vietnam, China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU facing the worst of these trade penalties. But while Nintendo might be the first company to address the impact these tariffs will have on production, the Entertainment Software Association--the video game industry's trade association that represents most of its major publishers--suspects that this is just the beginning.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/esa-responds-to-trump-tariffs-if-we-think-its-just-the-switch-2-then-we-arent-taking-it-seriously" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, ESA spokesperson Aubrey Quinn said that the tariffs being announced the same day as the Switch 2's pricing reveal was "just unfortunate coincidental timing," and that Americans "aren't taking it seriously" if we think think it's just the Switch 2 that will impacted by tariffs.</p><p>"It's been interesting with media coverage around video games and tariffs because just unfortunate coincidental timing that the Switch [2 reveal] was the same day as President Trump's announcement. There are so many devices we play video games on. There are other consoles, but as I was saying, VR headsets, our smartphones, people who love PC games, if we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously. This is going to have an impact," Quinn said. </p><p>“Even American-based companies, they're getting products that need to cross into American borders to make those consoles, to make those games. And so there's going to be a real impact regardless of company. This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry. There's going to be an impact on the entire industry.”</p><p>Quinn added that she expects that the "entire consumer ecosystem" will be affected by these tariffs, as higher prices and a volatile economy means consumers are less likely to spend. This will in turn impact company revenue, job security, research and development, and "even what the next generation of consoles will look like," IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine noted.</p><p>Like consumers--and the media, for that matter--Quinn said the ESA is still trying to figure out exactly how things will play out and just how big said impact will be. Though the organization assumed these tariffs were coming due to Trump's past actions and campaign promises, they are unsure how things will ultimately play out and are "trying not to have knee-jerk reactions."</p><p>"We don't think that what President Trump announced this week is the end of the story, but what was announced this week and the tariffs as outlined, we do expect these tariffs will have a real and detrimental impact on the industry and the hundreds of millions of Americans who love to play games,” Quinn said. “Our goal is to work with the administration, to work with other elected officials to try to find a solution that doesn't damage U.S. industries, U.S. business, but also American gamers and families.”</p><p>Fortunately, Quinn said that there are actions concerned citizens can take that that might make an impact. Reaching out to your representatives--be it through letters, calls, emails, tweets, or other forms of communication--is an effective method for ensuring that elected officials and their staff "hear that their constituents are concerned." Quinn also stated that members of the ESA have met with the Trump Administration, White House employees, and members of the United States Trade Representative, and are having conversations regarding these tariffs and their impact on the video games industry.</p><p>For months now, experts have speculated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/#comments-block-33629463" data-ref-id="1100-6528381">President Trump's proposed tariffs</a> would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">significant ramifications</a> for the gaming industry. While some have theorized that these tariffs might encourage companies such as Nintendo to produce in the United States, Analyst Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907789618294005816" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed out</a> that this would be incredibly unrealistic.</p><p>"Nintendo would need to spend billions to open a factory in the US," Ahmad said. "It'd probably take 4-5 years to complete this. Not to mention the time and cost to rebuild supply chain infrastructure and source components (which would be subject to tariffs because they're made outside the US). They'd then need to find, train and pay employees to operate the factory."</p>
