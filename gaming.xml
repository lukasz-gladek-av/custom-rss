		<p>Ubisoft has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> Title Update 1.4.0, which makes a huge change for one of the most hated aspects of the game. Stealth sections have been revamped to remove instant fail conditions, letting players blast their way out of a sticky situation, instead of being booted back to a save point.</p>
<p>As well as removing this condition, the enemy AI has also been tweaked so that players will be better signalled if they’re being detected, letting them make the choice of whether to try and back up and get back into cover, or just reach for their blaster and start going for it.</p>


<p>Elsewhere, enemy weak points have been added to add some explosive new options, Kay’s blaster has been returned and you can use two-handed weapons more often, and there’s a new toggle for the cinematic lens, which could clean up the image for those who hate fake camera effects.</p>
<p>Hoping to bring a bunch more players into the fold, Ubisoft has chucked Star Wars Outlaws into the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales this week, cutting 25% off the price of the game digitally. Of course, shops might have other ideas if they’ve got a few too many discs that they want to shift, so keep an eye out.</p>
<p>On the whole we rather enjoyed the game (stealth sections and otherwise), with Gamoc saying our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, “Star Wars Outlaws is an open world scoundrel-’em-up that clearly builds on Ubisoft’s familiar format, but that’s not a bad thing. The rep system in particular is interesting, as the constant fluctuations belie any kind of loyalty you might show otherwise, but most importantly, this game lets you just be in the enduring Star Wars Universe. It’s not perfect, but stealing for crime syndicates, fighting the Empire, speeding across alien landscapes, and so much more is a dream come true.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/gt7-update-1-54-gran-turismo-7-ps5-pro-patch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>‘s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> update is here, with Polyphony Digital bundling the PS5 Pro enhancements in with a regular content update for the enduring racing game. So, in addition to higher quality visuals on the mid-gen upgraded console, there’s also five new cars to hop in and drive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; Free Update - November 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OodQr_i9Ovs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>But for PS5 Pro owners, it’s the support for their new console that will be the most important thing. The PS5 Pro enhancements include a mode that combines visuals and performance modes of the base PS5, using PSSR to get smooth out any kinks in the process – though people were already able to get a huge performance boost at 120Hz even before this update.</p>
<p>Additionally you’re able to add ray traced reflections in race, with the option in the Display settings that lets you “Prioritize Ray Tracing/Resolution”. There’s also options for 8K resolution output here.</p>
<p>PSVR 2 owners will also get a boost with enhanced render quality in VR mode and smoother video playback by using reprojection.</p>

<p>Outside of that, you have five new cars – a Ford, a Merc, two Porches and a Suzuki – the Sophy AI has been added to Trial Mountain and Tokyo Expressway East Clockwise, there’s adjustments to the price of Legend Cars courtesy of Hagerty, and a smattering of other tweaks and fixes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dantes-ring-is-a-so-called-anti-combat-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-the-invincible/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's 42nd Golden Joystick Awards, which saw Black Myth: Wukong <a href="https://wccftech.com/winners-announced-at-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-black-myth-wukong-wins-ultimate-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triumph</a> in the Game of the Year category, developer Starward Industries unveiled a new game called Dante's Ring. The Polish studio's first game, as you might recall, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-invincible-exploring-the-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Invincible</a>, an adventure game adaptation of Stanisław Lem's sci-fi novel.</p>
<p>This time, the setting appears to be entirely original. Interestingly, Dante's Ring is being labeled an 'anti-combat' action RPG. What that means in practice is you'll be roaming a volcanic range with the goal of fighting against the environment, surviving, and possibly rescuing other folks. There's also going to be an element of choice, apparently, in how you navigate the various survivor factions featured in Dante's Ring. Here's the official overview:</p>
<p><em>The game focuses on rescue and survival, using retro equipment in a race against nature’s wrath among mystical beliefs. Will you fight a frenetic fire or flee from a pyroclastic flow? Break the door to rescue someone or stop and give first aid? Once the volcano’s hot breath reaches you, every second counts.</em></p>
<p><em>Dante's Ring offers a fresh approach to gameplay, focusing on avoiding combat and immersing you in a mesmerizing, eerie world where you pass through the gates of hell to save just one more life from its grasp.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>GAMEPLAY FEATURES</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Uncover the mystery hidden in the Ring of Fire.</em></li>
<li><em>Confront the untamed fury of fire with a range of retro-inspired equipment,</em></li>
<li><em>Traverse the terrain on foot or using retro inventions.</em></li>
<li><em>Solve intricate puzzles, break through obstacles, and carefully manage your supplies.</em></li>
<li><em>Find your own way to save people and animals.</em></li>
<li><em>Prepare for missions in the hub by selecting the equipment for your preferred gameplay styles/classes.</em></li>
<li><em>Complete quests and missions with outcomes that can influence the course of the story.</em></li>
<li><em>Scavenge for resources using retro tools on an island covered in a thick layer of ash.</em></li>
<li><em>Navigate complex moral choices and broker uneasy peace among diverse factions — all vying for survival.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Dante's Ring - Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IogYUUlDkSI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dante's Ring will debut next year on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988030/Dantes_Ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> Early Access. The full release is currently planned for 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ghosts of Tabor PSVR2 Release Delayed to Early 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ghosts-of-tabor-psvr2-release-date-pushed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ghosts-of-tabor-psvr2-release-date-pushed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ghosts of Tabor, the high-energy extraction shooter built exclusively for VR, has been delayed from coming to PSVR2 until early 2025, the developer has revealed. It was originally intended to be released with the ‘December wipe’ but owing to a complex development path, the team has had to delay the launch by a few months.</p>



<hr>







<p>Ghosts of Tabor has been dubbed ‘Escape from Tarkov VR’ by some, and that’s damn close to being true. Since being released in March 2023, Ghosts of Tabor has turned heads in the VR space, pulling in thousands of positive reviews and really standing out as the go-to option for anyone seeking the most immersive extraction shooter experience possible.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/ghostsoftabor/status/1859658154792955972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> and the game’s Discord server, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know the excitement around the PSVR2 launch of Ghosts of Tabor is through the roof – and trust us, we share that excitement! However, I want to be completely upfront with you: porting Tabor to PSVR2 has proven to be more complex than we anticipated, both for us and our partners.</p>



<p>To deliver the experience you deserve, we’ll need a bit more time. We’ve allocated additional resources to make this final push and are working tirelessly to bring it to you as early as possible in 2025.</p>



<p>Pre-orders will open once we’ve secured a timeline and confirmed the launch date.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Ghosts of Tabor, players enter harsh environments hellbent on surviving, and to that end, they must scavenge resources, eat, drink, and fight other players, all while seeking to secure top-tier loot and successfully extracting from the map to land a win. It has been praised for its detail and depth, and from customisation to in-game trading, there’s plenty of meat on Tabor’s bones.</p>



<p>Have you played Ghosts of Tabor yet? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

You can grab a pair for $170 at multiple major retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDH9M5W?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CMDH9M5W?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDH9M5W?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">PlayStation Pulse Elite Wireless Headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDH9M5W?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CMDH9M5W?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDH9M5W?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$130 (was $150)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you prefer a traditional over-ear headset, the Sony Pulse Elite Wireless PS5 Headset is on sale for 130 (was $150).

                <p>A long list of Scuf controllers are discounted in Amazon's Black Friday sale, giving you a chance to upgrade your gaming setup for cheap. Whether you need something premium like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VTRJGCP?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scuf Instinct Pro controller</a> or want to get into mobile gaming with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D49GBG24?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scuf Nomad</a>, you’ll find a lot of cool gadgets on sale. The deals run through December 8, though the hottest deals may go out of stock before the event officially ends.</p><p>One of the most popular Scuf controllers on sale is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VTRJGCP?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scuf Instinct Pro</a>, as it’s now just $190 (was $230). Equipped with four customizable backpaddles, support for three unique profiles, and trigger stops for faster actuation, it’s a great companion for competitive shooters. The backpaddles are a particular standout, as they’ve been built to be easily accessible without the need to reconfigure your hand position so you can quickly trigger multiple actions.</p><p>Toss in a slick design, and you’ve got a winning formula. Four different colors are eligible for the discount, and they all work with Xbox, PC, and mobile.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4401152-61ks7rskzwl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4401152" data-ratio="0.568" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4401152-61ks7rskzwl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4401152"></a><figcaption>Scuf Instinct Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4401152-61ks7rskzwl._sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>For PC gamers seeking something a bit more affordable, take a peek at the Scuf Envision Pro. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM6XBHDN?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wireless versions</a> are on sale for $150 (was $180), though a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLPG3CNT?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wired model</a> is even more affordable at $110 (was $130). Regardless of which you pick, you’ll get five remappable G-Keys along the bottom edge of the controller, four remappable backpaddles, and mouse-like mechanical switches for the face buttons and D-pad that make it ultra responsive.</p><p>Rounding out the Black Friday Scuf controller deals is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D49GBG24?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scuf Nomad</a>. Built for gaming on iPhone, the device straddles both sides of your smartphone, turning it into something akin to a Nintendo Switch. If you’re a fan of streaming Xbox Game Pass or diving into the ever-changing Apple Arcade lineup, the Nomad could be a great addition to your setup now that it’s just $60 (was $100).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/team-falcons-esports-org-of-the-year-saudi-arabia/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Esports Awards have ended for another year, and many trophies changed hands on the night. One award that has the esports community up in arms is the title of ‘Esports Organisation of the Year’, which went to Team Falcons.</p>



<p>Team Falcons was founded in 2017 but the brand made almost no waves at all until 2022, when the inaugural ‘Gamers8’ event took place in Riyadh. This Saudi Arabian organisation is backed by the nation’s government, and many have long been sceptical about the legitimacy of the organisation and its funding.</p>



<p>A while ago, The Esports Awards signed a three-year deal with Saudi Arabia’s Esports World Cup Foundation, pledging to host the event in Riyadh for the next three iterations.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-a-problem">That’s a Problem</h2>



<p>Team Falcons has investment from and ties to the Saudi Arabian government via the PIF and Savvy Games Group. The Esports World Cup, which took place earlier this year, is managed by ESL FACEIT, which is wholly owned by Savvy, and by extension, the Saudi government.</p>



<p>In August, Team Falcons won the grand championship at the Esports World Cup after winning more tournaments and fielding more teams than any other organisation in the world. Before, during, and after the event, Team Falcons was able to buy up some of the best esports players in the world to fill out rosters.</p>



<p>All this was achieved by an organisation founded in 2017, which didn’t really gain any traction until it started to receive sizeable investments from the Saudi government. It was part of what the community refers to as ‘esportswashing’, with the nation’s officials seeking to clean up the country’s image by investing heavily in esports and gaming.</p>



<p>Here are some facts:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Falcons started winning in Dota 2 this year after picking up some of the world’s best players</li>



<li>Team Falcons’ Counter-Strike exploits have gotten nowhere despite splashing the cash to sign huge players (like s1mple)</li>



<li>Team Falcons did nothing in Apex Legends until the Esports World Cup after signing one of the winningest players in the space</li>



<li>Team Falcons produced little in the way of results in Rocket League until Gamers8 and the Esports World Cup</li>



<li>Team Falcons secured a spot in the COD League (Vegas Falcons) despite having an awful track record in the game’s multiplayer scene</li>



<li>Team Falcons has dominated Warzone tournaments thanks to signing the most capable players in the space</li>
</ul>



<p>Before the Saudi line was tapped into, the only thing Team Falcons was really any good at was Fortnite, and a lot of the team’s earnings in that space had come from Gamers8, the Riyadh-based event that was replaced by the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>It’s surely becoming clear now how this is a problem with esports fans – it’s a matter of pouring as much money into the space as possible because there are no ‘financial fair play’ rules. </p>



<p>To win the Esports Organisation of the Year trophy at The Esports Awards, Team Falcons had to beat:</p>



<ul>
<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>Vitality</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Gen G</li>



<li>T1 Esports</li>



<li>Fnatic</li>



<li>Team Spirit</li>
</ul>



<p>Team Falcons’ crowning achievement for 2024 is winning an event that it flooded with teams to gain the maximum advantage possible. It also won that event, which is backed by the Saudi government, while being backed by the Saudi government, in Saudi.</p>



<p>But hey, congratulations on the award.</p>

It has full-size analog sticks and triggers, a conventional D-pad, four remappable back buttons, and curved handles that make it comfortable to hold. The analog sticks use Hall Effect sensors, which eliminates the components that cause stick drift. The analog stick caps are swappable, and each bundle comes with an extra set of caps.</p><p>It also has a built-in kickstand for tabletop mode and passthrough USB-C for charging. A companion smartphone app allows you to further customize the Nitro Deck's features. A button on the back of the controller lets you remap the four back buttons on the fly, too.</p><p>The Nitro Deck has built-in rumble and motion controls and can be used as a regular wired controller for Nintendo Switch and PC.</p><p>The hardshell carrying case fits the Switch with Nitro Deck attached perfectly.

One of the main changes with the new model is that the right stick is now above the buttons. The original Nitro Deck's low right analog stick can take some getting used to, but after spending time with the new model, I actually prefer the original layout. The exception here is first-person shooters or games where you need to move the camera a lot. In those scenarios, the Nitro Deck+ is comfier, but you'll probably want to map the face buttons to the four back triggers and/or make use of the new "sidekick" buttons--two remappable buttons next to the sticks.</p><p>The Nitro Deck+ also adds video out with an HDMI adapter, so you no longer need to remove the Switch from the cradle to dock it and play on TV. This is a welcome feature, and the bundle that's on sale comes with the HDMI adapter. The Nitro Deck+ without the adapter is also available for $20 off, dropping the price to $50.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>You can also <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVY8TBBM?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">save $10 on CRKD's NEO S wireless controllers</a></strong> for Nintendo Switch and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-the-first-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Few games let you smite hundreds of enemies with grandiose attacks as well as the long-running Dynasty Warriors series does, and so in a sense the latest one, Dynasty Warriors Origins, is competing with its past self. But with an enhanced combat system that rewards and incentivizes parrying and perfectly dodging enemy attacks and a more significant focus on telling the story of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms novels from a new perspective, it made a great first impression. These elements were all up my alley for a new Dynasty Warriors game, and playing it left me feeling a sense of wonder, intrigue, and a hunger for more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Origins was one of those odd phenomena where the images on the screen finally matched what my younger brain had seen when playing earlier games in the series. Bases were bigger, forests were lusher, and the screen was filled with more enemies for me to slash and punch on my way to victory than ever before. The spectacle and visuals of Origins are the best they've ever been, and sure, a lot of that is thanks to the power of modern hardware, but it's also the quality of everything on display. Long gone are the barren lands and mostly identical trees of Dynasty Warriors 9's open world, the repetitive textures on buildings, or the rockfaces surrounding most levels in games before that. Origins' world and characters are full of life, and each one is detailed more than ever, from their armor to their weapons. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Dynasty Warriors Origins introduces a new overworld map mechanic to traverse between battles. This diorama-like map can be explored to find various towns or cities to purchase items, NPCs to converse with, and missions to undertake. I only got to view a small portion of the map, but I did catch a glimpse of a fast-travel button, meaning there are most likely at least enough of these areas to explore to warrant the need for such a system. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I did catch a glimpse of a fast-travel button, meaning there are most likely at least enough of these areas to explore to warrant the need for such a system. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Origins' story is told from the perspective of a new original protagonist who will be interacting with important warriors such as Liu Bei, Zhang Fei, and Lu Bu. Yes, <em>that </em>Lu Bu. Origins’ story, as the title suggests, also occurs earlier than its predecessors, so the recognizable allies and enemies all have a new youthful vibrancy in and out of combat. And that combat, by the way, felt great. Every swing of my sword or staff was responsive, and perfect parries or dodges were accompanied by flashy animations, with perfect parries giving an even more considerable advantage in turning the tides on opponents.  And combos feel better than ever when chained with special moves and other abilities meant to pre-empt enemy attacks and knock them off balance. Add that to the sounds of the yellow turban army shrieking in fear and death and the cheers of my allies as my KO counter rose into the hundreds, and it felt like the quintessential Dynasty Warriors experience I had been missing for years.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some may be surprised or caught off guard when hearing about things like perfect parries or dodges in a Dynasty Warriors game. I'm happy to report that those who want to button-mash their combos through hordes of enemies will be able to do just that on the lower difficulties, just like in the older games, but for those wanting to push themselves and challenge the harder difficulties, they'll need to make full use of these systems. Playing on Hero mode saw even regular enemies removing larger portions of my health bar, which typically only happens when facing off against named generals. I put this to the ultimate test against the man, the myth, the legend Lu Bu, who fought the entire battle atop his steed until breaking his guard. His introduction is nothing short of what veterans will expect from him; he entered the scene as if he were the game's main character, instantly deleting entire squadrons of my allies and causing them to scream in terror. Now, I don't know how he scales between all the difficulties, but on the hardest one available during my demo (Hero difficulty), I managed to trigger the second phase of his fight and reduce him to under 40% before running out of healing items against his onslaught of unblockable attacks that dented over half my health per hit. This battle alone has sold me on the combat of Dynasty Warriors Origins.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Those who want to button-mash their combos through hordes of enemies will be able to do just that on the lower difficulties, just like in the older games, but for those wanting to push themselves and challenge the harder difficulties, they'll need to make full use of perfect parries and dodges.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The only immediate downside I found with Dynasty Warriors Origins so far is the inability to play in co-op, as this series has been a staple for those wanting to play co-op online or split screen with friends and siblings. While I’m not going to completely let the developers off the hook for this, there is at least a built-in compromise: during mission preparations, you can select an allied general to accompany you, and during the mission, you can take control of them for a short period of time. This helps turn the tide in battles, especially if you are low on health or want to destroy many enemies in a shorter period. These generals are much stronger than the protagonist in the game's early hours, and while I only activated the ability twice, I learned two things. First, it was incredibly fun and gave me a great taste of other weapon types, and second, it was clear that this mechanic is meant to be one of those you activate when you need to go all-in on a fight. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You also gain access to various tactics along the way, like commanding a squadron of archers to rain arrows on enemies. These abilities are fine on their own, but if you use them at the right time or in the right conditions, they can have an even more powerful effect to devastate armies and lower opponents' morale. Morale has always been another component of Dynasty Warriors, because whichever side has the higher morale gains bonuses in combat. In Origins, this is best exemplified by the red armor plates on enemy generals that reduce the damage you deal until they are all removed. Once all the yellow and red plates are removed, they become vulnerable to powerful assault attacks that make you untargetable while dealing out significant damage to both the enemy you've broken and any unlucky enemies nearby. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the customization system is back, and throughout the story, the protagonist will gain access to a handful of weapon types and skills called arts. The more you use the various weapons and arts, the more proficiency you gain to unlock new arts or upgrades for your current arts. To complement your weapons and arts, there are also several skill trees that will unlock things such as extra item slots to carry into battle, or enable the new extreme musou attacks that allow you to combine with your allies for even larger, deadlier special moves that devastate crowds and stronger enemies. Starting out, I only had access to a single sword. Still, after defeating a general, I unlocked the ability to wield their twin pikes in future missions, which will be an incentive throughout the game to challenge all the generals in a mission, not just those set as mission objectives.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dynasty Warriors Origins has the potential to be the crown jewel in the venerable series with its improved focus on combat, customization, and enhanced visuals. It's been nearly 20 years since I found myself eagerly waiting to play the newest Dynasty Warriors, but with the updates and enhancements I've seen so far in Dynasty Warriors Origins, that streak is no more. I walked away from my two-hour demo session with a renewed interest in a series I once treasured and am eager to get more time with when it releases in January. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dynasty-warriors-origins-preview-%E2%80%93-looking-for-a-comeback.1042470/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>People who know me know I'm a bit of a Three Kingdoms and Dynasty Warriors nerd. Having played every Dynasty Warriors game except the first 1v1 fighting game, add to this the Three Kingdoms novels, the historical texts, playing the other games, and watching series and films. Three Kingdoms, to me, is like other people's Rome. It's that era I'm just very interested in. Also, I like Rome, too. Anyway, <a href="https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/dw_origins/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>.</p>
<p>I recently got to go hands-on with Dynasty Warriors: Origins in Paris, invited by Koei Tecmo. I was excited and concerned because <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dynasty-warriors-9-empires-a-kingdom-in-disarray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynasty&nbsp;Warriors 9</a> wasn't good. The enjoyment of the series was always the uniqueness of the characters and their weapons: the camp nature of Zhang He and his Vega claws, Xiahou Dun and him being the coolest kid in the playground with his eye patch, or Guan Yu being the literal god of war with his ultra-long halberd, all on top of the 1 vs 1000 combat, which also moved too far into making even the regular soldiers feel like mere confetti.</p>
<p>9 demolished this by removing the uniqueness of its characters; it says there are over 90 characters, but with weapons and attacks shared between most of them, the uniqueness was lost, and even the combat felt boring. Dynasty Warriors: Origins wants to go back to basics, refresh the series in almost every way, and bring new people into the story, which was the Three Kingdoms period following the fall of the Han Dynasty.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>Or, more accurately, Dynasty Warriors: Origins tells the story of the origins of the three kingdoms. What will likely be one of the few decisions fans question is the ending of the game at Chi Bi. Those who know the history know that Chibi was the battle that stopped the early expansion of Cao Cao, leading to the formation of the three kingdoms of Shu, Wei and Wu. With the compressed timeline of 183 AD (Yellow Turban Rebellion) to 208 AD, Omega Force intends this to be a more in-depth look at China during the period and the prominent people within it.</p>
<p>With this compressed timeline comes a narrowing focus on the areas of China you will see and battle within. From what I saw in the hands-on and heard during an interview with producer Tomohiko Sho, the lands that become Shu will not feature within the game. However, the lands in a new world map will feature new core/story battles, an upgradable weapon system, side missions, skirmishes, and more.</p>
<p>Let me start by saying the world map is nothing reminiscent of the open-world element Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted. The map here is more of an overworld that you can explore, letting you find collectables or a new currency called Pyroxene, used to create boosts, join skirmishes, side battles, or core battles, or find characters to speak to and advance the story. The four hours I could play, some from the very start, some later, introduced these elements well and alleviated any concerns I had when I heard "open world".</p>
<p>I should point out it's not entirely open. There is some linearity in that areas aren't accessible until you have progressed far enough in the story. As you move to new regions, you will also find that these have their own "peace" level. This will rise as you complete missions and skirmishes, giving you incremental bonuses for filling it up.</p>
<p>With a levelling system of your character and the nine types of weapons you can use, there will undoubtedly be an advantage to grinding here and there - though it didn't feel essential. The more you level your weapons, the more you unlock extra combos and battle arts - special attacks. As you also level your character, you'll unlock stat boosts and other perks, adding additional benefits to doing more side missions and skirmishes.</p>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>


<p>It's worth saying that the story you find may not be historically accurate as you will be making decisions and siding with different forces in different battles, picking your way through events. As for who you are, you're a nameless hero, though what I've seen seems to imply you're some deity or spirit, mainly as you keep talking to people that others can't see. That and, in battle, you have supernatural abilities (or, I should say, abilities more than those of regular Dynasty Warriors characters). One such ability is called the "Eyes of the Sacred Bird", which allows you to see through the magic of the Yellow Turban officers and aspects of the battlefield like officer health.</p>
<p>In terms of the battlefield, if I were to make a comparison, this feels like a good mix of earlier and later Dynasty Warriors. The scale is there, with more enemies on the screen than ever before, but it also feels more like the earlier entries where the regular soldiers can be a threat to you. You can't simply ignore them. If you do, they can knock you off balance and damage you. You can still mow through them; you are a hero in Dynasty Warriors, but this feels like it has a good balance, particularly with the new additions to combat.</p>
<p>I've already mentioned the battle arts; these are new weapons in your arsenal and can be used to block power attacks from enemy officers and even groups of enemy soldiers on high morale and within the vicinity of their commander. Using these can certainly make the difference in a battle, as can the use of a well-timed parry or dodge, which helped me with my hands-on, allowing me to beat Lu Bu at Hu Lao gate, something I was told only 5% of the team have managed so far.</p>
<p>Another new feature of combat is the inclusion of strategies. You will have an entourage of guards that increases based on your actions, and you can have this unit perform actions, such as a volley of arrows or a charge. These are very useful in clearing soldiers or putting off a general. As battles progress, if conditions are met, you'll also find yourself in massive battles, part of "grand tactics", which can offer a sense of scale the series has pushed for but never fully represented. The coalition forces' charge on Hu Lao gate that I got to play was exceptional. It genuinely felt like thousands of soldiers charging in, the camera shaking, the music ramping up. It felt exhilarating.</p>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>


<p>Earlier, I mentioned there are "a few decisions" that fans will question. The second is linked to the fact that you control the Nameless Hero. You can select a hero who also follows you in battle, which will be dictated by where you are and the decisions you make in conversations. You can control this hero in battle once a gauge has filled up. The problem for some fans is that the number of heroes you control is limited to nine. This is the smallest roster in the series' history, which could raise some eyebrows.</p>
<p>Still, having seen the direction Omega Force is taking Dynasty Warriors: Origins, I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt here, mainly due to the story-focused direction for the player-character. Of course, there's a lot I haven't seen, but what I have seen makes me want more. You will also get to try out some of the game now, with an early demo showing exactly how confident Omega Force and Koei Tecmo are with the game.</p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins <a href="https://wccftech.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be released</a> on January 17, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S/X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-mercenary-class-hands-on-endgame-first-look<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Every time I play Path of Exile 2 – and I’ve been lucky enough to play it a few times now – I grow more confident that it’s going to be special. I’ve now played as the Hunter, Monk, Witch, Warrior, and most recently Mercenary. You’d think that I’d be tired of doing 2+ hour sessions with each of the classes, but the inverse is true. I can’t wait to dive back in. Its beta release on December 6 can’t come soon enough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m going to focus this preview on the Mercenary. While it’s not my favorite of the classes, the Mercenary is very unique in that it transforms traditional Path of Exile gameplay into what you would expect from a top-down shooter. This class, which focuses on the use of a crossbow, has you start by firing 7 rounds of bolts at any approaching enemies. You’ll then slowly unlock new skill gems that add abilities that will snipe, rapidly fire Armor Piercing Rounds, lob a grenade, freeze, set on fire, or otherwise set you up for success against the waves you’ll come across.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This transformation to a shooter is intentional, with Grinding Gear Games’ Jonathan Rogers embracing the challenge the class gave them by taking lessons from other titles in the shooter space that they then built upon. While I found that I missed the thwack of the Monk’s staff or the agility the Hunter’s bow offered I can see how the Mercenary could be an attractive option for new players who may be more familiar with other genres and entering the ARPG space for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one reason I feel the Mercenary is held back is because of the sheer amount of reloading needed, as it happens when you swap between firing modes or run out of ammo, leading to a bit more downtime than I liked in the early game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Mercenary class starts coming together and feeling quite powerful around the graveyard section of Path of Exile 2.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the class does start coming together and feeling quite powerful around the graveyard section of Path of Exile 2. This seems to be the point where all the classes really begin to come into their own and give players a peek at their endgame potential. By this point I had: a grenade launcher that shot three projectiles and did increased area of effect damage, a gun that fired ice that slowed and froze approaching enemies, and a fire shot that lit everything on fire that came near me, but also pushed back approaching mobs with force. These building blocks give you a chance to begin placing perks into the abilities you like the most. Especially because your passive skill tree journey will have likely unlocked a bonus or two that allow you to begin building the character you will use to continue through the campaign.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Into the Endgame</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A large focus of my preview event for Path of Exile 2 was a behind-closed-doors presentation focused on the endgame path you’ll be taken on. While I didn’t get hands-on time with it, Rogers took us through the endgame challenges, including a massive world map to be cleared and end-game activities that they think players will keep coming back to for hundreds of hours. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a roundtable interview, when asked about the endgame he said, “If we don’t have a good endgame going into early access, then Path of Exile 1 players are just going to say, ‘Hey this is just a worse game.’ We need that stuff to be able to actually make a POE1 player feel like, ‘Oh yeah, you know what? This is a true sequel to POE1.’” And boy does it look like they delivered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To give you a peek into what’s planned for December, the first half of the campaign, including Acts 1-3, will launch first and should take you around 25 hours to complete. The endgame awaiting you after campaign completion promises a lot of exciting new ways to power up your build. I got a small sneak peek at some of those endgame chases as part of a 2-hour presentation detailing several of the modes you’ll be able to chase.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are eight primary endgame modes planned at the launch of early access, you’ll be introduced to a few during the campaign. They include several sequels to popular leagues from the original Path of Exile, with more to be launched during early access. I saw the Trial of Sekhemas, which has you enter a series of rooms that each have unique challenges, like filling a blood chalice by defeating red enemies in the area. Or surviving increasingly difficult enemy spawns before a timer runs out. These floors each have several challenges like this, and at the end of each, after a boss fight, you’ll have a choice to cash in keys you’ve collected or proceed to the next level for a chance at better loot. Die, or have your “honor” reduced to zero by being hit too many times and you’ll be kicked back to the beginning. To improve your chances, there’s water you’ll collect that works as a currency to buy items during your run and help you along. Some relics can also be found or crafted. One relic teased the chance at a coveted unique item, but you’d be forced to complete this Trial with only 1hp.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are eight primary endgame modes planned at the launch of early access.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the rewards, this will also give you access to the Altar of Ascendency, where you get to pick one of three Ascendency classes at the end. In early access there will only be two Ascendency classes to start with. We got a peek at the Witch’s Infernalist Ascendency class that lets you summon a hellhound who will set everything next to it on fire once it is summoned. It also had the bonus of being the one who takes damage for you if you’re hit.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">They also showed off the Witch’s Demon Form that allows you to become a winged monster who is faster, does more damage, and casts spells faster, but also takes damage as you remain in the form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep in mind this is just the first endgame mode, which on its own seems like it would be able to provide hundreds of hours of fun challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also got a peek at another endgame system called the Temple of Chaos, which will be encountered in act 3. This Temple can be entered after you acquire a token from the trial master, and the event was called a sequel to the Ultimatum league from Path of Exile 1. You enter the Temple, and pick a modifier like Blood Globules (which are globby blood orbs that will spawn and follow you around in the sky before falling quickly to earth in an attempt to damage you). Or Shocking Turrets that make a grid of electricity occasionally shoot across the battlefield. These modifiers stack, and you’ll still need to complete the normal map challenges like trying to survive, killing everything in the room, or escorting a giant hammer across the map until it reaches its destination.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Path of Exile 2 Ranger Class</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And the final endgame activities revolved around the Ziggurat location, where you can access a world map and travel to various spots to dispel corruption. Here you can clear towers, defeat bosses, or clear Breaches. There's also the Expedition League sequel that has you plant dynamite across a map to unearth cool loot and unlock new abilities on gear. There are Delirium maps that increase difficulty and allow you to earn more passives from your passive tree. And they even teased an Uber Pinnacle boss that you'll need unique keys to access. They said that the Uber Pinnacle boss would offer a challenge for longtime players as it’s promised to be the hardest content in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rewards included a new gem system for your weapons, armor, and passive skill tree. The latter gives you the ability to socket unique gems into the tree that give you enhancements to anything unlocked in the vicinity of the socket, or additional boosts that give you the chance to further empower your build. And all of that is on top of an entirely unique Atlas skill tree which will let you unlock perks that are specifically tied to each of the endgame modes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Buckle Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s so much to cover from the Path of Exile 2 preview event and I’m only scratching the surface here. Each of the modes described could have an entire video dedicated to discussing strategies and options for tackling them to get player rewards. There’s going to be an almost overwhelming amount of loot to chase across several systems to keep me entertained and I can’t wait. One note from the Grinding Gear Games team was that at the start, everything I’ve described is only half the content. The playable classes, number of story acts, enemies and bosses will all double throughout the early access period, with more league sequels also on the docket for endgame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Path of Exile 2 will be free to play, but to get in on December 6th for early access you’ll need to buy a $30 supporter key which will also give you in-game currency to spend. However, if you’ve spent $500 or more in the last 10 years of the original Path of Exile then you’ll get in for free for being a longtime supporter.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

And, if you’ve been confused where your Photo Mode images go, wonder no more: The file path is now shown in game when you take screenshots, and file names are simplified (with the date now included). You can also bind your arrow keys to input mappings now.</p><h2 id="h77117"><a id="gamepay"></a>Gameplay Changes</h2><p>As far as gameplay goes, you can now compare new rings against currently equipped rings in <em>either </em>slot, and the Glint option description is a little different. Some weapons got new icons to help differentiate them, and it’s easier to see where your companion’s Enchantments are.</p><figure id="" data-id="b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-recommend-id="image://b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1456" data-height="819" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-recommend-id="image://b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1456" data-height="819" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Extended dodge also won’t get weirdly wonky for Rooks of the ‘Mage’ persuasion., Some skill text has been changed to be more clear (and accurate), and Antaam Champions do a bit more damage (as intended), and instances where enemies and companions would get stuck or in out-of-reach places have been alleviated. Speaking of fixes, that brings us to the bugs that Patch 3 aims to squash.</p><h2 id="h77118"><a id="bugs"></a>Bug Fixes</h2><p>All kinds of bug fixes are included, but not all of them will have obvious or substantial effects. The general focus is on fixing issues encountered during cutscenes, mesh and polygon interactions, and some incredibly minor balance adjustments to get some items to work as they were originally intended to.</p><p>Getting into specifics, Rook won’t suddenly change body shapes or adopt strange expressions during or after certain cutscenes. Some other cutscene issues were fixed as well, including strange, stretchy cloaks and clothing clipping through the character.

<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved strategy games. It started as real-time strategy matches against AI opponents in titles like Age of Empires, Age of Mythology, and Company of Heroes. I quickly found myself drawn to base-building and colony sim titles for the sense of progression and expansion they offer, though, and few compare to RimWorld. But then, there’s also Oxygen Not Included. They’re both exceptional, both offering countless hundreds or, in some cases, thousands of hours of gameplay. Which do you choose? Why not both? You can score two of the best colony sim games for under $35 with the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/46465/Terraform_Titans_Duo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Terraform Titans Duo</a> bundle on Steam!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rimworld">What is RimWorld?</h2>



<p>RimWorld is often considered the quintessential colony sim game, following in the footsteps of titles like Dwarf Fortress but offering a unique spin on the story generation mechanics. You’ll take control of a science fiction-fueled colony full of intelligent pawns that must contend with unique enemies, flora, fauna, psychology, climate, interpersonal relationships, and more.</p>



<p>After spending 1,000 hours playing the game, I can tell you that even the base version is worth every penny. But with the expansions and countless mods, you’ll easily score hundreds of hours from RimWorld if it’s your type of game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-oxygen-not-included">What is Oxygen Not Included?</h2>



<p>Also in the bundle, we have Oxygen Not Included. It’s another sci-fi colony sim game that focuses on the dynamic crew as they overcome obstacles, like alien lifeforms while harnessing the power of the asteroid they’re currently stranded on. For instance, you must consider logistics, like piping water and waste to and from the colony, to ensure no one falls ill. It’s complex and compelling in equal measures.</p>



<p>With ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ reviews, Oxygen Not Included is a grand time for any colony sim or base-building game fan!</p>



<h2 id="h-score-them-both">Score Them Both!</h2>



<p>With this partnership between Ludeon Studios and Klei Entertainment, you can currently score both colony sim games for less than $35. Oxygen Not Included is on sale, dropping the price of the bundle to its current total. You really cannot pass this one up!</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments below if you grab the bundle! Don’t forget to stop by and share screenshots of your colony in our General Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<hr>



<p>Did you know it can cost up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-can-cost-up-to-500000-for-a-spot-on-opening-night-live-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$500,000 for a spot on Opening Night Live 2025</a>? That’s an insane price to pay, and many indie developers can’t afford such extreme advertising costs!</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-watch-the-fortnite-remix-finale-event-featuring-juice-wrld/1100-6527953/" data-ref-id="1100-6527953">Fortnite Chapter 5 and Remix Finale event</a> takes the stage in-game on November 30, it will feature a pack of four iconic musical artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and Juice WRLD. Like previous in-game concerts, such as those starring Travis Scott and Ariana Grande, the event is likely to be a kaleidoscopic audiovisual roller coaster. Still, by including the late Juice WRLD, who passed away in 2019, this in-game concert will also be decidedly different from any before seen in Fortnite: It will be the first to use an artist's likeness posthumously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alien-romulus-director-defends-use-of-a-i-in-new-movie/1100-6525952/">something that Hollywood is also grappling with as of late</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot recently spoke to Nate Nanzer, Epic's head of global partnerships, in a music-focused interview that hit on the developer-publisher's decision to bring Juice WRLD, whose real name is Jarad Anthony Higgins, to Fortnite. Nanzer told me Epic had long hoped to do something like this with the late artist and explained why the company feels now is the right time.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something that our players have been asking for for years and years and years, and we've wanted to do it, but we wanted to find the right moment," Nanzer said. "We obviously want to do it in the most respectful way possible. We worked very closely with his mom and his label, and we were able to find the right moment where it felt right, around this event, and he has new music coming out, so all the stars kind of aligned around this moment."</p><p dir="ltr">Nanzer mentioned that Juice WRLD himself was "a big Fortnite player," and though the Epic executive didn't say this, it stands to reason that Juice WRLD would want to be in the game if he could say so today. Still, even with the involvement of his family and his music label, for some, the inclusion of a deceased artist's likeness in this manner may always cross a line. In the movie world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robert-downey-jr-plans-to-sue-anyone-who-makes-an-ai-replica-of-him/1100-6527453/">Robert Downey Jr. recently said he plans to sue anyone who tries to create an AI replica of his likeness</a>, and that even if it were to occur after he has died, his "law firm will still be very active." Events in 2012 surely predate many of Fortnite's biggest fans, but the Juice WRLD concert also recalls the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGbrFmPBV0Y">Tupac "hologram" that once performed at Coachella</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403773" data-ratio="0.6015625" data-width="896" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403773"></a><figcaption>Epic says players have begged for a Juice WRLD in-game concert, but when--if ever--is the right time for it?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the Fortnite world, I haven't personally seen a lot of pushback to Juice WRLD's involvement in next weekend's event. Certainly, there have been some feelings of ethics-based squeamishness, but the prevailing sentiment on places like the game's subreddit and popular Discord servers is one of excitement, perhaps owing to the often younger player pool in Fortnite. Whereas older players and onlookers may see this as a line being crossed, younger players who have already spent years growing up within Fortnite may more quickly accept this as a marvel of modern technology, and they may be excited to finally have the Fortnite Juice WRLD event Nanzer says has been one of the community's most requested.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our community loves his music. We have data [that shows he is] still extremely popular. And I would say, I can't quantify this, but when I look at Reddit threads, or Discord chats, or Twitter threads, Juice WRLD comes up over and over and over again. I mean, people have made Juice WRLD concerts in Fortnite Creative and [Unreal Engine for Fortnite]."</p><p dir="ltr">Nanzer added that he feels fans of the late artist will come out of the event with positive feelings. "We're hopeful. We know our players have been asking for it, so there's a lot of pressure to really deliver it the right way. I think people are really gonna love what we have coming, like, I think it's done in an awesome way. I think if you're a Juice WRLD fan, you're gonna feel good about it," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">As mentioned, Juice WRLD's mother, Carmela Wallace, was involved in this collaboration. Earlier this month, she shared remarks on the upcoming event, which you can read in full below.</p><p dir="ltr">"Jarad always loved to play Fortnite - it was more than just entertainment for him, it was a way to connect with others. From a young age, video games were a part of how he bonded with friends and family, and being in Fortnite is an incredible tribute to that connection. I know he would be overjoyed to see how his love for games continues to bring people together across different spaces, just like his music does.”</p><p dir="ltr">The debate over when it is or isn't acceptable to use a deceased person's likeness won't end when Fortnite Chapter 5 does next weekend, but Nanzer told me the company wants "music to permeate everything in Fortnite," which likely means this isn't the last time Fortnite will court controversy, even unintentionally, as it strives to fulfill its vision of a multimedia metaverse. In fact, there are already rumors that a future Fortnite collaboration will revolve around XXXTentacion, a musical artist who was murdered in 2018 at the age of 20.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite is a tastemaker on a global scale. Much of the games industry over the past half-decade has been mired in chasing lucrative trends that Fortnite started or had massive success with. Once meant to be nothing more than a survival game, Fortnite is today an increasingly hard-to-define platform that doesn't merely feature pop culture; it shapes it. As Epic continues down this path of making the ultimate <em>everything</em> experience, it's inevitably molding what the future looks like, whether we're ready to live there or not.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><em>Editor's note: Remarks from Mrs. Wallace were added to the body of this story shortly after publishing.</em></p>

But as much as <em>The Veilguard </em>can be defined by its similarities to games of the past, so, too, is it notable for its differences. More than probably any sequel BioWare has put out in nearly 20 years, <em>The Veilguard </em>makes a calculated attempt at a clean break from previous games in its series in terms of choice and consequence.

Is it an anthology putting multiple heroes into a game of hot potato with the universe’s crises? Or could it learn a thing or two from its science fiction sibling <em>Mass Effect,</em> and commit to being a series built on choice and consequence rather than feeling burdened by it? More so than past games, <em>The Veilguard </em>positions the series to go either way, and its failings are evidence that BioWare needs to make a decision one way or another as it moves on to whatever comes next.</p><figure id="" data-id="def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-recommend-id="image://def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrigan and Rook look up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Morrigan and Rook look up at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-recommend-id="image://def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrigan and Rook look up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>BioWare’s messaging on why it made the call to shave cross-game connectivity down to three choices and a character creator has been spotty, with the team claiming they only imported choices <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they could meaningfully represent</a></span>. <em>The Veilguard </em>gives us a new, heavily customizable protagonist in Rook, a mercenary recruited by fan-favorite party member Varric, and it takes place in the northern regions of Thedas, far removed from the events of the previous <em>Dragon Ages</em>.

Overall, we still get a flattened version of that character, one who arguably should have been the protagonist fighting against Solas, the ex-party member turned antagonist. I played my Inquisitor as a resentful atheist dragged into a holy war, but the man who bears his title in <em>The Veilguard</em> only resembles him in voice, not beliefs. In a vacuum, I don’t blame BioWare for not being able to match the very particular story I wrote in my head with a pre-defined character. But that problem could have been solved if I had been controlling him this time around.<br></p><p><em>The Veilguard </em>only imports three choices, but it doesn’t feel fully disconnected from games of the past. A lot of its narrative comes from worldbuilding we’ve watched unfold over 15 years. Multiple characters like <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>’ Witch of the Wilds Morrigan, <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s storyteller Varric, and <em>Inquisition</em>’s Tevinter pariah Dorian make appearances throughout the game in roles of varying importance. BioWare carefully writes around the specifics of what you might have done in previous games so each of these party members could have feasibly ended up where they have regardless of what you’ve done. The handling of <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s Isabela is more questionable, as dialogue in <em>The Veilguard </em>heavily implies she was recruited during the second game, though it’s possible to play <em>II </em>without her in your party if you don’t actually get around to asking her to join. This is a very specific scenario that few players probably ever saw, but it’s an example of how, even as BioWare tries to be respectful of past choices (largely by not bringing most of them up), some paths are bound to slip through the cracks.</p><figure id="" data-id="7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-recommend-id="image://7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Inquisitor and Rook sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor and Rook sit at a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-recommend-id="image://7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Inquisitor and Rook sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Admittedly this is the kind of nitpicking that only the sickest of sickos like me could ever engage in because we’re the only ones who even notice, but it’s the trap BioWare has set for itself. Establishing choice, consequence, and carryover as a pillar of your studio’s ethos means that fans can spend years imagining what their decisions might mean in the future, only for the reality to not match the theories that have been spreading through the community as what seemed like huge choices end up being a mere footnote in the grand scheme of things. Some of the biggest choices in previous games ended up funneling to the same outcome, and people were inevitably upset to see that magnified tenfold in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s limited import.<br></p><p>It’s clear that BioWare has aspirations that often get gradually chipped away throughout development as time and resources restrict what’s possible. Fans have datamined <em>Veilguard </em>files that imply some decisions that weren’t imported were meant to be at one point in production, and there’s an art book full of references to choices and consequences that never made it into the final game. Ex-<em>Dragon Age </em>writer David Gaider has been dropping bombs on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbfwg2555s22&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbfwg2555s22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a></span> about the logistics of recognizing different decisions in sequels. The actual, realistic possibilities of reactivity in these games will likely never match the expectations. Having existed in online BioWare spaces for over a decade, I know a lot of fans want a diverging main plot in response to their decisions, but that’s often not feasible given the budget and time constraints of AAA games.</p><p>That’s the promise we imagine when we talk about choice and consequence, right? Games like <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>could be, in a perfect world, digital choose-your-own-adventure books or tabletop games that react to every little thing we do with an infinite number of outcomes and branching paths. But if that isn’t feasible, what is reasonable to expect?<em> Mass Effect</em>, despite its problems and some glaring exceptions, was able to deliver on some major choices by the time <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><em>Mass Effect 3</em></a></span> rolled around thanks to its fixed perspective of protagonist Commander Shepard. <em>Dragon Age </em>has pulled off stunning moments like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-nearly-brought-back-another-h-1851704334&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-nearly-brought-back-another-h-1851704334">Here Lies the Abyss questline</a></span>, but none of those change the core plot. Perhaps some disappointment over this is on fans for not having more measured hopes, but I can’t help but feel like <em>Dragon Age </em>is fundamentally ill-equipped to deliver the choice and consequence that BioWare’s pedigree has conditioned people to expect.</p><figure id="" data-id="8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-recommend-id="image://8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hawke, Varric, and the Inquisitor speak at Skyhold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hawke, Varric, and the Inquisitor speak at Skyhold." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-recommend-id="image://8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hawke, Varric, and the Inquisitor speak at Skyhold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Dragon Age </em>is, ostensibly, an anthology. It jumps around the world of Thedas and, with each new entry, gives us a new protagonist to inhabit and a different problem to solve. Meanwhile, it also imports choices from previous games as it teleports us to the other side of the universe. <em>Dragon Age </em>has always wanted to have its cake and eat it too. The stories it tells are so directly tied to the people at their center that the protagonist switch that occurs with each new game has always felt like an arbitrary choice, not one that actually serves the tales it’s telling. <em>The Veilguard</em>’s flattening of the Inquisitor<em> </em>was the most damning example, but <em>Inquisition</em>’s transition from <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s Hawke to the Inquisitor was hardly seamless. Corypheus, the antagonist of <em>Inquisition</em>, debuted in <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s <em>Legacy </em>DLC and was directly tied to the family lineage of Hawke. When the Champion of Kirkwall appeared in <em>Inquisition</em> as a customizable NPC, they were similarly flattened and also unwilling to stick around to solve the problem they’d started in the previous game. When the heroes we embody are so quickly discarded, even when they have deep personal ties to what’s going on, is it so surprising that the minutiae also falls down the chasm with them?<br></p><p>Now that <em>The Veilguard </em>has only imported three choices, none of which acknowledge the specifics of the larger world, it’s interesting to look at the game and realize that a lot of its big decisions feel more insular than those in previous games, like they might not need to be imported into the next one. Broadly, the main plot of stopping the elven gods doesn’t change no matter what you do, and even the final choice is more about deciding the flavor with which the same final event happens. Most of the variables you can alter happen within the story of <em>The Veilguard</em>, rather than the story of <em>Dragon Age </em>writ large. That isn’t to say the game isn’t gesturing toward the future; it’s just that there are fewer choices that feel like they’re being put on a shelf to be examined later, even as the game essentially wraps up most of the lingering lore threads of the past and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-executors-loghain-1851700436&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-executors-loghain-1851700436">paves the way for a new conflict</a></span>.</p><p>All that being said, the final image we see in <em>The Veilguard </em>is a Marvel-esque tease indicating that the titular group “remains vigilant.” BioWare has already confirmed that it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has no DLC plans</a></span> for the game as it shifts focus to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">fifth <em>Mass Effect</em></a></span>, so whatever comes next, it sounds like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830">the party</a></span> is going to play some part in the next game. And after seeing the way <em>The Veilguard </em>handled the Inquisitor, I don’t want the same fate to befall Rook, with them turned into another flattened version of a previous <em>Dragon Age </em>protagonist. If <em>The Veilguard </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-at-war-with-itself&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-at-war-with-itself" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essentially wipes the slate clean</a></span>, BioWare has the opportunity to go one of two ways: doubling down on the anthology format that hasn’t worked for the series and gradually making choice and consequence a smaller pillar of its identity, or trying something more focused that doesn’t have to draw from every side of the universe but can better represent player choice.</p><figure id="" data-id="0c0ffef770bdba4e55958edfbefed283" data-recommend-id="image://0c0ffef770bdba4e55958edfbefed283" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrigan, Rook, and the Inquisitor talk to Solas." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Morrigan, Rook, and the Inquisitor talk to Solas." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c0ffef770bdba4e55958edfbefed283" data-recommend-id="image://0c0ffef770bdba4e55958edfbefed283" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrigan, Rook, and the Inquisitor talk to Solas." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This has been my 1600-word lead-up to my real point: Rook should be the protagonist of the next <em>Dragon Age </em>game. Many of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s big decisions feel so tied to them, their relationships, and their experiences as a mercenary dragged into a leadership role, that they feel primed to serve as the face of the franchise moving forward. They’ve found alliances across all of northern Thedas, have storylines that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-harding-davrin-death-alive-survive-1851697615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-harding-davrin-death-alive-survive-1851697615">don’t seem tied up yet</a></span>, and their arc in <em>The Veilguard</em> seems destined for more stories. Just because <em>Dragon Age </em>has handed off old conflicts to new heroes with each new game in the past doesn’t mean it has to keep doing so. If BioWare wants a fresh start, it’s the perfect time to try something new.<br></p><p><em>Dragon Age</em>’s biggest problem with continuity was never that carrying choices over in a meaningful way was impossible, it was that its constant expansion in scope and shifting perspective made it more difficult to craft stories that satisfactorily reflected the choices made. <em>The Veilguard </em>can serve as a new beginning. Letting it<em> </em>function as a kind of narrative starting point from which to branch out, along with letting Rook provide a consistent perspective through which we can experience the chapter or chapters to come, all approached with more forethought than we’ve seen the series demonstrate in the past, would be the best use of this game’s potential.</p><p>If we’re shedding the old to make way for something new, it’s worth examining the shortcomings of the past. I don’t know what BioWare has planned for the next <em>Dragon Age</em>, but I would love to see the studio take a leap of faith with a hero who hasn’t been sanded down into an NPC yet. <em>Dragon Age </em>has had multiple chances to find its own Commander Shepard. The best time to do it would have been when the Inquisitor was in the spotlight ten years ago. The next best time is right now. Rook spends all of <em>The Veilguard </em>learning to be a leader, and now that the training wheels are off, maybe it’s time to let one person steer the ship.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game is a big open-world FPS that is all about surviving extreme situations with very few resources in a digital recreation of the very real Chornobyl Exclusion Zone filled with (not real) mutants, monsters, and mercenaries. And while you might not be shocked to hear that in this harsh and painful video game world you sometimes have to kill wildlife, you might be surprised by how often it ends up being a dog at the end of your barrel. </p><p>Within the first 20 minutes of booting up <em>Stalker 2</em> on Xbox Series X I was forced to gun down a dog that attacked me in the  prologue. I didn’t think much of it, but I also don’t really mind killing <em>anything </em>in a game. Perhaps I’m a cold bastard. Perhaps its because I grew up in a rural area where animals died frequently due to coyotes, cold, and so on. Not sure. </p><p>But as I continued to play, more dogs kept getting killed. And even I, a cold-blooded monster in video games, started to feel weird about it. </p><p>Sure, the dogs in<em> Stalker 2</em> are mutated a bit, but they still growl, bark, and whimper when shot, and they look an awful lot like a dog you might have as a pet, so it still might be uncomfortable for some.</p><p>For example, right after the prologue/tutorial section wraps up, a cutscene plays in which a dog bites your character’s foot and wakes you up. Before he can shoot it, the poor animal is grabbed by a weird radioactive anomaly and spun into an explosion of blood and skin. </p><p>Then, I had to kill a few more dogs on my way to a town where I could get quests, buy and sell loot, and stash some of my stuff. I wondered if there were other enemies in the game. (There are and <em>oh god</em> they are deadly and scary.)</p><p>Once I reached town and watched a few cutscenes, I talked to a bartender and asked about work. He gave me two missions, one of which involved tracking down some stray dogs and killing them. Then, after I left the bar and explored the town, a different NPC called out to me and asked I wanted to help out with a job. The job? Killing a pack of dogs. At this point, I did start to wonder if everyone in this town hated dogs. </p><p>Leaving town to do a different quest involving a person hiding from a few different groups, I tracked down a possible location for the target. I arrived and ran into bandits who just so happened to have a bunch of wild dogs in their base. I mean, I assume they were wild strays because when I killed them after they attacked me, nobody in the base cared at all. Perhaps they’re even more coldhearted than me?</p><p>This all happened in the first 3 to 4 hours of <em>Stalker 2.</em> As I continued to play, the dog killing became a bit less common, but they are an enemy you’ll run into a lot and NPCs will ask you to kill them during (what I think are) randomly generated quests. </p><p>So if the idea of killing a dog in a video game makes you squeamish or it just sounds like a shitty experience, than I’d recommend not playing <em>Stalker 2</em>. And if you do enjoy killing dogs in games, that’s...weird, but uh, boy, this new game is for you! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's a perfect time for Iron Wolves to be thankful as Destiny 2's Iron Banner event will make its return next week. The Iron Banner usually brings along new weapons and ornaments, and this event will be no different as it introduces both a new armor set and rocket sidearm into the the loot pool. </p><p>On Bungie's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-11-21-24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week In Destiny</a> announcements, the name of the armor set was revealed--Iron Intent--with pieces "worthy of Weyloran, Nirwen, and Orewig" themselves. Players will know those names as great Iron Lords, who've all had weapons and ornaments named after them throughout the years. The Iron Banner will return to the game starting on November 26, with the match type of Control for the first week.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403765"></a><figcaption>The new Iron Banner armor set, Iron Inent, for Titan, Warlock, and Hunter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg"></figure><p>The armor has a Norse-adjacent aesthetic with the Titan helmet almost looking like a hammer with the Warlock mask having studded horns. All three have intricate braiding embossing up and down the plates. Destiny has had similar ornaments before with the Valhund set, but still very different in presentation.</p><p>Along with the Iron Intent set, the announcement teased the first-ever Stasis rocket sidearm. It also revealed that it would be possible to get the weapon with the Loose Change perk with Chill Clip perks. As Iron Banner events are now two weeks long, there's plenty of time to get the perfect roll on the new weapon. The few rocket sidearms in the game have proven to be excellent, and the current Artifact has a lot of Stasis weapon-centric perks, so it should be a pretty desirable weapon. </p><p>The previous Iron Banner brought new versions of old favorites, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-claws-of-the-wolf-god-roll-guide/1100-6524666/" data-ref-id="1100-6524666">Claws of the Wolf</a> pulse rifle and Crimil's Dagger hand cannon. This will be the last time the banner is raised and Lord Saladin's sigil is lit during this episode, and if you missed out, it's a great time to make your enemies hear the howls and know fear.</p>
