		<p>Sumo Group has announced it is reducing its global workforce by 15%, which equates to 250 people, and the first studio that has been impacted is Timbre Games. Staff of Timbre Games took to social media to confirm they had been told the studio would be closed, with Sumo Group confirming the news to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-sumo-group-closing-timbre-games">GameIndustry.biz</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement yesterday, Sumo Group confirmed the plans to layoff staff across its operations. The statement said, <em>“Every day the incredibly talented people across Sumo studios are dedicated to creating great games and bringing ground-breaking experiences to players worldwide. That work and dedication over the past 21 years has helped to put Sumo on the map and build a family of studios that are second to none, and we are incredibly proud of what Sumo has become.</em></p>


<p><em>Whilst Sumo has been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced, we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward.</em></p>
<p><em>The difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways is a direct result of these challenges, and unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support. Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India.</em></p>
<p><em>This is an incredibly challenging process to go through for everyone at Sumo and our focus is now on supporting our people and working with our partners on their games as we move forward to ensure we emerge from this difficult time, ready for the future.”</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/19/british-developer-sumo-digital-acquired-by-tencent-1-3-billion/">Sumo Group was acquired by Tencent for a sum of $1.3 billion</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>

<p>
There's some good stuff coming in June, then - Monster Hunter Rise being an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-rise-review-the-switchs-best-game-since-breath-of-the-wild">absolute treat</a> for action fans, while Crusader Kings 3 and Anno 1800 both serve up some superb historical strategy, even if they both approach it from completely different directions. Chuck in those perennial Lego favourites, some enjoyable (if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-us-is-a-vast-vibrant-platformer-with-a-muddled-heart">rather muddled</a>) ecological platforming in After Us, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-2024-review">quietly revolutionary</a> Football Manager 2024, and there's a lot to love.
</p>
<p>
As for Premium subscribers specifically, June adds one new PSVR 2 title to the catalogue alongside three Classics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Kayak VR: Mirage (PSVR2)</li>
<li>LEGO Star Wars 2: The Original Trilogy (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Ghosthunter (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Daxter (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
All the above join PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium on 18th June - but while one hand is busy offering welcoming handshakes to the newcomers, the other will be waving fond farewells to Sony's latest list of catalogue departures, which this time are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>GTA 5 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>MotoGP 23 (PS5, PS4)</li>

<li>Monster Jam Steel Titans (PS4)</li>
<li>Unturned (PS4)</li>
<li>Brothers:A Tale of Two Sons (PS4)</li>
<li>DC League of Super-Pets: The Adventures of Krypto and Ace (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Dodgeball Academia (PS4)</li>

<li>Baja: Edge of Control (PS4)</li>
<li>The Wild at Heart (PS4)</li>
<li>Indivisible (PS4	)</li>

The site, called EpicDB, was taken offline shortly after it posted information scraped from the Epic Games Store catalog on Monday, but that didn’t stop people from scanning the list and posting their findings.</p><p>You can see the list of games from publishers like Bethesda, Sega, Sony, Square Enix, and others in a series of screenshots posted by a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-lot-of-unannounced-games-are-leaking-via-epicdb.898755/">user on a <em>ResetEra</em> forum</a>. While some, like <em>Turok</em>, are easy to spot, others are listed under previously rumored codenames, such as <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-the-new-bioshock-has-been-in-the-works-for-yea-1840314561">“Parkside<em>” </em>or <em>BioShock 4</em></a>. </p><p>There are still other titles under codenames we haven’t heard about. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/?share_id=6m1QV-LYimeoJ1TcX40o5&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">Some users speculate</a> that “Momo” could point to a <em>Final Fantasy 9</em> remake, while “Selma” may be the PC port of <em>Red Dead Redemption 1</em>. The codename “Utah” could also hint at the PC version of<em> The Last of Us Part 2</em>, which is rumored to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/the-last-of-us-part-2-is-reportedly-ready-to-launch-on-pc">be almost ready to launch</a>.</p><p>Epic Games has since pushed an update preventing sites like EpicDB from scraping its list of unpublished games. “We released an update tonight so third-party tools can’t surface any new unpublished product titles from the Epic Games Store catalog,”&nbsp;Epic Games said in a statement provided to <em>Wccftech. The Verge</em> reached out to Epic Games with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.</p><p>But with so many other titles listed under unknown codenames, like CurlyWurly from Sega and Brownie from Bethesda, internet sleuths still have plenty of mysteries to figure out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-lets-you-stick-with-one-protagonist-for-most-of-the-game-exploration-loop-is-sherlock-like/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be the first new entry since 2020's Valhalla. In that game, players had to choose at the start whether to play with a female or male main character (Eivor Varinsdottir), but in the new installment, there will be two separate protagonists: the shinobi Naoe and the samurai Yasuke.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering to which extent Assassin's Creed Shadows will dictate who you're playing with, associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-preview-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told GamesRadar</a> that players would be able to stick with their favorite protagonist for most of the game if they wish.</p>
<p><em>If you want to be only one character, you can for most of the game. So we're not really strong-arming anyone to switch back and forth. There are setups that are definitely better with Naoe, such as, if there's a bunch of bandits in a cavern that is very, very dark, sure you can go with Yasuke, but if you go with Naoe, it'll be quicker because it's in the dark. So there are some hints like this, but other than story missions that are particularly tailor made for one or the other, we don't specify who needs to be played at this moment, it's up to the players.</em></p>
<p>This is a similar approach to Marvel's Spider-Man 2, another game with dual protagonists in which you could play as either Miles Morales or Peter Parker during most of the open-world missions.</p>
<p>In case you're interested in the differences between Naoe and Yasuke, our <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-forward-presentation-and-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freshly posted</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows preview from Summer Game Fest outlines them very clearly:</p>
<p><em>A massive studded club was Yasuke’s primary weapon in the Assassin’s Creed Shadows demos, which would be swung around like a baseball bat and squish ashigaru skulls like overripe tomatoes. For enemies that take more than a single strike to down, Yasuke’s mighty swings rip through the air and smash into their armor to strip their breastplates off in the streets. Charged attacks and a trio of special skills each operated on cooldowns mix up his brutish swings all the while having the fortitude to shrug off intense blows.</em></p>
<p><em>On the other hand, Naoe hearkens back to the more refined assassination styles. In addition to the single hidden blade, this plucky shinobi wields a shorter katana and a chain-and-sickle weapon called a kusarigama. With the latter, Naoe can swing a massive chain around for crowd control but also stun enemies with the weighted end before closing the distance and stabbing the foe with the sickle end (sometimes taking more than one stab to finish them out in brutal fashion). As a much smaller and more nimble combatant, Naoe does more with her agile frame to dodge and jump around the battlefield to sidestep enemy attacks that glow red (blue-highlighted attacks, on the other hand, can be blocked and parried)</em></p>
<p>In the aforementioned Gamesradar interview, Simon Lemay-Comtois also talked about introducing a more enticing exploration loop that rewards gathering information in a Sherlock Holmes-like fashion.</p>
<p><em>Early on, we decided to break the rules as much as we could on the conception of Assassin's Creed Shadows. So we tried to go and change the formula as much as we could. That's one of the places where we've heard the criticism, we ourselves wanted to push the exploration to be more engaging to the player, to want to discover things rather than just sinking into something and being fed information. So it's something new that we try to work into the game. And since it's working, we kind of built it throughout all the quests and the missions that you can do in the game. Now, I will say there is still a guided mode that players can opt into, which is more classic. It will tell you where to go and stuff like that, but the basic mode, our new exploration loop, is more about playing Sherlock Holmes a little bit and having to work for the reward at the end.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to launch on November 15 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, Mac, and iPad.</p>

This refers to when players can romance any paramour regardless of their character’s gender. Games like this are often criticized for making characters feel like they are molded by the player’s presence, rather than people with their own individual identities. <em>Dragon Age 2’s</em> four main romanceable characters are all bisexual, but the game has a storyline involving party member Anders, whose past relationship with a man is only brought up if protagonist Hawke is a man. <em>DA2</em> writer David Gaider told <em>Kotaku </em>in February this was meant to distinguish Anders’ relationship with male or female versions of Hawke, but recognizes this comes off like the mage’s identity was a switch to be flipped in hindsight.</p><p>“Unfortunately, we just didn’t have enough time to get enough feedback and iterate on those situations,” he said. “We would hit a particular interaction, we would make a judgment call either as a group or the writer on their own, and that was it. There was no time for anything more than one gut-check, which is probably not the way to go.”</p><p><em>The Veilguard</em>, meanwhile, seems to be going out of its way to make it clear each of its party members are pansexual, regardless of who Rook is or if they’re <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-emmrich-volkarin-romance-1851535012&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-emmrich-volkarin-romance-1851535012">initiating a relationship with them</a></span>. In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy?&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, <em>Veilguard </em>director Corinne Busche said the team was cognizant of how these player-facing relationships can be “off-putting,” and wants to make it clear that each of these characters’ identities are independent of the player. This can be through their other previous romantic histories, or future love stories that have yet to unfold.</p><p>“Their past experiences or partners, they’ll reference them and indeed who they’ll become romantic with,” Busche tells<em> IGN</em>. “For instance, we saw Harding. I might be playing a straight male character flirting with her, but I choose not to pursue a romance. She might get together with Taash. So my perception, my identity has no bearing on their identities and that comes through really strongly.”</p><p>That <em>The Veilguard</em>’s companions can end up in relationships with each other if you pursue them is exciting, and something <em>Dragon Age </em>has done in previous games. If you’re going to have a cast of pansexual misfits, some of them might as well start smooching. It’s also one of the surefire ways to demonstrate a character’s identity without it having anything to do with the player. Anders’ story may have run into this clarity issue in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, but party members Fenris and Isabela enter a relationship with each other if the player doesn’t pursue either. This helped alleviate the feeling that their identities were tied to Hawke, so at the very least, it seems BioWare is aware of criticisms that follow the free-for-all romance approach and is trying to circumvent them.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S this fall.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">In the music industry, a band often uses a self-titled album years into its career to denote a reinvention.

PlayStation's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/astro-bot/" data-ref-id="5000-630892">Astro Bot</a> uses the same naming convention to signal a similarly fresh start. Following a 2018 VR exclusive with obviously limited reach and a 2020 game that Team Asobi's studio head and creative director Nicolas Doucet considers a "tech demo," 2024's simply titled Astro Bot feels like it's ready to launch the cutesy robot to the top of the crowded PlayStation pantheon.</p><p dir="ltr">"Astro's Playroom is actually called [that] so it wouldn't be mistaken for an Astro Bot-sized game," Doucet told me following a demo in which I beat several levels, rescued many PlayStation characters reimagined as robots, and beat a boss in the form of a boxing cephalopod. "A lot of people actually don't know the Astro universe outside of Astro's Playroom, so starting [here] with the name Astro Bot made a lot of sense as a new beginning."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Astro Bot Finally Unleashes A Full-Scale Game</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Doucet said that the VR game's success convinced the team to revisit the Astro Bot world with the PS5 pack-in that followed it, and they thought if a wider audience was <em>still </em>falling in love with the mascot and their world at that point, then they could go biggest of all with something else. Astro Bot is that something else.</p><p dir="ltr">From what I played, the differences between Astro Bot and its predecessors are obvious in some ways and subtle in others. The diverse levels I experienced took me across beaches like those in Astro's Playroom and a construction yard hung high above the clouds just like in Rescue Mission, but these familiar landscapes were clearly denser too, and the overworld seemed more like something from LittleBigPlanet, in which I could pilot a jet-propelled DualSense from planet to planet as I unlocked levels, bonus challenges, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">My favorite part of the game is its ability to feel almost clairvoyant. Every time I'd experiment with the environment by smashing up certain parts of it, climbing way up high, or tucking away into a corner expecting a secret, I would find one. The levels have a masterful way of guiding me down their correct paths, but also signaling where I may be rewarded for dashing down the B or C or even D paths. I'd find coins to spend or more bots dressed like Ratchet, Rivet, Kratos, and more of the game's 150+ cameos, which is a number Doucet revealed to me.</p><p dir="ltr">This perpetual cycle of exploration and reward pairs very well with the game's mechanics, which remain as tight as before and bring a few new DualSense toys with them. I don't just want to turn over every stone for the secrets I may find; I also just want to keep playing the game because it <em>feels</em> so good to play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317367-astrobotannouncescreenshot06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4317367" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317367-astrobotannouncescreenshot06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4317367"></a><figcaption>With more than 150 cameos in the game, virtually every beloved PlayStation character can be discovered.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317367-astrobotannouncescreenshot06.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We've doubled down on the use of DualSense," Doucet said, adding that the game adds about 15 new power-ups in total, with only "three or four" shown in the debut trailer. One of those is the ability for Astro Bot to turn into a sponge, which uses adaptive triggers as you wring the robot dry to give you a feeling of becoming lighter. In my demo, I also equipped a rocket-boosted dog in a backpack, which shot me horizontally across some of the larger gaps or allowed me to smash through some obstacles. In my hands, the triggers kicked back forcefully to imitate the thrusters.</p><p dir="ltr">But the most clever use-case I learned of--though I didn't experience it in my demo--is a trick with the texture of some objects. Walls can hide hollow points with secrets on the other side, and as Astro grazes against these borders, reaching out and touching them like Nathan Drake passing through a doorframe, the feedback on the controller may indicate these secrets. For completionists, I suspect these will prove to be the trickiest, but perhaps most fulfilling, collectibles in the game. "We don't use it, like, tons and tons," added Doucet. "We use this feature just a bit, but enough to create that magic moment."</p><p dir="ltr">After two games that were beloved but constrained in different ways, 2024's Astro Bot seems destined to be full of magic moments. It launches September 6, exclusively on PS5.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The foundational elements of a Lego game have remained largely unchanged for 20+ years: Smash everything into bricks and studs, collect characters by the dozens, then use those characters to jump back into levels to solve puzzles that were previously gated off. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-horizon-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-631814">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has a little bit of that DNA, and moving back to a fixed camera like the pre-Skywalker Saga games makes it look like a classic Lego game of yesteryear, but after playing 30 minutes in single-player and co-op, I came away thinking of it as the most cinematic Lego game to date. Rather than intensely focus on smashing and collecting things, it's putting the focus on Guerrilla's story--and putting that story through a kid-friendly filter.</p><p dir="ltr">"We were determined to make a Lego game unlike any other Lego game," James Windeler, narrative director at Guerrilla, told me after my hands-on session. "From a visual perspective, we wanted to make a statement in the sense that we wanted to create a playable Lego movie in terms of the visual quality. But one of the things that's really unique about it and very different from other games is that everything you see is made from individual bricks. Every asset could, in theory, be made from physical material, Lego pieces."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317370-lha_screen_cinematic_thunderjaw_toy_logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4317370" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317370-lha_screen_cinematic_thunderjaw_toy_logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4317370"></a><figcaption>Lego Horizon Adventures stands out from other Lego games in several ways, with the visuals being an immediately obvious example.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317370-lha_screen_cinematic_thunderjaw_toy_logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">He's right, of course. Traditionally, Lego games involve bricks in the playable area and backgrounds made to look more like traditional video game environments, and that difference here, paired with the gorgeous visuals, really makes Lego Horizon Adventures stand out instantly when you see it.</p><p dir="ltr">But playing it feels a bit different than classic Lego games, too. Sure, you can smash up some of the environment to collect studs, but not nearly as much as in other Lego games, and there seemed to be no stud counter demanding you unlock some status such as "True Adventurer." That's because this isn't really a collect-a-thon like Lego Batman or Lego Star Wars. It is, as Winderler says, like playing a Lego movie starring Aloy, Rost, and other stars of Horizon Zero Dawn.</p><p dir="ltr">And I do mean Zero Dawn specifically. Lego Horizon Adventures reshapes the 2017 game in key ways to be more appealing and appropriate for kids, but without totally reimagining its story. "It's not a faithful retelling, and neither is it a parody," explained Windeler, who said the game will take players about 7-8 hours to complete, though there are elements of replayability to be revealed later. "We wanted to poke fun at the IP; we wanted to use all the self-referential humor that's characteristic of Lego properties.</p><p dir="ltr">"We also very much wanted to make sure that the game had a very broad appeal [...] We didn't make the whole open-world game and put it in here. We told a story that we felt captured some of the spirit of the original, some of the themes [...] It's more of an inspiration."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317371-lha_ps5_screen_cauldron_logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4317371" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317371-lha_ps5_screen_cauldron_logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4317371"></a><figcaption>Lego Horizon Adventures can be played alone, but it's designed for co-op between family members or friends, either locally or online.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317371-lha_ps5_screen_cauldron_logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Given how those themes originally included things like climate change and corporations' habit of commandeering a dilemma to present a solution before making matters worse, I wondered how much of the game would go into those beats specifically. "We definitely pushed some of the more complicated and truly dark themes very much into the background. Those ideas are in the game, but they're very subtle," he said. "You know, the story takes place more in the present and is very much focused around the more emotional story of a girl looking for her mother who gets drawn into an adventure with existential stakes."</p><p dir="ltr">Just as it translates the story and world into bricks and minifigs, one of the coolest parts of my demo was how it transforms the series' weak-spot targeting system into a simpler version that less experienced players can grapple with more easily, specifically on the Nintendo Switch's small controllers. "A lot of thinking went into that," Windeler revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">"But we also wanted to make sure that we maintained the kind of level of tactical thinking and combat that the fans of the franchise might be used to, too. So even though the control schemes are quite simple, you will recognize mechanics, like [focusing] on the weak spot, but also, there's like a complexity; there's a difficulty slider, and if you slide it up, there's a requirement to really kind of engage on a tactical level."</p><p dir="ltr">In practice, this involves holding the aim button at a machine's parts as they glow a vibrant yellow, just like in the traditional Horizon games, then releasing it to hit the robotic beast in that spot. Players can also sneak around in the tall grass and even kick off wildfires that propagate across the brick-filled landscape, causing chaos and even sometimes solving environmental puzzles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317372-lha_ps5_screen_mothers_heart_logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4317372" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317372-lha_ps5_screen_mothers_heart_logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4317372"></a><figcaption>Mother's Heart is a customizable hub you'll return to, perhaps to build things like hot dog carts or roller coasters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4317372-lha_ps5_screen_mothers_heart_logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">And of course, in two-player co-op, all of these elements can be doubled, creating a kid-friendly combat system that is still more like an action-adventure game rather than a traditional Lego game, which tends to a button-mashy brawler. In a word, Winderler called Lego Horizon Adventures' combat systems "frantic."</p><p dir="ltr">With Lego Horizon Adventures reimagining the story, whether it's for a visual gag or just to make it a better family gaming experience, I asked if Guerrilla ever flinches at the task of taking a character like Aloy, whom the studio has always spoken so highly of, and turning her almost into a caricature of herself. But Windeler doesn't see a conflict there.</p><p dir="ltr">"We do have the single-player games, you know," he said. "We're still very protective of the characters in that canon, [but] everyone who was involved in this wanted to have fun with it. There are still some heart-wrenching moments in the story. And like, we're not completely skipping out on the emotion of the original story. But it's definitely meant to bring joy to people."</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Horizon Adventures arrives on PS5, PC, and--yes--Nintendo Switch this holiday season.</p>

                <p>The latest Xbox firmware update has arrived, ushering in a set of changes and improvements. Microsoft ran through the changes in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/xbox-june-update/?ocid=Platform_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Link_lrn_6.12.1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, and we are highlighting the key takeaways below.</p><p>First off, the update gives players more personalization options for their backgrounds. Players previously had to choose if they wanted a dynamic background or game art when hovering over a title. But with this new update, users have both options available at the same time. You can find this new option by navigating this way: Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalization &gt; My Background &gt; Show selected game art. Additionally, a new setting allows players to change the color of their dynamic background without changing their default profile color.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4317830-screenshot2024-06-12at12.05.16pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4317830" data-ratio="0.56716417910448" data-width="1005" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4317830-screenshot2024-06-12at12.05.16pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4317830"></a><figcaption>The latest Xbox update is out now</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4317830-screenshot2024-06-12at12.05.16pm.png"></figure><p>The June update also makes changes to wireless settings with the aim of making it easier to switch between Wi-fi networks if you need to do that, like in the event you bring your Xbox on a trip. Your Xbox can now remember up to 10 networks, and you can now connect to them without inputting a password again.</p><p>Additionally, this new update allows users to manage their subscriptions directly from the Xbox instead of outside the console platform. Microsoft also noted that users might see experimental features in June, including different Game Pass page layout styles, more information in search card results, and the ability to find specific people using search.</p><p>Beyond the console updates, Xbox wireless controllers are getting a new firmware update this June. Specifically, the Xbox Adaptive controller now has support for additional USB accessories, with each port now supporting up to 12 buttons, along with a second stick, and a hat switch.</p><p>For the Xbox App on PC, the June update introduces a new Game Pass "sub navigation" menu that makes it easier to browse through the catalog. In terms of cloud gaming changes, players can now self-manage game data and cloud saves to help out in situations like troubleshooting corrupted save data or resetting a game to its original state for anyone who wants to start a game over. Finally, mouse and keyboard support for cloud gaming is now available for all players following a testing period.</p><p>Many of these features were made available first to members of the Xbox Insider program, which is <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free to join and open for everyone.</a></p><p>In other Xbox news, Microsoft announced three new Xbox consoles during the Xbox Games Showcase, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-announces-new-all-digital-xbox-series-x/1100-6524077/" data-ref-id="1100-6524077">$600 Xbox Series X with a 2 TB hard drive.</a></p>

        <p>Former EA and Facebook exec will remain leader of Netflix's games efforts until replacement is found</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Netflix's VP of Games Mike Verdu is taking on a new role as the company ramps up its ambitions in the video games space.</p>
<p>A former Facebook and EA exec, Verdu first <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-hires-new-vp-of-game-development">joined Netflix in 2021</a> ahead of the streaming firm announcing its push into mobile games.</p>
<p>The details of his new position are unclear at this time, but <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> understands it involves 'innovation in game development.'</p>
<p>He will continue to lead Netflix's video games business until a replacement is found.</p>
<p>"I am so proud of what we’ve accomplished, and excited to start a new team at Netflix on the cutting edge of game innovation," said Verdu. "New technologies have always been key to creativity in games development and, as an entrepreneur at heart, this initiative is right in my happy place."</p>
<p>Since Verdu joined Netflix, the company has launched 100 titles for its subscribers, including internally developed games based on some of the firm's most popular shows such as Too Hot to Handle, Virgin River and Money Heist.</p>
<p>Netflix has also acquired multiple studios, including <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio-0">Night School</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-continues-games-push-with-boss-fight-entertainment-acquisition">Boss Fight</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-to-acquire-next-games">Next Games</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-acquires-spry-fox-as-sixth-internal-studio">Spry Fox</a>, and opened two more in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-opening-fifth-studio-and-seriously-exploring-cloud-gaming">California</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-launches-new-studio-in-finland">Helsinki</a>, all of which are focused on creating new games for the service.</p>

He burst onto the scene in 2018 with the critically acclaimed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot: Rescue Mission</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for PS4 and PlayStation VR. His follow-up adventure, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro’s Playroom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was released in 2020 and came pre-installed with every PS5 console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those two games both debuted as demonstrations of major technology rollouts for the company. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rescue Mission</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Asobi used Astro Bot to show off the capabilities of PSVR, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro's Playroom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> introduced the computing power capabilities of the PS5—capabilities that many developers have yet to fully take advantage of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If other developers aren't using that processing power—well then the little bot will just do it himself. Earlier this month Sony announced that Astro’s journey would continue in the upcoming PS5 game, titled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/wHMNQzLG_Jg?si=Q57_ZiQidXmWeeRk">Astro Bot</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer spent some time playing Astro Bot at Summer Game Fest and spoke with director Nicolas Doucet about what it’s like to make a game with a character previously known for showing off tech demos and expanding even more on the haptic feedback features of the DualSense controller.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Astro Bot"><span>Astro Bot</span> shows off more power from the PS5</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doucet said that Team Asobi went with the simple name </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in order to distinguish that it’s a big story for Astro and a new beginning. The studio’s first two games were released in 2016 called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Playroom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Playroom VR</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which could be described as tech demos to show off the capabilities of PS4’s DualShock 4 controller and the PSVR headset.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That naming convention transferred over to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro’s Playroom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. “So we use that word on purpose to really establish that this is a toy, just a tech demo,” Doucet explained. “Now the name is free so we can make something big and really start from there.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Team Asobi learned from developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rescue Mission</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro’s Playroom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that the gameplay has to continually keep the experience fresh, which is why the team created 15 new powers for Astro to utilize when going traversing through levels. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a big focus was creating many different kinds of planets and worlds filled with unique gameplay mechanics.</span></p><p>Image via Team Asobi/PlayStation</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Three of Astro’s new powers were playable during the hands-on segment. These included Astro puffing himself up like a balloon to reach new heights, a backpack that lets him charge at enemies, and a pair of spring arms to hit enemies from afar.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“It's more about what’s going to be the next surprise that the game throws at you. In order to keep that going, we have to be really inventive and creative,” said Doucet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were several different ways that Team Asobi prototyped new DualSense features. In one independent demo separate from the game, the developers had this idea of turning Astro into a sponge. The adaptive triggers would feel heavy, like how a sponge would be filled with water. But when pressed down, water would squeeze out and then the triggers would feel light.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doucet also revealed another DualSense haptic feedback feature that wasn’t shown off in the demo. There are moments in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where players can stroke their hand and run Astro against the wall. And according to a change of texture, you can feel when you’ve stumbled across a secret passage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“That's something that could be done with normal vibration, but it would’ve been very primitive,” Doucet said. “With the DualSense, it has so much finesse that you can actually feel the difference in expression.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s level design and layout have changed from previous games too. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro’s Playroom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the levels were laid out with some platforming, then some mini-games, then back to platforming. Doucet noted that the big difference in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that every power up and ability supports the game’s basic platformer mechanics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The overworld has been structured similar to something like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Galaxy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Astro can fly around in his ship to decide on which world to tackle next. There are six galaxies and 80 levels in total, which include the main campaign, side levels, and secret ones. This approach was made to provide players more freedom in the order they want to tackle levels as they unlock.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In these levels, Astro can find his missing bot crewmates hidden as collectibles. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will also feature over 150 VIP bots, which are cameos from other PlayStation franchises.</span></p><p>Image via Team Asobi/PlayStation.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The demo included bot versions of Kratos and Atreus from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Once found, this caused their own unique level to appear in the galaxy, although it remained locked in the demo. While Doucet wouldn’t reveal what made those levels distinguishable from normal ones just yet, he explained that the team didn’t want the cameo characters to just be simple background decorations.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why doesn't ">Why doesn't <span>Astro Bot</span> support PSVR2?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite PlayStation showing support to its franchises in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> through these cameos, including seemingly forgotten ones such as Parappa the Rappa, Ape Escape, and LocoRoco, the game doesn’t seem to support PlayStation’s latest venture, PSVR 2.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot: Rescue Mission</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was exclusive to PSVR and couldn’t be played without a headset on PS4, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn’t require a PSVR 2 setup at all. When asked if Team Asobi would be open to bringing Astro Bot back to the world of VR on Sony’s next-generation headset, Doucet said, “We’ve only been thinking about PS5 at the moment. That's been our main focus.”</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/steam-next-fest-demos-summer-game-fest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s another <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest</a> on, which means my hard drive is <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/steam-next-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">once again</a> full of tiny slices of games I wish I could play all of, but I can’t. The writer in me wants to find some kind of narrative cohesion to put all the ones I’ve checked out into the same blog, but their main connecting thread is that I liked them! Maybe you will like them too.</p><h2>Wax Heads</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wax Heads Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQLJKugCxJM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2769240/Wax_Heads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wax Heads</em></a> was announced earlier this year. In real life, I’m not a big fan of collecting things, including records, but I do love a video game where you have to do chores. In the demo, you play as a new record store employee who has to fill a steady stream of customer requests, searching the store for their desired record based on what customers tell you. Some are pretty straightforward: a brand new record, or one that’s on sale. Others are more complicated: do you recommend the newest album from a risque band to a young teen requesting it, or offer them a tamer, earlier release? Which album will satisfy this guy with a lot of opinions about a band’s membership over the years? What is this dude in a mascot head actually asking for?&nbsp;</p><p>It could feel like a hidden object game with music fandom slapped over it, but the world-building of the shop elevates the game into more than just hunting through rooms until you spot the right item. Albums have history and connection, the shop is full of rich little details, and there’s a plot percolating about the shop owner’s history and the shop’s future. Each album has a thoughtful track list and cover art, creating a real sense of a fictional music scene. Combined with side tasks like a flyer to make and an arcade game to play, even though the demo is just one day in the shop,<em> Wax Heads</em> feels full and engaging.</p><h2>Reka</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="REKA - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Future of Play Direct 2023" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhZiJ1AFfyw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1737870/REKA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Reka</em></a> was announced last year, and comes to Early Access in August. In the demo, you play as a girl who wanders into helping a witch, Baba Jaga, with a ritual to rebuild her home. That home is a customizable hut on giant chicken legs, in which you’ll travel the game’s world in the full release, but in the demo are confined to just stomping around dramatically at the end.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of what you do in the demo is fetching things the witch tells you to and helping her with a ritual, but rather than feeling simple, this paints the witch as a standoffish, mysterious character with secrets to impart that immediately made me want to know more about her. I’m a sucker for any game with woods, and the <em>Reka</em> demo has a beautiful slice of landscape to explore, full of items to loot for spells and little quests to do for the superstitious townspeople. The demo prevents you from stomping the town to pieces in the chicken hut, but lumbering over the treetops felt cool as hell, and I’m excited to see how the hut plays into the full game.</p><h2>One Btn Bosses</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="One Btn Bosses - Official Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WldHLxkAW5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I’m not a big fan of boss battle games–or maybe, I want to be, but I suck at them. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1910600/ONE_BTN_BOSSES/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Btn Bosses</em></a> joins games like <em>Titan Souls </em>in bringing limited mechanics to boss battles–here, that you only press one button, which in the demo changes the direction of your geometric character along a track. There’s a bit of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> in the auto-shooting bullet hell vibe, but rather than increasing the number of enemies as that game does, each level in the demo brings a new attack to look out for. The levels are short and chaotic, asking you to manage your speed (moving in the same direction increases your damage output) and avoid the boss’ varied attacks. Your character can only take a few hits, and things get tough fast, but basically all you’re doing is dodging, which is mostly what I do in boss fights anyway.&nbsp;</p><h2>Grunn</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Grunn - Official Demo Trailer" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7vcX8m2_0Z0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720950/Grunn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grunn</em></a> is by Tom van den Boogaart, who you might remember from indie “walk around a weird space station” game <em>Bernband</em>. In <em>Grunn</em>, you’re walking around a dilapidated garden, with a list of chores to complete over a weekend. The game’s trailer makes it very clear all is not as it seems, but I was still taken by surprise when things got weird. (Be aware there’s jumpscares, which are objectively not scary but scared the heck out of me because I’m a horror wuss.) The demo has multiple endings to see, and I’m curious about what’s really going on despite how loudly I yelled “No!” at the faintest whiff of creepiness. At the very least, it’s satisfyingly inefficient to cut the entire estate’s grass with hedge clippers.</p><h2>Fruitbus</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fruitbus - Official Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxE6pwfrH0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484130/Fruitbus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fruitbus</em></a> is by <em>Among the Sleep</em> studio Krillbite, but it has the opposite vibes of that game’s horror: you drive a food truck around a brightly colored world, serving little animal characters fruit salad. There’s a lot of buttons to press (my <a href="https://aftermath.site/pacific-drive-star-trucker-buttons-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite</a>) to turn the bus on and off, open the counter, and buy items at shops. While it seems you can buy a backpack to carry more stuff, I was incredibly charmed by how you can only hold two things in your hands at once, which led to me ferrying fruits I found back and forth, making multiple trips for change at shops, or fumbling with knives, bowls, and apples while characters waited for their food. There’s a plot about convincing people to come to your grandmother’s funeral, but I mostly careened around the game’s island in my bus, honking my horn and angering the locals.</p><h2>Morse</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="MORSE Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q82n8ALqHxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I’m not sure if <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1976860/MORSE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Morse</em></a> is part of Next Fest or Next Fest just led me to realize it has a demo, but it’s a game that’s been on my radar for a while now. You play as a Morse code operator in World War 1, fending off enemy soldiers, ships and planes by attacking squares using Morse code. At first, I struggled to get my head around it, frantically glancing between the dots and dashes of the various letters and the battle. But once it clicked, I started to feel accomplished in both strategy and Morse code, confidently tapping out letters and bouncing between rows. I’m really into the minimalist art style, and I love the whole idea of the game, so it was cool to play some of it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-and-steam-sued-rigging-market<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve is being sued by a UK law firm to the tune of £656m (around $840m) over claims that the Steam service is ripping off consumers owing to unfair price parity obligations.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwwyj6v24xo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the BBC</a>, UK law firm Milberg London LLP, which also brought a case making similar claims against Sony <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/sony-playstation-being-sued-for-5-billion-amid-claims-it-ripped-off-nine-million-consumers-12678949" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2022</a>, is claiming that Valve uses its dominance over the digital PC gaming market to impose unfair charges on 14 million UK consumers.</p>
<p>Digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt is leading the case, and she's alleging that Valve is "rigging the market" thanks to price parity obligations, which, according to Milberg London's claim, publishers on Steam are "force[d]" to sign up to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-valve-sued-storefront.jpg?itok=twNPsnqY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-valve-sued-storefront.jpg?itok=iWz7ZaO0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Valve is "rigging the market" with unfair price parity obligations, a new lawsuit claims.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Shotbolt and the claim, Valve makes publishers who want their games on Steam sign up to promise that they won't charge less for their games on other platforms.</p>
<p>This leads to Valve being able to charge what Shotbolt calls "an excessive commission of up to 30%" on its games, which in turn drives prices up and forces consumers to pay more than they should.</p>
<p>The claim alleges that Valve has been engaging in this practice for at least six years, and that a victory would "stop this unlawful conduct" and help consumers "get back what they are owed".</p>
<p>Given that the Epic Games Store <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-epic-games-store-will-take-just-12-revenue-share">takes just 12%</a> compared to Valve's cut, but that games are rarely (if ever) cheaper on Epic's store, this claim seems like a slightly strange one, although given past form, it may only be a matter of time before those companies find themselves in Milberg London's sights as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-games-store-storefront.jpg?itok=pZOVFcaq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-games-store-storefront.jpg?itok=I0Xmz19P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other storefronts, like Epic, don't appear to be in Milberg London's crosshairs.</figcaption></figure><p>This also isn't the first time Valve has found itself in legal trouble over supposedly unfair price parity agreements.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, Valve was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolfire-games-accuses-valve-of-controlling-non-steam-game-prices">sued by Humble Bundle creator Wolfire Games</a>, which alleged that the Steam provider forced publishers to sign up for price parity agreements or risk having their games removed from Steam.</p>
<p>It seems like this is a legal argument that isn't going to go away for Valve, and given that Milberg London's case against Sony appears to still be ongoing, it may be one that comes back to haunt the Washington-based gaming giant. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dorfromantik-team%E2%80%99s-star-birds-splices-mario-galaxy-with-science-youtube.899316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176851/star-birds-dorfromantik-kurzgesagt-announce-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="oCIJUH">Here’s a union of two of my favorite German cultural exports: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23049119/dorfromantik-review-1-0-update"><em>Dorfromantik</em></a>, the exquisitely designed, minimalist landscape-building game, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt">Kurzgesagt — In A Nutshell</a>, a YouTube channel that puts out tastefully animated, fascinating, and approachable explainers about the cosmos, biology, futurism, evolution, and other science-y topics.</p>
<p id="XVg4Vz">Toukana Interactive, the developer of <em>Dorfromantik</em>, is collaborating with Kurzgesagt on <em>Star Birds</em>, a base-building and resource management game in which the channel’s cute, duck-like bird mascots explore space by hopping from asteroid to asteroid, mining, building, and creating automated production networks as they go.</p>
<p id="fh8wtV">The first thing that stands out about the game is its look, which uses Kurzgesagt’s house graphical style — bright colours, clean lines, and rounded contours — to render toylike, rotating asteroids reminiscent of the Super Mario Galaxy games.</p>
<p>  <figure>

    </span>
  
</figure>


</p>
<p id="3mb9Rg">Toukana laid out what to expect from the game on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">Steam page</a> and an accompanying <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1455840/view/4147331471358454120?l=english">post to <em>Dorfromantik</em>’s page</a>. Players will use rovers to explore asteroids and uncover hidden resources; build mining and production facilities to research and manufacture new tech; fulfill quests set by the anarchic birds on their space station; establish trading routes and ultimately take off for new star systems. The asteroids are procedurally generated, and the key to the game will be using the 360-degree building system to make the most efficient use of each space rock’s limited surface area, connecting units with hand-drawn pipework. </p>
<p id="2tZajv">Toukana and Kurzgesagt also promise “a mysterious storyline featuring kurzgesagt vibes,” “resources &amp; production processes inspired by real science,” and “rogue-lite elements &amp; high replayability.” They warn that <em>Space Birds</em> is not a 4X game or a realistic physics simulation, however.</p>
<p id="54qqWv">If <em>Dorfromantik</em> is anything to go by, <em>Star Birds</em> will be soothing, absorbing, and perfectly balanced. If Kurzgesagt is anything to by, it will be philosophical, surprising, curious, and a little bit epic, with dry narration. I can’t wait. <em>Star Birds</em> is set for release in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hands-on-with-astro-bot-pure-joy.899313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I can’t remember the last time I played a PlayStation game and felt this happy. I’ve loved plenty of first-party Sony games and their expensive melding of Hollywood cinematics, refined gameplay, and dense systems. <em>Astro Bot</em> is in many ways the antithesis of that. It’s no less refined, perhaps even more so. And it certainly doesn’t look or feel cheap. But it does play like a game unsaddled from the self-conscious baggage of an industry chasing the emotional weight of prestige TV and the content expectations of $300 million blockbusters. <em>Astro Bot</em> is whimsical, delightful, and most importantly, just a whole lot of fun. </p><p>I played four levels and some extra challenge stages from the upcoming PlayStation 5 action platform at Summer Game Fest. It took roughly 45 minutes with Team Asobi’s latest crack at the burgeoning robot series—which arrives September 6—for me to become completely<em> Astro Bot</em>-pilled. I didn’t play 2018's<em> Astro Bot Rescue Mission</em> for PlayStation VR, and only briefly dabbled in the PS5 launch pack-in game<em> Astro’s Playroom</em>, despite enjoying what I tried and the near-unanimous praise it received. My time with the upcoming sequel, arguably the mascot’s first, full-fledged adventure, convinced me the <em>Mario</em>-inspired formula isn’t just ready for primetime but could become the next great series in Sony’s PlayStation Studios repertoire. </p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>will feature over 80 levels across 50 planets in six different galaxies. The goal of each one is to rescue over 150 fellow bots that represent characters from PlayStation’s past and present, like <em>God of War</em>’s Kratos and Jak from <em>Jak and Daxter</em>. The stages I played were each fairly short and linear, but that didn’t matter. Every moment was bursting with satisfying animations or rewarding discoveries. While <em>Mario Bros.</em> levels and feel like mazes where abilities and secrets help you to unlock them, <em>Astro Bot</em> stages are like a children’s museum designed to maximize sensory experience. </p><figure id="" data-id="1058a2113a810b8f041b4cc4c66a4ecd" data-recommend-id="image://1058a2113a810b8f041b4cc4c66a4ecd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro throws a ball of metal at a crane.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>They begin with you flying in and crash landing on a “Dual Speeder” ship that looks exactly like a DualSense. As Astro’s means of transportation, the controller is also the key vehicle for everything that happens in the game, with sounds from the speaker, minor variations in the rumble, and the haptic feedback of the triggers all working in concert to imbue every enemy punched, coin collected, and object broken with a sense of pure joy. You know something’s really working when you pick up a new power, in this case the bulldog Barkster’s air dash, and you can’t stop using it. I just kept pressing it over and over again, whether I needed to or not, because I could and it felt amazing, even if I accidentally killed myself a few times along the way.<br></p><p>Another part of <em>Astro Bot</em>’s magic is that, at least in my demo of the game, none of these sensory tricks, visual flourishes, or gameplay gimmicks felt overused. Once the level was done, the air dash went away and was replaced with something else. At five to 10 minutes each, the ideas in one stage are quickly exhausted before moving on to the next batch. I unzipped a big pink octopus one moment and crashed into paint buckets the next. A construction level had me collecting metal bars with a magnet to move platforms. A giant fishbowl smashed and let the water out on another. Along the way I missed plenty of bots, so I by no means exhausted each level, but the bite-sized experiences left me wanting to go back, rather than worrying about the potential tedium of an overstuffed collectible hunt. </p><figure id="" data-id="ac64fb1a0a826682e4e34455adca4d36" data-recommend-id="image://ac64fb1a0a826682e4e34455adca4d36" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro punches an octopus. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro punches an octopus. " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac64fb1a0a826682e4e34455adca4d36" data-recommend-id="image://ac64fb1a0a826682e4e34455adca4d36" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro punches an octopus. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The fact that each bot represents a part of PlayStation’s history felt surprisingly alluring too. Those Easter Eggs feel more like a bonus than a crutch. Instead of relying on nostalgia and winking at hardcore fans, gathering characters from the platform’s past gives the collectibles added meaning. Each new bot, like one based on the protagonist of<em> Journey</em>, is like a walk down memory lane, including visiting past console eras where games like <em>Astro Bot</em> didn’t feel so rare. While past <em>Astro</em> games served as tech demos and museums, the platforming, presentation, and world design of <em>Astro Bot</em> feel strong enough for the game to stand on its own, even if it wasn’t bathed in gamer nostalgia.<br></p><p>My hands-on time ended with a boss fight against a giant octopus where I used frog arms to punch it and slingshot Astro into its head. A second phase had me jumping across platforms and swinging from red beams in between massive waves crashing across the cliffs from which I was hanging. After that, I made my way to a challenge stage where everything moved super-fast until canisters of exploding ice were used to slow down the environment. It was the perfect digestive on which to end a delicious and filling meal. There was just enough challenge to make me lean forward, but not so much that my glee turned to frustration. The PlayStation reps watching behind me were kind enough to cheer when I finally cleared it after half a dozen attempts. </p><p>This is the part where I remind you that I’ve only played small portion of the game via a carefully staged demo, and my impressions are limited to that fairly scripted slice. Still, if the rest of the game is anything like it, <em>Astro Bot</em> could be something pretty special. And it’s definitely a dose of breezy but mischievous fun the PS5 needs right now. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/finding-a-new-balance-between-ai-and-beneficial-bugs.899304/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/finding-a-new-balance-between-ai-and-beneficial-bugs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pharah, one of the heroes in Overwatch, has an emote where she says, “Rocket jump? That sounds dangerous.” Almost thirty years before Pharah said that, in Quake, some players discovered that shooting a rocket into the ground would damage them but also provided a jump boost, allowing them to reach higher places and thus having a combat advantage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using the word “bug” is almost like giving your interlocutor a prompt, inviting words like “stomp,” “crush,” or “wrangle” to fill in the blanks. But bugs are an integral part of games culture and the social networks that games build around themselves. The ability to shoot a rocket into the ground to jump higher has now become a staple feature of many first-person shooter games, and the popularity of that bug allowed Blizzard to gracefully wink at those players in the know, endearing them to a character that has otherwise little time to be developed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the field of Quality Assurance, bugs are defects of a larger or smaller severity, that can negatively affect the intended experience of the user or possibly even prevent them from experiencing the product in the first place. In extreme cases, such as security flaws, bugs can even have a lasting detrimental effect on players lives. Countless hours of hard work, effort and creativity are poured into minimizing the potential that a user might encounter these bugs, and countless people should be celebrated for their work in maximizing the user experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But in the field of video games, there must be some space left to sing the praises of bugs. They have been an integral part of developing the field, either through those bugs that have become genre-defining features or works of glitch art and the niche subculture of fan-made works of fiction exploring the terror that emerges when a beloved childhood video game is glitched to horrifying levels. Not to mention the culture of speedrunning and the competitive and artful purposeful exploitation of bugs, sometimes for the greater good. Sometimes, bugs are the ultimate “collectible” in a game. One might think of easter eggs in this vein, but easter eggs are intentional. The developer knows they are there, and like the rest of the game, they are a vehicle of communication between them and the players. But when players find a bug, they belong, for a moment, just to the players. They offer a window for them to appropriate a part of the game, congregate around it and share it with their friends and communities. If easter eggs and intended mechanics are the means through which designers and developers communicate with players, bugs are the means through which the game communicates with them. And it is at this bare interface between the game and the player that art, relationships and culture can evolve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As participants in the field of video games, we owe a debt to these temporary breakpoints between the crafted, intended experience and the software’s inner workings. And more so, we must give our thanks to those folks working to ensure that we can see bugs in this positive manner, because without whom, the memorable glitches would not be culture-producing, but destructive. Quality assurance work asks much of its practitioners, particularly in the field of video games. It asks for perseverance ensuring that each part of the video game is not only functional, but also visually and auditory accurate throughout multiple configurations of hardware specs. It asks for creativity in trying to achieve tasks in ways not only unintended by the designers, but even implausible for the task to be performed. It asks for analytical skills in determining the spot where the defect occurs, its conditions and the impact that it may have when encountered by a player. It asks for QA professionals to repeatedly assume the roles of potential players, even when the game’s complexity leaves room for myriad player personas to fill its space. These calls are answered with hard work and time investment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Modern video games strive for complexity, emergent gameplay and replayability, all packaged in and enhanced by flawless and pleasing graphics and sound design. Each of these aims comes with increased financial investment and increased demands on the makers of those games. Iteration loops become tighter, risks become higher and the requirement for quick responses becomes more stringent. In these conditions then, the responsibility of empowering game makers to achieve their goals should also increase. As the scale and depth of games increases, QA professionals will still be asked for perseverance, creativity, analytical skills and empathy, and so they must be allowed the space to exercise them. AI-driven QA tools can help do that by shortening the loop of performing a large battery of tests, by diversifying the use cases that they can analyze and act on, narrowing the possibility space where the breakage might have occurred, providing quick insight into ways of engaging with the game that might have been unintuitive and allowing an overview of the impact of the defect upon the experience at large.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game design has always balanced the edge between player freedom and designed experience, which naturally puts pressure on the demands for testing. Increased player freedom adds pressure by exponentially increasing the action possibilities as well as their sequential combinations, which can sometimes be humanly impossible to parse in their entirety. For example, some years ago, I was playing Alan Wake. I came to a point in the game where I was not doing great, both in terms of health points and ammo. In this sorry state, I passed an auto-save checkpoint right before a fight. In my state, the fight was impossible to win. I was stuck in an auto-save respawn loop out of which I could not get out, and I could no longer progress in the game. I quit the game and have not returned to it since, nor have I played the sequels to Alan Wake. This is partly because of that bitter taste the experience left and because I feel like I have missed out on too much of the story and I would be lost. Having my experience safeguarded would have meant, in this case, that the unlikely sequences of behavior that I engaged in, with the same skill level that I had (that had me lose so much HP and ammo) would have had to be performed by a tester, at that specific checkpoint in the game. That tester would have had to do the same thing for each checkpoint under each variation of skill and action sequence. The conditions that led to my scenario would have taken a tester an incredible amount of time to find, if ever. But for me, that was the entirety of my experience with the game. That said, parsing such large amounts of data is all in a day’s work for AI. Such tools can provide testers with the capability to detect and call out occurrences that may have a 0.01% chance of happening but that affect 100% of a player’s experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So then where do we stand on bugs? Do we thank them, or do we stomp them? I think that actually is the wrong question to ask. What is needed is space and time for creativity, for understanding the potential of those bugs and celebrating the players and game makers who play in the meeting space between person and software. We will never be able to eliminate all bugs. Players will find them, and they will make them their own. But if QA professionals are not provided with the tools to diminish the presence of destructive bugs, we risk keeping those players away who might find the next rocket jump.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>About the Author</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dr. Miruna Vozaru is a Game Analyst PhD who has worked in the industry as a researcher, teacher, level designer and level analyst.

For researchers, organizers, and activists, this offers the possibility for real-world impact and a chance to apply your findings in a concrete and impactful way. For all of us, it&nbsp; presents a chance to work with like-minded individuals on suggesting pragmatic solutions and to build a community for sustainability in the games industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a book aimed at advising practice, essays and research will be organized into topic-focused sections. The editors will work with authors to organize essays appropriately. Editors will also provide a structure for each topic-focused section that frames the work of authors in the context of real-world stories, practical examples, and actionable advice. To facilitate this connected organization, and to also make sure that each contributor knows what is being said in the chapters before and after their own, we are planning a digital meeting between the editors and the contributors for each topic. In this meeting, we will give feedback to each other's draft texts, find connecting points, and strengthen the argument of the book, while meeting the people who are working in our exact field.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In order to respect your time and work, and to make such a meeting possible within the time-frame of the editing process, the editors are aiming for a fast turn-around for submissions within 2-3 weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Contributions:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chapters will be max. 8000 words written in accessible language. Shorter contributions, especially practice-based and design work, are also explicitly welcome. Specialist terms and concepts will be explained and there will be no assumption that the reader is a researcher or specialist in a given development field. That said, it will be possible to use scientific and other references. About 50 illustrations in black and white are available for the entire book. We accept submissions with multiple authors as well as more than one submission per author.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given that we are expecting contributions from a variety of fields, chapters can look quite different from each other. Some might be academic text while others can be an explanation of a successful organization process or advice for impactful design. We strive to accommodate these differences in the structure of the book and encourage submissions with practice-based topics. The editors offer support to contributors who are not necessarily used to writing in order to support such submissions and help you tell your story. What exact form this support will take will be based on the need of contributors in collaboration with the editor team.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re very interested in contributions and perspectives from those actively working on game development projects, and we also recognize that game industry professionals may not have as much experience with the writing and editing processes involved with this project compared to contributors with a more academic background. As a 15-year game industry veteran who has more recently learned to research, write, and publish work in this space, editor Trevin York is on hand to support contributors who are similarly interested in sharing their processes through these types of written projects.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Editors and Publisher:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The book is to be published by CRC Press, in the Tyler and Francis Group, in 2026 with a release during GDC. The printed book will have the following ISBN: 9781032836195. It is edited by Dr. Patrick Prax, Dr. Clayton Whittle, and Trevin York. Patrick is Associate professor of Game Design at Uppsala University and has been working with sustainability in game design education and the game industry. Clayton is the co-chair of the IGDA Climate SIG and Ph.D. research consultant for transformational games. Trevin is the founder &amp; director of Dire Lark, a game design for change studio. Clayton and Trevin are also the first authors of the Environmental Game Design Playbook by the IGDA Climate SIG.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Timeline:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Submission deadline for abstracts: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>15th of June 2024</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Submission format: 500 words excluding literature</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Editor feedback: acceptance within three weeks, 7th of July</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Peer feedback on in-progress chapters: 15th of October, submission 10th of October</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Full chapter submission deadline: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2nd of December 2024</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Feedback within six weeks, 15th of January</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Final submission deadline to editors: 15th of March 2025</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Final Print Deadline: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>01 May 2025</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publication: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GDC 2026</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Abstracts with the title “book submission” to be emailed to: <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5e3d323f272a3130012936372a2a323b1e312b2a32313135703d3133">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Please do not hesitate to contact us if there are any questions at all!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can find the call here: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/call-for-abstracts-towards-sustainable-game-design-the-game-needs-to-change/">https://game.speldesign.uu.se/blog/call-for-abstracts-towards-sustainable-game-design-the-game-needs-to-change/</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thanks,</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Patrick, Clayton, and Trevin</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Editors</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="252" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After weeks of build-up, <em>Doctor Who</em> viewers have finally been given a peek at the role that Susan Twist plays in all of the madness. In trailers for The Legend of Ruby Sunday, it’s finally confirmed that Twist will indeed play tech mogul Susan Triad.</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">This news will come as no surprise to anybody who has been keeping up with her appearances and the hints being dropped, but it does confirm the long-known theory that was sparked by a mock-up magazine cover in a documentary featuring Russell T Davies.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone anonymously pointed me in the direction of this.

 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">In The Legend of Ruby Sunday, the seventh episode of <em>Doctor Who</em> season 14, which is set to release on June 14, the Doctor will finally acknowledge the constant cameos played by Susan Twist, stating that everywhere he lands, a woman appears. The trailer for the episode hints that Susan Triad is showing up in the various locations in her dreams.</p> <figure data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="NEXT TIME | The Legend of Ruby Sunday | Doctor Who" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xu2-1iIyQrs?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">New images reveal that the Doctor will meet Susan Triad while accompanied by Mel, a long-running familiar face in <em>Doctor Who</em>. Another image shows Ruby accompanied by Rose Noble, played by Yasmin Finney and familiar from the 60th Anniversary specials.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via BBC</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">A final teaser image released ahead of the episode’s debut shows the Doctor using his Sonic device (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-has-everything-in-the-right-place-but-still-feels-disjointed/">I’m really glad to see it make a comeback</a>), though my attention is caught by something else in the image. A small child can be seen on what appears to be a Segway – could this be a callback to the first episode of the season, Space Babies?</p> <figure data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via BBC</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">Russell T. Davies has said that viewers of the upcoming episode ‘<a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/doctor-who-susan-twist-images-newsupdate/">will be screaming</a>’ during the two-part climax to season 14, with Ruby’s ‘deepest secret’ being revealed. Some suspect that Ruby is not entirely what she seems to be, citing her unflinching acceptance of the alien goings-on she has experienced.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="false">In a post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8CK5XnN_Bk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=63dff608-96a9-4a9b-8d9f-de98f7fb7e65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, Russell T. Davies has teased yet another character’s growing importance. Mrs. Flood, the far too knowledgeable next-door neighbour of Ruby Sunday, can be seen inside the bedroom of Ruby’s Grandmother, Cherry. The family member doesn’t look too happy at the appearance from her neighbor, but what the interaction provides to the story remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On its initial release back in February 2022, Elden Ring was an immediate hit. In just over two weeks, it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-described-as-start-of-a-new-franchise-following-enormous-12m-sales-milestone">shifted 12m copies</a>, with publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware describing these sales as "a fantastic start for the new franchise".</p>
<p>By the time we got to May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-134m-copies-since-launch">sales had surpassed 13.4m</a>, and rose further to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-surpass-166m-worldwide">16.6m by August</a>. A year after it made its Tarnished debut, it was revealed Elden Ring had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-an-astonishing-20m-copies">sold 20m copies</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Elden Ring has likely seen a boost in sales recently, as anticipation for its Shadow of the Erdtree expansion ramps up. Shadow of the Erdtree is set to release later this month, on 21st June, across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pre-order/9n5p5sc2rz7k">Xbox X/S</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pre-order/9n5p5sc2rz7k">Xbox One</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer contributor Emma Kent has been hands-on with Elden Ring's DLC already, stating the expansion "feels like a FromSoftware greatest hits album".</p>
<p>"Shadow of the Erdtree already has the look and feel of an absolute epic. With its sombre atmosphere, intricate worldbuilding and cheeky level design, it has all the ingredients required for an additional chapter of Elden Ring's sprawling narrative," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece">Eurogamer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree preview</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24176933/adventure-time-movie-rebecca-sugar-side-quests-heyo-bmo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there-will-be-an-adventure-time-movie-from-rebecca-sugar-patrick-mchale-and-adam-muto.899265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176933/adventure-time-movie-rebecca-sugar-side-quests-heyo-bmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="86F9Tg">Cartoon Network is in production on an <em>Adventure Time</em> movie, featuring the talents of <em>Adventure Time</em> veterans Rebecca Sugar, Patrick McHale, and Adam Muto, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/global/adventure-time-movie-rebecca-sugar-patrick-mchale-two-spinoff-series-1236034970/">reports Variety</a>. </p>
<p id="tcVYyk">There’s scant more news about the project, like whether it’ll be released theatrically or on the Max streaming service, or which of <em>Adventure Time</em>’s sprawling cast it’ll focus on, but that lineup of creators should catch the interest of any fan of the venerable animation series. </p>
<p id="nPA0tN">The movie appears to be the first new major work from Sugar since the close of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23964548/steven-universe-stevonnie-queer-animation"><em>Steven Universe</em></a> and <em>Steven Universe Future.</em> McHale made his post-<em>AT</em> name as the creator of the beloved <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/25/13329508/over-the-garden-wall-cartoon-network-halloween"><em>Over the Garden Wall</em></a> miniseries, while Muto has continued to shepherd <em>Adventure Time</em> through a series of spinoff specials and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23894698/adventure-time-fionna-cake-review-ice-king-finale-explained-simon-betty"><em>Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake</em></a>, already renewed for a second season. </p>
<p id="tm8l82">Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network have also greenlit two spinoff series specifically aimed at a child audience — an interesting distinction to make from the movie. <em>Adventure Time: Side Quests</em> will take child audiences back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eUrwYQe3Dw">Finn and Jake’s pre-hero childhood days</a> for lore-light standalone episodes, while <em>Adventure Time: Heyo BMO</em> will aim at the preschool audience, in what appears to be a claymation series starring the lovable robot BMO and maybe Shelby the worm?</p>

In the bottom-right biome of <em>Animal Well</em>’s map, you’ll find two rooms that contain a total of five cats locked in cages. You may notice that above each cage is a black box with five lines, and those lines light up if you play the Animal Flute. If you play the right sequence of notes, the cage will unlock and the cat inside can run free. So how, exactly, do you figure out what songs to play?<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>In truth, if you’ve <em>just</em> encountered the cat cages in <em>Animal Well</em>, don’t worry about hunting down the songs you need to play just yet. Freeing the cats isn’t necessary to complete the game’s first layer. In fact, you’ll need to see the credits in <em>Animal Well</em> before you can organically solve this puzzle on your own. <strong>Your reward for freeing the cats is an item that will prove essential once you’re tracking down all 64 hidden eggs, but before that, it won’t necessarily help you out</strong>.</p><p>Nothing’s stopping you from looking up the songs and freeing the cats right away, mind you. So if that’s what you’re here for, we’ve got you covered. But before we get into that, let’s give you some more tips in case you think you can solve this puzzle on your own.</p><h2 id="h15641"><a id=""></a>What you need to figure out the caged cats’ songs on your own</h2><p>If you want to figure out how to free the cats on your own, you’ll need the following items</p><p>1: The <strong>Animal Flute</strong> (you should have this by now)<br> 2: The <strong>Lantern</strong> (obtained in the final area of the game’s first layer)<br> 3: The <strong>Top</strong> (obtained in the egg room after collecting 32 eggs)</p><p><strong>I highly recommend getting the UV Lantern</strong>, which is tied to exploring the three areas hidden behind the “circular recess” gates. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-medals-e-k-s-medal-where-find-what-to-do-1851518877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-medals-e-k-s-medal-where-find-what-to-do-1851518877">You can check out our full guide about this here</a></span>. <strong>The B. B. Wand can also help you access at least one of the cat songs, though it’s not necessary</strong>. This is in a hidden area near where you saw the credit sequence play for the first time at the end of layer one.</p><p>From there, you want to explore the bottom-right biome and look for any series of five arrows chiseled into the background. The most obvious example of this is in the room where you first find the Ostrich spinning on the wheel (look at the wall after the Ostrich is gone). Take a screenshot of each sequence or write them down as you find them, and once you’ve collected all five, you’ll have everything you need to free the cats.</p><p>If that sounds like too much work for you, then here are the songs you want to play at each location.</p><h2 id="h15642"><a id=""></a><em> Animal Well</em> caged cat songs</h2><p><strong>NOTE: If you just want the reward for accomplishing this ASAP, you’ll still need the Top item. </strong>So assuming you’ve already obtained 32 eggs, here are the songs you need to play.</p><figure id="" data-id="cf9431e7d29c0af4e591b78c3672e0ef" data-recommend-id="image://cf9431e7d29c0af4e591b78c3672e0ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Animal Well screenshot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Animal Well screenshot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bigmode</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf9431e7d29c0af4e591b78c3672e0ef" data-recommend-id="image://cf9431e7d29c0af4e591b78c3672e0ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Animal Well screenshot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h15643"><a id=""></a><strong>Cat Room 1:</strong></h3><p>See the map above if you need to remember where this room is.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-complete-30-hours/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It’s great news for Star Wars fans with a critical work-life balance: Star Wars Outlaws will be just 30 hours in length. That’s still a substantial amount of meat on those sci-fi bones, but it’s slim enough that even the hardest-working individual could complete it in a few weeks. That’s the news from Julian Gerighty, the creative director working on the game at Ubisoft. </p>



<p>He also stressed that even for a completionist ticking every box possible, the game’s lifespan (pre-DLC, I guess) will last around 60 hours.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-still-plenty-to-do">Still Plenty to Do</h2>



<p>It’s assumed that there’s lots of content wrapped up in Star Wars Outlaws, but perhaps not the suffocating amount you’d find in a game like Assassin’s Creed. That’s the gist of what Gerighty was saying when <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/star-wars-outlaws-can-be-finished-in-30-hours-says-creative-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he spoke to VGC</a> recently, anyway. He promised that Outlaws won’t offer a swollen, oversaturated experience like Assassin’s Creed, but instead, it’ll be a more manageable title – and that was a very deliberate decision by the developer.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Very early on, we decided this is going to be a 25, 30 hours golden path adventure, 50 hours, 60 hours for completionists, and that is, for a guy with a family and a job, it’s still a fair amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In his interview, Gerighty outlined some creative amendments that were made to Outlaws early on. For instance, the team had to cut swimming mechanics from the title, but in exchange, they brought in playable minigames – which are sure to be a hit with Star Wars fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws is due to hit platforms on August 30, with a couple of narrative-based expansions set to launch sometime after.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/double-exposure%E2%80%99s-best-edition-gets-you-access-two-weeks-before-launch.899256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-editions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure was just revealed by Square Enix and Deck Nine, with fans worldwide being stunned by the sudden reappearance of Max Caulfield. As the lead in the inaugural title of the series almost a decade ago, Caulfield served as the introduction to the franchise for many players, becoming an iconic presence and a firm fan favourite character even all these years later.</p>



<p>Recently, the various editions of Double Exposure were revealed across multiple platforms, and it has been confirmed that buying the best edition will net you access to the first two chapters of the game <strong>two weeks earlier than anyone else</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tough-times-for-spoilers">Tough Times for Spoilers</h2>



<p>For those not in the know, Life is Strange is a unique franchise that follows characters with ‘abilities’ as they navigate complex and often emotional scenarios. In the first game, we controlled time, in the second game, we assumed the role of two brothers, the youngest of which could move things with his mind. In the third game – True Colors – we played as Chloe, a young woman with the ability to read minds and emotions.</p>



<p>Max Caulfield’s return is a spectacle to be sure, and from the first trailer, it looks like she’s picked up a few more abilities all these years later. In Double Exposure, Max can tear into alternate universes and watch as parallel stories unfold.</p>



<p>Now, the fact that Life is Strange is <strong>heavily </strong>driven by a winding narrative, it stands to reason that spoilers will, one way or another, destroy the point of playing the game. Each title has given way to twists, turns, unexpected pitfalls, and heartbreaking scenes that leave the player gasping. With the best edition giving the first two chapters away <strong>two weeks </strong>before launch, players getting a standard edition will need to avoid social media for half a month or risk ruin.</p>



<p>Here are the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874000/Life_is_Strange_Double_Exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">various editions of Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>:</p>



<p><strong>Standard  Edition</strong></p>



<p>Comes with the full game <strong>only</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Deluxe Edition</strong></p>



<p>Comes with the full base game, and the Spooky and Decades outfit packs.</p>



<p><strong>Ultimate Edition</strong></p>



<p>Comes with the full base game, the Spooky, Decades, Final Fantasy VII, Fan Favourite, and Paw Prints outfit packs, ‘exclusive cat content’, and of course, two weeks early access to the first and second chapters of the game.</p>



<p>The game’s Standard Edition will retail for around $49.99, but the Ultimate Edition will set you back a pretty penny – $74.99 to be precise.</p>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure will be released globally on October 29, 2024.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ELDEN RING – Official "The Journey So Far" Catch Up Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Created by Steven Nass and Peter Henningsen, FromSoft Word is more challenging than your first fight against Manus, Father of the Abyss. If you're used to typing up a storm and editing later, you're going to be in for a hell of a fight. The Dark Souls influence is also evident through the choice of font and <em>familiar </em>background music, and the real challenge here is to see how much you can type before you're finally stopped by a grammatical error.

In Monster Hunter World, you would need to load up the story quest, go into the map, and find the monster, which would trigger the cutscene. After the cutscene finished, you could invite other players to your hunt. This was only true the first time you did each story mission, but it made playing co-op more difficult than most players would like.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"While we can say that there will be some segments where you have to witness certain parts of the story before you can actually start some of those co-op elements, in the background we've taken care to make sure that players are always connected or they can stay always connected in terms of co-op parties," Tokuda said.</p><p dir="ltr">Tokuda said that while there would still be a few instances where a cutscene would need to be viewed before you can do co-op, the overall headache would be lessened thanks to matchmaking improvements. Players can stay partied up, even though these cutscenes and the background matchmaking is always happening, so you can quickly get more players in once the cutscene ends. There will even be a notification as soon as you can invite other players to your section. While it sounds like players will have to still deal with some of these cutscenes, Capcom has taken the time to make it a much smoother and easier experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Rise did not have these issues, but that was due to there being separate single-player and multiplayer story missions, with cutscenes taking place before the mission and not during. Monster Hunter Wilds is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2025.</p>

Capcom has said that Wilds will feature herds of large monsters, giving players more monsters to contend with during each hunt.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with GameSpot, which you can read the entirety of below, Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda said that the game will blow past the limitations of previous entries. Instead of the max of three monsters running around at once during a hunt there will now be herds of large monsters, similar to herds of smaller monsters present in previous games. Now when you reach your target, you may have to contend with multiple of that monster at once. There will also be even more large monsters around, which Tokuda said will create more dynamic moments in the gameplay.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Monster Hunter Wilds Gameplay Trailer | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Tokuda said that, for example, the lightning monster shown during the Summer Game Fest trailer is an apex monster and the way it interacts with other monsters can change based on the number and type of monster present. It will also act differently depending on the environment, which can change thanks to weather and other shifting aspects. Tokuda said that all of this comes together to really make the upgraded environments really shine in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p dir="ltr">Tokuda said this as part of an interview with GameSpot's Jean-Luc Seipke, alongside Monster Hunter Wilds executive director and art director Kaname Fujioka and Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto. You can read the interview in its entirety below. Monster Hunter Wilds launches in 2025 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview has been edited for clarity and length.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Where were you able to elevate aspects of Monster Hunter, both in gameplay and presentation, since this is the first entry built for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Kaname Fujioka: </strong>Yeah, so thank you for your question. So really what we've been able to accomplish with the new hardware is a lot of what we've been able to show you so far with the, first of all, the dynamic environmental changes that are part of the overall concept of the game, which is really exemplified in the contrast that we're trying to strike with the sense of dangerous and aggressive, intimidating nature, contrasted with the bountiful environments that we've been able to show you. All of that is dispersed and explicitly possible with the new hardware that is available to us now.</p><p dir="ltr">That also includes the number of monsters that we're able to present in the game and how they pack and they herd into large groups, not only with the amount of numbers that we're showing you, but also the precise behaviors that they each have. They all have their own desires, their own unique identities, behaviors, and this large-scale environment that's not only filled with monsters, but also filled with humans, all real time dynamically changing environment. So that seamlessness and the real time dynamic changes, everything's always moving together, interacting with each other, that's all maybe made possible by the new hardware available to us.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are there any interesting ways the team wants to have the monsters and even the humans now interact with each other almost dynamically in Monster Hunter Wilds?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Yuya Tokuda: </strong>Yeah, thank you. Really, what we were trying to present with the monster actions is just powered up nature of the ecosystems that we've been able to express in the game. Up until now, we've only really been able to display three monsters of three different types in the field, but now that's really ballooned into these packs and herds of monsters at the… that you've been able to see, kind of what we've been able to do in previous games with small monsters now on a much larger scale with large monsters also interacting in these huge groups of monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">So being able to really detail or express these ecosystems in a really detailed fashion is what we've been really excited to be able to accomplish here with Wilds. So for example, what you were able to see with the sandstorm and the Apex Monster that appeared there, that lightning-based monster, and how it interacts with the other monsters that appear only in certain kinds of the environment, that kind of dynamism, that kind of constantly changing environment is something that we've been really able to accomplish and we really want to push that aspect.</p><p dir="ltr">And specifically one thing that we're excited about in some of the smaller interactions with the monsters is seeing the small monsters latch onto, jump onto and invite the larger monsters and that thing happens more dynamically and more naturally.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Were there any major lessons or fan feedback from Monster Hunter Worlds or Rise that the team wanted to integrate into Wilds?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokuda: </strong>Yeah, we really valued the input and opinions of players from Worlds and Rise, and listening to that as we approach and design Monster Hunter Wilds. To get into specifics, for example, now that the map is a lot bigger, we were really focused on making it easier for players to navigate the world, not just in terms of the geography but the verticality as well. There are definitely instances in previous games where players, they did have the Scout Flies guiding them towards the monsters, but there might've been situations where a monster moved locations and on the way there the monster's no longer there, it's moved somewhere else.</p><p dir="ltr">But now with the introduction of the Sacred as a trusty mounting support, it can automatically move toward your quest target or the quest monster, making it much, much easier to stay in the hunt and know how to get to where you're going. Not only that, but the map as well, it's a lot more detailed, it has a lot more features that also illustrate the verticality and the environments, so making it much, much easier for players to get around.</p><p dir="ltr">But yeah, we've really been trying to really introduce the game with a lot more qualitative improvements, so we're listening to players' feedback.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>In Monster Hunter Worlds players would have to wait for a mid-mission cutscene before they could join co-op. Has the team made co-op more seamless for story missions?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokuda: </strong>Yeah, we've definitely taken that feedback to heart. And while we can say that the story really... We've done a much, much deeper guidance to the story this time around, we're really trying to expand on the immersive story experience for players and that's part of the concept of the seamlessness of the world and transitioning from the cutscenes right into the gameplay back into the action.</p><p dir="ltr">So we've really powered up that aspect of it, but at the same time we've been listening to the feedback of the player and the ability, and so while we can say that there will be some segments where you have to witness certain parts of the story before you can actually start some of those co-op elements, in the background we've taken care to make sure that players are always connected or they can stay always connected in terms of co-op parties and there's a lot more features now to match up... That background matching is always going on, so players will be notified as soon as they can do quests together and do gameplay together, and it's been made a lot more convenient and easy to do all around. So they've taken care to design the story with that in mind.</p><p dir="ltr">So you can rest easy in that multiplayer, that co-op aspect and that multiplayer aspect is something we've taken care to incorporate inside this game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are there any changes to the weapons or move sets in Monster Hunter Wilds that the team is really excited about?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokuda: </strong>On the whole... Well, to summarize what's going on in Wilds is we are presenting the full lineup of 14 different weapon types and each of those different weapon types is going to have new moves, new action, new mechanics. One of the major things that's shared among all the new updated weapons is that there were going to be moves now where in previous games you had to be stationary when the moves were executed. Now there's more positioning available you can move while performing those moves to allow you to better yourself towards monsters. So on the whole, everything has been updated with that in mind.</p><p dir="ltr">And in terms of specific weapon style mechanics, some of the greatest changes that are made to the Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun, and the Hunting Horn, we've done a really kind good job in making sure that they all feel a lot better, a lot crunchier here in Wilds. So we really think that you can look forward to that.</p><p dir="ltr">So we've also started to reveal some of the weapons as well, but one of the biggest things as well with all the weapon type changes is that there's now a focus mode that allows you to aim attacks in the guards, but also it allows you to perform attacks towards… that cause extra damage. And those special attacks that are available in focus mode lead into all kinds of new combos as well. And there's also... Or I guess this is a temp term here, but basically a weakness exploit attack basically that is possible with the focus mode, so that's also a major part of the updates weapons as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Both Monster Hunter World and Rise featured a ton of post-launch content, including crossovers with other games. Will Monster Hunter Wilds receive a similar level of post-launch support?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ryozo Tsujimoto: </strong>Yeah, I think it's a good question. If you've been following the Monster Hunter series, then you'll know that we really do take a lot of care to give the players a lot of content that they can enjoy, even after the game's released. But really, yeah, we can only stress that we've only been able to show you a fraction of the game and we're really hyper-focused right now on delivering the best product possible for the main game, right?</p><p dir="ltr">So you can definitely expect us to keep players interest and keep players really into the experience, even after the release. But for now we're still just putting our nose to the grinder for the main game and trying to build the best game there.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Of the monsters already shown, what new moves are you excited about and how do these monsters fit into the larger ecosystem of Monster Hunter Wilds?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fujioka: </strong>Basically, it's a difficult question to answer because there's so much about the monsters that we want to show that we like in what we've been able to do. But one of the things that first mentioned is basically how we've been able to show the differences in monster characteristics and how the monsters behave and act in the ecosystem depending on some of the new herding mechanics, for example, how threatening some monsters are and how that threatening level increases when they're in larger herds and larger numbers, versus how they can still have different characteristics expressed when they're on their own. So some of the… for example, when they herd, they behave a bit differently when they are on their own. But you can also expect that all of the individual monsters that, they also have their own unique characterization, they have their own unique characteristics expressed very in fine detail with a lot of care taken to them.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, the Apex Monster that you've been able to see in the Woodward play that we've shown you, that flying monster with the lightning attacks, that monster, for example, is something that we've taken a great liking to and we expect a lot of that Monster Hunter level attention to detail and the way that it behaves individually.</p><p dir="ltr">So you can look forward to that. Another aspect personally that… is looking forward to is that he's taken a lot of care… has taking a lot of care into how the main monster, which we haven't been able to show you details about the main monster yet, but how it's integrated into the story and how its ecology is also built into the nature of the story and how that unfolds is something that we've really liked how it's turned out. So we can't wait to show people how that's going to look.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds has a big emphasis on mounts, including combat while riding. How much of that is in the game and are there monsters where you would want to be mounted the entire fight?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokuda: </strong>Yeah, so really to put it as simply as possible, the basic concept of dismounting or being on the ground during combat is unchanged. That is still the basic overlying principle of hunting and Monster Wilds. The Sacred is designed as a [mount] first and foremost, and if you get the chance, you'll probably see us a bit more in the demo play if you get the chance to see that. But it's a support role for the player. So the Sacred will come in when the player is in trouble, when they're in a pinch to help out. You can mount it quickly to gain some distance and to reposition yourself. And this is built into the groundwork of what the Sacred accomplishes.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, you'll get supplies into the Sacred pouch at the start of a quest. It'll have extra supplies for you. It has a weapon sling that allows you to switch very quickly between your main and your sub weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">And that support role is integrated into just how it's been designed. The Sacred itself doesn't actually attack monsters, and so when you can perform some mounted attacks while you're on the Sacred, those mounted attacks fit the purpose of providing extra mobility for you as you're in the hunt, or for leading monsters away or quickly getting from point to point. And that's also expressed in the fact that you can get onto the Sacred quickly to gather material with the Hook Slinger and to use that quickly as a Slinger shot, and things like that. So, the Sacred is allowing for all of that, and it gives you more options but it's not really going to be based around the mounted test.</p>

                <p>It's been a while since we've had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> concert--or "immersive music experience" as Epic may call it--but the next one is coming soon, and it's the first worthy of a mosh pit. "Metallica: Fuel. Fire. Fury." is an in-game concert coming to Fortnite later this month and for a limited time.</p><p>The event kicks off on June 22 with three showings, followed by three more the next day. Here's the full schedule:</p><p>Saturday, June 22:</p><ul><li>11 AM PT / 2 PM ET</li><li>2 PM PT / 5 PM ET</li><li>8 PM PT / 11 PM ET</li></ul><p>Sunday, June 23:</p><ul><li>7 AM PT / 10 AM ET</li><li>11 AM PT / 2 PM ET</li><li>2 PM PT / 5 PM ET</li></ul><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrtWx80NP-Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mrtWx80NP-Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The concert will feature six of Metallica's songs from the band's illustrious, decades-spanning catalog, created by the VR, AR, and metaverse studio Magnopus, which built the experience for Fortnite. Parties of up to four players can head to the show together. If you've previously seen Fortnite concerts like those starring Travis Scott or Ariana Grande, you know to expect an audiovisual spectacle. The concert won't be playable after these dates conclude, so be sure to make the time if it sounds like a good time. Spoiler: It's gonna be a good time.</p><h2>More Metallica in Fortnite</h2><p>But for the Metallica (or Fortnite) devotees, there's a lot more of the metal band's influence to be found all over the game. First off, the new season of Fortnite Festival is all about the metal band. You can read more about that in our coverage of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-4-adds-lots-of-metallica-and-a-pvp-mode/1100-6524173/" data-ref-id="1100-6524173">Fortnite Festival Season 4</a>.</p><p>In battle royale and Zero Build, you'll find a <strong>new traversal item/weapon</strong> in the Ride The Lightning guitars, which create a trail in your wake on which allies can ride.

<p data-characters="219" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, the Ubisoft title stemming from James Cameron’s <em>Avatar</em> franchise, is set to receive its first story DLC. <em>The Sky Breake</em>r, the upcoming story expansion, is going to be released on July 16.</p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">Ubisoft released the trailer for <em>The Sky Breaker</em>, which showed the Na’vi celebrating their victory after the events of the base game. The celebrations are cut short when a ship crashes down at the festival, carrying the notion that the fight for survival and their home planet is not over yet.</p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">The DLC will introduce The Heart of the Plains, a new location, and players will also get to take on a new enemy type known as the AMP Defender. This mech-suit carries a riot shield, as if it was not already hard enough to defeat the mechs with bows and arrows.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - The Sky Breaker Story Pack Trailer | Ubisoft Forward" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWq6m8rQMHw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">The celebration shown during the start of the trailer is known as The Great Games, and there will be several challenges themed around it for players to complete. Character progression will also be extended through this DLC with 25 more ranks to gain and spend skill points. Players can now reach master crafter status, and there will be a new Legendary rarity category for items.</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">There is a Season Pass available which grants you access to both of the planned story DLCs,<em> The Skybreaker</em> and <em>Secrets of the Spires</em>. The second DLC is planned for autumn 2024. The Season Pass costs $39.99 on the Ubisoft Store, and requires the base game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/classic-doom-gets-the-shield-saw-from-dark-ages-thanks-to-this-mod/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=classic-doom-gets-the-shield-saw-from-dark-ages-thanks-to-this-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="365" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Now that we’ve all seen the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-the-dark-ages-takes-doomguy-back-to-his-days-as-a-sentinel/">trailer for <em>The Dark Ages</em></a>, the brand-new <em>Doom</em> game that will be taking us back to medieval times, there was at least one thing that stood out for me: the Shield Saw. The teaser showed all the usual chaos and demon-slaying we know and love about the series, but the saw-looking shield in the Slayer’s possession is next-level.</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">Well, if you’re intrigued about getting to try it out on the denizens of hell, your chance has already arrived. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/a-modder-has-already-brought-doom-the-dark-ages-new-shield-saw-to-the-1993-original-and-its-pretty-close-to-perfect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a>, a modder has already added the “Shield Saw” seen in the <em>Dark Ages</em> trailer into the original <em>Doom</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">The mod comes from user Craneo, in which they say they just “kinda ended up trying to make actual decorate [sic] for it.” Soon after, they made the .WAD file available, which you can download from Google Drive <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NI9McMkc7WdTxEwkU_N0_ha2R8FDUAVr/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-a-slice-of-violence" data-injectable="false">A slice of violence</h2> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">You can check out the brief footage above before you decide to download the mod. Essentially, it seems to replace the classic chainsaw from the OG in favor of the newfangled Shield Saw.</p>
 <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">We get to see the Doom Slayer hacking away at Zombies and Imps as per, but the real USP comes when they throw it at oncoming enemies. Upon contact, it basically turns monsters into a fine paste, so it’s a pretty beefy weapon.</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">It’s also just one of countless examples of how quickly the modding community can move. Remember, the teaser for the new <em>Doom</em> only went live a couple of days ago, and Craneo’s mod was released less than 24 hours later. Efficient, I’d say.</p>
