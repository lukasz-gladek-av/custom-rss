            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24159055/summer-gaming-events-xbox-showcase-nintendo-direct<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998271/e3-gaming-convention-canceled-death">corpse of E3 lies a-mouldrin’ in its grave</a>, its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21243981/summer-game-fest-news-events-geoff-keighley-sony-microsoft">spirit marches on</a> in the form of a bevy of video game showcases and events. There’s a hefty number of them — some notable, some not (but they should be) — and they encompass a wide range of games and genres. Here’s your guide to the whats, wheres, and whens of this year’s summer of games.</p><p><h3><a href="https://access-ability.uk/2023/11/17/access-ability-summer-showcase-2024-announcement/">Access-Ability Summer Showcase 2024</a>&nbsp;</h3></p><p>Accessibility has become a major feature of games, with developers often incorporating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/3/23668538/sony-playstation-store-accessibility-tags-ps5">accessibility features in their marketing materials</a>. The Access-Ability Showcase takes that one step further, curating an entire digital event around games with robust accessibility features. “Our aim is to make sure that if a game looks exciting, you don’t have to worry about getting hyped, only to learn later that a game doesn’t support your needs as a player,” wrote Laura Kate Dale, host of the Access-Ability showcase. The showcase starts on June 7th at 11AM ET on <a href="http://twitch.tv/LauraKBuzz">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FYoutube.com%2FLauraKBuzz">YouTube</a> and will feature viewing options for American and British sign language and audio descriptions.<br></p><p><h3><a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/">Summer Game Fest</a></h3></p><p>Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest was one of the first on the scene to take over when E3 started foundering during the covid-19 pandemic. This is the fourth year of Keigh-3, and it has only gotten bigger with this year’s event boasting over 55 gaming partners, including the big hitters like Xbox and Playstation to smaller outfits like Annapurna Interactive and Thunderful Games. You can watch the main showcase on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40thegameawards">YouTube</a> on Friday, June 7th, at 5PM ET.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.dayofthedevs.com/events/">Day of the Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition 2024</a></h3></p><p>Immediately following the Summer Game Fest presentation, iam8bit and Double Fine Productions are hosting the SGF edition of their Day of the Devs showcase. Day of the Devs is one of my favorite parts of Summer Game Fest since it always exposes me to games I’ve never heard of before that quickly become my favorites. In 2022, that’s how I heard about <em>A Little to The Left</em>, <em>Escape Academy</em>, and <em>Desta: The Memories Between</em>. It also was one of the first showcases that featured a little game called <em>Animal Well —</em> maybe you’ve heard of it. Make sure you tune in to the Day of the Devs showcase on June 7th at 7PM ET on Twitch and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40DayoftheDevs">YouTube</a> so you can find your next indie obsession.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fevents%2Fxbox-games-showcase">Xbox&nbsp;Games&nbsp;Showcase</a></h3></p><p>Just a few days after the main Summer Game Fest showcase, Xbox will host its own event on Sunday, June 9th, starting at 1PM ET on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2Fxbox">YouTube</a>. Though Xbox just held an indie partner showcase in April, debuting a handful of interesting indie titles — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144596/theyre-just-giving-away-toes-for-free">including this one about Japanese mascots</a> — this showcase promises to be much bigger. Xbox is incorporating all its studios, including the recently acquired Activision, so expect a bunch of heavy-hitter AAA games from the biggest studios in the world. After Sunday’s event, Xbox is also teasing a second showcase it’s dubbed a “[REDACTED] Direct.” Though the company is trying to be coy, it’s widely rumored <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145262/xbox-games-showcase-summer-2024-call-of-duty-direct">that the [REDACTED] in question is the latest <em>Call of Duty </em>game</a>. There’s also a chance Xbox will share more information on the report that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158934/microsoft-call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-plans">this next <em>Call of Duty</em> will be added to Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p><p><h3><a href="https://wholesomegames.com/">Wholesome Direct 2024</a></h3></p><p>If the high-energy / high-action games featured in the bigger showcases aren’t your thing (and even if they are), then the Wholesome Direct may have what you’re looking for. The Wholesome Direct features games that are, according to the event’s curators, “incredibly hopeful, artistic, and creative.” Last year’s Wholesome Direct featured<em> Venba</em>, and the game’s creators credit (<a href="https://x.com/venbaGame/status/1668407220411805696">literally</a>) being featured in the showcase as a major factor in their success. Watch the Wholesome Direct on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wholesome_games">Twitch</a> or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fc%2FWholesomeGames">YouTube</a> on Saturday, June 8th, at 12PM ET. </p><p><h3><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-pc-gaming-show-2024-announcement/">PC Gaming Show</a></h3></p><p>The PC Gaming Show, hosted by <em>PC Gamer</em>, is a showcase that was initially designed to address the lack of PC gaming representation during E3. Ten years after its debut, it’s still going strong with the showcase taking place June 9th at 4 PM ET on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pcgamer">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fpcgamer">YouTube</a>.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsale%2Fnextfest%23%3A~%3Atext%3DSteam%2520Next%2520Fest%2520will%2520take%2Cwhen%2520Steam%2520Next%2520Fest%2520begins.">Steam Next Fest</a> </h3></p><p>Like the PC Gaming Show, Steam Next Fest is all about the games <em>not</em> on Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo Switch. (Although some of the games featured during Next Fest might also be on those consoles, too.) Steam Next Fest does its presentation a bit differently, though. It lasts for a full week, giving gamers access to demos of forthcoming games, livestreamed developer interviews, and deep dives on the games featured. Next Fest starts June 10th at 1PM ET and lasts until June 17th, so you have plenty of time to check everything out. </p><p><h3><a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fforward">Ubisoft Forward 2024</a></h3></p><p>Ubisoft Forward returns for Summer Game Fest 2024. Ubisoft will share updates on its games on June 10th at 3PM ET. We should expect more details about <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, the second season of <em>Skull and Bones</em>, and more.</p><p><h3>Nintendo Direct</h3></p><p>Buried in all the speculation regarding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">Nintendo’s next console and when it will be revealed</a> was a message from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa about the next Nintendo Direct. “We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024,” <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197">he said in a post on X</a>. Though there’s no specific date attached to the Direct, we should probably expect it around the same time as all the Summer Game Fest activities since Nintendo likely won’t want to be left out of all the fun.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en">Gamescom 2024</a></h3></p><p>Rounding out this year’s summer of games is Gamescom 2024. The event is kinda like the European version of E3 and will feature its own showcase event similar to the keynote addresses of E3s past. Gamescom kicks off on Wednesday, August 21st (my birthday!), and lasts until August 25th, with the Opening Night Live showcase, hosted by Geoff Keighley, typically taking place during the week, time TBD.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The series has been dormant since 2007, so fans haven’t been able to pit a lot of modern rappers against one another in a fighting game. But this <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>mod is a decent enough substitute. The Def Jam MK1 Pack has two options to play as Lamar, one makes the “Not Like Us” rapper a skin for Reiko, and the other lets you play as him as a skin for Kung Lao. Drake, meanwhile, is a skin for Johnny Cage.</p><p>The Drake vs. Kendrick beef has been entertaining to watch unfold and I don’t think I’ve ever seen people be so unified online. Though it seems both of them have stopped dropping songs about each other for now, it was easily one of the most significant pop culture moments of 2024, even though it’s only May.

I now understand why they held gladiator matches in ancient Rome. <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>mods aren’t those, but the fighting game is brutal enough that it gives you a modicum of the same adrenaline rush.</p><p>Anyway, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6eK-2OQtew&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6eK-2OQtew" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stream “Not Like Us”</a></span> on your favorite music streaming service.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the northeastern quadrant of the map, you’ll encounter a large chameleon that, among other things, can defeat you in one hit using its tongue. With some trial and error, you can figure out how to overcome this big old lizard and continue exploring. Or, if you don’t have time for that, you can find out exactly what you need to do below.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>For those who just need a few quick hints, you’ll have to face off against the chameleon twice in <em>Animal Well</em>. In the first encounter with the green chameleon, your goal is to press the three yellow buttons and pass through the gate beneath it. Use the grass as bait to survive its tongue attacks. In the second encounter with the red chameleon, you’ll have to bait it into eating the hedgehogs on the platform. This will defeat the chameleon once and for all, which will net you one of the four flames required to beat the first layer of the game.<br></p><p>Of course, there’s a bit more to these encounters than that. So let’s break this boss monster down.</p><figure id="" data-id="49a93a04f52b4502c6c4cf5f6314fbc1" data-recommend-id="image://49a93a04f52b4502c6c4cf5f6314fbc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A big green chameleon looms on the left side of the screen in an Animal Well screenshot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A big green chameleon looms on the left side of the screen in an Animal Well screenshot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shared Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="49a93a04f52b4502c6c4cf5f6314fbc1" data-recommend-id="image://49a93a04f52b4502c6c4cf5f6314fbc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A big green chameleon looms on the left side of the screen in an Animal Well screenshot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h43038"><a id=""></a>How to defeat the green chameleon</h2><p>When you enter the room with the green chameleon, you’ll have a roof over your head that will protect you from anything the lizard can throw at you.

The first—and by far the most dangerous—is its tongue attack. It will extend its tongue towardswherever you’re standing at the time the attack starts, and it will eat up the first applicable thing it touches (unless it strikes nothing at all). If it eats you, that’s an instant game over. Fortunately, you’ll notice that there are several patches of grass on the ground. <strong>If you hide underneath the grass, the chameleon will grab the greenery instead and leave you safe</strong>.</p><p>Granted, you don’t <em>need</em> the grass to dodge this attack either. The trajectory of the tongue is decided once the attack begins, so you can jump or move out of the way after it reaches out to you for a snack. This is especially helpful once you need to ride the floating platform above you, since your perpetual motion will make you a harder target for the boss to hit.</p><figure id="" data-id="72372b663720a1c34517ef391ce24b66" data-recommend-id="image://72372b663720a1c34517ef391ce24b66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The chameleon's eyes turn red, and it uses its projectile attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The chameleon's eyes turn red, and it uses its projectile attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shared Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="72372b663720a1c34517ef391ce24b66" data-recommend-id="image://72372b663720a1c34517ef391ce24b66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The chameleon's eyes turn red, and it uses its projectile attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The chameleon will telegraph its second attack when its eyes turn red, which will coincide with a distinct gurgling sound effect.

This is a much easier attack to dodge, and it won’t trigger its tongue move during this time.</p><figure id="" data-id="733cd4e6a2ba6cc084826d05201077a4" data-recommend-id="image://733cd4e6a2ba6cc084826d05201077a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player dodges the chameleon and uses the yo-yo to press a button." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player dodges the chameleon and uses the yo-yo to press a button." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shared Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="733cd4e6a2ba6cc084826d05201077a4" data-recommend-id="image://733cd4e6a2ba6cc084826d05201077a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player dodges the chameleon and uses the yo-yo to press a button." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for pressing those three buttons, you can easily reach the two on the bottom side of the screen using the Yo-Yo. You can manipulate the chinchilla and jump on it to press the buttons as well, but that’s obviously a slower option. Afterwards, use the chinchilla to jump onto the small platform under the chameleon, and wait for an opening to ride the floating platform above over to the last button. It may feel scary to get so close to the chameleon, but remember, you can use the grass as cover. Just don’t hang out after it eats all the grass there.</p><p>After you press the final button, make a dash toward the gate and pass on through.

Instead, you want to use what you learned from the previous encounter to <strong>bait the chameleon into eating the hedgehogs</strong>. The easiest way to do this is to <strong>tap the left button in front of any of the hedgehogs, inching forward at roughly the speed at which they walk</strong>. This will naturally goad the chameleon into trying to snack on you, only to catch a hedgehog instead. <strong>You’ll need it to eat all five hedgehogs to win</strong>.</p><figure id="" data-id="09742a2cb1e2b2e867b433ea8720836a" data-recommend-id="image://09742a2cb1e2b2e867b433ea8720836a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player plays the animal flute to stop the hedgehog.

As you get down to the last hedgehog, you may find it hard to line it up with the chameleon when it’s trying to use its tongue attack. Fortunately, <strong>you can cause the hedgehogs to go to sleep by using the Animal Flute</strong>. This will momentarily stop the hedgehogs until you stop playing, which can help you control the flow of the encounter.</p><p>That said, I can’t stress this point enough: <strong>Make sure to only use the Animal Flute when the hedgehogs are on top of the platform</strong>.

<p>In a post on X (that’s the first time I’ve referred to it as that), Epic Games teased an impending Fallout-themed update to Fortnite, the legendary battle royale game. In a simple post, we see the bust of a suit of power armour, a figure that has been all over our screens since the Fallout TV show was released on April 10.</p>



<p>Furthermore, a reference in the game’s news feed suggested that the Brotherhood of Steel – the most recognisable faction in the Fallout universe – will help to usher in Chapter 5, Season 3, which is set to be released on May 24.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fallout-but-how">Fallout, But How?</h2>



<p>That’s all there is to know about the upcoming Fallout crossover event in Fortnite. It hasn’t been confirmed in what capacity the crossover will work, and it could be anything from full-blown skins to music, emotes, and backbling bundles. It’s easy to imagine a collaboration between Bethesda Game Studios and Epic Games that would see the Amazon-backed Fallout TV show ported into the world of Fortnite.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>For instance, I could imagine a variety of skin packs including the three core characters from the recently released television show: Lucy, Maximus, and The Ghoul (Cooper). They’d fit very nicely in the world of Fortnite, given that they all have signature weapons, tropes, and even quips. If I were a betting man, I’d say that’s what’s on the way from May 24.</p>



<p>Keep a weather eye on the horizon – the Brotherhood of Steel is coming to Fortnite, and who knows what else?</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"While it probably doesn't matter, I think we'd all rather be in the release window that we're looking at now," the executive <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693998-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Previously, GTA VI was set for release at an unspecified point in 2025, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-now-set-for-fall-2025/1100-6523520/" data-ref-id="1100-6523520">now it's lined up to launch specifically in Fall 2025</a>. It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">pretty much every Rockstar Games release gets delayed</a>, so it's possible GTA VI might slip like GTA V and Red Dead Redemption II did before it.</p><p>Also during the call, Take-Two management said the company expects to have sequential growth following the release of GTA VI, which struck some as odd or even unbelievable. That's because GTA VI is expected to generate an enormous amount of money for Take-Two, making for a difficult comparison during the next fiscal year. An analyst pointed out that Take-Two experienced sequential declines following the launches of GTA V and Red Dead Redemption II. So how will things be different this time? Zelnick said "it's a fair question," going on to note that the video game business has "really changed" since Red Dead Redemption II and GTA V came out years ago.</p><p>He said Take-Two will post sequential growth due to the company's pipeline of titles that includes other major releases (though he did not name any outright). He also said he expects GTA VI to keep selling well for years after launch, just as GTA V did and continues to. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-gta-6-approaches-gta-5-passes-200-million-copies-sold/1100-6523542/" data-ref-id="1100-6523542">in the past three months of 2024, GTA V sold another 5 million copies</a>, which is more than most games sell in their lifetimes.</p><p>"We actually think there is a compelling case that the full game sales [of GTA VI] will continue to be robust for years to come. Equally, we have a pipeline both announced and unannounced that's very exciting," he said, further noting that Take-Two now owns Zynga, which brings in tons of money on a level the company didn't have when GTA V and Red Dead Redemption II released.</p><p>Not only that, but Zelnick pointed out how Take-Two plans to expand its business to new geographies. He said Take-Two currently mainly does most of its business in the US and Western Europe, but he believes there are "enormous opportunities" for growth in Asia, India, and Africa.</p><div tabindex="0"

was pressed to answer why Take-Two has so much confidence that GTA VI will be a hit. There is obviously a huge amount of hype behind the game, but Zelnick also reminded everyone that the data shows astonishing ongoing growth for GTA V and GTA Online more than a decade after the game came out.</p><p>"I think we feel as though the market's anticipation is at a fever pitch. And of course expectations are very high everywhere in this boardroom and all around the world for the perfection of what Rockstar typically delivers," Zelnick said.</p><p>Finally, Zelnick said GTA VI has the makings of being another big hit because the current-generation console market is already big and growing bigger still. Citing data from IDG, Zelnick said there are around 81 million current-generation consoles sold, with projections for 111 million by the end of 2024 and 175 million by the end of 2027.</p><p>Zelnick said he doesn't necessarily believe these numbers and projections will turn out to be accurate, but he does believe the console market is still growing. He also pointed out how he expects GTA VI to have a "very significant attach rate" for consoles. Zelnick was asked if GTA VI might help draw lapsed gamers back to the market, but he did not answer this question outright.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more GTA VI news as it's announced.</p>

Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.</p>

<p>As reported by <em><a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/five-nights-at-freddys-2-release-date-december-2025-1236006597/">Variety</a></em>, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including <em>M3GAN 2.0</em> and <em>The Black Phone 2</em>. It's not surprising to see <em>Five Nights At Freddy’s</em> getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2023/11/27/five-nights-at-freddys-continues-box-office-success-becomes-highest">Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever</a>, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tagline<i> </i>for <i>Five Nights At Freddy's 2 </i>reads<i>,</i> "Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances." The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>FNAF 2</em> won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em>, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/15/mortal-kombat-2-movie-gets-october-2025-release-date">recently confirmed</a> to release in October of that year.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/17/steamworld-heist-ii-announced-and-it-launches-august-8th/">SteamWorld Heist II was announced</a> last month, much to many people’s surprise. Today, Thunderful Games has released a new video that delves into the story of the pirate themed sequel, which comes nine years after the first SteamWorld Heist originally released for the Nintendo 3DS, which was set in Space.</p>
<p><iframe title="SteamWorld Heist II | Story Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7xT0nemVpc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>SteamWorld Heist II is set on the Great Oceanic Shard, a remnant of the shattered planet that revolves around its core. The water of the Shard sea are essential for the survival of the SteamWorld residents, who need it to keep running. However, the water is becoming corrosive and dangerous for everyone that relies on though no one knows why. Captain Quincy Leeway is more concerned about the location of his submarine, rather than the Royal Navy’s strict control over the Shard sea’s water.</p>
<p>Captain Leeway is the character players will be controlling in between missions, travelling around the Shard recruiting new members to the crew, as well as upgrading them too. Quincy has one arm and is not playable in missions, with the crew instead taking on the jobs instead. You will start with a couple of crewmates including Daisy, who is loyal to Quincy, and Wesley, who is seeking an honourable death in battle.</p>
<p>The world of Steamworld Heist II is a mystery, covering in fog until you go into areas, so you will not know what you are going into at first. The Royal Navy patrols the sea too, and is a danger to players as these ships will attack without warning. The world is also split between the warm Caribia sea and the cold Arctica sea. In Arctica, it is the Rattler faction that pose the danger to players. Combat is key to surviving on the sea, and your submarine will deal damage when lining up against enemy ships, however some enemies are very powerful. If you lose a battle and become shipwrecked, you will respawn at the last bar you visited. The submarine can be upgraded too with more powerful weapons and armour, an engine that allows for more speed, and an upgrade to dive under the waves.</p>

<p>Steamworld Heist II will be released on August 8th for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.</p>

There are a few reasons. For one, it opens the console up, letting you freely back up game installs and saves. You can also run emulators on the PS4 and play your installed games without a disc. And yes, some people are pirating new games and playing them on these hacked consoles, too. But we are not here to talk about that. Instead, I want to share a strange way people are jailbreaking PS4s. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hackaday.com/2024/05/16/you-can-now-jailbreak-a-ps4-with-an-lg-tv/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hackaday.com/2024/05/16/you-can-now-jailbreak-a-ps4-with-an-lg-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>HackADay.com</em></a></span>, a recently created method for jailbreaking a PS4 involves plugging it into a jailbroken LG smart TV. (And yes, in case you didn’t know about this already, people are jailbreaking smart televisions, too.) Once you’ve hacked your LG TV, you install a digital tool onto the TV and hook your PS4 up to it using an ethernet cable.

At that point, the tool should work its magic and you’ll soon have a jailbroken PS4.</p><p>This new tool is built upon the work of other modders and hackers who were able to figure out new ways to jailbreak Sony’s last-gen console.

            <p>War never changes, and either does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s love of a crossover. Thus, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a> and Fortnite are colliding as the post-apocalyptic RPG heads to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">battle royale</a> shooter’s upcoming next season.</p>

<p>The official Fortnite TwiXer account confirmed that Fallout would appear in its Wrecked season - that’s Chapter 5 Season 3, for those keeping count - by sharing an imagine of a Brotherhood of Steel knight in the iconic T-60 power armour looming over some yellow-orange clouds. Accompanying the teaser image were emoji of a winking face and a thumbs-up - a fairly unsubtle reference to Fallout's chirpy Vault Boy mascot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fortnite’s own in-game announcement adds that the crossover will arrive “courtesy of the Brotherhood of Steel” in exactly one week: next Friday, May 24th.</p>
<p>The reveal of the Fallout x Fortnite collab - the latest in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-will-soon-let-you-shoot-solid-snake-in-his-beautiful-butt-as-family-guys-peter-griffin-it-seems">long line of video game crossovers</a> for Epic’s battle royale game after the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war">God of War</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo</a>’s Master Chief - comes as it gears up for the next evolution of its map.</p>
<p>As is now standard for Fortnite, its next season was teased by an in-game event. This time, it saw the currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnites-myths-mortals-season-lets-you-wield-godlike-powers-and-bullet-bend-as-avatar-korra-later-today">Greek-themed map</a>’s statue of Zeus raise its sword to the sky and summon a pillar of red lightning that crashed onto Pandora’s Box. From there, the lightning ball went skipping over the map before exploding on the horizon, bringing forth dark clouds of a storm crackling with energy while an electric guitar shredded in the background.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>There’s been rumour of the Wrecked season having a post-apocalyptic theme - which the crossover with Fallout would certainly lend weight to - with recent leaks hinting at another collab with Mad Max, presumably timed with upcoming prequel movie Furiosa. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-latest-live-event-kicks-off-countdown-to-mad-max-esque-new-season">Eurogamer</a>.) Billie Eilish is also expected to turn up at some point, becoming the latest musician to enter the Fortnite spotlight after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnites-next-live-music-concert-is-eminem-marking-the-rappers-first-video-game-cameo-in-almost-20-years">Eminem</a>, Ariana Grande and more.</p>
<p>As for the Fallout crossover, we don’t yet know what it’ll look like. Will it just focus on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">very popular</a> Amazon TV series? Or will it dare to delve deeper than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> by pulling out some nods to the series’ early CRPG roots? We’ll know in a week!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-am-i-crying-because-of-a-damn-video-game-commercial.874347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24159066/ea-sports-college-football-trailer-analysis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="6eeVbx">I woke up this morning thinking I would be a normal, composed adult. Instead, I find myself crumpled over my keyboard, misty-eyed, compulsively texting friends I haven’t spoken to in years about a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes">trailer for a football video game</a>.</p>
<p id="aKz67m">Is this how my parents felt when they watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6QsCOU35ug">coffee commercials</a> in the ’90s? Am I having a midlife crisis? Maybe!</p>
<p id="XJF2f3">That won’t stop me from turning inward and answering a question I haven’t been able to shake since breakfast. Why is the trailer for EA Sports College Football 2025 <em>so</em> effective? I don’t have one definitive answer, but I do have three guesses:</p>
<p id="3HjAbQ"><strong>This trailer had to be excellent.</strong> A lot has changed since <em>NCAA Football 14</em> paused the series over a decade ago. The willingness of the NCAA (and EA, as a partner) to exploit unpaid college athletes became a popular and effective talking point across popular culture, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_Baby_Athletic_Association">episodes of <em>South Park</em></a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6fZV3OP44E">congressional hearings</a>. EA’s other football series, Madden, theoretically well-positioned with the exclusive rights to NFL simulation games, became a shadow of its past, inventive self. And the reputation of EA — following years of creative misfires and studio mismanagement — now stands somewhere between the DMV and the dentist. </p>
<p id="gzrYeO">The EA marketing team wasn’t going to let this rare, ultra-positive opportunity — bringing back a long-requested series, involving college athletes — go to waste.</p>
<div id="K299vq"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="1UlUHD"><strong>They borrowed from the best.</strong> Something about this trailer felt uncannily familiar, but it took a few viewings to pin that something down. It’s this: EA used the GTA trailer template. Quite literally. Take a moment to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1QDaXkufCo"><em>College Football 25 </em>trailer</a> alongside the trailer for <em>GTA 6,</em> embedded above.</p>
<p id="w0U2WJ">When Rockstar announces a new GTA game, their goal isn’t to show the experience of playing the game, but to produce the bubbly brain chemical feeling of being in the latest open world. GTA reveal trailers are, in the most skeletal form, montages of locals expressing themselves in big and emotional ways, interspersed with beautiful landscapes and iconic architecture. </p>
<p id="lc02yI">The format is a natural fit for EA’s College Football series, which places the pageantry of the sport right alongside the actual playing of football.  Players tap lucky charms on the way to the field. Live animal mascots buck on the sideline. A dude in a Trojan outfit stabs a football field with a sword as if to say, “Fuck off, this is my turf! I have a fucking sword!” </p>
<p id="woUeU5">When the Houser brothers founded Rockstar, they wanted to borrow from record labels, which knew one thing mattered above all else: the right vibes. I don’t think it’s an accident the <em>College Football 25</em> trailer uses a version of Guns N’ Roses “Welcome to the Jungle,” the song Rockstar used to reveal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOzcbtsw_pQ"><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em></a>.</p>
<div id="SLjffa"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1QDaXkufCo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="NdssYm"><strong>It’s been too long. </strong><em>NCAA Football 14, </em>the previous entry in the series, was released over a decade ago — around the time my connection with the series was on the wane. </p>
<p id="Rkd56C">Years before that, in the mid-’00s, the NCAA Football games had been the glue that bonded me and my college roommates. We never got the traditional American college football experience — the NYU Violets last played in 1952 — so we built increasingly intense allegiances to our favorite teams in the game, and then, gradually, outside the game too. By senior year, we regularly hounded one another about the superiority of USC, <em>The </em>Ohio State University, and the University of Texas, none of which we attended. Or had even visited. </p>
<p id="OpECn3">As we left college and our lives became busy in the way all adult lives do, we shed our ironic-but-not-ironic fandoms. And with little connection to the teams, and less time on our hands, our NCAA Football matchups faded, too. I was sad when EA put the kibosh on the series in 2014, perhaps less because I missed the game than I missed my friends.</p>
<p id="ks68Ch">So now, seeing this trailer, I’m flooded with all the good memories spent on a filthy couch that we took from the trash of a neighboring apartment building. That’s probably the real reason a video game trailer can make me cry. </p>

  <p id="TPKImH"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071083/fallout-tv-show-cast-seasons-explained">Fallout</a> is coming to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. Exactly how and when Bethesda Softworks’ post-apocalyptic franchise is coming to Epic’s battle royale-turned-everything game is unclear, but we’re pretty much guaranteed to get some cartoonish power armor out of it. We’re also likely to get some Vault Dweller jumpsuits, but it remains to be seen what exactly Epic and Bethesda have cooked up for the highly anticipated collaboration.</p>
<p id="SbCEpn">The official <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1791499072789979575">Fortnite social media account on X</a> (formerly Twitter) teased the crossover on Friday, hinting that Fallout-style bases and post-nuclear devastation could be dropping in on the battle royale island. No doubt Vault Boy will also make an appearance as part of the collab.</p>

<p id="Srgf3B"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131018/fallout-games-steam-player-count-bethesda-tv-show">Interest in the Fallout franchise is at a high point</a> right now, thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24122477/fallout-tv-series-review-prime-video-show">Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> TV series</a> and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24127478/fallout-4-next-gen-update-bethesda-tv-show">recent “next-gen” update for <em>Fallout 4</em></a>. That free upgrade rolled out for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of <em>Fallout 4</em> in April, and Bethesda’s been patching it up since.</p>
<p id="LNZliz"><em>Fortnite</em> players may get their hands on that Fallout-inspired content as early as next week. Chapter 5 season 3 of <em>Fortnite</em> — reportedly titled “Wrecked” — is expected to launch on May 24.</p>
<p id="2WRDtd">The Fallout franchise appears to also be coming to another big game soon: Call of Duty. Dataminers have <a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1785712301577789550">uncovered references to Fallout</a> (alongside Gundam and The Crow) that could be hints about content planned for season 4 of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone 2.0</em>. Call of Duty’s next season launches May 29.</p>

It started when Doja apparently tweeted a criticism of <em>Fortnite</em>’s waterbending ability, which was added to the game in the ongoing season to complement the introduction of a <em>Legend of Korra </em>skin and an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-avatar-last-airbender-skins-characters-sokka-1851399985&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-avatar-last-airbender-skins-characters-sokka-1851399985"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender </em>event</a></span> that concluded earlier this month. Doja has since deleted the tweet, but quote-tweeted a response to it and said, “IM HAVING A FUCKING MELTDOWN” before launching into a thorougly entertaining tirade about the feature.</p><p>According to the responses Doja received, she isn’t exactly alone in hating on waterbending, which appears in the game as a Mythic weapon, and thus is more highly valued and powerful than the average gun. <em>Fortnite </em>frequently introduces weapons like these in tandem with tie-in events, to mixed results. Early on in <em>Fortnite</em>’s lifetime, it added the Infinity Blade from the titular mobile Epic Games title, which could destroy structures and obliterate players in one fell swoop. Some folks really enjoyed the obviously busted nature of the weapon, while others were critical of its inclusion in a competitive game, since it threw off the game’s balance and, they argued, nearly guaranteed victory with little to no skill necessary.<br></p><p>It seems that Doja believes this is the current problem with <em>Fortnite</em> and waterbending, which may have been seen by some as a novelty weapon when it was first introduced. Now, it appears that it has perhaps overstayed its welcome. In Doja’s own words, “YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT THE GAME BECAUSE OF WATER BENDING, I WOULD BECOME SEVERELY DEPRESSED IF I HAD TO RELY ON ANY OF THESE STUPID NON FUCKING WEAPONS.”<br></p><p>Disgruntled players have taken to Doja Cat’s replies with the rest of their <em>Fortnite</em>-related woes, which seem to be tied to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing season’s Greek theme</a></span> and the ridiculous power-ups that came with it, including the explosive Thunderbolt of Zeus. One such player responded, “deadass u a pussy if u use water bending, chains, or the thunderbolt,” though Doja didn’t entirely ascribe to the same notion. Instead, she quote tweeted them to say she thought the thunderbolt was “fine,” and shared a similar sentiment about the season’s Wings of Icarus ability too.</p><p>While players routinely have their reservations and complaints about games, it does seem like constantly shifting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474">live-service titles</a></span> such as <em>Fortnite</em> bear the brunt of these criticisms these days.

In the case of <em>Fortnite</em>, though, it seems like its current season doesn’t really resemble the game that players initially invested in, which is par for the course when a game’s M.O. is to constantly change its core DNA to match the moment and the demands of players. If it didn’t change, <em>Fortnite</em>’s fan base would be the first to dub it a dead and stagnant game, making the core issue a complex and thorny one, not to mention kind of self-inflicted.<br></p><p>In other <em>Fortnite</em>-related news, Epic just announced that the game’s latest in a never ending string of collaborations will be with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-fallout-crossover-event-teaser-official-epic-1851484808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-fallout-crossover-event-teaser-official-epic-1851484808"><em>Fallout</em></a></span>, which has been enjoying a great deal of success following the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">wonderful TV adaptation</a></span> that debuted last month.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(I’ve recently been loving, but am terrible at, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627890/Ants_Took_My_Eyeball/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627890/Ants_Took_My_Eyeball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ants Took My Eyeball</em></a></span>, for instance.) I also play absolutely every <em>Metroid</em>-like platformer I can get my hands on. So what is it about <em>Animal Well</em> that is making me not only so happy, but also staying up so ludicrously late at night despite having 7am starts every morning?</p><p>I think it might be the yo-yo. But less facetiously, it’s the spectacularly tactile nature of the platforming. The little blob you play as bounces so perfectly, and with each gained ability feels leagues ahead. I deeply love how the game gives you a frisbee, but doesn’t tell you that it’s possible—well, vital—to ride on it. With every new item, there’s experimentation to discover its full potential. And yet, with all this, it doesn’t incessantly ruin all your fun with incessant boss fights! What a thing to behold. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3115c664ba05259f5f1b4872ec6267b3" data-recommend-id="image://3115c664ba05259f5f1b4872ec6267b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A strange creature stands before the player's sword in Dread Delusion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A strange creature stands before the player's sword in Dread Delusion." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lovely Hellplace</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3115c664ba05259f5f1b4872ec6267b3" data-recommend-id="image://3115c664ba05259f5f1b4872ec6267b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A strange creature stands before the player's sword in Dread Delusion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Windows (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.protondb.com/app/1574240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1574240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Deck OK</a></span>)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Venture further out into the world</p><p>I’ve said this here on <em>Kotaku </em>before, but so many role-playing games use the same Tolkien-esque building blocks in creating their worlds. And, look, there’s nothing wrong with that. I love dwarves and orcs and wizards with long gray beards as much as anyone. But it does make it all the more thrilling when you come across a world that feels truly original. I’ll never forget the excitement of venturing into <em>Morrowind</em>, finding a world with hints of familiarity, but that was also wondrous and strange. I’ve only barely stepped foot into <em>Dread Delusion</em>, a new first-person open-world RPG which just came out of early access this week, but already it’s giving me a similar feeling that I’m venturing into a world unlike any I’ve seen before. </p><p>There are familiar elements here, of course: swords and spells, sure, and vaguely <em>Warcraft</em>-esque flying airships to boot. But there are also crimson skies, and towering mushrooms, and enemies who defy description. The fact that the tech powering <em>Dread Delusion</em> makes it all feel reminiscent of late-90s <em>Might &amp; Magic </em>games only adds to the wonderfully textured atmosphere.</p><p><br>Thankfully, while the world itself is alien, the core RPG mechanics feel pretty approachable, and there’s plenty of flexibility in determining just what kind of character you want to create. As I said, I’ve only just scratched the surface of <em>Dread Delusion </em>thus far, but I’m very much looking forward to getting lost in it for a while this weekend and seeing what new wonders await over the horizon. — Carolyn Petit  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da2d3268aacd75a5bd305cc2831dbdbd" data-recommend-id="image://da2d3268aacd75a5bd305cc2831dbdbd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="716" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Snake looks around a corner while disguised at Pliskin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Snake looks around a corner while disguised at Pliskin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da2d3268aacd75a5bd305cc2831dbdbd" data-recommend-id="image://da2d3268aacd75a5bd305cc2831dbdbd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="716" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Snake looks around a corner while disguised at Pliskin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.protondb.com/app/2131640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2131640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Deck O</a></span>K)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Prepare for a European Extreme mode run</p><p>Having revisited the first <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and its spin-off, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341"><em>Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions</em></a></span>, I got the impulse to move onto <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, one of the many games I played to death in the 2000s.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341"><em>Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions</em>: The <em>Kotaku </em>Review</a></span></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122"><em>MGS2</em></a></span> is almost too perfect for me.

It at least looks like the Brotherhood of Steel, arguably Fallout’s most recognizable faction, will show up in some form, perhaps as a purchasable skin. Some music from the series, such as The Ink Spots’ I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire, could also pop up in some form, and it wouldn’t be a shock to see a Vault Boy skin either.</p><p>Fallout’s origin goes back to the release of the original game in the late ‘90s. Although it’s only grown in popularity since, the Bethesda and Microsoft IP seemed to reach new heights with the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-1-review-amazon-prime-video">Amazon Prime Video’s Fallout TV series</a> last month.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - Knight Recon Tracer Pack Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">What to expect from Season 4</h2><p dir="ltr">A new season of Call of Duty means a fresh battle pass for unlocking more weapons and cosmetics. Season passes usually contain at least one operator and two DLC weapons. One of the new free weapons for Season 4 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-4-confirms-the-return-of-iconic-rifle/1100-6523524/">confirmed to be the popular Kar98k bolt-action rifle</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on leaks from data miners, this season could include multiple crossover IP events, including collaborations with <a href="https://twitter.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1785712301577789550">Fallout, Gundam, and The Crow</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors are also swirling about a third crossover event with The Boys and a potential operator for the character Kimiko. While it might unrelated, Call of Duty socials <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1790469875057528989">commented on a new trailer for The Boys</a>, which was centered around Kimiko. Additionally, the actress who plays the character, Karen Fukuhara, was apparently also <a href="https://twitter.com/DETONATEDcom/status/1790803060840616291">seen at Infinity Ward studios</a>. The last two crossover events have added plenty of Supes to Call of Duty's growing list of operators, with Homelander, Starlight, Black Noir, A-Train, and Firecracker, so if true, it would be nice to finally see an actual member of The Boys join the lineup.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Official details haven't been revealed for this upcoming season of Warzone, but with the introduction of Rebirth Island in Season 3, players probably shouldn't expect a new map reveal. The season will likely focus on game modes, events, and new features.</p><h2 dir="ltr">MW3</h2><p dir="ltr">Activision hasn't announced any specific content for Season 4 of multiplayer, but the update will likely include new maps, game modes, and new limited-time events.</p><p dir="ltr">The recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-4-confirms-the-return-of-iconic-rifle/1100-6523524/">Season 4 teaser</a> seemingly makes a few references to the DNA Bomb multiplayer killstreak from Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare by using images of ominous green gas and a strand of DNA. This AW killstreak was earned by scoring 30 kills in one life, which is very similar to MW3's current nuke killstreak, with the only difference being that the DNA Bomb didn't end the match. It's uncertain how it might be used, as it is so similar to the existing nuke, but maybe this won't be a multiplayer feature and instead be used in Zombies or Warzone in some capacity.</p><p dir="ltr">There will likely be more Zombies content arriving sometime in Season 4, but the past two seasons have held the big Zombies update for the midseason "Reloaded" update. This means a possible new story mission, warlord boss, and new schematics could arrive, but players will likely be waiting until the halfway point of the season.</p><p dir="ltr">As always, all rumors must be taken with a grain of salt until confirmed by Activision. More official details should arrive closer to Season 4's launch.</p>

<p data-characters="325" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Gray Zone Warfare&nbsp;</em>has been&nbsp;riddled with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gray-zone-warfare-is-already-steams-best-seller-despite-mixed-player-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mixed reviews</a> on Steam, mainly concerning the many bugs that make it sometimes impossible to play. So, in an effort to address these issues, Madfinger Games has announced a fix for several notable glitches, with a mission to include “over 200” improvements.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="true">I’ve seen a lot of patch notes throughout my time in gaming, and the scope of 200 sure does seem like a lot. While the specifics of what they will include are relatively a mystery, we know the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/madfinger-games-will-patch-gray-zone-warfare-grenade-exploit-that-has-been-plaguing-players-at-home-base/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grenade exploit</a> will be patched. This annoying glitch allows players to hurt members of their own faction, taking their gear in the process. Now, these faction traitors will no longer have this power once&nbsp;<em>GZW</em>&nbsp;Patch 1 rolls out.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GZW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GZW</a> Update</p><p>We are currently testing Patch 1 for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GrayZoneWarfare?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GrayZoneWarfare</a>.</p><p>This Patch addresses issues like the Grenade Exploit, customizable VOIP key bind, losing gear after a crash, and over 200 other improvements.</p></div>— Gray Zone Warfare (@GrayZoneWarfare) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrayZoneWarfare/status/1791491072117428610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">Other than the exploit, the crashes that cause a player’s gear to disappear will be addressed. I, for one, would like to regain all those <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-missing-task-rewards-in-gray-zone-warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quest rewards</a> I lost from this. However, it doesn’t seem like these objects will&nbsp;be placed back, as it will only get rid of the crashes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">What the other 200 improvements will entail is unknown, but players have been chiming in on a few of them. Specifically, soldiers hope to see a buff to shotguns, which have been considered a relatively weak weapon amongst some players.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">Another upcoming feature that may make it to&nbsp;<em>GZW&nbsp;</em>Patch 1 is the day/night cycle. Nevertheless, it is only slated for&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/GrayZoneWarfare/status/1791121441460457805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“one of the early updates,”</a>&nbsp;so it might not be available for the first patch.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">You can expect&nbsp;<em>Gray Zone Warfare&nbsp;</em>Patch 1 sometime next week, either debuting at the beginning of the week or, at the latest, May 24, 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="317" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Netflix has released some new information about its upcoming <em>Terminator</em> anime series, now formally christened <em>Terminator Zero</em>. Alongside a batch of awesome first-look images, we also have the series’ official release date and a brief synopsis of its story. Here’s everything we know about <em>Terminator Zero</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-when-will-terminator-zero-be-released" data-injectable="false">When will Terminator Zero be released?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Production I.G</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">Barring any final-hour delays, <em>Terminator Zero</em> <strong>will be released</strong> <strong>on August 29, 2024</strong>. It’s a date with an interesting in-universe tie-in, too. Within the <em>Terminator</em> franchise, August 29, 1997, is “Judgement Day,” the day the artificial intelligence network known as Skynet is prophesized to achieve sentience and unleash nuclear Armageddon upon the world.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-terminator-zero-about" data-injectable="false">What is Terminator Zero about?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Production I.G</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">Like most other entries in the <em>Terminator</em> franchise, the story of <em>Terminator Zero</em> will involve time travel. The series’ protagonist, an as-yet-unnamed soldier, travels back in time to 1997 to protect Malcolm Lee, a scientist working to create a “benevolent” AI designed to protect humanity from Skynet.</p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">Of course, the soldier’s job won’t be easy, as Skynet has sent an “unrelenting assassin” to the past to kill not only Malcolm, but also his three children. Amidst all this, Malcolm will grapple with the complex moral ramifications of designing what boils down to a digitized child soldier, who will bear the brunt of Skynet’s malevolence.</p> <h2 id="h-who-is-making-terminator-zero" data-injectable="false">Who is making Terminator Zero?</h2> <figure data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Production I.G</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">While Netflix will produce <em>Terminator Zero</em>, the series will be animated by <strong>Production I.G</strong>, the studio behind many iconic anime films and television series, including <em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand-Alone Complex</em>, <em>Psycho-Pass</em>, and <em>Haikyu!!</em>. The series will be directed by Masashi Kudō, who served as the director for the insanely popular anime adaption of Tite Kubo’s <em>Bleach</em>.</p> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="false">Mattson Tomlin, who also wrote the script for <em>The Batman: Part II, </em>will write<em> Terminator Zero’s </em>script. In <a href="https://ew.com/terminator-zero-anime-first-look-mattson-tomlin-exclusive-8645307">an interview with Entertainment Weekly</a><em>, </em>Tomlin stated that the series will treat every movie in the <em>Terminator</em> franchise as canon, meaning that plenty of Easter eggs and nods will be peppered throughout <em>Terminator Zero’s</em> eight episodes.</p>

            <p>As you might’ve heard, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a> is out in early access, offering up the much-anticipated sequel to Supergiant’s mythical (and delightfully thirsty) roguelite. Though the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">sheer amount of polish and Stuff</a> in even its pre-release form might have you thinking that a full 1.0 release can’t be too far down the line, the game’s creative director reckons we’ve still got around a year to wait before it’s considered all finished up.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<p>That’s per Greg Kasavin’s recent chat with cheery RPS fansite<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hades-2s-creative-director-says-we-expect-to-be-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year/"> PC Gamer</a>, during which Kasavin touched on the gameplay differences between OG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>’ Zagreus and Hades 2 hero Melinoë - with more of a lean towards fast-paced spellcasting and area-of-effect attacks - and the litany of small details packed into the game, such as the different reactions of characters to the player’s choices such as picking boons or during boss fights.</p>
<p>With Hades 2 crammed full of those small touches on top of the obvious need to constantly tweak and balance its combat, Kasavin said that the team won’t be rushing to get the finished game out the door. In the near future, there’ll be a run of smaller patches that further polish existing parts of the gameplay - similar to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-hades-2-patch-lets-you-gather-seed-silver-and-souls-simultaneously">recent tweaks to resource-gathering and sprinting</a> - with at least one bigger update that will introduce brand new elements such as enemies, environments and features. While that big update is in the works for “several months”, there’ll be a pause on the smaller fixes.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/hades-2-early-access-review-7.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>“We'll patch that a few times to shore up any issues, and repeat this broader process... until we consider the game complete!” Kasavin said, which suggests we’ll see some more ‘Major Updates’ after that, too. For the first big addition, at least, Kasavin teased that Supergiant already have a particular theme in mind, which enterprising players may uncover if they delve deep enough into the game.</p>
<p>All in all, Kasavin expects Hades 2 to remain in early access “at least through the end of this year”. That’s perhaps not surprising given the first game took around two years from early access launch to 1.0, and the sequel has arrived with even more to play with in the meantime - meaning even more to tweak and balance along the way for its developers, too.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-game-pass-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the reports circulating</a> that Microsoft is set to put Call of Duty Black Ops 6 onto Xbox Game Pass at launch, the company appears to ready to make changes to the services tiers as well. According to multiple insiders, Xbox Game Pass is set to receive changes to its tiers due to the addition of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>“We can assure you that changes are coming to the Xbox Game Pass Tiers mainly due to Call Of Duty,” Insider eXtas1stv <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1791468893925417436?t=P6CsgjcO5D50_1lhFayKEg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a>. “There are still things to confirm, but I hope to report back soon.”</p>



<p>This was then followed up by Shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot30-why-so-series-x-s.820296/page-540?post=123109182#post-123109182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reset Era saying</a>, “There will be changes, yes”.</p>



<p>Whether that means price changes or simply adding another premium tier remains to be seen. But it seems clear that more changes are in store for Xbox Game Pass. Currently, the service has three total plans. There’s Xbox Game Pass Core for console that replaced Xbox Live Gold for $9.99/month, Game Pass PC for $9.99/month, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate that covers both console and PC for $16.99/month.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft for comment on these reports. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

Here's where you can find Xur this weekend and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week you can find Xur on <strong>Nessus, </strong>in <strong>The Watcher's Grave</strong>. For his weapon, Xur is offering <strong>Arbalest</strong>. Hunters can pick up <strong>Raiju's Harness</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Aeon Safe</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>The Stag</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304741-xurnessus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304741" data-ratio="0.56197916666667" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304741-xurnessus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304741"></a><figcaption>Xur's location on nessus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304741-xurnessus.jpg"></figure><p>Head to Nessus and use the Watcher's Grave transmat zone to find Xur this week. When you arrive, hop on your sparrow and head north toward the exit of the area. Look for a big tree with pink moss on the right side of the area.

You can deactivate the Super early to create a blinding explosion and gain a temporary bonus to Arc damage. Your Arc staff will also consume less energy when you're not attacking with it. The stats here are mostly well balanced, with mobility being the best, but resilience is very low. Intellect is average, so you'll want to mod those two stats specifically.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 18</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 9</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 62</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Aeon Safe (Exotic Titan gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304745-destiny22024-05-1719-12-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304745" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304745-destiny22024-05-1719-12-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304745"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304745-destiny22024-05-1719-12-54.jpg"></figure><p>Like other Exotic armor pieces in the Aeon line, Aeon Safe has three unique Armor Mods that work well with team-focused builds. Sect of Insight specializes in empowering your allies, and the stats on this roll aren't too bad. Resilience is pretty good and intellect is very high here, allowing you to gain quicker cooldowns on your Super abilities. Discipline is very low and mobility is unnecessarily high, so you'll have to plan your build accordingly to work around these.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 13</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 16</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 20</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 68</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">The Stag (Exotic Warlock helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304746-destiny22024-05-1719-13-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304746" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304746-destiny22024-05-1719-13-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304746"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304746-destiny22024-05-1719-13-04.jpg"></figure><p>While it looks like it belongs in Alan Wake 2, The Stag is actually a Destiny 2 classic. This Exotic buffs Warlock Rifts to reduce damage for allies, and if you fall in battle, you'll leave a healing rift behind for your teammates. This is a pretty good roll that goes all in on the identity of this Exotic, as the recovery stat is almost maxed out. Resilience is sadly low and intellect could be better, but this is a good Exotic to grab in case you plan to be the team medic.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 30</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 18</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 65</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Exotic Weapons</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Arbalest (Exotic linear fusion rifle)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304747-destiny22024-05-1719-12-29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304747" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304747-destiny22024-05-1719-12-29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304747"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304747-destiny22024-05-1719-12-29.jpg"></figure><p>A very nice linear fusion rifle, Arbalest has two great abilities. Disruption Break lets you make enemies more vulnerable to kinetic weapons after you break their shields with Arbalest, and Compounding Force is perfect for breaking through the defenses of pesky

His exact location is always a mystery when he first arrives, as he is not listed on the map, and for novice players, he can be easy to miss. However, there are a set number of locations where he takes up residence, including the Tower Hangar area, on Nessus in Watcher's Grave, and in the Winding Cove area of the EDZ.</p>

<p data-characters="367" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> has a new promotional event where buying items in real life benefits players in-game. If you want to collect some of the sweet new Mountain Dew crossover items in <em>FFXIV</em>, including a brand new exclusive mount, you’ll want to pick up a few bottles of the sugary drink. Here’s what to do to earn all of the items while this event is still running. </p> <h2 id="h-all-mountain-dew-drinks-and-points-explained" data-injectable="false">All Mountain Dew drinks and points, explained</h2> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">For starters, the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-event-calendar-seasonal-ongoing-and-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FFXIV</a></em> crossover event with Mountain Dew is only running for a limited time, so don’t wait or you might miss out on these goodies. How the event works is players buy specially marked Mountain Dew Gaming 20oz bottles, and only them. 2-liters, cans, and so on don’t count at this time. They have a banner around them that reference rewards you can unlock right now. These bottles have a 10-digit code underneath the cap, which grants you some points to your Mountain Dew Gaming account. </p>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">You can then turn around and exchange those points for various prizes, of which there are a few themed around <em>FFXIV</em>, specifically. Unfortunately, some of the 20oz bottles of Mountain Dew go for different points than others, which might be a bit confusing. Below, you’ll find all the different flavors and how many points they’re worth online: </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Mountain Dew Frostbite:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>Purple Thunder:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>Maui Burst:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>Over Drive:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>All other flavors (original, Zero Sugar, Code Red, etc):</strong> 100 points each</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-mountain-dew-gaming-points" data-injectable="false">How to redeem Mountain Dew Gaming points</h2> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">Once you’ve bought yourself a Mountain Dew bottle (or a dozen), it is now time to finally start redeeming some points. What you want to do is look underneath the cap for a 10-digit code. Head to this website right <a href="https://www.mtndewgaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and create a Mountain Dew Gaming account or login to an existing one. You’ll see the option to enter each code and you’ll receive the appropriate number of points, as mentioned above. </p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">You can seemingly redeem as many codes as you want while the event is live. However, this event is only available in the United States for now. Unfortunately, this event excludes Canadian players. Worse still, don’t waste your time trying to redeem one of the rewards on your <em>FFXIV</em> account if its region is different from the US, because it won’t work. </p> <figure data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>

<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rumors about a&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fallout</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fortnite</span></em>&nbsp;collaboration have been circulating the community, particularly in light of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-biggest-changes-the-fallout-show-introduced-to-the-lore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video</a> show. Those speculations are now realized with an artwork teaser for an upcoming&nbsp;<em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fortnite</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;update.&nbsp;</span></p> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">In this teaser, we see the series’ iconic Power Armor, which almost anyone, fan or not, would recognize. But instead of&nbsp;<em>Fallout’s&nbsp;</em>classic look, the suit of armor will be transcended into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite’s&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-players-claim-its-almost-impossible-to-complete-battle-pass-without-spending-real-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Now, the burning question is: What unique elements will this&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>x&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>&nbsp;collaboration bring? It’s a safe bet that we’ll see new&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>skins, a trend we’ve witnessed with numerous other franchises like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-aang-skin-avatar-last-airbender-elements-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>. The Power Suit, featured prominently in the teaser, is likely to be one of them. Personally, I’m hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> Vault Jumpsuit to be part of the mix.</p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">New&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>-themed quests could be&nbsp;another feature included in the crossover.&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;isn’t shy of having collaboration missions, similar to&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-a-lightsaber-in-fortnite-x-star-wars-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lightsaber tasks</a>. Map iterations may also be a part of this, possibly including vault locations.&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>already has vaults in-game, so why not add a&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>touch to match the theme?&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">As for items, a Pip-Boy could be used for Battle Royale. It would make for a great accessory, keeping with the tradition of tracking information for the player.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Given that the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>franchise has multiple entries,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>could go almost anywhere with this collaboration. It could offer content for one of the most famous entries<em>, Fallout 4</em>, or focus on some of the newer elements of the TV show. Of course, there are plenty of other iterations, such as&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="false">Only time will tell what this&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>x&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>&nbsp;collaboration will bring. But the one thing we know for sure is that war never changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="200" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Good news for anyone playing <em>Redfall</em>, or anyone who cares about a gaming ecosystem where publishers can’t make entire titles vanish from existence: the game is still going to get its offline mode.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">Arkane Austin has just announced that <em>Redfall</em> will be getting one final update before the studio shuts its doors for good. The update will make some changes to the Neighborhood and Nest systems, potentially pulling in new or returning players, and it will also add single player pausing and an offline mode to let people actually continue to play the game, which otherwise would have all but disappeared whenever Microsoft decided to take down the servers.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you for all your supportive messages. </p><p>We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. </p><p>We’ll provide additional details soon. Thank you all.</p></div>— Redfall (@playRedfall) <a href="https://twitter.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true">Earlier this month <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/">Microsoft essentially dissolved four studios</a> in one unceremonious swoop. <em>Redfall </em>developer Arkane Austin got cut alongside Tango Gameworks (<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>) and Alpha Dog Games (<em>Mighty DOOM</em>), while Roundhouse Studios got merged into ZeniMax Online Studios. It was another heartbreaking example of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/">game developers losing work</a>, whether or not their game succeeded in the market. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-redfall-pc-xbox-arkane-microsoft/"><em>Redfall </em>didn’t wow reviewers</a> or gamers last year, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hi-fi-rush-represents-game-pass-secret-strength/"><em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>was a definite success</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="false">The final <em>Redfall </em>update is bittersweet news to say the least. The game might have failed to make an impact, but Arkane proved with <em>Prey </em>that it has the capacity to make a great game. Given a little more time to make updates and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-killed-redfall-right-before-arkane-could-save-it-from-online-only-fate/">actually release the game’s planned DLC</a>, Arkane Austin might have been able to turn <em>Redfall </em>around. Now we’ll never know. The last update will technically keep the game alive, but with Arkane Austin itself being shuttered, that doesn’t feel like much of a win.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Endless Legend, the superb fantasy 4X game from developer Amplitude Studios, is currently free to download and keep on Steam - and there's still almost a week to claim it.
</p>
<p>
Amplitude - which has also developed the likes of Endless Space, Dungeons of the Endless, and Humankind - released Endless Legend back in 2014. It quickly drew praise for its fantasy flavoured Civ-style strategy - enlivened by some smart twists on the formula and its highly distinctive factions - mixed with a heavy dollop of lore.
</p>
<p>
If you're still a stranger to Endless Legend's action some ten years after its release, and the above description has set your strategy nubbin a-tingling, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289130/ENDLESS_Legend/">permanently add it to your Steam library</a> for the princely sum of zero money right now. And don't panic if you're currently indisposed: the offer runs until next Thursday, 23rd May.
</p>

<a aria-label="Get Endless Legend for FREE!" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYc_j0Y3o-0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
To coincide with Endless Legends' 100% price slash, its nine expansions are also heavily discounted, with the priciest currently costing £2.19 and the cheapest slinking in at a svelt 59p.
</p>
<p>
And if you'd like to check out more of Amplitude's work, it's probably also worth noting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/AmplitudeStudios">studio's entire catalogue</a> is currently discounted on Steam, meaning substantial savings on everything from Endless Space and Humankind to the more recent Endless Dungeon.

            <p>If you’ve been wondering what Valve’s been working on as their next game after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-2-best-settings">Counter-Strike 2</a>, the answer may be at hand. Details and screenshots for Deadlock, a third-person hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> with MOBA elements, have seemingly leaked out of a recent closed playtest, revealing a blend of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> and Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Deadlock is apparently the latest evolution of a project previously known as Neon Prime, which you may faintly recall <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-register-mysterious-new-neon-prime-trademark-in-the-us">Valve registering a vague trademark for</a> a couple of years back. The game’s reappearance as Deadlock came via <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557">noted Valve leaker Gabe Follower</a>, who described it as being a competitive hero shooter in the vein of Overwatch or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> - albeit in third-person - with the lane-based map design and even tower defence elements of MOBAs like Dota 2 or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Those maps will host matches between two teams of six players, who will control unique hero characters able to pop off different abilities and items. The maps themselves are said to be “huge”, with the inclusion of floating rails - a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> - to help players zip around.</p>
<p>The game’s world also seems to draw at least a little from the likes of BioShock, with a mixture of steampunk and fantasy in a European-inspired city home to strange creatures, robots and magicians alike. (Gabe Follower notes that the game was originally more sci-fi-themed closer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a> - which might explain the futuristic-sounding Neon Prime moniker - but shifted more to fantasy after “bad feedback” from testers.)</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Screenshots supposedly verified by the leaker reveal at least one character, a bow-wielding ranger called Grey Talon with the ability to use traps alongside long-range precision. The character design does indeed look very Overwatch-y or Dota-y to my eye, with the teases of the map showing graffitied city streets and alleys.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8MqhEz6N_k">Tyler McVicker</a> added to the swirling rumours by claiming that the now-leaky closed playtest already has hundreds of people giving Deadlock a go, with a proper announcement and reveal of Valve’s next “major” game due sometime soon - perhaps sooner than even the developers expected, given the information already finding its way out into the public eye.</p>
