			<p>Dune: Awakening was one of the major games showcased at Gamescom 2024, where they announced the plans to release the game in Early 2025. Additionally, during Gamescom, 30 minutes of Dune: Awakening gameplay will be showcased later in the week. Those excited about the game managed to get an exclusive look at the game during Gamescom Opening Night Live, where they got to see a 5-minute exclusive gameplay reveal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening – Exclusive Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ud3EW5aAUZ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The reveal for <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-qa-creative-director-clarifies-mmo-size-hints-at-beyond-arrakis/">Dune: Awakening</a> shows the player's rise from scavenging and survival to mobilizing an entire guild hunting for spice. Players will explore the scorching desert full of colossal sandworms while trying their hardest to survive the harsh heat. To make their journey more tolerable, players will have to learn the survival instincts of the Fremen.</p>
<p>To also aid your survival, you can expand your influence in many ways throughout Dune: Awakening, including combat, spice flow, and upgrading your bases. You can choose which path to take and develop your character by walking the path of the Mentat, Trooper, Planetologist, Swordmaster, or Bene Gesserit.</p>
<p>You have to try and control the spice to cling to power while warfare rages on around you. You can join a guild and align with either House Harkonnen or Atreides, where you'll then battle each other for spice in dynamic guild battles involving various vehicles, tech, and specialized combatants.</p>
<p>For those who got to experience the showcase of Dune: Awakening at Gamescom in person, you may have seen the towering Sandworm sculpture that led you to their booth, where you can watch the extended 30-minute gameplay presentation. You'll also get to leave with your own Fremkit goodie bag. In addition, journalists and creators at Gamescom will also get the chance to try a demo of Dune: Awakening, where they can then share their impressions with the wider public.</p>
<p>Multiple content creators will also showcase Dune: Awakening's 30-minute presentation over the next few days, with content creators such as Sacriel, Alphacast, and Mowky showing off the gameplay.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening will launch in early 2025 on PC, with the game arriving on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later. To list the game on PC and console, visit the <a href="https://duneawakening.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> and sign up. You can enter the closed Beta when it happens.</p>
<p>In addition to the 30-minute showcase of Dune: Awakening, Funcom has announced that a third Dune: Awakening Direct will air on August 29. The direct will showcase more game play footage and some of the game's features, with Soe Gschwind hosting.</p>

The series, <em>Secret Level</em>, is an adult-animated anthology series. Each episode in the series will tell unique story set in different iconic game settings including <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<p>At Gamescom, Tim Miller took the stage to promote Secret Level. Miller was noticeably emotional, stating that the show was a love letter to videogames and to the unique characters and settings to which they belong.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//gLihxsmI_OU"></iframe></p>
<p>The teaser trailer shown at the event contained short snippets of different videogame characters. Notable standouts were a squad of Space Marines from <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>God of War's</em></a> Kratos, the protagonist from the martial arts action game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sifu-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Sifu</em></a>, and the five-headed dragon Tiamat from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>
<p>An official press release provided some additional information. <em>Secret Level</em> is a 15-episode animated anthology series.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.
</p>
<p>Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

<p>In Arc Raiders - or ARC Raiders, if I'm feeling generous - you're a survivor in an underground colony. The ARC are deadly machines who rule the surface. As a scavenger, you go on sorties in search of supplies at the behest of traders and quest givers back home, working with or against other players to make it back home with the goods.
</p>
<p>It's now a "$40 premium title", according to Embark. "There are many reasons for this change, and they all boil down to our conviction that a premium business model is a better fit for the type of game we’re building. A premium model allows us to create a more focused, balanced, and engaging action-survival experience."
</p>
<p>Embark are also planning on running a couple of beta tests in the near future, beginning with a tech test between October 24th and 27th. You can sign up for that now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">via its Steam page</a>.
</p>
<p>I'm glad of the change away from free-to-play. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-finals-review">truly love The Finals</a>, but its business model makes its continued existence feel perilous given its inevitably dwindling player numbers.

However, Amazon is the lone retailer that still regularly offers Game Pass Ultimate codes for the price <em>before </em>the last price hike.

<p>Hot off the back of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">incredibly bland Borderlands film</a>, Gamescom Opening Night Live kicked off with a CG trailer tease for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">Borderlands 4</a>. Not a lot to go on here, but it's coming in 2025. </p>

<p>A bit more substance this one. Ahead of its release on October 25th, we got a look at the 'Most Wanted' campaign mission of COD Blops 6. Ironically, the start of trailer saw an emphasis on a very different kind of 'shooting' - with a camera, rather than down our ironsights. But there was still plenty of classic shooty shoots toward the end, though, with explosions, ziplines and car chases a go-go. Just mind those quick-time events - wouldn't want to go splat down that lift shaft now, would we?</p>
<h2>Goat Simulator Remastered</h2>

<p>One of the more baffling trailers of the evening, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> Remastered is indeed a thing. It's coming later this year.</p>

<p>A brand-new game set in the Dying Light universe, this is another spooky first-person parkour 'em up with zombos, nasty beasties and probably loads more creatures of the night stalking you and your fellow survivors. Geoff also confirmed it will have around 20 hours of stuff to do, and feature a new region in the Dying Light universe. No date yet, but we've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-a-new-18-hour-standalone-game-that-began-life-as-dlc">more details here</a>.</p>

<p>If I was a betting woman, I'd say the elevator pitch for King of Meat probably went something like: "Amazon Games does <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>". Though in actual fact, it's being made by UK studio Glowmade, with Amazon on publishing duties. So maybe "Ex-Media Molecule developers does Fall Guys" is more accurate (though slightly less catchy). In any case, you can certainly see the spirit of Sack Boy is well and truly alive in this chaotic co-op party game. No release date yet, but our Ed has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/king-of-meat-is-a-chaotic-new-amazon-published-game-from-ex-lionhead-and-media-molecule-developers">all the details you need right here</a>. </p>

Cue some evocative wailing. You can climb up to vantage points, stake out bases, or use your various gadgetry to take out your enemies from a distance. You'll also be making water from your enemy's blood (but of course) in order to survive, and constructing ornithopters, settlements and more. It's coming to PC in early 2025.</p>

We also got a glimpse of the settlement you'll be holding up in, as well as a thundering great dragon lad enemy. Still no date other than 2025, but at least we got a glimpse of some succulent monster meat chops. Sooooo tasty! </p>

<p>Herdling, the new game from the creators of Far: Lone Sails, is, yep, you guessed it, a game about herding big fluffy yak-like creatures across wide open landscapes. While part of me is just a teeny bit sad that we're not getting more Far this time round, I mean, look at those yaks. They're adorable. And even though you're not running around a giant boat-submarine-train, those landscapes sure do look very Far-esque. I'm into it. Herdling is coming in 2025.</p>

<p>Peter Molyneux has returned from the mists to announce his brand-new game, Masters of Albion. After assembling a group of devs who previously worked with him on Fable and Dungeon Keeper, this open world god game has big Black and White energy, albeit with a more customisble bent that lets you design buildings, meals, armour and more. You can also zoom down to possess your townsfolk in third person to fight enemies that come knocking on your castle walls at night yourself if you fancy it, but god mode also looks as though it has some tasty powers to play with too. No release date yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam to find out more, or read editor-in-chief Tom Phillips' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-a-fallen-god-of-game-design-seeking-one-final-chance">big interview with the Molyneux himself</a> right here. </p>

<p>From the mildly ridiculous to the sublime (well, if a heavily Troy Baker-narrated gameplay trailer is your idea of sublime rather than just a pure Indy gameplay trailer), we got a nice hefty look at some in-game action from Indiana and the Great Circle in this latest trailer. And it's shaping up pretty nicely from the looks of things! By why rely on Troy to tell you about Indy? Our Victoria Kennedy has loads more details on the game right here, so why not read up on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-makes-a-timid-but-faithful-first-impression">her thoughts</a> ahead of its newly revealed release date of 9th December 2024 (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">Spring 2025 for PS5 players</a>).  </p>

<p>Closing out this year's Opening Night Live was a teaser for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">brand-new Mafia game</a>, though in truth it felt like more of a teaser trailer for Geoff's Game Awards in December, as the trailer closed out with your classic 'more info in December!' messaging. Bit of a short-straw for developer Hangar 13, there, but that's Geoffcom for you.   </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-and-full-ray-tracing-path-tracing-on-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA had another big Gamescom 2024 announcement to make, although it is a bit staggered due to a later embargo compared to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a>: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will join Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, and Black Myth: Wukong in the very restricted club of PC games that support NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and full ray tracing.</p>
<p>Also known as path tracing, it was only viable for offline rendering and, therefore, limited to usage in movies and TV series until not long ago. It was only the arrival of upscalers and specifically frame generation techniques that allowed its real-time application to gaming, starting with CD Projekt RED's open world game once Update 1.6.2 went live in April 2023. Alan Wake 2 followed suit last Fall, and Black Myth: Wukong launches today.</p>
<p>All of these games have been made with different engines (REDengine 4, Northlight Engine, and Unreal Engine 5) and the same is true for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which is powered by id Tech. We don't know which version of the engine is being used, but it was most likely based on id Tech 7, which powered DOOM Eternal.</p>
<p>That game ran extremely well, but then again, it only featured ray traced reflections (added with a post-launch update). MachineGames does have some experience, having added ray traced reflections to Wolfenstein: Youngblood with a post-launch update, but the performance cost will be much higher in this case.</p>

<p>The official PC system specifications of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have yet to be released, but we'll let you know once the developers share them. In related news, you can read our preview from the pre-Gamescom presentation and an in-depth developer Q&amp;A with MachineGames in <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> article. The game will launch on PC and Xbox Series S|X on December 9, while a PlayStation 5 version is coming next Spring.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-7-lets-you-mix-and-match-history-%E2%80%94-and-it%E2%80%99s-a-blast.958953/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Imagine Caesar Augustus at the head of an army of Mongol warriors or Ben Franklin building the Great Wall of China. In Sid Meier’s <em>Civilization 7</em>, such flights of historical fantasy can become historical fact. The game has new ages to experience, new civilizations to build up, new leaders to guide them, and — for the first time in franchise history — the ability to mix and match leaders and civilizations to build the empire of your wildest dreams. <em>The Verge</em> had the opportunity to test out the game and talk with its developers at Firaxis Games. The brief, three-hour demo wasn’t enough time to get a feel for how well leaders and different civilizations work together, but I left feeling excited about all the ways <em>Civilization VII</em> aims to change the course of history.&nbsp;</p><p>In previous <em>Civilization </em>games, civs were always tied to a specific leader who was usually, but not always, a noteworthy head of state. Later iterations of the game offered multiple leaders for civs, and on a couple of occasions where it made historical sense, one leader could straddle multiple civs like France and England both having access to Eleanor of Aquitaine, who, during her unusually-long-for-the-time-period life, was the queen of both countries.</p><div><p>“We’ve known for a long time that our community has wanted a ‘build my own civilization’ tool kit.”</p></div><p>In <em>Civilization VII</em>, leaders are no longer tied to specific countries, giving players the opportunity to synergize the special abilities and bonuses of leaders with the unique attributes and units of different civs.</p><p>“We’ve known for a long time that our community has wanted a ‘build my own civilization’ tool kit,” Ed Beach, <em>Civ 7</em>’s creative director, says. Beach explained that balance issues made this feature unfeasible for previous games, but it was a priority for <em>Civ 7</em>. “If we make all the leaders balance with each other and all the civs balance with each other, then mixing and matching will work.”</p><p>Before a <em>Civ 7</em> game starts, players will choose their leader, then their civ. The game will make recommendations as to what civ will best suit a particular leader according to the specific strengths and “styles” of each. I chose Amina, warrior-queen of Zazzau, as my leader. She’s an economic and militaristic leader suited for civs that like to fight or make a lot of money. I don’t like to fight, but cash rules everything around me, so I settled on pursuing an economic victory. And though her attributes make her well-suited to a civ like Egypt or Rome, I chose her to lead her native civ of Aksum.</p><p><small>In previous <em>Civ</em> games, Hatshepsut would lead Egypt. In <em>Civilization 7</em>, however, the choice is yours, and you can see what different civs she’s best suited to govern.</small></p><p>According to Beach, <em>Civ</em> games are developed according to a simple equation whereby one-third of the game is new, the other third is updated, and the final third stays the same.&nbsp;</p><p>Though <em>Civilization</em> is one of my “quintessentially me” game series, I completely skipped over <em>Civ 6</em>. But as I played Civ 7’s demo, I realized that the moment-to-moment gameplay fell into the “stayed the same” category. Despite missing out on an entire game, I was able to parse the new-to-me user interface. And what I didn’t quite grasp, like the feature that allows players to develop specialized districts within a city, the game’s tutorial was very good at catching me up on.&nbsp;</p><p>One feature that was part of the “update” slice of the <em>Civilization </em>development pie was the historical era system. Where before, the passage of time was marked by a civ progressing from the ancient era to the classical era, Firaxis has streamlined the many historical eras into just three chapters — antiquity, exploration, and modern. Within each chapter are legacy paths or goals the player pursues with each path arranged into one of four categories that’ll sound familiar to <em>Civilization</em>-heads like myself — economic, military, cultural, and science. Since I was gunning for the economic victory, its attendant legacy path required me to do things like establish several trade routes or amass a wide variety of resources other world leaders would pay top dollar to get their hands on.</p><p>At the heart of <em>Civilization 7 </em>is the idea that history is built in layers. Beach used the evolution of the city of London as an example, explaining how different empires dramatically changed the face of the city. The Romans built the city’s walls that the Saxons would later improve before the Normans came and updated them even further.&nbsp;</p><p>The ability to mix and match civilizations comes from this “layered” concept of history, and it doesn’t end when a player first picks their leader and civ. For the first time in the series’ history, players will be able to change their civilization at different points throughout the game. The game keeps track of the decisions players made and the legacy paths they pursued, then when a player progresses to the next chapter of history, they’ll get a new civilization to lead based on their choices.</p><div><figcaption><em>Cities look better than ever in Civilization 7. Will you let your city grow organically or meticulously engineer your city to perfection?</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Firaxis Games</cite></p></div><p>For example, at the start of the Exploration Age, I might have had the choice to change from Aksum into another economy-focused civ like the Dutch. Or, had I indulged her militaristic capabilities, I might have gotten the Spanish empire instead.&nbsp;</p><p>And though the idea of Ben Franklin leading the Chinese might upset some history buffs, the idea of civilizations evolving into something new based on the paths they take and the technologies they develop is sound history. London’s various evolutions from a regional Roman capital to the crown jewel of the British empire is just one example.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have a system that’s listening to events that are happening in the game world,” Beach says. “And it has multiple thousands of little stories that can come out of the game because something has triggered.”&nbsp;</p><p>Those events don’t have to be civilization-shaking in scale, either. My scientists had developed a new food treatment technique but needed to know how to deploy it: should they use it on some bitter berries to make them more palatable or use it to soak some hyena meat? Since the idea of eating grilled hyena didn’t sound too appealing, I chose the berries leading to the discovery of how to cultivate olives.</p><p>I bitterly lament that the demo didn’t let me progress to the next age to see how impactful the humble olive would have had on my civilization’s history or the new civs Aksum could have evolved into. That kind of dynastic storytelling has been missing from <em>Civilization</em> games, so I’m keen to see all the new histories<em> Civilization 7</em> will enable me to write.</p><p><small><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 7</em> launches on PC, Mac, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch on February 11th, 2025.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Old Country is being developed by Hangar 13, the same studio responsible for Mafia 3. Technically, sorta, they're also the studio that made Mafia 1 and 2, since those games were made by Illusion Softworks, which became 2K Czech, which was merged into Hangar 13 in 2017. What a twisted web capitalism weaves.
</p>
<p>This new Mafia was revealed tonight at Gamescom's Opening Night Live, with a brief coda from Hangar 13's president Nick Baynes, who said that The Old Country would go "back to the roots" of what people liked about the seires and would have a "deep, linear narrative." I thought Mafia 3 had a linear narrative and was better than people gave it credit for - at least after the bugs were fixed - but hey-ho. I hope it being set further back in the past means the cars are even slower and more rubbish than ever. I hope the cars are so old and shit that they've got legs.
</p>
<p>2K will show more of Mafia: The Old Country in December of this year, ahead of a planned release sometime in 2025. This has been a big day for 2K generally, since they've also just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-now-know-that-borderlands-4-is-a-borderlands-game-with-4-at-the-end-coming-2025">announced Borderlands 4</a> and stuck a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/firaxis-announces-civilization-7-release-date-alongside-new-trailer-full-of-nukes-wonders-and-period-celebs">release date on Civ 7</a>.

But what’s clear is that, by the time they reunite over two decades later, <em>something</em> happened to them as they shot music videos in their childhood hometown. <em>Lost Records</em> shifts back and forth between Swann’s past and present, toying with the player’s uncertainty about why this group of girls haven’t spoken in years to create a constant sense of unease. Mundane conversations I had with Swann’s friend Autumn across a diner table in the present felt tense even when we were reminiscing about wonderful times we had together as teens.</p><p>The demo I played deliberately cut out segments that might have alleviated some of that tension, and the carefully curated mystique of the moments Don’t Nod put before me left me tantalized and eager to discover what supernatural twist is waiting in the cuts to black.</p><figure id="" data-id="999b02fd3eb97e3eff42dfcccd56f72f" data-recommend-id="image://999b02fd3eb97e3eff42dfcccd56f72f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="999b02fd3eb97e3eff42dfcccd56f72f" data-recommend-id="image://999b02fd3eb97e3eff42dfcccd56f72f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The parts of Swann’s story I was able to play, however, were intriguing in their own way, touching on parts of my own ‘90s nostalgia that I think I’ve started forgetting about as I’ve gotten older and more preoccupied with the present. The demo starts with her looking through her childhood room trying to find a movie she’s rented from the local movie shop but has misplaced somewhere in another case. As I examined all the doodads scattered across her distinctly ‘90s room adorned in period-appropriate homages to properties like Trolls and Stephen King novels, it was like I could feel the plastic of the VHS cases in my hands after having not thought about those things for decades.<br></p><p>Between throwing stuff out over the course of my childhood and moving across the country in adulthood, I’ve shed a lot of physical items and memories of the things that were once pivotal to my life. Not every piece of ‘90s media evokes those buried recollections for me, but walking through Swann’s room was the first moment when <em>Lost Records</em> tapped into my nostalgia. But I didn’t revel in it. It wasn’t an upbeat dopamine hit of a reference to some fondly remembered thing. It was more of a somber feeling, a recognition that time has passed and things have changed.</p><p>So many of the tactile experiences I had as a child have been replaced by scrolling and convenience. I imagine the juxtaposition of how Swann interacts with the technology of her adolescence and the more modern world of the present-day segments is meant to create a contrast between the two distinct moments in her life, but it also reminds me of how impermanent and disposable almost everything we interact with is. I’m thinking of the box of VHS tapes that sat in my family’s storage building for decades as we replaced them with DVDs and Blu-rays, which were then subsequently replaced by streaming services that will delist a movie without warning.

Her most precious adolescent memories are of her using the handheld camera to shoot 4:3 music videos for the friends she was dying to impress. <em>Lost Records</em>’ dialogue perfectly captures an awkward teen’s best efforts to fit in, to the point where I couldn’t help but empathize with her as I winced at the unabashed, unironic earnestness of how she speaks to her would-be friends.<br></p><p>While her anxiety may persist into adulthood, the raw, unpolished way she and her friends shoot a music video in the woods outside their hometown is but a distant memory. I don’t know yet if the shaky, awkward shots I took with Swann’s camera still persist in the game’s present day, but watching the end result of our time together and seeing how many clips were clearly born of me still getting used to which buttons did what in the game’s photo mode felt appropriate. Swann was still learning how to be a director at that age, just as I was still learning how to work the game’s controls. So yeah, the final result is not a professional, perfectly framed music video, but it’s the best I could do in the moment.</p><figure id="" data-id="75db80fcf4d3460c1c77da9ae09c7113" data-recommend-id="image://75db80fcf4d3460c1c77da9ae09c7113" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann records something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swann records something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="75db80fcf4d3460c1c77da9ae09c7113" data-recommend-id="image://75db80fcf4d3460c1c77da9ae09c7113" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann records something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I expected <em>Lost Records </em>to play on ‘90s nostalgia, as Don’t Nod had told me it was a chance for the team to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-dont-not-teenage-dialogue-1851442033&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-dont-not-teenage-dialogue-1851442033">reflect on their own teenage years as adults</a></span>. But I don’t think I was prepared for how it would play on my own anxieties about how the world is, well, losing records of its past. The tactile ways we once held footage, photos, letters are dying out. Technology has improved our lives, but it’s also made us flippant about how easily something historically or personally significant can be discarded with the touch of a button. Where once you’d have to tear and burn a photo to destroy it, now you just have to delete it from your photo app or hard drive. I’m only in my 30s, thus I’m not quite as distanced from my adolescence as Swann and her friends are in <em>Lost Records</em>, but so many videos and photos of those years have already been wiped as social media accounts are deleted and old photo albums have been lost in the shuffles between homes. Maybe that’s just what happens to nostalgia as the world grows more dystopian. It stops being a rose-colored lens to view the good ol’ days and becomes a reminder that history can feel impossible to preserve.<br></p><p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But while <em>The Acolyte</em>’s cancellation stokes the fires of that ongoing culture war, it’s also indicative of a much larger problem plaguing modern television—and streaming services and rising production costs are to blame.</p><h2 id="h12115"><a id=""></a><strong>The flaws of modern TV</strong></h2><p>The rise of a disparate (and expensive) collection of streaming services replacing the basic cable subscription for millions of paying customers has drastically changed the landscape of modern television. Back in the heyday of cable TV, there was far less time between seasons of a typical show than there is now. Look at <em>Breaking Bad</em>, widely considered one of the most prestigious of prestige television shows: The last episode of its first season aired in March 2008, while the first episode of the second season picked up almost exactly a year later. Now, there are routinely multiple years between seasons—two years elapsed before <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2 followed its predecessor, nearly three years passed between seasons 2 and 3 of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, and the series finale of <em>Stranger Things</em> still doesn’t have a release window (the last season aired two years ago, and the next one just started production this year).<br></p><p>That is a massive amount of time for an invested audience to wait, and it can greatly diminish their enthusiasm for a series—it can also result in them literally losing the plot, as it’s difficult to remember what happened the previous season when it’s been several years since you last watched it. Plus, it’s tough to justify a second season when you know it’ll be in production for years—there’s no real reason to let a show breathe anymore, to let it iron out the first season’s kinks. If <em>Parks and Recreation</em> was canceled after season one, we’d have never gotten <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmUYpgptBtY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmUYpgptBtY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the funniest scenes in modern television</a></span>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="744586091189e11b62b605274da03b4d" data-recommend-id="image://744586091189e11b62b605274da03b4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ghoul grins.

When companies are increasingly concerned with numbers going up, it’s impossible to justify another season of a series that’s so expensive to make when its viewership numbers don’t match other shows within the franchise—and therein lies our final problem: the franchise.</p><h2 id="h12116"><a id=""></a><strong>The <em>Star Wars</em> problem</strong></h2><p>In recent years, the only “successful” deviation from traditional <em>Star Wars</em> media has been <em>Andor</em>, the spy-thriller-esque series starring Diego Luna that’s a spin-off of 2016’s <em>Rogue One</em>. Despite it reportedly not having as large a viewership as <em>The Mandalorian</em> or <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/andor-season-2-rogue-one-k2so-luna-interview-teaser-tv-1851624333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/andor-season-2-rogue-one-k2so-luna-interview-teaser-tv-1851624333"><em>Andor</em>’s second season</a></span> is set to debut sometime in 2025. Though <em>Andor </em>technically retreads old ground like so many other <em>Star Wars</em> series, it feels incredibly fresh when compared to the other shows that rely so heavily on nostalgia to try and placate older fans. So it’s a welcome surprise that Disney decided to bankroll another season—especially since there are no plans for season two of either <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> or <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="3c9abbb03c5d05d68268aa45db23c438" data-recommend-id="image://3c9abbb03c5d05d68268aa45db23c438" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Osha looks off-camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Osha looks off-camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3c9abbb03c5d05d68268aa45db23c438" data-recommend-id="image://3c9abbb03c5d05d68268aa45db23c438" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Osha looks off-camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But <em>Andor</em> is an exception, not the rule. A specific sect of fans are notoriously resistant to perceived changes to lore or the centering of marginalized folks in <em>Star Wars</em> media, and <em>The Acolyte</em> pissed them off from the jump: run by a woman, with a Black non-binary lead, lesbian witches, and a blistering take on the flaws of the Jedi, it became the focal point of a culture war before it even aired.

At the time of writing, Stenberg’s latest Instagram post is filled with comments denigrating them: “Take the L never do <em>Star Wars</em> again,” reads one comment, while another asks, “How does it feel to have your terrible show canceled, princess?”<br></p><p>Unfortunately, in an age where modern television series are defined by their big price tags and (hopefully) bigger viewer numbers, a show like <em>The Acolyte </em>had an almost insurmountable feat in front of it in order to ensure its survival. If its mere existence hadn’t been used as the catalyst for conversations about “wokeism” in <em>Star Wars</em>, perhaps it would have had a fighting chance.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monument-valley-3-finally-has-a-release-date-and-its-netflix-games-exclusive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Ida and Ro name a successor.</h2></div><section><p>Five years ago, ustwo games announced it was developing a third entry in the critically-acclaimed puzzle series, Monument Valley. Now, after all that waiting, it's finally coming out on December 10, 2024, and it will be exclusive to Netflix Games at launch.</p><p>In a trailer at Opening Night Live today, we got our first real look at Monument Valley 3. It's both familiar and new, featuring a new little protagonist named Noor carrying a lantern. Per a press release, Noor is searching for a new source of power "before the light of the world fades, forever." As before, the player uses the touchscreen to move M.C. Escher-like environments around and create paths for the character to progress.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Monument Valley 3 seems to use similar spatial and visual puzzle styles to its predecessors, but it looks like the lantern-carrying protagonist will occasionally have to lead other characters effectively through the mazes. The very first game starred a single protagonist, while the second featured a mother and her child navigating mazes together and explored themes related to their relationship. Both games were critically acclaimed for their design, with Monument Valley 2 winning the Game Award for Best Mobile Game in 2017, and winning best Puzzle at the 2018 Webby Awards.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Monument Valley 3 Screenshots gamescom ONL 2024</h3></div></output><p>Monument Valley 3 will technically be coming to both iOS and Android like its predecessors, but at launch will only be available via the Netflix Games app. Additionally, both Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2 will come to Netflix Games on September 19 and October 29, respectively. Netflix, as we've previously written, has struggled to lure in large amounts of subscribers, and has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-considering-introducing-in-app-purchases-ads-to-its-games-platform">reportedly been discussing internally</a> whether or not to add in-app purchases or ads to its games platform in the future.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
