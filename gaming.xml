                <p>The difference between real and generated frames is a hotly contested topic, especially when it comes to their prevalence in PC gaming. Nvidia and AMD have made big improvements to their own solutions for predicting and simulating frames that can be inserted in-between real ones spat out by your GPU, and now Steam is making it a little easier to determine the difference between the two.</p><p>In an update to its in-game performance tools, Valve has added the ability to differentiate between frames generated by your hardware, and ones generated by your pick for frame generation, whether it's Nvidia's DLSS suite or AMD's FSR toolset. A new frames-per-second counter can show you what frame rate you're currently seeing with frame generation on, and what is actually being rendered by the game, which can be useful to determine issues with the technology.</p>

<p>Usually, issues arise with frame generation when your base frame rate isn't high enough, creating a mismatch between the responsiveness of the game and the fluidity you see on-screen. Valve's approach lets you determine if your settings are still a bit too demanding for your hardware by letting you see the true frame rate at a glance, so that you can make adjustments to fine-tune this balance.</p><p>The update also adds more information to the overlay, including additional GPU and CPU utilization information, maximum and minimum frame rates, a frame rate graph, and more. You can choose between four display levels in the in-game overlay settings, as well as the color and opacity of the display to suit the game they're being layered onto.</p><p>Valve says this update is specifically for Windows users now, and for modern GPU hardware. Additional support will come at a later, undetermined date. You can find out more about how Valve calculates all of its performance metrics in the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD-5767" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">detailed breakdown here</a>.</p>

                <p>During a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> livestream for The Edge of Fate, which is set for release on July 15, Bungie developers explained how they expect players to sequence break the new planet of Kepler--and that's intentional.</p><p>The new destination of Kepler is described as being similar in depth to the Rise of Iron content from the original game in 2016. It was complex with many puzzles and mysteries to solve. The Edge of Fate's content has been designed so that the campaign missions "slowly" lead players into unlocking different abilities and the varying levels of them, as well as uncovering more of Kepler's explorable areas.</p><p>There are puzzles to figure out, secrets to unlock, and particular routes that will be inaccessible without using abilities, such as Matterspark, to shrink down and traverse through vents or hidden paths. During the stream, Bungie developers explained that this was done in order to teach players that it's necessary to look at and think about the world around them in a different way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After the main campaign story missions are complete, you can unlock abilities anywhere, but this means that you can sequence break puzzles and missions. Bungie says that this is "entirely intentional" and that it is looking forward to seeing what players can do beyond the limits of its own playtesting processes.</p><p>"We're not 100% sure where players might sequence break," said Destiny 2 assistant game director, Robbie Stevens, "but that's intentional."</p><p>With the news that players breaking Destiny 2 is finally intended by Bungie, it'll be interesting to watch the varied combinations and broken builds created by players in action.</p><p>Where Bungie draws a stricter line though is its raids, with many items and abilities being disabled for the Contest Mode versions of its raid races. During the stream, Bungie also announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">The Edge of Fate raid race start date</a>, and detailed the new Epic raid system that will be available shortly after its release.</p>

<p>"Unleash your inner Kong"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If a day of previews and impressions aren't enough <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> for you, how about a commercial? It's time to unleash your inner Kong.</p>
<p>Nintendo has dropped a brand new ad for the upcoming 3D platformer, incorporating the games central premises of music and smashing things up. You won't be able to stop yourself from humming the tune — or even chanting along with the actors.</p>
<p>The gameplay itself isn't anything new, but we're not complaining; there's plenty of smashing, running, and even a glimpse of DK's Bananza Transformation. This is the most love we've seen Donkey Kong get in a long while, and the wait over the next few weeks is going to be excruciating.</p>
<p>Fans in the comments are, of course, posting the lyrics to the DK Rap — that song <em>isn't</em> in this ad, but the "DK" chanting is certainly evocative of it. Also... is that a Lanky Kong reference at the end?</p>
<p>Anyway, if you missed it, we actually went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">hands-on with the game very recently</a>, and even after only a few hours, we might be in love. Nintendo also confirmed to us that the team behind the game is indeed "the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> team", so those comparisons are apt.</p>
<p><em>Are you excited for Donkey Kong Bananza on 17th July 2025? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Marvel and NetEase revealed the launch date and details for Marvel Rivals Season 3: The Abyss Awakens. The new season is going live on July 11, with the cosmic-powered Phoenix joining the roster as a new playable hero and the Klyntar: Celestial Husk map being added to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">popular</a> hero shooter game. Season 3 will also introduce new features, special events, and Team-Ups between characters. Going forward, the developers have announced that Marvel Rivals will launch a new season every two months.</p>



<p>On this Mosaic (Space) Timeline, the Phoenix and Jean Grey have fully accepted each other, traveling through the universe while helping residents across the galaxy. However, when the Timestream Entanglement took place, the Phoenix sensed a terrible darkness awakening at the edge of the known universe. The Phoenix could feel that this darkness had already corrupted many gods, and even she, who was so far away, felt a sharp pain in her mind. To annihilate it in its slumber, the Phoenix and Jean decided to venture into the abyss where this darkness resided, using their flames to completely burn down the root of this universe's problem. The Phoenix will be a Duelist-type character in Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>As for the new map, lore-wise, Knull has slaughtered multiple Celestials. The severed head of the first Celestial he decapitated drifted away from the planet Klyntar over the eons, morphing into Knowhere. Meanwhile, the body has remained in orbit above Klyntar, slowly corroded by Knull's power within and the forces of the cosmos outside. The Celestial Remains fall from the sky, becoming a part of the Klyntar landscape.</p>



<p>For Season 3, the Marvel Rivals team is adding new features, battle pass and system updates and four new Team-Ups. The game's mission system will see a complete overhaul and a new layer of customization to the accessories system will be introduced. A brand-new competitive mode will be released in the latter half of Season 3, and Blade will join the roster. Also, beginning in Season 3, verified university students will enjoy costume trials. University students can access 10 costumes and MVPs upon completing verification. These costumes will rotate each season. The Marvel Rivals team is rolling out email verification for students in the US, UK, and more, with more regions to come.</p>

Attendees can immerse themselves in the Marvel Rivals experience at the Marriott Marquis through playable demos, insightful panels, and giveaways. On Friday, July 25, fans can look forward to a panel titled 'Marvel Rivals: Hero Creation from Concept to Showcase'.</p>

Think <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>, but with more sticky notes, missions, and a full progression system. However, that progression system is getting a big overhaul in update 1.3, just one of a few updates Remedy has pushed out to improve the game based on fan feedback. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=536605983645893984&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=536605983645893984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Update 1.3, out now on all platforms</a></span>, rebalances how perks work in <em>FBC</em>. Perks are a key part of the game’s progression, letting players unlock new abilities—like being able to get rid of status effects by jumping—and changing how you play the game. Previously, they were hard to unlock as you had to collect resources, some of which the game did a poor job of highlighting. But now some lower-level perks are cheaper to unlock while some higher-level ones cost more resources. The idea, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Remedy explained in a blog post</a></span>, is to get people using more perks, more quickly, and then making it easier to unlock higher-level options as they play more. </p><p>It sounds good to me, someone who is still playing<em> FBC: Firebreak </em>on and off between other games. The last few updates have done a great job of improving the game, but looking at what publicly available data there is, like SteamDB’s player count charts, <em>FBC </em>seems to be struggling. </p><h2 id="h139741"><a id=""></a>Remedy was disappointed by <em>FBC’s </em>launch</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-launch-wasnt-what-studio-hoped-for-but-remedy-isnt-giving-up/1100-6532823/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-launch-wasnt-what-studio-hoped-for-but-remedy-isnt-giving-up/1100-6532823/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview,</a></span> Remedy communications director Thomas Puha talked to <em>GameSpot</em> about the launch of <em>FBC</em>, its player count, and its future. And he was frank and honest, saying “We aren’t naïve; we had hoped for a better launch.” </p><p> But Puha says the team is “super-motivated to continue building the game” and is using player feedback to guide future updates. He also pushed back on people using <em>FBC’s </em>low Steam player count as evidence that the new shooter has flopped. </p><p>“Steam is a very important part of the business of <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” said Puha. “The Steam [active player count] is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn’t everything.”</p><p>As for the future of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/fbc-firebreak&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/fbc-firebreak"><em>FBC</em></a></span>, Puha reiterated Remedy’s plans to add two new missions to the game later this year as well as some new, undisclosed features. But he also acknowledged that some plans have changed based on the rough launch. </p><p>“We’ve rearranged some of our development plans, prioritized certain features, and deprioritized others already during the week of the game being live,” said Puha. “The game is live, players’ feedback comes in, things will change, that’s what we expected.”</p><p>“It’s exciting that the game starts evolving now that it’s live,” continued Puha, “Remedy is fully committed to <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. We are all curious to see what it will be like later in the year.”</p><p> .</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/remedy-control-fbc-firebreak-lowplayer-count-update-1-3-1851785449]]></content:encoded>

While it is <em>technically </em>possible to accomplish this task in one in-game day (there’s a trophy for it, even), 99.999999999% of players will need to aimlessly stumble throughout the house while they gather clues and unlock permanent upgrades first. <strong>The game’s credits will play after finding Room 46</strong>, so you could consider this “beating” <em>Blue Prince</em>.</p><p><strong>While you can finish <em>Blue Prince</em> in 15 to 20 hours</strong>, this estimate can swing wildly. If you’re really good at puzzle games and luck is on your side, you could find your way to the end of <em>Blue Prince </em>in under ten hours. However, if you aren’t accustomed to roguelikes or puzzle games (or both), you could easily spend 25 or 30 hours to reach the credits. Frankly, there’s nothing wrong with that! <strong><em>Blue Prince </em>leaves a lot up to chance by design</strong>, so you could go hours without seeing clues that other players might find incredibly early on their journey.</p><p><strong>That said, <em>Blue Prince </em>has a <em>ton </em>of mysteries to solve after the credits</strong>. These relate directly to the main story and include some pretty big discoveries, but uncovering these will take <em>a lot</em> more notetaking and out-of-the-box thinking. <strong>Peeling back every layer of <em>Blue Prince </em>and seeing every challenge to the end can absolutely take you over 100 hours</strong>. Again, that estimate should be taken with a grain of salt, as many secrets will depend on whether a lot of random events line up just right for you on a given in-game day. Your completion time will also change if you use guides or want to solve absolutely everything yourself.</p><p>This massive postgame is why many fans have taken to calling the quest for Room 46 “the tutorial.” That said, if you haven’t played <em>Blue Prince </em>yet, I’d strongly advise <em>against</em> looking at the opening act as an appetizer to overcome before you get to the game’s main course.</p><h2 id="h23223"><a id=""></a>Why I don’t think you should call getting to Room 46 in <em>Blue Prince </em>“the tutorial”</h2><figure id="" data-id="dc6ffa5d5c5d5ad960f91a6462108af2" data-recommend-id="image://dc6ffa5d5c5d5ad960f91a6462108af2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

Before I could even press play, I was barraged with tips and facts about <em>Blue Prince </em>that I <em>had </em>to know if I wanted to play it the <em>right </em>way. You gotta take notes about everything! You haven’t <em>really</em> started <em>Blue Prince </em>until you reach a certain point! You’re just a <em>noob</em> if you complain about the Billiards room! You won’t believe how many layers there are to <em>Blue Prince</em> and you have to <em>see them all</em>!</p><p>I’ll be frank; this discourse damn near ruined <em>Blue Prince </em>for me. I was <em>so </em>stressed out in the opening hours of the game that I obsessively noted every observation I had about every room, worried about all these intricate and complex puzzles that would await me when the game <em>really </em>started. I wasn’t even sure <em>what </em>I was looking for, I just <em>had </em>to get through this “tutorial” fast so I could understand why everyone’s losing their mind about this game. What spectacular secret will I find once I enter Room 46? What will <em>Blue Prince</em> be like once I finally get to the “real” part of the game?</p><p>Without outright spoiling, I’ll say this: <strong>there’s no reality-shifting moment in Room 46</strong>. There is no “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-deserves-to-be-replayed-1847202498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-deserves-to-be-replayed-1847202498">Just Monika</a></span>” or “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/portal-the-companion-collection-switch-valve-nintendo-1849117877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/portal-the-companion-collection-switch-valve-nintendo-1849117877">The Cake is a lie</a></span>” twist that will force you to make that shocked face you see in 90% of YouTube thumbnails. The only big reveal is—as mentioned above— there are several extra puzzles in <em>Blue Prince </em>that involve more obsessive note taking and riddle-decoding to solve. When people call the first act of <em>Blue Prince</em> “the tutorial,” they just mean there’s a lot more game remaining.</p><p>By focusing so much on what was next in <em>Blue Prince</em>, I wasn’t able to enjoy those opening hours of the game. I nearly put it down for good until I started playing it alongside my girlfriend, which finally helped me ignore the sky-high expectations put in my brain from internet commentators. I really regret that my first hours with the game were tainted by focusing on what came next, so my advice is to take <em>Blue Prince </em>slowly and enjoy every phase of the game however you’d like.</p><h2 id="h23224"><a id=""></a>Play as much of <em>Blue Prince </em>as you want, even if you don’t “beat” it</h2><figure id="" data-id="470f8c61ae4f9b067b2bc6694705b371" data-recommend-id="image://470f8c61ae4f9b067b2bc6694705b371" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

A door with a crescent moon is shown on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>My negative experience aside, I still think framing the first act of <em>Blue Prince </em>as “the tutorial” is misguided. At best, it’s redundant: You’ll inevitably find bread crumbs for extra puzzles and objectives on your journey to Room 46. <em>Blue Prince </em>naturally does a good job of prodding your curiosity, so you’ll know which threads to pull next if you’re ready for more after the credits. </p><p>At worst, the tutorial framing is patronizing. It undermines the accomplishment of getting to Room 46, as if to say the player shouldn’t feel proud because the puzzles that lie ahead are just so much harder. Even if there’s no ill intention involved, it’s the same vibe as telling someone they haven’t <em>really </em>played an MMORPG until they’ve participated in high-end raid content, or you haven’t played <em>Elden Ring</em> unless you use a strength build and never use Spirit Ashes and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-missmikkaa-erdtree-boss-fight-dance-pad-1851606332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-missmikkaa-erdtree-boss-fight-dance-pad-1851606332">play exclusively with a dance pad</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/skip-boss-fights-elden-ring-metroid-prime-argument-1851781231&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/skip-boss-fights-elden-ring-metroid-prime-argument-1851781231">Not everyone enjoys video games the same way</a></span>, and that’s okay! Reaching Room 46 is worth celebrating, whether it took you five or fifty hours to pull off.</p><p><strong><em>Blue Prince </em>is about the journey, not the destination</strong>. So if you aren’t enjoying the journey, there’s no big moment at the end that’ll make it all worthwhile. The post-credits puzzles in <em>Blue Prince </em>are way more intricate and cryptic than everything that came before, and you might not enjoy those challenges as much as the straightforward quest to find Room 46. Others may say that the endgame challenges of <em>Blue Prince </em>are the best part. It’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to dive so deep into the game that you become a walking wiki for it.</p><p><br>All of this is to say, don’t worry too much about what the “true end” of <em>Blue Prince </em>is. It is, indeed, a quick adventure if you want it to be. But if you want to dig deeper into it, you’ll be pleased by just how deep this rabbit hole goes. For best results, <strong>I recommend going slowly with the game and taking breaks if you get stuck, as a good night’s sleep can make all the difference between a puzzle being fun or frustrating</strong>. And most importantly, enjoy your time in Mt. Holly manor!</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-how-long-to-beat-room-46-tutorial-puzzles-1851785424]]></content:encoded>

Contest Mode is a time-limited version of the race that is available as soon as the raid is released. It has inflated difficulty in the form of reduced outgoing damage, higher combatant health, and a reliance on flawless team communication and strategy. These traditionally began on the Friday following the release of the expansion on Tuesday, but this time around that's changing.</p><p><strong>The Edge of Fate raid race will begin on Saturday, July 19</strong>.</p><p>We assume that it will still begin at the daily reset time, but this has not been confirmed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Secondly, several weeks after the raid's initial release, a new version of the raid will become available. This is known as an Epic version of the raid and will expand the story, adding new content. Bungie emphasized that it is not holding anything back in the base version of the raid to enable the Epic version to exist, but rather that the Epic raid will "enhance" the raid experience.</p><p>For those wondering about how to prepare for the race in the four short days between the expansion's release and the launch of the raid, Bungie recommends completing the campaign's main story on Legendary difficulty to reach the recommended Power level.</p><p>Guardians can further enhance their preparation by grinding for more powerful gear, which can drop at higher tiers with more benefits when completing difficult activities.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Formula Legends is a racing game full of on-track drama, tight racing action and very silly names. Luis Hammerton cruises round the final corner in Belgium to secure top step on the podium, though not without controversy after nudging Mark Peerstallen and Osvald Pastry out of the way while going down the straight. Sad faces all round, meanwhile, for Petrul Tassly, Charlie Lacreme and Hans Troll, who were nowhere near the top three, and who are probably pretty disappointed to find that their special abilities aren’t as good as those guys.</p>
<p><iframe title="Formula Legends - Demo and Future Games Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfVyhk16MTA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Formula Legends takes the sport of F1 and gives it an arcade racing makeover, with hyper-deformed cars, giant racer helmets and oversized tyres, giving this a look that’s more cute than it is couture. It immediately feels fun, welcoming and kind of adorable, and if you’re a fan of the real-life sport, it’s an exceedingly light and fun take on it.</p>


<p>Our hands-on with the demo gave us a look at a single track, and the different racers and cars you can choose from, but there’s a lovely feature here that amplified our time with the game, and helps to push Formula Legends into essential territory for motorsport fans.</p>


<p>Formula Legends features three different eras of premier open-wheel racing, with track layouts, cars and racers that match each time period. That means we’re heading back to the 70s, with a sepia filter applied to the puddle-strewn track, the blue-ish tinged tarmac of the 90s, through to the more readily recognizable names and designs of the modern day sport. It’s a great idea – one it shares with Retro GP – but it feels like the team at 3DClouds have made a little more of it, beyond just the differing car designs.</p>
<p>Our hands-on took us to Belgium, racing around three iterations of Spa-Francorchamps; it’s a clear homage to the real-life track, even if they’re not allowed to use the proper circuit name and instead has a legally distinct equivalent branded as the Ardennes GP. That means you get to experience the iconic climb through Eau Rouge, the tricky combination of Les Combes and Malmedy and the blast of speed out of Stavelot, all presented in Formula Legends’ simple but effective art style.</p>
<p>I love the ability to see how they’ve mimicked the evolution of the track design, and to note what’s been retained through fifty years of racing there. Even if this is a lighter, more arcade-orientated title, it’s clear that the development team have a genuine passion for the real-life sport, and for its history.</p>

<p>On-track, this is old-school arcade racing, with a zoomed-out overhead camera, giving you a tucked-in view, and more emphasis placed on memorising the different nuances of the track rather than being able to see all the way to the horizon. It reminds me of classics like Super Off-Road and their more recent brethren Super Woden GP, but with a bit more immediacy thanks to the camera tracking behind your car.</p>
<p>These little race cars feel incredibly planted on the track, with grip for days – at least in the 90s and modern era cars – but this is an arcade racer that needs some tactical and thoughtful driving to get you through.</p>
<p>You need to be aware of your braking zones, and you need to make sure you’re following the circuit, as Formula Legends isn’t afraid to fire off a bevy of penalties for exceeding track limits. It’s a slightly odd juxtaposition at first, with the arcade handling and appearance seeming at odds with the more precise needs of the handling and rules, but once you’ve settled into the rhythm of racing you’ll find it comes together beautifully.</p>
<p>The pitstops add a further wrinkle to the action, with a minigame that tasks you with first selecting your tyre type, before changing each wheel by matching the correct QTE button press. It keeps you on your toes through an integral part of the race that many racing games simply ignore.</p>

<p>Few things are better than the sweep of your race car flying through a series of corners, hitting that point of zen that you find with the best racers, where you feel utterly in control and locked in. I wasn’t expecting Formula Legends to feel as good as it does on track, but it’s been a delight from start to finish. I love that the different eras boast their own handling too – you’re almost experiencing a different game, with unique tracks, appearance and racers.</p>
<p>Formula Legends is set to delight any fan of Formula 1, with an irreverent but loving nod to the different drivers that’s backed up with genuinely engaging racing. I can’t wait to experience more of it when it launches later this year.</p>

Provided they don’t share my fear of watery depths, the DLC might feel too short for some, and could risk being a touch boring in that you mostly just swim around collecting stuff. But, if you stick around for the character-driven story woven through the murky depths, you’ll come to find that this DLC, much like the base game, is here to hold up a mirror to your own life, to ask you when your instincts might be the most dangerous threat to your existence. And just when you’re in the middle of some deep thought about the human desire for knowledge and our impulsive curiosity, <em>Siren’s Rest</em>’s horror is here to remind you that some forces of nature may ever elude that knowledge and perhaps punish that very curiosity we so often value.</p><figure id="" data-id="326c78198075b793e893500d9458e03b" data-recommend-id="image://326c78198075b793e893500d9458e03b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An oxygen cord stretches from the player out into the depths of the ocean." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An oxygen cord stretches from the player out into the depths of the ocean." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="326c78198075b793e893500d9458e03b" data-recommend-id="image://326c78198075b793e893500d9458e03b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An oxygen cord stretches from the player out into the depths of the ocean." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a pseudo sequel to <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, <em>Siren’s Rest </em>benefits from you having played the base game before jumping into the literal and proverbial deep end it provides. But if you played <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> around the time of its release and have forgotten various details, don’t worry. I did too, and there was something resonant about coming across the wreckage of the original game as my mind slowly caught up to what happened. The DLC is a character-focused story at heart, so an encyclopedic knowledge of details about what happened in the original game beyond “crazy monster shows up and destroys everything” isn’t terribly necessary. So come on in. The water’s fi—no, this shit’s horrifying, what am I talking about? </p><h2 id="h320020"><a id=""></a>The walking simulator learns to swim</h2><figure id="" data-id="5b6ec9e3400e493ba83cc5f706b66bd6" data-recommend-id="image://5b6ec9e3400e493ba83cc5f706b66bd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist looks out at a fellow diver deep underwater." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist looks out at a fellow diver deep underwater." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b6ec9e3400e493ba83cc5f706b66bd6" data-recommend-id="image://5b6ec9e3400e493ba83cc5f706b66bd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist looks out at a fellow diver deep underwater." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though the entirety of <em>Siren’s Rest</em> takes place at the bottom of the ocean floor, it is still very much like previous games from developer The Chinese Room: It’s a short trip of wandering and collecting, with the occasional test of your reflexes during chase sequences. You’re also given an arc welder early on that lets you cut open grates and doors to gain access to new areas. </p><p>You can’t cut just anything open, though. Instead, you’ll come to spot signature clusters of rusted metal nodules on the areas you’re allowed to cut, which typically come up at points when Mhairi finds herself at a dead end. This usually leads to the person chatting in her headpiece, Rob, telling her “well, look around!” and then you eventually find the door or grate or whatever that needs to be cut open. This pattern repeats a bit too often.</p><figure id="" data-id="bdbce3e977c8367f5d2d379b940ff24f" data-recommend-id="image://bdbce3e977c8367f5d2d379b940ff24f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swims through a cramped space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist swims through a cramped space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bdbce3e977c8367f5d2d379b940ff24f" data-recommend-id="image://bdbce3e977c8367f5d2d379b940ff24f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swims through a cramped space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s unfortunate there’s not more freedom to play and explore in an unscripted way. The game wants<em> </em>you to poke around a bit and to feel free to explore, but there’s not a whole lot to be found if you venture off the straight and narrow path as you make your way toward the increasingly creepy experiences that await, buried under thousands of feet of water and rusted metal.</p><p>I have no issues with the simplicity of the “walking simulator” genre. I dig it—especially as a palette cleanser from larger, more demanding games. And there is something precious and refreshing about a game that you can just bang out in three hours. That said, there were more than a few times I wished the Chinese Room would’ve considered ways to push this genre a little more. Giving me a bit of freedom with the arc welder to cut into random, unmarked surfaces would’ve been a neat way to encourage me to poke around a bit more and get into the headspace of a deep sea diver uncovering mysteries. </p><figure id="" data-id="b9660e23d82f6ecbc0794be285587d20" data-recommend-id="image://b9660e23d82f6ecbc0794be285587d20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist observes a doorway where their oxygen cord is laced through." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes a doorway where their oxygen cord is laced through." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b9660e23d82f6ecbc0794be285587d20" data-recommend-id="image://b9660e23d82f6ecbc0794be285587d20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist observes a doorway where their oxygen cord is laced through." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Swimming underwater for the vast majority of the game does grant a sense of freedom you don’t usually find in this genre, however. The simple ability to move in all three dimensions makes the spaces feel less linear, and of course contributes to the sense of dread that comes with being at the bottom of the ocean. I’d love to see more devs run with the concept of a focused, narrative-driven game set underwater; it made me think in three dimensions more than I would’ve expected, which in turn allowed me to more easily immerse myself in the dread that <em>Siren’s Rest</em>’s environment holds. </p><p>On that subject, fellow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassophobia&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassophobia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thalassophobes</a></span>, let’s have a chat about how this game <strong>will </strong>make your stomach turn. </p><h2 id="h320021"><a id=""></a>If you suffer from thalassophobia or submechanophobia, please be careful</h2><figure id="" data-id="a23584fb7177dab7596813adf817069d" data-recommend-id="image://a23584fb7177dab7596813adf817069d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A diver looks out over a steep underwater cliff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A diver looks out over a steep underwater cliff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a23584fb7177dab7596813adf817069d" data-recommend-id="image://a23584fb7177dab7596813adf817069d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A diver looks out over a steep underwater cliff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I fully consented to subjecting myself to a game that runs on the very things that terrify me the most: being stranded in a vast ocean, being deep underwater, and being in a large body of water with…things.</p><p>This has been a lifelong terror of mine. All the other shit that spooks me—arachnophobia, being abducted by aliens, trying and failing to use my rice cooker—all that takes a distant back seat to the behemoth of the ocean. So yeah, this game was hard for me to play. And the fact that I fell in love with the narrative only complicated that experience. At the sight of the impossible depths of <em>Siren’s Rest</em>’s ocean, my stomach physically felt like it turned several times; I had to smack the escape key to pause the game and take a breath more on numerous occasions. And yes, one moment did get me to yelp like a little girl and cover my eyes with my hands. Thankfully my roommate wasn’t home when this happened. I was loud. </p><figure id="" data-id="4b5e3056cf73779f36adb11597bbaab9" data-recommend-id="image://4b5e3056cf73779f36adb11597bbaab9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swims toward a sunken helicopter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist swims toward a sunken helicopter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4b5e3056cf73779f36adb11597bbaab9" data-recommend-id="image://4b5e3056cf73779f36adb11597bbaab9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swims toward a sunken helicopter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I like to play around with fear and danger; it can be a rewarding and positive experience when done safely and with consent. But if you’re like me and genuinely do suffer from a sense of dread from large bodies of water, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submechanophobia&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submechanophobia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submechanophobia</a></span>, kenophobia, or agoraphobia (and claustrophobia given the tight spaces you must squeeze yourself through sometimes), please be careful with this game. The flipside of its effective thalassophobic simulation is that <em>Siren’s Rest</em> can actually be a neat way to safely face some of these fears. And that very concept of facing something that scares you or confuses you is core to the DLC’s strongest asset: its gorgeous, resonant, and memorable narrative themes. </p><h2 id="h320022"><a id=""></a>Fight, Flight, or Freeze</h2><p>Running away, and the notion that we exacerbate problems by fleeing from them, was the most compelling aspect of 2025’s <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> for me. The protagonist in the base game finds himself in a horrific situation <em>because</em> he’s running away from some problems at home. The game then uses inexplicable cosmic horror to give the character, and you, a persistent experience of flight, of running in terror, refusing to face what pursues you. And I simply love a game that bakes its themes into the gameplay itself.</p><p>You’ll have to escape from a few things in <em>Siren’s Rest</em>, but the previous game’s theme of running away is flipped. Instead of being someone who always runs <em>from</em> things, Mhairi continues to push further underwater, exploring the remains of the oil rig. She’s someone who consistently pursues things as a part of her character and temperament. She’s curious and persistent. You’ll come to learn that Mhairi has her own connection to the incident of the first game, and it seems clear that her curiosity and persistence, admirable qualities in the right circumstances, are the very things that are endangering her and her crew as the story unravels.</p><div><h4> The political themes are louder this time around  </h4><p> The first game wasn’t shy about its politics, driving home that private,  for-profit control and a lack of unionized labor was every bit as  responsible for the destruction of the rig as was the creepy thing  lurking in the waters. And if anything, playing <em>Siren’s Rest </em>only makes it even more clear just how much that first game had to say. Characters in <em>Siren’s Rest</em>  chat about how the imposing and abusive managerial structure of the  fictional Cadal oil company is what pushed the crew to its breaking  point, while the Lovecraftian beasties serve as an unknowable  representation of said breaking point. There’s a powerful story about  labor and environmental justice woven into this DLC.  </p></div><p>If <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> tries to instill in you the lesson that perpetually running away from your problems won’t solve anything and in fact will only ruin things further, then <em>Siren’s Rest</em> is here to caution you about the extreme opposite reaction. The danger of persisting and the need to continue to dig to find closure on something mysterious and unknowable is at the core of this DLC. During one fascinating sequence, the crew in <em>Siren’s Rest</em> is given an opportunity to turn away and return to the surface after something unfortunate happens, but it’s Mhairi, not an overbearing manager who expects results, who wants to stay and keep digging, out of curiosity, out of a <em>need to know</em>. It’s a moment rooted in character that speaks to larger themes as well. Yes, the social and economic structures we build are often what swallow us whole when we’re not united against power and capital. But at the same time, we should be cautious about certain impulses of our own that might threaten our ability to unite against those forces.</p><p>But it’s not just its deft, rich commentary on capitalism and our impulse to seek answers that makes <em>Siren’s Rest </em>worth playing, nor is it just the fear of what lurks beneath the ocean’s surface that provides its nightmare fuel. <em>Siren’s Rest</em> is here to give you some cosmic, Lovecraftian horror—to scare the hell out of you, sure, but, to provide a powerful masterclass in how and why unknowable horror can be such a powerful narrative tool as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="e4d0ed34f2c7e0fbb5abb88e88a39810" data-recommend-id="image://e4d0ed34f2c7e0fbb5abb88e88a39810" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Siren's Rest photographs a dead body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Siren's Rest photographs a dead body." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e4d0ed34f2c7e0fbb5abb88e88a39810" data-recommend-id="image://e4d0ed34f2c7e0fbb5abb88e88a39810" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Siren's Rest photographs a dead body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Siren’s Rest</em> isn’t here to give you a lore dump on the ecology of whatever the hell came out of the ocean floor in the first game. Those hellish threats remain unnamed, mysterious, able to make you doubt reality itself. <em>Siren’s Rest</em>, instead, wants you to consider our connections to other people and how they are strained by the very relatable, human need to find closure. The “umbilical” cable that provides Mhairi with her oxygen serves as a reminder of her connection with safety, with other human beings. But despite how essential this connection is to sustaining her own life, <em>Siren’s Rest</em> sees Mhairi repeatedly test just how much stress she can put on that fragile connection. And at the same time, the game also wants to caution you that, just maybe, some shit is best <em>left alone</em>. If only it were so easy to just let sleeping dogs lie, even those sunken far below the ocean’s surface.</p><hr><p>A short runtime and lack of freedom, on top of some unfortunate bugs, might hold <em>Siren’s Rest</em> down from reaching its potential for some. But the beautifully written character stories at the heart of this horror game are what make it worth experiencing. <em>Siren’s Rest</em> is a powerful and terrifying B-side to a fantastic horror game from last year, one I’ll think about for a long time to come.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/01/xbox-game-pass-july-2025-wave-1/">announced</a> the monthly Game Pass additions for July 2025, and there's little doubt that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 will be the highlight.</p>



<p>The long-awaited remake of the skateboarding series' third and fourth mainline installments will launch on July 11. On that same day, the games will become available to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers on Xbox consoles, PC, and cloud. Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/sgf-2025-tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previewed</a> Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 at Summer Game Fest 2025; here's an excerpt from his hands-on:</p>



<p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4’s biggest change in the hands-on preview, beyond the obvious exclusion of the free-form career mode from THPS4, is backporting all the gameplay and mechanical changes from the fourth numbered entry back into THPS3. This means grind extensions, leveling out, and even skitching are all on the menu for Foundry and Airport. It consolidates the two numbered entries into a single launcher and menu, combining both games into a $49.99 package. Activision tipped us off about some of the other brand-new features coming to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, including new modes like Photo Mode and HAWK, but also the ability to create custom goals in Create-a-Park. However, I wasn’t able to check all of these out, given our limited time to get hands-on.</em></p>

In the show, the gruesome struggle for survival is a spectator sport in which The Front Man and the competition operators allow a select group of rich, masked douchebags to watch the games on television screens—like a sports bar for the perverse.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/squid-game-season-3-netflix-saw-black-mirror-circle-1851785257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/squid-game-season-3-netflix-saw-black-mirror-circle-1851785257">Season 3</a></span>, the sadistic voyeurism goes to scarier depths when we find out some VIPs are given the chance to dress up as guards and execute contestants who didn’t finish the game properly. These are the people who personify the term “insanely rich.” Dong-hyuk said those people share a connection with one of the richest men in the world.</p><p>“Everybody talks about him. Not only is he the head of a huge tech company that controls the world, almost, but he’s also this showman. After writing [Season 3], of course I thought, ‘Oh, some of the VIPs do kind of resemble Elon Musk.’”</p><p>This isn’t the first time he’s noted the parallels between his imaginary class of elitists and the ones all over the news. In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/squid-game-director-season-2-hwang-dong-hyuk-netflix-interview-1234670491/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/squid-game-director-season-2-hwang-dong-hyuk-netflix-interview-1234670491/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 interview with <em>IndieWire</em></a></span>, released a month after <em>Squid Game</em> premiered, he said President Donald Trump reminded him of one of the VIPs in the first season because “it’s almost like he’s running a game show, not a country, like giving people horror.” He told <em>Time</em> years later that the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol “was also part of the current events that inspired me.”</p><p>Truly, these are the reasons shows like <em>Squid Game</em> draw massive audiences. Economic imbalances afford certain groups of people the ability to watch those less fortunate desperately fight and kill for resources others&nbsp;have in abundance, resources they can frivolously spend on things like kicking back and taking in this brutal spectacle. <em>Squid Game</em> is far from a documentary, but as Dong-hyuk has all but admitted, it is a product of its time.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-season-3-elon-musk-donald-trump-1851785435]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Remasters and ports are big business, and when Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition was announced, hardcore fans who played the original 2011 version were excited. That excitement quickly turned to frustration as the PC release contained a number of bugs, and Sega is now offering refunds to everyone who bought it.</p><p>Over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169520/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine__Master_Crafted_Edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, there are almost 100 "mostly negative" reviews citing buggy loads, ugly UI changes, and constant crashing, leaving fans disappointed. "Decided to pick up a copy after the price was reduced for Anniversary Edition owners as some goodwill was returned," one player wrote. "Have played less than an hour and got sent into bugsplat just navigating the menus, all of which are a downgrade compared to the original. No idea why Relic have decided to fix what's not broken here."</p><p>Sega dropped the price to $20 for anyone who already owns the Anniversary Edition, and as <a href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-refunds-ps5-1851785318?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> is reporting, letting fans who already purchased it on PC get a refund through July 10. Sega also laid out improvements that Patch 3 was to implement, including "fixed softlocks, graphical glitches, and input issues in various screens" and more technical fixes like moving local user profile data to a different location to prevent certain crashes. </p><p>However, the game's problems go outside PC players. Xbox Series X|S players--who play the game via Game Pass Ultimate--are also experiencing a bug that's eating their save files. It's such a common complaint that players are sharing their stories over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1l9czva/lost_progresssave_on_xbox_series_x_on_master/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> to see if there's any possible solution, as refunds aren't available on that platform yet.</p><p>If you're too frustrated to keep playing but still want your Warhammer goodness, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-you-can-get-a-free-warhammer-40k-game-this-week/1100-6532330/" data-ref-id="1100-6532330">Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War</a> is on supersale right now over at GOG.

The Season 3 release date is set for July 11, though it remains unclear how some of the content shown in today’s video will roll out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-ushers-in-the-age-of-ultron-with-hellfire-gala-theme-and-emma-frost"><u>Season 2: Hellfire Gala introduced</u></a> new Heroes, Ultron and Emma Frost, Season 3: The Abyss Awakens looks like it will finally allow players to control Blade and Jean Grey/The Phoenix. The former is an especially important addition, as Marvel Rivals fans have speculated about when the Daywalker would be added to the roster since teases began during the vampire-themed Season 1. Jean Grey’s inclusion, meanwhile, comes with the surprise that she’ll be able to harness the power of The Phoenix for her telekinetic abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Knull will serve as the big bad this time around, with the Marvel Rivals Season 2 trailer teasing that he’ll be teaming up with Hela to take power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the wake of the Timestream Entanglement, Knull stirs deep within Klyntar’s core, stretching his shadowed hands across the cosmos," an official description for Marvel Rivals Season 3 says. "Power promised by the dark symbiote god beckons the awakening of a new queen. The Phoenix arrives from across the stars to erase Klyntar before the darkness can rise again! However, she'll require unlikely aid from a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night. As the god of the symbiotes and the Phoenix Force collide, will you burn with the light of creation or embrace the darkness?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed Marvel Rivals players will also notice what is most likely a collection of new skins set to arrive at some point during Season 3. There is, of course, Hela’s symbiote skin, which Knull gives her early on in the footage, but it’s toward the end that we get a closer look at a few more. Wolverine can be seen sporting a Phoenix Force skin of his own, with Blade and Magik both sporting fiery outfits as well. It’s Jeff the Landshark symbiote skin that has most fans really freaking out, though.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="no" dir="ltr">SYMBIOTE JEFF SKIN???? <a href="https://t.co/SMmm41rUYF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SMmm41rUYF</a></p>— Lightoss 💪🌟 (@lightossan) <a href="https://twitter.com/lightossan/status/1940062111255712134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals Season 3: The Abyss Awakens will introduce at least two new playable Heroes, but it also marks the beginning of a new chapter for the popular Marvel hero shooter experience.

While past seasons have been approximately three months long, Season 3 will see that schedule change to two-month-long seasons.

                <p>Crash Bandicoot may not be as popular as he used to be, but three decades ago he was one of PlayStation's first breakout original characters. But when former Sony executive Shuji Utsumi attempted to get Hollywood interested in making a Crash Bandicoot movie, he was given the cold shoulder by film executives.</p><p>Utsumi--who is currently the CEO of Sega of America--told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/reviving-sega-will-be-the-greatest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> about his attempt to bring Crash Bandicoot to the big screen. Despite the success of the games--from 1996 to 2010, Sony released a Crash-related game nearly every year--no one seemed to share Utsumi's vision for what the film could be.</p><p>"When I started to get involved in the video game business, I picked up Crash Bandicoot and started asking some of the movie studios if they were interested in turning that property into a movie," recalled Utsumi. "But I was treated like, 'hey, video games is like a toy business.' They didn't really take it seriously."</p><p>Utsumi went on to note that the Sonic the Hedgehog movies have proven to be very successful for both Hollywood--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-franchise-races-past-1-billion-at-the-box-office/1100-6528632/" data-ref-id="1100-6528632">the film franchise has pulled in more than $1 billion</a>--and for Sega itself in terms of boosting game sales and Sonic's status as an iconic character. Crash Bandicoot, however, has seen better days. Developer Toys for Bob made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crash-bandicoot-4-review-/1900-6417574/" data-ref-id="1900-6417574">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a> in 2020, but the studio reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-artist-says-fifth-game-was-canceled/1100-6524957/" data-ref-id="1100-6524957">canceled plans to produce Crash Bandicoot 5</a>.</p><p>Although the Crash Bandicoot games were originally developed by Naughty Dog, the rights to the character are currently held by Microsoft after its purchase of Activision Blizzard. Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/want-a-crash-bandicoot-movie-ask-xbox-the-last-of-us-boss-says/1100-6531823/" data-ref-id="1100-6531823">expressed his support for a Crash Bandicoot movie</a>, but he also reiterated that it's Microsoft's call whether to actually pursue that project.</p>

            <p>It'll soon be time for another season of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the super-duper Overwotlike and thirsty delivery vehicle for every variation of Marvel character known to the human mind. What's coming in season three? Wesley Snipes and a bloody great burning bird lady. By which I mean, Blade and Phoenix. They'll be matching wits with Hera, goddess of death, who has palled up with Knull, god of symbioties, aka the wriggly black pyjamas sported by Venom.</p>
<p>All of this may seem frightening and bizarre if you're here because you accidentally hit auto-complete while googling "Marks &amp; Spencers opening times", so here's a swift trailer to fill you in.</p><!--more-->

<p>How about that? Nicely surgical bit of techno, I thought, definitely has me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZuZZzvJxR8">itching for the dance floor</a>. The new season begins on 11th July. Here's some official blurb for that trailer.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In the wake of the Timestream Entanglement, Knull stirs deep within Klyntar's core, stretching his shadowed hands across the cosmos. Power promised by the dark symbiote god beckons the awakening of a new queen. The Phoenix arrives from across the stars to erase Klyntar before the darkness can rise again! However, she'll require unlikely aid from a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night."</p> </blockquote>
<p>"As the god of the symbiotes and the Phoenix Force collide, will you burn with the light of creation or embrace the darkness?" the trailer blurb concludes. I choose to translate this as: do you want Phoenix Force skins or Symbiote skins? As for how the new characters play, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/massive-marvel-rivals-leak-confirms-season-3-theme-with-new-hero-battle-pass-and-more/">leaks suggest</a> that they're both DPS roles. There's also talk of new hero team-ups and some "anti-heal" mechanics, given away by new voice lines. It's probable one of the new heroes has the power to shut down health replenishment.</p>
<p>We've not covered Marvel Rivals much lately due to a shortage of hands at the wheel and greymass for the ever-expanding hero roster. It remains a popular game, with 56,735 people playing at the time of writing.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blade-and-phoenix-are-coming-to-marvel-rivals-this-july-in-season-3-along-with-rumoured-anti-heal-mechanics]]></content:encoded>
