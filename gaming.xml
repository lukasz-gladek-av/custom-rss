		<p>One of the early exclusive highlights of the Switch 2 era, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is getting just that little bit bigger with a new tandem DLC pack that adds DK Island and Emerald Rush to the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC, out now! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tkyp0u73cPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>DK Island adds… well, it adds Donkey Kong’s home island to the game, letting DK and Pauline explore the idyllic scene. That’s nice, but Emerald Rush adds a new challenge mode through the full game. Taking the chance to join the Void Crew (after the end of the game, of course) you’ll go on an emerald smashing romp through each world, having to clear as much of the green stuff as possible to unlock the mode in later stages.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you’re on the fence about DK Bananza, you’ll be able to download a free demo on Switch 2 and check out the deformative platforming action.</p>
<p>The game is a lot of fun. In my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>, I said, “Donkey Kong Bananza is an intoxicating cacophony of brawling, digging and platforming. It’s a new style of 3D platformer from Nintendo that, for better and for worse, embraces the destructive chaos of letting players tunnel through and deform the world.”</p>

		<p>The Metroid Prime 4 release date has been confirmed, the game set to launch for Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches December 4th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6tSSTH0Z8_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Also revealed through this announcement was a big new gameplay feature. Samus is able to hop onto a rad looking stretchy motorbike and race across the alien landscape, not just exploring, but also battling enemies at high speed.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game back at the Switch 2 reveal event in April, saying “For now, though, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is easily one of our most anticipated games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s sure to be a great experience on the original Switch as well, but pushing the graphics to higher levels and the mouse mode are the cherry on top.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected and was not meeting the company’s high standards in its initial form. As such, they taken the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series with the original Metroid Prime game on GameCube.</p>

<p>While that has slowly but surely come together, there’s been the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023. Both wetted the appetite for more Metroid games for fans, and it’s great to see Metroid Prime 4’s development has come far enough for Nintendo to pin a release date on it. We can’t wait to see more, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo is out to kill off the PSVR 2, announcing the return of Virtual Boy games as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, debuting on 12th February 2026 for both Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics arrives February 17th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aXT9wzOLFg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What’s the catch? Well, since these are all stereoscopic 3D games, you will need a dedicated Virtual Boy accessory in order to play, giving you split lenses for each eye. Thankfully, while there is a full-on plastic recreation of the Virtual Boy which you drop your Switch or Switch 2 console into, there is also a cardboard counterpart –&nbsp;likely similar to the VR Labo contraption from early in the last generation.</p>
<p>Mario’s Tennis, Galactic Pinball, and Teleroboxer had their specific shout-outs, but 14 games will be dished out for the Switch Online library in due course.</p>

<p>The DLC is called <strong>DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</strong> and is set on DK's very own home, so expect another huge nostalgia rush.</p>
<p>In Emerald Rush mode, you'll be attempting to join the ranks of Void Co by breaking and collecting emerald ore in a kind-of roguelike mode. You'll get to upgrade skills and choose random boons and benefits.</p>
<p>This mode is available in both DK Island <em>and</em> a handful of levels in the base game, and completing these trials will unlock rewards such as new costumes.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4kghimp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Pre-orders now live!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>One of the more interesting games that was announced alongside the Switch 2 console, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment</a> now has an official release date for Switch 2. And that date, my hacking and slashing pals, is November the 6th. Oh, and pre-orders go live today!</p>
<p>With 60fps action that should - fingers crossed - be smooth as a baby Korok's butt (hey, you can also play as a Korok fighter, so that's GOTY sorted early), and the ability to pair up with other fighters online or via GameShare with a pal, we're super-excited for this melding of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a> - and one of the more interesting parts of that series' lore to boot - with high-octane <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Warriors</a> action that should now look and perform as we've always wanted on Nintendo's new console!</p>

			<p>Nintendo finally announced the release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond today during its Nintendo Direct presentation, confirming that it'll arrive this coming December 2, 2025 on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The end is in sight for everyone who has been waiting for Metroid Prime 4 since it was first announced eight years ago in 2017, and even longer for those who've been waiting for this follow-up since the last Metroid Prime game released all the way back in 2007 with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.</p>



<p>The trailer that was debuted today shows off more gameplay, and interestingly, shows Samus riding around what appears to be an open-world on a motorcycle, which is an element of the game that we hadn't previously seen in any gameplay trailers or game previews.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's an added layer that makes the game all the more enticing. It'll be interesting to learn more about it as we get closer to release, but mostly, it's just good to finally have a release date confirmed for the game.</p>



<p>Leading up to its launch, Nintendo will release a retrospective look at the previous three Metroid Prime titles, and launch three new Amiibo figures ahead of launch, including one with Samus and her motorcycle featured in the above trailer.</p>



<p>When we checked out Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/">earlier this year for a hands-on preview</a>, while it was just an early look, Wccftech's Nathan Birch wrote that, "<em>it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way</em>."</p>

			<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, a remake of the seventh entry in the JRPG series by Square Enix, will launch worldwide next year.</p>



<p>The remake, which won't be a port of the Nintendo 3DS remake released years ago, as some speculated when <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-remake-in-the-works/">rumors regarding the game started circulating online</a>, will be a full 3D remake which seems bring the game's visuals, interface and combat system closer to the latest entries in the series, including the excellent Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. Surprisingly enough, it will also take not too long for the game to launch, as its release is set for February 5, 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Despite Square Enix keeping its silence on Dragon Quest XII, fans of the series have plenty to look forward to in the coming months, as, besides Dragon Quest VII Reimagined next February, they will be able to experience the first two entries in the series with the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. Unlike the HD-2D remake of the third entry in the series, these two upcoming remakes will offer more than enhanced visuals and some quality-of-life improvements, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-gamescom-hands-on-preview-more-than-a-new-coat-of-paint/"> hands-on preview</a> based on a demo I tried during last month's Gamescom.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5, 2026, on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Fall semester has already started for college students, so why haven’t you gotten yourself a laptop yet? You may not need it for Syllabus week, but soon you’ll be sent home with more homework than you can imagine. Get a computer that can handle it without completely depleting your monthly budget.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4086/"> Right now, this HP student laptop is down 77% at Amazon. It’s list price is $2,800, but the deal is bringing the price to just $645. That’s a difference of $2,154.</a></p>
<p>Okay, hey now. That over two thousand dollar discount can’t be real right? Well, kind of. If we take a look at the price history of this item, we’ll see it’s only existed on Amazon since June of this year. After a couple weeks, it immediately shot down in price by roughly as much as it has now (mostly around $800). Since then, it’s been back and forth from a crazy discount like this and its full price, but never back up for more than several days at a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4086/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Looking at the specs, the laptop is pretty good—but not nearly-three-thousand-dollars-good. It’s rocking an Intel Core i3 processor, which is fine. It does come with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage which is really good, but not pushing the starting price up&nbsp;<em>that much</em>.</p>
<p>So what gives? I’ll tell you. Some Amazon sellers will try to give the illusion you’re getting a better deal than you are. That starting price is just made up. The discounted rate is the real value of the laptop. But now if we’re looking at that, this laptop had spent most of the Summer at around $800. Now that school has started, it’s come down to its new lowest price of $646. For this reason, really we can say this HP laptop is on sale for $2,154 off. That’s not bad!</p>



<p>The HP laptop has a nice and large 17.3-inch display. This is great not just for getting schoolwork done, but if you’re in the dorms, you might end up watching a lot of your shows and movies from it too. Good to have a sizeable screen for that. Of course, you can always connect it to a TV or larger display using the HDMI 1.4 port.</p>
<h2>What Else Your Getting</h2>
<p>Other ports include two USB-A slots, one USB-C, and a good ol’ headphone/mic jack. The HP laptop also supports Wi-Fi 6 as well as Bluetooth 5.0 to easily pair wirelessly to some of your accessories.</p>
<p>Speaking of accessories, the laptop comes with a number of them as a bonus. You get a wireless mouse, and external CD/DVD drive, a full 1TB external hard drive, along with some webcam covers, dust plugs, and a cleaning cloth. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4086/">All that plus an HP laptop that comes preinstalled with Windows 11 Pro for $646?</a> Sounds like a pretty good deal after all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Considering we already had a Pokémon Presents just a month ago, I wasn’t expecting to see a new <em>Pokémon</em> game at today’s Nintendo Direct. Yet here we are, learning about a new game called <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, and it looks like a cross between <em>Animal Crossing</em> and a farming sim.</p> <p>In this Switch 2 game, you play as a Ditto who takes on a human form and helps build a space for the local ‘mons. It’s kind of a strange concept, and I actually hate seeing the little beady-eyed Ditto person’s face, but I’m down for more <em>Pokémon</em> games that show this world in a different light. The game will launch in 2026. Check out the reveal trailer here:</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Play as a Ditto transformed into a human and shape an empty land into a beautiful home for Pokémon in Pokémon Pokopia, releasing on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch2</a> in 2026. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoDirect</a> <a href="https://t.co/zTiVcLHAgJ">pic.twitter.com/zTiVcLHAgJ</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1966500993593405711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Visually, the game employs something pretty similar to the minimalist, chibi style of <em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</em> and <em>Shining Pearl</em>, but really Ditto is the only character that it’s super noticeable with, as the Pokémon just kinda look like they always have. The one advantage of playing as Ditto, however, is that you’ll be able to talk to your fellow Pokémon, so they seem to function like <em>Animal Crossing</em> villagers with their own personalities, desires, wants, and dreams. The trailer shows a lot of different looks for your Ditto human, so you can probably customize them to your liking. There’s also one shot of two players walking around in the same area, so it looks like you’ll be able to visit your friends’ villages, too.</p> <p>Overall, it looks pretty neat.&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-style life sims don’t usually hold my attention for very long, but the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon </em>framing might keep my interest a little bit longer. I’m just a goal-oriented player so games that are just about maintaining something are harder for me to get into. But if you’re looking for something a bit cozier in the world of <em>Pokémon</em>, it looks like&nbsp;<em>Pokopia</em> will deliver that.</p>

What?!</p> <p>The latest trailer opened with the bounty hunter tearing across the dunes of an alien planet on a <em>Tron</em>-like speeder. Will these be isolated parts of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> or is the sequel going more open world just like all of Nintendo’s other big franchises? What parts of the map will be locked behind doing a wheelie off a space ramp?</p> <p>Here’s a look:</p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-red-samus-trailer-date-switch-2-1851772697">As previous footage revealed</a>, the game will feature a new red suit for Samus and psychic powers she must use to navigate ancient alien ruins and solve puzzles. The game’s main antagonist appears to be Sylux, a rival bounty hunter first introduced in <i>Metroid Prime Hunters</i> who hates the Galactic Federation.</p> <p>Samus is also getting new <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> amiibo, including one with her on her motorcycle, on November 6, followed by a Sylux amiibo on release date.</p>

              <p>Yes, seriously! In a move absolutely no one was expecting, the all-time classic 3D gaming device Virtual Boy is coming to Nintendo Switch, via what looks like the ultimate Labo experiment. Via either a faithful plastic replica of the original device, or even a cardboard version, Nintendo is planning to bring 14 Virtual Boy games back to its systems. The 1995 device wasn’t exactly a break-out success, so it’s fantastic to see it begin given a brand new, deeply bizarre second chance some 30 years later.</p>  <p>As the subscription service feature that’s now called Nintendo Classics rapidly expands, perhaps there was hope that we might start to see some Wii games getting emulated, and the woefully missing DS category getting added, but it’s safe to say few had Virtual Boy on their bingo card. The three-decade-old device rendered 3D games in a red-on-black format, played by pressing your face into the massive goggles balanced on a stand. When it came out in 1995, it launched with <em>Mario’s Tennis</em>,&nbsp;<em>Red Alarm</em>,&nbsp;<em>Teleroboxer</em> and&nbsp;<em>Galactic Pinball</em>, all of which are set to appear in this new version.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000625330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625330"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625330">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>What’s so extraordinary about this is that it obviously can’t just run on your Switch or Switch 2, because the consoles have no means of being a 3D device. Hence the brand new peripheral which recreates the original look, complete with far-too-spindly legs. But there’s also a cardboard version that will likely cost significantly less, and hopefully still recreate the same effect.</p>

 <p>The original Virtual Boy did not sell well, partly because it was very expensive for the time, and partly because it rendered games as crude red lines in 1995 when 3D graphics cards were just becoming a big deal. Clearly nostalgia makes all of that irrelevant, and this the most bizarrely appealing idea 30 years on.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000625329" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625329"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625329">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There’s no clear date when it will be arriving in the still awfully-named Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, but we know it’ll coincide with the launch of the physical peripherals. 14 games will be added to the collection “over time,” including two versions if&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>, and the almost forgotten&nbsp;<em>Mario Clash</em>.</p>
