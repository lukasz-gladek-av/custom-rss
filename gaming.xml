			<p>More than half of the total CAPCOM software sales for the first half of the current fiscal year have been on PC, according to the publisher's latest financial report.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/html/explanation/2025/2nd/1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> covering the first half of FY25, the Japanese publisher confirmed that sales, operating income, and Digital Contents segment are all down 25%, 39%, and 35%, respectively, over the previous fiscal year, which is not surprising, considering the publisher launched mostly minor titles in the first six months of the current fiscal year. Still, the publisher confirmed it is still on target to achieve its annual forecast thanks to a second half of the year that will be stronger than the first, thanks to the upcoming launch of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>This fiscal year's sales also highlighted a growing trend for CAPCOM, as of the 20.025 million units of software sold, 54% were sold on PC, with console sales shrinking from 51% in FY20 to 40% in FY25. The publisher's focus on the PC market is definitely paying off, and it will be interesting to see how much Monster Hunter Wilds will sell on PC compared to consoles, which don't seem will deliver the best way to enjoy one of the most anticipated games of 2025, judging from <a href="https://wccftech.com/monstewr-hunter-wilds-display-modes-consoles-120-hz/">impressions</a> from the PS Plus exclusive beta which began today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bloodborne-and-final-fantasy-16-designer-velux<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A designer who worked on&nbsp;FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>and Square Enix's&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>has opened up his own studio by the name of Velux.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-fromsoftware-and-square-enix-game-designer-establishes-new-game-company-to-make-games-for-game-lovers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a Japanese <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000001.000151924.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>), designer Sho Igarashi will serve as the newly-created Velux Studio's CEO. He's worked not only with FromSoftware and Square Enix, but also with&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>studio Cygames and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/forspoken">Forspoken</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Luminous Productions.</p>

<p>According to Automaton's translation of the press release, Igarashi's "expertise lies in battle production" (that's Automaton's wording, not the press release's), although it's not clear whether he definitely worked on combat design for the aforementioned games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-velux-studio-sho-igarashi.jpg?itok=ReVpqYIb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-velux-studio-sho-igarashi.jpg?itok=FeE0XH2q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sho Igarashi's credits include&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't know much about Velux Studio, except that per Automaton, the company will be making games across PC, consoles, and mobile devices, and it'll include both "high-end" and "casual" titles in its remit (again, that's Automaton's wording).</p>

<p>The goal here is to "make games for game lovers", or so the press release says, and the studio will be working with Unreal Engine 5 in-house, so it sounds like nothing will be outsourced.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know exactly what Velux is working on, although if a couple of preview images released on the studio's new <a href="https://velux-studio.co.jp/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> are anything to go by, it looks like the debut game will have a sci-fi flavor to it.</p>

<p>Velux also has an <a href="https://x.com/VELUX_STUDIO" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, although naturally, since the studio is new, there isn't much on there yet. Still, you know who to follow if you want up-to-the-minute news about this new company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/velux-studio-unreal-engine-5-project.jpg?itok=9NnXjUh- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/velux-studio-unreal-engine-5-project.jpg?itok=_WYjiVYZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Velux Studio is currently hard at work on...whatever this is.</figcaption></figure><p>Igarashi is far from the only decorated designer to be starting up his own studio. In recent years, we've seen studios started up by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors">several ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers</a>, as well as staffers from big companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bethesda-bioware-naughty-dog-near-studios-hawthorn">Bethesda</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-ea-staffers-three-thousands-studio">EA</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-staffers-birdkin-hideaki-saori-utsumi">Capcom</a>, among others.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what Velux Studio will reveal as its debut title, but let's hope we find out sooner rather than later. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Everything fans have come to love about the series returns in full, bringing together an emotional story and compelling powers-based gameplay to create something unique and engaging. Let’s take a look at any burning questions you may have about this fresh entry in the world of Life is Strange.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h110310"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> a direct sequel?</strong></h2><p>The original <em>Life is Strange</em> remains a favorite among series fans, so it makes sense that developer Deck Nine would want to revisit the game’s characters at some point. Though a prequel titled <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</em> examined Chloe’s life leading up to her meeting <em>Life is Strange</em>’s protagonist Max, there had yet to be a sequel looking into what happened in the years after the events in Arcadia Bay.</p><p>That’s where <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> comes in. <strong>Yes, it’s a full-blown sequel to the first game</strong>, which picks up a full ten years after the events that transpired in that initial entry. While the story of the first game still has an effect on Max and the lives of those around her (more on that below), this new adventure is also a fine jumping-in point for new players—meaning <strong>you don’t necessarily have to have played the original to get a complete, cohesive tale from this one</strong>.</p><p>Max has left Arcadia Bay and is now a photographer at a prestigious university—but we all know that things won’t go too smoothly for our heroine. Instead, Max soon finds her friend Safi dead, prompting a series of events that leads to her learning she has the power to switch between multiple timelines—one in which Safi is dead and another where she’s somehow still alive. This ultimately allows you to weave in and out the two timelines, as Max inches closer to learning who killed Safi, and finding out whether she can stop them.</p><h2 id="h110311"><a id=""></a><strong>How does <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> handle <em>Life is Strange</em>’s multiple endings?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="3f226c73c16d5569f497733b88a96c04" data-recommend-id="image://3f226c73c16d5569f497733b88a96c04" data-format="jpg" data-width="2173" data-height="1215" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max is confronted by a reporter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max is confronted by a reporter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f226c73c16d5569f497733b88a96c04" data-recommend-id="image://3f226c73c16d5569f497733b88a96c04" data-format="jpg" data-width="2173" data-height="1215" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max is confronted by a reporter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>SPOILER FOR <em>LIFE IS STRANGE</em>!</strong></p><p>At the end of the original <em>Life is Strange</em>, Max is faced with one of the hardest decisions anyone could ever imagine: save her friend’s life or save the entirety of Arcadia Bay. Both of these decisions obviously resulted in unique, bittersweet endings, begging players to replay the game and see how things would’ve turned out had they made a different decision.</p><p>With this in mind, you may be wondering how <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> handles this canonically. Well, good news: It doesn’t really matter which ending you chose originally, as a moment early in the game grants you the choice to pick which ending you’d prefer as canon.</p><p>Your journal, texts, and even character interactions differ based on which choice you make, yet again giving you plenty of reasons to pick the opposite option at the beginning of a second playthrough to see how those older events shaped the world for Max and those around her.</p><h2 id="h110312"><a id=""></a><strong>How many chapters are in <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>?</strong></h2><p>Unlike previous games in the franchise, <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> is not an episodic title. However, it is still split up in a way that feels similar to the episodic nature of older games in the series. It contains <strong>five chapters</strong>, with each leading up to an important moment in the story that will shape what’s to come.</p><p>Each chapter can take you between two to four hours to finish, depending on whether you push through the main narrative beats or take your time exploring, checking out the sights, and engaging in optional collectible hunting. As such, you can expect to spend somewhere between <strong>10 to 15 hours</strong> completing the full game based on your playstyle.</p><h2 id="h110313"><a id=""></a><strong>What platforms is <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> released on?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5e28b6c79bf22a93cb20e180ffe1ee32" data-recommend-id="image://5e28b6c79bf22a93cb20e180ffe1ee32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max casts a force ghost." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max casts a force ghost." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e28b6c79bf22a93cb20e180ffe1ee32" data-recommend-id="image://5e28b6c79bf22a93cb20e180ffe1ee32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max casts a force ghost." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> is available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. If you’re using older platforms like PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, you won’t be able to purchase or play this entry in the series, unfortunately.</p><h2 id="h110314"><a id=""></a><strong>Can my PC run <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>?</strong></h2><p>If you opt to play <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> on PC, you may be curious whether your rig is up to the task. Luckily, the game isn’t as demanding as more graphically intense titles, but you’ll still need a computer with reasonably modern hardware to keep up.</p><p>Here are the minimum and recommended specs for the game.</p><p><strong>Minimum Specs:</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Windows 10</li><li>Intel Core i5-2400 / AMD FX-6300</li><li>12GB RAM</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960, 4 GB / AMD Radeon RX 470, 4GB / Intel Arc A380, 6GB</li><li>DirectX 12</li></ul><p><strong>Recommended Specs:</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Windows 10</li><li>Intel Core i7-7700K / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li><li>12GB RAM</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Super, 8GB / AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT, 12GB</li><li>DirectX 12</li></ul><h2 id="h110315"><a id=""></a><strong>Does <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> have accessibility settings?</strong></h2><p><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> features a solid suite of accessibility settings you can access via Settings &gt; Accessibility.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-first-black-ops-6-double-xp-weekend/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty’s Double XP Weekends are the best. For a limited time, you can earn twice as much XP in CoD, and if you’re looking to quickly level up in Black Ops 6, the next Double XP Weekend is the dream ticket—so let’s look at all the information we have so far.</p>



<p>I love a Double XP Weekend in CoD. If you’ve not been able to play as much Call of Duty as you’d like, or you’ve had some time off, a Double XP Weekend allows you to catch up, make up lost ground, and get back into the leveling-up fray. It applies to all game modes too, so you don’t need to feel restricted in your methods or change your gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is likely to continue the trend of the last few CoD games by having regular Double XP Weekends. With talk of Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season One</a>, and even its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a>, let’s address another key topic right now.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-the-next-double-xp-weekend-event-date-is-in-black-ops-6">Do we Know When the Next Double XP Weekend Event Date is in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s off to work we go. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Right now, we don’t currently know when the first Black Ops 6 Double XP Weekend is expected to be. If we use 2023’s Modern Warfare 3 as a marker though, we should expect to see the first 2XP Weekend in the <strong>third or fourth week of November</strong>.</p>



<p>Modern Warfare 3’s first all-Double XP Weekend debuted on Nov. 22, last year, and the first instance of these special occasions usually drop around the end of November / start of December—expect Black Ops 6 to be the same.</p>



<p>For now, this is pure conjecture on our part, so take this speculation with a grain of salt. However, keep checking back to this guide as we are going to update it as we learn more about the first Double XP Weekend.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-double-xp-weekend-in-black-ops-6">What is Double XP Weekend in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Double XP Weekend is a period—usually <strong>lasting from Friday until Monday</strong>—in which players can <strong>earn twice as much XP for one or more of CoD’s leveling-up systems</strong>—and this is expected to be the same for Black Ops 6 too.</p>



<p>There are many ways to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earn Double XP in Black Ops 6</a>, but this is one of the best. It depends on Treyarch, but Double Weekends can include one of the following: <strong>Double Player Level XP, Double Weapon Level XP, or Double Battle Pass XP</strong>. If you’re lucky, the developer may decide to be generous and allow you to have Double XP for all three!</p>

Well, our first regret was assuming that our factory at that time—a factory that made lots of Bluetooth speakers—could easily design the electronics for us, saving us lots of time and money. That went pretty well at first. But they, in turn, outsourced the Bluetooth software and chipset to another company in another country," wrote Panic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As a result, the Stereo Dock would crash often–rapidly adjusting the volume would do it. The Bluetooth pairing/unpairing experience was rough. And when we played music, it just didn't sound very good. The back-and-forth between three companies trying to fix bugs became a huge challenge. And worst of all: the cost of the Stereo Dock kept getting higher and higher."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Panic eventually took over the audio production process and hand-tuned the speaker's EQ curves to bolster its output. It also negotiated a buyout of the bluetooth chipset source code with a view to taking over development and improving the user experience, only to be met with some "gnarly code" that made life even more difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We kept pushing forward. We got a number of beautiful finished prototypes, in beautiful final packaging, that look incredible on our desks. But they weren’t very good to use. And if we’re going to ship a product, it has to be, at least, good," continued Panic. "Eventually we hit that painful line: we’re spending more to make this product than we are likely to ever make back from it. And so, we hit pause."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company still hopes it will have the time and resources to reboot the project in the future, but for now remains focused on Playdate itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Panic has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdate-devs-have-earned-over-500-000-through-catalog">sold over 70,000 units of Playdate</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since launching the console in 2022, although it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdate-launch-delayed-until-early-2022-">encountered plenty of challenges</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> along the way. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/panic-launches-catalog-a-curated-digital-storefront-for-playdate">It also launched Catalog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a bona fide storefront for Playdate developers and players, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/panic-recovers-stolen-playdates-worth-400-000-after-lots-of-detective-work-">retrieved around $400,000 worth of Playdate stock</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that vanished in Las Vegas in rather suspicious circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> said personal abuse sent to Wuk Lamat's voice actor "breaks my heart".</p>
<p>Wuk Lamat was a fresh character introduced in the latest expansion, Dawntrail, but proved unpopular with some players. This turned sour when voice actor Sena Bryer received transphobic abuse for her portrayal of the character.</p>
<p>Yoshida has commented on the character, as well as the abuse Bryer received, in a new interview with <a href="https://checkpointgaming.net/features/2024/10/chatting-with-the-iconic-naoki-yoshida-on-the-design-and-reception-of-dawntrail/">Checkpoint Gaming</a>, acknowledging player feedback and tweaks coming in forthcoming patches.</p>

<p>"[Wuk Lamat's] a very complex character, and she even has a bit of a complex about herself," said Yoshida. "Unfortunately, we didn't delve very far into the background of why she had those feelings, so it appeared as if she left a negative impression.</p><p>"We accept that feedback. I feel a little sorry that we weren't able to properly depict her. We may have been able to make her more straightforward, so we're pushing her in the forefront as this character. But again, we're going to be reflecting that learning into [content patch 7.1] and onward, we're hoping that we can show more of what makes Wuk Lamat so great, and I'm hoping that we can regain from there."</p>
<p>Yoshida then specifically mentioned the personal attacks against Bryer.</p>
<p>"One additional thing, there were comments about how we are too accepting of diversity - some people seem to be disapproving of that," he said. "I'm afraid one of our staff members received very negative comments and it almost felt like a personal attack, which breaks my heart, because she worked really hard and these criticisms were not constructive at all. It doesn't do anything except make the staff lose motivation, and in the end that could potentially damage the quality of our game and take away from what makes this game so interesting. So if there are any sort of criticisms, bring it to me, because I'm the one approving this material. I wanted to reiterate that, please refrain from personal attacks against our staff."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Yoshida has been outspoken against this abuse, telling German outlet <a href="https://jpgames.de/2024/09/final-fantasy-xiv-das-sagt-naoki-yoshida-zur-kritik-an-wuk-lamat/">JPGames</a> in September it was "really difficult" to discern valid criticism from people "just criticising the character in relation to values".</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Yoshida discussed criticism of Dawntrail</a>, particularly how some fans were disappointed the Scions took more of a backseat in the drama compared to previous expansions.</p>
<p>"With regards to the Scions playing a more active role only later on in the story, truth be told this is something I intentionally wanted to try out," said Yoshida. "I do understand there are people who always want the Scions to be at the centre of the story, but at the same time there are people who are also requesting something new instead. So it was a conscious effort on my part to experiment and see how the balance would play out."</p>
<p>Patch 7.1 of Final Fantasy 14, named Crossroads, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-71-crossroads-is-coming-in-november">set for release in mid-November</a>, bringing new story missions and - most notably - the start of the Final Fantasy 11 themed raid series, Echoes of Vana'diel.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will feature multiple display modes on consoles, as well as a 120 Hz output option, judging from the PS Plus exclusive beta that is now live worldwide.</p>
<p>As shown in a screenshot shared on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-ot-born-to-be-wild.1020882/post-130805709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, the next entry in the series, launching in a few months, will allow players to either prioritize resolution or framerate, as well as enable 120 Hz output for VRR-compatible displays. Unfortunately, according to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-ot-born-to-be-wild.1020882/post-130807878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, both display modes have to make some heavy compromises in terms of framerate and image quality, and performance is not very stable in either mode, dropping heavily in some areas so much that VRR is disengaged, but thankfully, there's still some time before release, and things could be improved further in time for release.</p>
<p>While image quality and performance may not be amazing, it definitely feels like Monster Hunter Wilds will be a massive step forward over its predecessors thanks to some of its new features, which include the Focus Mode gameplay mechanics and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-lobbies-100-players/">100 player lobbies</a> that promise improved interactivity with other hunters.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th, 2024. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">preview.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-unannounced-games-fy-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/koei-tecmo-to-release-several-unannounced-titles-before-april-2025.1021860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-unannounced-games-fy-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>studio Koei Tecmo has revealed that it has several unannounced projects set to release before the end of the fiscal year in March.</p>

<p>According to the company's latest financial presentation, "several unannounced titles (up to mid-tier)" are set to launch before the beginning of April 2025, although of course, Koei Tecmo doesn't reveal exactly what they are.</p>

<p>That's in addition to the games already in the pipeline for Koei Tecmo, which include the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/romance-of-three-kingdoms-8-remake-release-date"><em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8&nbsp;</em>remake</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, and two&nbsp;different&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian"><em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>RPGs</a>, as well as manga and anime adaptation&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-koei-tecmo.jpg?itok=5fhKKIZm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-koei-tecmo.jpg?itok=C7LF7FQP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Koei Tecmo's upcoming slate includes&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, plus several unannounced games.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Koei Tecmo's unannounced projects comes alongside a look at the company's financial performance for the first half of 2024, and sales are down by 11.4% compared to the previous year, although Koei Tecmo says this is because the PC and console areas of the business were "focused on back catalog".</p>

<p>Similarly, Koei Tecmo's financials are lower than the company initially forecasted for this first half of the year, thanks to a "decrease in sales from console/PC and online/mobile".</p>

<p>However, it's noteworthy that unlike major Western studios (the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">Bungie</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september">Microsoft</a> spring to mind), Koei Tecmo hasn't laid any employees off this year; rather, its headcount has actually increased since the first half of last year.</p>

<p>It's true that Koei Tecmo hasn't increased its salaries across the board like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fromsoftware-raises-base-salaries">some</a> of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-salary-increase">compatriots</a>, but it's still nice to see a company responding to slightly lower sales not by firing employees by the hundreds, but by standing firm.</p>

The studio says it's on target to hire 200 new employees across the 2024-25 fiscal year, with a focus mainly on new graduates.</p>

<p>Other initiatives in place for Koei Tecmo's future include improving its internal tech, utilizing AI, and expanding its global publishing structure in the long-term.

        <p>Aihama, Japan. The final years of the Edo period. One rain-drenched evening, a group of men burst into the town’s brother and sister-run umbrella shop. Yushin is cut down in front of his sister Yui, leaving her alone in the world. The next thing he knows, he is looking down at his own stricken corpse—a soul without a body. The grim incident shatters the peace in this quiet backwater. Lurking beneath the surface is an intricate, deep-rooted plot, shrouded in mystery. Until Yui is safe, not even death is enough to extinguish Yushin’s soul. He’ll stop at nothing on his quest, shifting from body to body, possessing anyone and anything to rescue his sister.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Songs of Silence - Official 1.0 Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"The release of Songs of Silence is a huge milestone for our studio," creative director Alex Kehr said in a press statement. "Following our journey in Steam Early Access, our players' feedback has shaped the game into something truly special. We are so excited for the community to dive into the 1.0 version of Songs of Silence to experience its epic story campaign, hours upon hours of multiplayer content, finely-tuned combat, and tons of gameplay options that we feel reinvigorates the 4X strategy genre."</p><p>Overall, players can expect a 15-hour campaign alongside PvP and co-op multiplayer modes. One of the other interesting gameplay mechanics in Songs of Silence is the Cards of Fate, cards that represent unique actions and abilities that can be used to change the course of battles and influence elements on the map to your advantage.</p><p>2024 has been a pretty good year for fans of the strategy genre. In addition to the early access release of Songs of Silence, other genre highlights included the recent launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ara-history-untold/" data-ref-id="5000-566096">Ara: History Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-drawing-a-line-in-the-snow/1900-6418286/" data-ref-id="1900-6418286">Frostpunk 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/homeworld-3/" data-ref-id="5000-501735">Homeworld 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/age-of-mythology-retold/" data-ref-id="5000-574585">Age of Mythology: Retold</a>. </p><p>If you're interested in trying it out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195410/Songs_of_Silence/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Songs of Silence demo is available on Steam</a>, and you can see more of the game in action through the embedded trailer above. The price for Songs of Silence won't increase after it exits early access, and you can pick it up for $40 on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-horizon-forbidden-west-patch-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/">Horizon Forbidden West</a> patch introduces an image treatment solution that delivers better image quality from what we have seen so far of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> discussed this new image treatment solution, saying that it delivers a pristine image quality that is close to what NVIDIA DLSS can deliver on PC and considerably better than what we have seen PSSR do so far. This solution, which is reportedly in development for Guerrilla Games' next project, is likely a compute-based solution that doesn't use the machine learning hardware of the PlayStation 5 Pro, so it could potentially run on the base console, where it could deliver much more impressive results, considering the only upscaler available on the regular PS5 is AMD FSR, which delivers some middling results, as we have seen over and over in the past few months.</p>
<p>Although the great image quality delivered by this image treatment solution could be thanks to the high base resolution (1440p / 1584p to 4K), it could also be another great option for developers, as it could allow Guerrilla or any other developer using the Decima engine, like Kojima Productions with Death Stranding 2, to use the PlayStation 5 Pro machine learning hardware to do other things.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #186: Teraflop War OVER, Killzone Dead, Alan Wake 2 PS5 Pro, Silent Hill 2 Patched!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RrGDYXvKBk?start=6024&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The superior image quality delivered by Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 5 Pro, thanks to this new image treatment solution, could be matched by any other game using PSSR with a high enough base resolution, as the games using the upscaler seen so far had a much lower base resolution than 1440p. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to see for ourselves what the AI-powered upscaler will be able to do under the right conditions, as the console launches next week, on November 7th, worldwide.</p>

            <p>Bungie have been fairly quiet about Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">announced in 2023</a>. Yesterday they released a devlog in which game director Joe Ziegler seemed to want to reassure fans of the studio that the game was still in development. He talked around a lot of the game features, without actually saying much about it. As yet, there's still no footage of the game in action, making its previous release window of 2025 appear even more tenuous.</p>

<p>Ziegler begins the video by saying there's no gameplay footage to show, and talks in some very general terms about what the game is going to be - a PvP-focused extraction shooter. Ollie has already rounded up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-release-date">everything we know about Marathon</a>, and this devlog sadly doesn't tell us anything new about the game. If anything it makes it sound less defined than before. Ziegler makes vague mention of player abilities, loot, and "runner" loadouts, while re-explaining some extraction shooter basics many first-person shooter fans will already know. He does give some indication of where the studio is in terms of production, even if he doesn't show anything.</p>
<p>"Some things are a little bit more complete, like our environments are starting to come together in a really, really beautiful way," he says. "Some of the character models we've been iterating through. So they're coming together but they're not fully there yet... So it's a little early to show you all of it as one piece."</p><p>There are some insubstantial teases of characters. One is codenamed "Thief" and another is codenamed "Stealth" who is unsurprisingly described as "hard to pin down". And Ziegler mentions that the studio will be recruiting more playtesters next year. He doesn't mention anything about the release date, or give much indication about other elements of the game.</p>
<p>In BBC comedy The Thick Of It, a government minister is scheduled to go on a news show. But he has absolutely nothing to announce or say. His vicious PR man, Malcolm Tucker, tells him to come up with something. "It better not be too boring," he commands. "And it better not be too interesting either, okay? And it better not cost too much. It can't be an old thing, obviously, and don't make it too new." </p>
<p>I can't help but suspect Ziegler's non-announcement is the result of the same kind of PR frogmarching and "visibility first" thinking. Bungie's silence around the game has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-full-original-marathon-trilogy-is-now-free-on-steam-but-bungie-are-still-quiet-on-the-reboot">not gone unnoticed</a>, and it's likely the studio wanted to simply say "our game is still alive" without actually showing any work-in-progress. Compare this to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skates-chaotic-playtest-videos-are-the-best-marketing-the-game-could-ask-for">bare-faced development</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a> from Full Circle, or the almost worringly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thousands-are-playing-valves-unrevealed-shooter-deadlock-a-blend-of-team-fortress-2-and-dota-with-bioshocky-skyrails">blasé treatment</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> by Valve. Both of whom are happy to show things in various states of unreadiness.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, however, it's up to Bungie to decide when they feel the game is good enough to show. It's not like they have been without road blocks in development. The studio has recently seen multiple <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">management shake-ups</a> amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs</a>. Ziegler himself is directing the game after the removal of previous director, Chris Barrett, for the latter's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-reportedly-fired-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-for-unwanted-and-inappropriate-messages-to-female-staff">allegedly inappropriate behaviour</a>. Some Bungie staff have also been reassigned to other divisions within Sony, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought the studio back in 2022</a>. None of this is likely to have helped the development of the shooter. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has an arachnophobia mode as part of its accessibility offering that turns spider-like creatures into amusing blobs.</p>
<p>The forthcoming game in the series has an open beta coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-getting-open-beta-in-november-with-early-access-for-playstation-plus-subscribers">PS Plus subscribers getting early access</a> that's now available.</p>
<p>Right at the start, players can tweak the settings and turn on Arachnophobia Assistance, which "adjusts the appearance of some small monsters and endemic life to accommodate players with arachnophobia".</p>

<p>The result is creatures becoming golden globules that wobble around environments. As an arachnophobe myself, it certainly put a smile on my face.</p>
<p>Note, however, this only applies to small monsters rather than the main monsters you'll be tasked with properly hunting.</p>

<p>That's fine for the menagerie of dragon, lizard, bear, and toad-like monsters, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp4gR1QEvVA">spider-esque Lala Barina</a> seemingly won't be affected. Still, it does have four legs rather than eight - and the legs are the worst.</p>
<p>The beta also provides a look at other accessibility options, with three presets for visual, auditory, and motion sickness options. These can also be toggled individually in the options menu.</p>

<p>The arachnophobia mode is fast becoming standard in games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/20-years-later-world-of-warcraft-is-getting-an-arachnophobia-mode">World of Warcraft finally received one</a> earlier this year after 20 years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">Call of Duty Black Ops 6 turns spiders into something even worse</a>.

And while that's a descriptor often used for each new game, it's a welcome evolution that streamlines the experience with tidier menus and NPC teammates.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta launches across all platforms on 31st October and lasts until 4th November. We've got all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-release-date-time-early-access">beta times in our guide</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arkham-horror-the-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween.1021809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was only three months ago that I was praising Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Hungering Abyss for its ability to teach the game, supply players with everything they'd need for a multiple-hour experience, and create an entertaining and tense spooky experience. The one major downside I had was how it really was only suited for that one experience, now with the release of the Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook in under a month we know what it will be like to create a story from scratch.</p>

<h2>Intuitive Layout</h2>

<p>Before I get into the contents of the book itself I need to highlight how incredibly well formatted the Core Rulebook is. From the moment I opened the book I could tell the time and effort that had gone into the layout. Starting with what Arkham Horror is, information about the setting of the game, and a very clear section disowning Lovecraft's beliefs, you launch into relevant information for the player.</p>

<p>You'll learn about the city of Arkham, where players might base their character, but also learn about how the game doesn't need to be restricted to Massachusetts. Examples of mysteries in Cairo or Europe, or even beyond the veil immediately start prodding at the mind of DM and player alike.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-the-world.jpg?itok=soqQ6YNz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-the-world.jpg?itok=fkjBAbUI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there you get all the required information on the rules of the game, neatly together for easy referencing, character creation, and information for DMs.</p>

<p>If you plan to keep the book on hand while playing it should be a breeze to locate what information you're after in a pinch. On top of that, inside the cover is a code from Drivethrurpg for a PDF of the Rulebook.</p>

<h2>Rules Glossary</h2>

<p>The first major section you'll reach is the Rules Glossary. This will cover how the Dynamic Pool system works, the different types of scenes that you'll encounter and how to take actions and consequences.</p>

<p>The approach to this is bite-sized information that can continue to be built upon starting with that important Dynamic Pool. In Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game the Dynamic Pool is every, it will determine how much you can do as you investigate a location to how you can move and act in combat.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-arkham-map.jpg?itok=wrHusmwq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-arkham-map.jpg?itok=G9BRvTnL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players have a dice pool of six dice. As they take damage they can end up with fewer dice, hence fewer actions to make, or if they experience horrors those dice can turn against you inflicting horrors if they land with a certain face.</p>

<p>Going into the Core Rulebook with an understanding of the dice pool and how it functions after my time with Hungering Abyss the system made sense. For a player coming into this system new I do think it's a bit tough to understand initially. Like with a lot of TTRPGs there's a lot that you can read but doing the thing will normally help you understand much faster.</p>

<p>It's in this way that the introduction to the Dynamic Pool, scenes, and actions is actually better got across by Hungering Abyss in the way that the game only introduces concepts to you as they become relevant.</p>

<p>From there the bite-sized information continues and is effective in creating a glossary that is easy to reference and quick to check with clearly labeled sections and sub-sections alongside well-laid-out descriptions and even some examples for the harder-to-understand concepts.</p>

<h2>Bringing a character to life in the world of Arkham Horror</h2>

<p>There's a funny line at the beginning of the character creation that I believe sets up the world you're about to step into with Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Most of the people in Arkham, Massachusetts and around the globe spend their time dealing with the simple routines of their daily lives. [...] Your characters aren't so lucky"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Players will take on the roles of those unfortunate enough to find themselves tied to a dark and mysterious fate. These characters, dubbed investigators, might have been raised in this world or is about to get pulled from their comfy life but there's no turning back.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-hunter-class.jpg?itok=Rz4XUiD7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-hunter-class.jpg?itok=8Jp0DkOh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A character is made up of a few key components; Background, Personality Trait, Archetype, Skills, and their starting equipment and advancements. In the back of the book is a blank character sheet that you can use to fill out as you go through the process of building your character up.</p>

<p>Interestingly this character sheet wasn't mentioned at the start of the character creation process, or in the table of contents.</p>

<p>A lot of these aspects aren't hard rules but instead prompts, for discovering your characters backgrounds you'll get prompted with questions like "What is your family like?" and "How does your character make a Living?" etc…</p>

<p>These questions then get paired with what differences there might be between a Poor upbringing and that of a Prosperous lifestyle.</p>

<p>Personality and Archetype are more set in the rules. There are eleven Personalities and eight Archetypes. You can mix and match these to finetune your character and allow for differences among characters to develop immediately.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-character-class.jpg?itok=E3B9_BH5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-character-class.jpg?itok=7L8i2HWA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Diversify The Party</h2>

<p>As a 'Outgoing' Personality you might have the chance to perform an action with your Presence stat, but it could also negatively impact you causing Disadvantage against rolls with allies. This could be combined with a Guardian archetype to create a mayoral character who is good at communicating with their peers.</p>

<p>That same Outgoing Personality could create a vastly different character if applied to a Seeker like a private detective, or a Mystic who is able to manifest supernatural abilities.</p>

<p>Characters will progress by earning experience in sequences. This experience isn't something to fill up a meter for, but instead, it can be spent on gaining abilities. It's not as much "leveling up" but skill points to be spent on a tree.</p>

<p>A major benefit of this is that players will be able to tweak a lot more, and faster. It's not a matter of multiple sessions before you can make skill checks easier or pick up a new ability, you might be able to pick something small up at the end of an encounter or save up for something bigger.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-stat-block.jpg?itok=gD4jdwuH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-stat-block.jpg?itok=zIvhswi- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Strapped Up</h2>

<p>The list of interesting equipment, mundane or otherwise, is like stepping into a candy store. Players will be able to obtain different armors, melee and ranged weaponry, single-use items, and even ancient tomes filled with spells.</p>

<p>Each section is filled with relevant information like gameplay mechanics, prices, and more again assisting the DM in creating a very seamless experience.</p>

<p>Mechanically I was extremely interested in the Tomes section. Unlike a Wizards book that could hold any spell the Tomes here are very specific with what information they contain, the checks that a character would need to complete to have read and understood them, and what spells can be cast with them.</p>

<p>These are definitely the rarest of the rare items for your party to come across but who wouldn't like to happen across the De Vermis Mysteriis, allowing you to enchant weapons or armor, or get your hands on the Necronomicon?</p>

<h2>The Role of the GM and Worldbuilding</h2>

<p>Moving further away from the information that the players need to know we reach the chapters with information for the Game Master. Here we have detailed information about Arkham, including the different regions of the town, important locations within them, and even a visitor-style map.</p>

<p>The section on running the game provides a variety of helpful tips and information including how to create a story, how to run the different scenes, and additional information on the tones and themes of the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-included-adventure-character.jpg?itok=A6K7F45x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-included-adventure-character.jpg?itok=fdl5qQre 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For a horror game I'm extremely glad to see a section on safety rules. Not just the guidelines on how to creat lines and veils, known as Pillars and Borders in Arkham Horror, but also to omit all Xenophobia and Marginalization.</p>

<h2>What Lurks Beyond The Veil</h2>

<p>Two of the final chapters are dedicated to the different Allies and NPCs you'll be able to inject into your games, including stat blocks for all monsters. For your world building the chapter, The Ancient Ones, is your one-stop shop to understand the kinds of eldritch creatures that Lovecraft came up with.</p>

<p>Here you'll find multi-paged dossier entries on some of the big and small players of the Mythos including Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Crothhoaka, and more. Each section does an impressive job of distilling all of the information surrounding these creatures into well-formatted sections. Reading each you'll understand what they are and where their domain is, what effect they have, what their lair is like, and what kinds of allies or factions may be supporting them.</p>

<p>What I really appreciate about the introduction of what are meant to be all-powerful Old Ones is that while there's a lot of context and understanding there isn't anything mechanical to them. Sure the Star Spawn might have a reference to their power from Cthulhu but no player character would truly be able to face an Old One. Their presence helps to inform the actions of cults and other factions, instead of being the Big Bad themselves.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-old-ones.jpg?itok=6NIHXB6J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-old-ones.jpg?itok=vySbj8zP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Time To Play</h2>

<p>Finally, the last section of the book holds with it an adventure to play. While I do still believe for new players the Hungering Abyss starter set is going to be your best 'first experience' playing, if you've already completed that and are ready for a new challenge then it's excellent to have this Core Rulebook be a one-stop-shop to your first time playing the game too.</p>



<p>I was incredibly impressed reading through the Arkham Horror Rulebook. The content of it all was extremely easy to understand and efficient, teaching you to the game quickly but also makes referencing rules while playing extremely efficient.</p>

<p>While the character sheet is tucked away the options will provide players a wide variety of options to take through their spooky adventure, and the DM is more than adequately equipped to channel a creepy vibe from beyond the veil.</p>

<p>If you're an absolutely new group to playing I would still recommend the starter set, as it comes with so many tokens, handouts, and a 'learn as you go' style rulebook but if you're a fan and you're ready to dive into your own adventures then this is an excellent Rulebook to do so.</p>

<p>These games are being added just a couple of weeks after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-banjo-tooie">Rare's classic 3D platformer&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-banjo-tooie">Banjo-Tooie</a>&nbsp;</em>was added to the Switch Online list, but the two titles being introduced today arguably couldn't be more tonally different.</p>

<p>First up, you're getting old-school action-adventure&nbsp;game&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>, which blends elements of shooters, platformers, and all kinds of other genres. This isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/90s-classic-shadow-man-remastered-coming-to-pc-in-april">Nightdive's remaster</a>; it's the original N64 game, presented with all its warts intact.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-shadow-man-n64.jpg?itok=BTPuUdmV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-shadow-man-n64.jpg?itok=2amJDw6a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow Man&nbsp;</em>is haunting its way into the Nintendo Switch Online archives today.</figcaption></figure><p>Also available today is&nbsp;<em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em>, an FPS that serves as a sequel to the 1997 shooter&nbsp;<em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, this is another game that the ever-diligent retro enthusiasts at Nightdive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/turok-2-seeds-of-evil-remastered-edition-coming-to-steam">remastered back in 2017</a>, but again, this isn't the remastered version; it's the original N64 release.</p>

<p>The release of both of these games on Nintendo Switch Online was revealed earlier today in a rather amusing (and somewhat uncharacteristic of Nintendo) trailer that calls back to the grindhouse-style trailers of the 1970s. You can check that trailer out right here.</p>




<p>There's been a fair bit of buzz around Nintendo Switch Online recently, largely thanks to a rather strange game that Switch Online Expansion Pack members were invited to playtest last week.</p>

<p>Naturally, that game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mysterious-nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leaks">almost immediately leaked</a>, and it's an odd-looking multiplayer affair that sees players teaming up to populate a planet with all kinds of construction efforts. We don't know if it'll be released outside of the playtest yet.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man&nbsp;</em>and <i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil&nbsp;</i>are available right now for Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack members. Watch this space for more info on all things Switch Online-related.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/who-made-call-of-duty-black-ops-6.1021791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/who-made-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty has so many teams involved in its creation that it’s difficult to keep up with who’s involved and who the main company is behind its creation. Black Ops 6 introduces many new features and changes, and contrary to popular opinion, it isn’t being helmed by one company. </p>



<p>Infinity Ward officially got the CoD ball rolling with 2003’s Call of Duty and 2005’s Call of Duty 2. IW took a backseat to Treyarch in 2006 as the newbie more than adequately led Call of Duty 3. More teams have entered the conversation since, leading to players wondering who makes which games.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is a continuation of the espionage side of Call of Duty—with a hint of round-based Zombies thrown in for good measure. The first-person shooter was been well-recieved, and we know who’s responsible for its success.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-black-ops-6">Who Made Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tell me! Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Treyarch and Raven Software</strong> are behind the development and continued support of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Seeing Treyarch behind the wheel is no surprise as Black Ops is Treyarch’s baby. However, 2020’s Black Ops Cold War was the first title in the BLOPS portion of CoD to bring another team on board—Raven Software. History has repeated itself as Black Ops 6 is officially co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software.</p>



<p>With a deep Campaign, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/">Liberty</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/">Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a> Zombies maps (with more to come), and online multiplayer, there are a lot of plates to spin—but we do know both teams aren’t spinning every plate though.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-the-black-ops-6-campaign">Who Made the Black Ops 6 Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>Raven Software</strong> is actually the developer behind the dramatic, single-player Campaign. The news was confirmed by <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/24107491/black-ops-6-reveal-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision Blizzard</a> on June 9, for the Black Ops 6 Campaign reveal, “Development on the&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>&nbsp;Campaign is led by Raven Software.”</p>



<p>It might surprise you to know this was also the case for Black Ops Cold War. Raven handled the Campaign, whereas Treyarch focused its efforts on the Zombies and seasonal multiplayer content. The companies decided if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Everything you feel and experience in Black Ops 6’s Campaign is the direct result of Raven Software’s tireless efforts and creativity—and I’m not complaining as we got the unbelievable Emergence mission!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-black-ops-6-zombies">Who Made Black Ops 6 Zombies?</h2>



<p><strong>Black Ops 6 Zombies is being handled by Treyarch</strong>—and this includes the two current maps, as well as subsequent maps arriving in the future.</p>



<p>Treyarch’s Zombies portion of Vanguard was notoriously shallow, but this is only because of a stunted development time which forced the company to strip back the popular game mode. Now, in Black Ops 6, proper round-based Zombies is back. Powerful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapons</a>—including the monstrously powerful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ray Gun</a>—and fun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-super-hero-easter-egg-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter Eggs</a> all feature prominently.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-black-ops-6-multiplayer">Who Made Black Ops 6 Multiplayer?</h2>



<p><strong>Treyarch is also handling the Black Ops 6 online multiplayer component</strong>, meaning they handle everything from gameplay balancing to new content to the maintenance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-black-ops-6-servers-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a double-barrel effort from Treyarch, but as 20-plus-year veterans, it should have no problem balancing Zombies and multiplayer. It had no problem doing this with Black Ops Cold War, so we should have a bright year ahead of us.</p>

With a positive critical response to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> now safely tucked under its belt, BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> project director Michael Gamble has reflected on some of the differences between the studio's two upcoming projects.
</p>
<p>
Unlike Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which hits shops later this week, Mass Effect 5 will not seek to tweak the sci-fi franchise's established visual style, he said.
</p>
<p>
"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it," Gamble wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1850999886763983193">post</a> on X. 
</p>
<p>
"Both are from the studio, but Mass Effect is Mass Effect. How you bring a sci-fi RPG to life is different than other genres or IPs," he continued, "and has to have different kinds of love."
</p>

<p>
Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese praised The Veilguard's divisive new graphical style in our review of the game, noting how BioWare seemed to be "aiming for something closer to an animated film in appearance". 
</p>
<p>
"It really works," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>, noting how in particular it enhances facial gestures and helps draw out "the inherent fantasy and emotion in scenes and environments".
</p>
<p>
As for Mass Effect 5's tone, Gamble wrote it would "maintain the mature tone of the original Trilogy. This is all I'm going to say for now."
</p>
<p>
The obvious point of comparison here is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a>, the franchise's fourth main entry that was primarily developed by BioWare's now-shuttered Montreal team. This entry took a chattier, more youthful and adventurous tone than the sci-fi series' first three games - perhaps to be expected, considering the increasingly dire stakes and wartorn backdrop there. Still, the change was not well received.
</p><p>
But word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">Mass Effect 5, or whatever it ends up being called</a>, will feel closer to the original trilogy of games is not a surprise. We know from years of teases that BioWare's return to the franchise will pick up the story of the original trilogy's Milky Way galaxy many centuries later, and see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">the return of at least one familiar face</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for when Mass Effect 5 might arrive, BioWare has not yet said. Perhaps we might hear more on 7th November, the series' annual N7 Day fan celebration, when BioWare typically drops new information.

            <p>Two N64  games have now been added to the Mature app of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok-2-seeds-of-evil">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</a> and Shadow Man are both available right now for subscribers with the Expansion Pack.</p>
<p>Both games were known for their blood and gore - unusual on Nintendo's system - hence their inclusion in the Mature app, alongside shooters Perfect Dark and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok-dinosaur-hunter">Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</a>.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Mature app is a separate download away from the main N64 app.</p>
<p>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil was, of course, the follow-up to the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok">Turok</a> game, in which players shoot dinosaurs with a variety of outlandishly gruesome weapons.</p>
<p>Shadow Man, meanwhile, was based on the comic book series of the same name, following a voodoo warrior with the ability to visit the land of the dead.</p>

A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-shadowman-game-in-the-works-21-years-after-the-last">new game in the Shadow Man series</a> is also in the works.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia.1021752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Spider dislikers, your concerns have been noted. At least by Capcom, anyway. The developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> are including an option in the upcoming beast-skinning action RPG that will turn all arachnid style monsters into something much less creepy and/or crawly. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The spider-free option was spotted by players of the PlayStation Plus beta test (as noticed <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-features-an-accessibility-mode-for-players-who-fear-spiders-and-insects/">by Automaton</a>). It's called "Arachnophobia assistance" in the accessibility options, and reads: "Adjusts the appearance of multi-legged creatures such as arachnids, insect-like small monsters, and endemic life." The description also notes that it won't alter the difficulty or "creature movements". </p>
<p>So how does it deal with eight-legged monsters? They <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029-39053-001.jpg">become slimes</a>, of course. As Automaton note, so far only small monsters appear to be accounted for. It's not clear how larger monsters with spider-like legs will be altered, if at all. What even counts as "spider-like" anyway? When your game is full of hybrid creatures that take inspiration from all sorts of wildlife, that line where a phobia kicks in may be hard to define. </p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is not the first game to do this sort of thing. Even this week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> came out with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">an arachnophobia mode in its zombies campaign</a>. Meanwhile, shrunken survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> has an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-groundeds-arachnophobia-mode-turns-creepy-spiders-into-cute-blobs">extensive arachnophobia mode</a> that lets you disable or enable every individual element of what makes a spider scary. You can get rid of the legs but keep the fangs, for example. Or just turn it into a harmless pair of spheres. </p><p>The PC beta for Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-beta-launches-this-month-with-a-character-editor-and-co-op-multiplayer">isn't arriving on Steam until October 31st</a>, so we won't be able to investigate the monstrous wilderness ourselves just yet. But if you do play, you'll be able to import your character when the full game releases on February 28th next year (actual progression through the game's opening chapter will not be saved though, say Capcom).  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
