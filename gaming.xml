            <p>
Sumo Group, the parent company of Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Texas Chain Saw Massacre developer Sumo Digital, has announced plans to reduce its workforce by up to 15 percent, putting nearly 270 employees across the UK, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, and India at risk.
</p>
<p>
"Whilst Sumo has been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced," the company <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2024/sumo-group-update/">wrote</a>, "we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward."
</p>
<p>
To that end, Sumo has made "the difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways", which "unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support". While Sumo says it has considered "every alternate route to limit the impact to our people", it confirms up to 15 percent of employees in the UK, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, and India (from a workforce of 1,790 according to <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/">its website</a>) will be affected.

After ten years of waiting, BioWare is finally blowing the lid off the fourth entry in its fantasy RPG series. The studio put out a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">cinematic trailer</a></span> showcasing the game’s party members during the Xbox Showcase, and released a gameplay trailer that showed off 20-minutes of in-game footage. There’s a lot to sift through, but here are some big takeaways from the past week of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> reveals.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-recommend-id="image://7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Veilguard combat encounter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Veilguard combat encounter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-recommend-id="image://7176fe9a5ca4d1e30ea51b482caac94c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Veilguard combat encounter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Straight up, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is the hardest pivot to an action game the series has ever done. While <em>Dragon Age II</em> and <em>Inquisition</em> tried to blend the tactical combat of <em>Origins </em>with real-time action, <em>The Veilguard </em>forgoes any notion of doing that in favor of something that resembles a character action game like <em>God of War</em>. It looks <em>really</em> solid as an action game, at least. But your mileage may vary on if that’s what you’re looking for out of a new <em>Dragon Age </em>game.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-recommend-id="image://4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-recommend-id="image://4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While there’s a focus on real-time action this time around, you will still have abilities to use, cooldowns to manage, and a way to pause the action as you sort through which of those you want to use. <em>The Veilguard </em>will have its own equivalent of the <em>Mass Effect </em>combat wheel that lets you stop the fight, pick an ability, aim it at the baddie of your choice, and fire it off. The wheel we saw in the gameplay trailer had nine ability slots, but it appears that you’ll be able to tab over to another wheel similar to previous games.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-recommend-id="image://e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-recommend-id="image://e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first three <em>Dragon Age </em>games let you have three party members with you at all times. That won’t be the case in <em>The Veilguard</em>. In keeping with the aforementioned <em>Mass Effect</em>-ification of things, <em>The Veilguard </em>will only let you have two companions by your side at once. This will naturally affect party composition and strategies, but if <em>The Veilguard </em>keeps the series’ beloved party banter, it will change how those conversations play out as it will often be between only two characters.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-recommend-id="image://db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-recommend-id="image://db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given <em>The Veilguard</em>’s focus on Solas, the party-member-turned-antagonist from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, it’s not a surprise that The Inquisitor, the protagonist from the 2014 RPG, will be returning. Players will be able to customize the appearance of The Inquisitor similar to how they did <em>Dragon Age II </em>protagonist Hawke in the last game. We don’t know yet what their role will be, but it’s at least good to know they’ll be around for the conclusion of the story they started ten years ago, even though I would argue they should have been the protagonist of <em>The Veilguard</em>, but I digress.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-recommend-id="image://31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-recommend-id="image://31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While BioWare has yet to publicly show <em>The Veilguard</em>’s character creator, <em>Kotaku</em> saw a glimpse of it at Summer Game Fest, and it has some real depth to it. You can play as four races: Human, Dwarf, Elf, and Qunari, and it will have sliders to change your body type. BioWare confirmed that even if you make your Rook a short king, the team has done work to ensure animations fit any character build. You’ll also be able to pick Rook’s pronouns, as well as their origin based on what faction they come from. This includes the Shadow Dragons, Grey Wardens, Antivan Crows, Lords of Fortune, Mourn Watch, and the Veil Jumpers. Each of these orders has a distinct place in <em>Dragon Age </em>lore and whichever one you pick will affect how some characters interact with you and open up new dialogue options. Like <em>Inquisition</em>, <em>The Veilguard </em>will have four voice options, two with British accents and two with American ones.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-recommend-id="image://5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-recommend-id="image://5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>BioWare has become synonymous with importing choices from old games into new ones, but it’s been ten years since the last <em>Dragon Age</em>. As such, the studio is changing how it’s approaching bringing those choices across games. <em>The Veilguard </em>will allow you to pick what big decisions you made in the old games in its character creator, rather than importing an old save from <em>Inquisition</em>. This also means it won’t draw from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ages-save-file-solution-lets-you-rewrite-your-h-1217092939&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ages-save-file-solution-lets-you-rewrite-your-h-1217092939">Dragon Age Keep</a></span>, a browser app that lets you craft world states to import into <em>Inquisition</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-recommend-id="image://5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook picking a dialogue option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook picking a dialogue option." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-recommend-id="image://5004a09b1ba7fc2df6fe274a5493b32c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook picking a dialogue option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Veilguard </em>is bringing back <em>Dragon Age 2</em>s dialogue system, which was tone-based and resulted in its protagonist Hawke falling into one of three different personality states. You have three general tones in a conversation: kind, humorous, or aggressive, with slight variations depending on the situation. This dialogue system was interesting in the 2011 RPG because it would shape Hawke’s personality, even in scenes where you weren’t directly picking a dialogue option. We’ll see how <em>The Veilguard </em>handles it, but I will miss <em>Inquisition</em>’s less codified approach.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="560d3b40cb081a20caa15a2e0f6eb8bf" data-recommend-id="image://560d3b40cb081a20caa15a2e0f6eb8bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="560d3b40cb081a20caa15a2e0f6eb8bf" data-recommend-id="image://560d3b40cb081a20caa15a2e0f6eb8bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>BioWare has been adamant that changing this game’s name from <em>Dreadwolf </em>to <em>The Veilguard </em>has been in service of better representing the party-focused story it tells. That shift in messaging has been pretty apparent since the cinematic trailer put a spotlight on all seven companions who will join Rook on their quest. We’ve got a breakdown of what we know about all seven characters <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857">right here</a></span>, and some of them have appeared in other <em>Dragon Age </em>media like books and comics.

<p>With the ongoing Steam Next Fest, which allows players a chance to download and check out various demos for upcoming games, folks find themselves drawn to Once Human. It was the first demo downloaded, and I’m finding it absolutely fantastic. But there’s a question in the air. Is Once Human Early Access?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-once-human-early-access-or-full-release">Is Once Human Early Access or Full Release?</h2>



<p>When Once Human officially releases on <strong>July 9</strong>, it will do so as a full-release title. Unlike most other survival-crafting games on the market today, the upcoming open-world survival shooter will not launch into Early Access. </p>



<p>It’s a fresh take and one we’re wholly open to. The current gameplay is satisfying, the creature designs are phenomenal, and, with a little more polish, it’ll prove itself as a long-term survival game for fans of the genre!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-survive-in-once-human">How to Survive in Once Human</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Starry Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you first dive into Once Human, either in the beta during Steam Next Fest or upon launch in early July, you’ll find the prologue rather welcoming. It does a fantastic job of smoothly introducing you to the gameplay mechanics, loot, and overall story beats. But then you’re thrust into the open world alongside a magical crow and told to survive. Here are a few tips:</p>



<ul>
<li>While you won’t die of hunger or thirst immediately upon touching down, it’s a wise move to keep food and water in your inventory for when times get tough. After all, this is a survival game. You require both to operate at peak efficiency.</li>



<li>While playing on a PvE server, don’t be afraid to make a friend or two. You can group up to tackle challenging points of interest, share loot, or even build a small community together in the open world. Even better is you can ask for help!</li>



<li>Your starting crossbow is excellent at dealing with shambling zombies and Watchers, but you’ll require smoothing with more oomph before long. Do your best to seek out a better weapon, ideally a firearm, quickly!</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Alongside Once Human, there’s a handful of quality <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-next-fest-june-2024-10-games-you-need-to-check-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demos we recommend from Steam Next Fest</a>!

<p data-characters="282" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve gotten lucky and pulled <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sethos-builds-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sethos</a> in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, you might be wondering how he fits into your team. As an on-field Electro DPS character, Sethos’ kit is balanced around the Quicken and Aggravate reactions. Here are Sethos’ best Quicken teams to maximize his damage!</p> <h2 id="h-sethos-in-quicken-teams" data-injectable="false">Sethos in Quicken teams</h2> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">First, a brief <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-dendro-reactions-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overview</a> of Quicken and Aggravate reactions. When Electro and Dendro combine in any order, an enemy receives the Quicken status. This looks like a green lightning effect around the enemy. Hitting an enemy in this state with Electro attacks triggers Aggravate, which increases the attack’s damage.</p> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">Since Sethos relies on Quicken and Aggravate reactions, his best teams will feature Dendro teammates. You can supplement additional Electro or Anemo units, too, for additional damage and buffs.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-dendro-teammates-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Best Dendro teammates for Sethos</h2> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Sethos should be paired with <strong>at least one Dendro teammate</strong> in order to maintain the Quicken status on enemies. Off-field Dendro application is particularly important, since Sethos will want to stay on-field <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-sethos-in-genshin-impact-normal-vs-charged-attack-playstyles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using either Normal or Charged Attacks</a>. The best Dendro teammates for Sethos are:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Nahida</strong> – Provides high off-field Dendro application and damage.</li> <li><strong>Dendro Traveler</strong> – Provides good off-field Dendro application, but less damage than Nahida.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhu</a></strong> – Has less Dendro application, but still good enough, and provides healing.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yaoyao-healer-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoyao</a></strong> – Budget Baizhu.</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-other-teammates-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Other teammates for Sethos</h2> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Once you have your Dendro unit(s) picked out, fill in the empty slots on your team with some flex picks. Try a second Electro character who can deal off-field damage. Some examples include:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a></strong> – Provides energy and significant off-field Electro damage.</li> <li><strong>Yae Miko</strong> – Deals off-field Electro damage.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">You can also add an Anemo teammate holding the 4pc Viridescent Venerer artifact set. This set reduces enemies’ Electro RES, causing Sethos to deal more damage. Any Anemo unit can work here, but the best Anemo teammates for Sethos are:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Sucrose</strong> – Grants Elemental Mastery buffs.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kazuha-builds-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuha</a></strong> – Increases your team’s Electro DMG.</li> <li><strong>Jean, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xianyun-support-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xianyun</a>, or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sayu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sayu</a></strong> – Provide healing.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Certain Geo characters also work well with Sethos. There is an opportunity cost to using some of them, though, since Geo characters often do best in full Geo teams, not Quicken teams. Nevertheless, these Geo units can have a place in Sethos’ teams.</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-zhongli-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhongli</a></strong> – Provides a shield and reduces enemy RES to all elements.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-albedo-build-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Albedo</a> or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-chiori-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chiori</a></strong> – Deal off-field Geo damage at intervals.</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-example-teams-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Example teams for Sethos</h2> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Sethos – Fischl – Yaoyao – Sucrose</li> <li>Sethos – Fischl – Baizhu – Kazuha</li> <li>Sethos – Yae Miko – Nahida – Baizhu</li> <li>Sethos – Fischl – Nahida – Zhongli</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="202" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Niantic has revealed details for the upcoming <em>Pokemon GO</em> Scorching Steps event, which kicks off on June 21, 2024. The event will start at 10 am local time, and ends on June 25, 2024, at 8 pm local time.</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">During this event, <em>Pokemon GO</em> players will get to take advantage of a number of event bonuses and catch a variety of featured Pokemon. Here are all the event bonuses active during <em>Pokemon GO</em> Scorching Steps:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false"> <li>Twice the amount of candy from hatching eggs</li> <li>Half distance required to hatch eggs that are placed into incubators during the event</li> <li>The first three eggs will only require one-fourth distance to hatch when using the <em>Pokemon GO</em> egg hatching widget</li> <li>There will be an increased chance to encounter hatch Shiny Slugma and Shiny Litleo</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 id="h-featured-pokemon" data-injectable="false">Featured Pokemon</h2> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">As the event bonuses suggest, the <em>Pokemon GO</em> Scorching Steps revolves around egg hatching, and will reward players for hatching eggs during this event. Larvesta can be hatched from 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km eggs during this event. All other featured Pokemon can be hatched, depending on the egg and the distance required to hatch it. Here are all the Pokemon you can hatch through eggs during the event:</p> <p data-characters="9" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true"><strong>2 km eggs</strong></p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Growlithe</li> <li>Slugma</li> <li>Houndour</li> <li>Magby</li> <li>Larvesta</li> </ul> <p data-characters="9" data-current-count="209" data-injectable="false"><strong>5 km eggs</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"> <li>Hisuian Growlithe</li> <li>Darumaka</li> <li>Litwick</li> <li>Larvesta</li> <li>Litleo</li> <li>10 km eggs</li> <li>Larvesta</li> <li>Turtonator</li> <li>Charcadet</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">There are also event-themed field research tasks coming with this event, which will allow players to catch Slugma and Litleo by completing the tasks, and some players might be lucky enough to encounter Turtonator in the task rewards as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/rebel-moons-directors-cut-is-coming-with-a-new-title/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rebel-moons-directors-cut-is-coming-with-a-new-title<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="119" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Rebel Moon </em>director’s cut is coming to Netflix on August 2, and when it gets here, it will have a new name.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">Actually, it’ll have two new names. Zack Snyder took to social media today to unveil the release date for his extended double-feature as well as the fresh titles for each chapter of “Rebel Moon.”&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><em>Chalice of Blood </em>and <em>Curse of Forgiveness </em>are inevitably going to tell the same story as the PG-13 <em>Rebel Moon </em>movies, but fans are still going to have plenty of new things to see. Snyder told Variety that the new movies feature over an hour of extra content, and some of the new scenes were specifically held back until now. “We shot scenes just for the director’s cut,” Snyder said, adding, “So in that way, it’s really a revelation because it gives that second kick at the can for big fans.”</p>
 <p data-characters="757" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="false">The extra runtime will presumably flesh out the multiple worlds and characters that make up the core of <em>Rebel Moon</em>. The original <em>Child of Fire</em> had to introduce so many characters and concepts that the experience felt rushed, but that almost certainly won’t be the case with the new R-rated version. We’ll see how many people tune back in for these new versions. Both <em>Rebel Moon </em>movies were critical flops, and there might not be many people willing to sit back down for a longer version of the original experience, even if it does depict – as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-snyder-cut-is-on-the-way-later-this-year/1100-6524155/">official description states</a> – “the viciously sexier, bloodier world of <em>Rebel Moon</em>.” If it does well enough, maybe Snyder will get to make the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/latest-sci-fi-news-spielbergs-ufo-movie-for-all-mankind-renewed-and-rebel-moon-part-3/"><em>Rebel Moon 3</em> he’s apparently already plotted out</a>. </p>

            <p>I try to avoid describing video games in mathematical terms, but I can hardly avoid it here. Treasure Planet's flying galleons plus Spirited Away's bath house plus Spiritfarer's gentle building and management mechanics equals Hotel Galactic. Watch the trailer below and tell me I'm wrong.

<p>I'm not being reductive, right? Although it's not like Spiritfarer wasn't already channeling Ghibli.
</p>
<p>You build your hotel and design each room to cater to different kinds of guests, manage your staff by assigning actions and priorities, and seemingly form friendships with alien companions with special abilities and traits they can pass on to new joiners. 
</p>
<p>There's an implied villain at the end of the trailer above, although there's no real mention of potential conflict on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183670/Hotel_Galactic/">Hotel Galactic Steam page</a>. The closest it gets is a reference to a "spooky underground complex", in which you can discover "new materials, creatures and expand the construction space." Otherwise it's pitched as cosy from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>Hotel Galactic has no release date yet, but I'm intrigued. It'll apparently have a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/528325741/hotel-galactic-studio-ghibli-inspired-25d-inn-management">Kickstarter in July</a>, although whether that's to fund its existence, or polish, or something else, I don't know. In the meantime, let me do what YouTube did to me after I watched the trailer, and recommend Jenny Nicholson's latest video <a href="https://youtu.be/T0CpOYZZZW4?si=pG-I1fkZLA0NpIRF">on a different kind of galactic hotel</a>. I've watched all four hours of it twice.</p>

It was an exciting time for sure, but also a very busy time for the game industry. </p><p>With all these new trailers, teasers, announcements, and reveals, it’s likely you missed some of the coolest and biggest trailers from the last few days. If that’s the case, don’t worry, as we have cataloged the 16 best trailers from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">SGF 2024's wild weekend</a></span>. Here you go!</p></div></div><div><p>The Doom Slayer is back and this time he’s got a big shield, a gun that shoots skull fragments, and a cybernetic super dragon. In other words: <em>Dark Ages</em> looks awesome! We can’t wait to kill demons in <em>Dark Ages</em> when it arrives on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Lego and<em> Horizon: Forbidden West</em> make for a strange combo for sure. However, the announcement trailer for <em>Lego Horizon: Adventures</em> looked wonderful and fun. But perhaps the biggest surprise is that this odd spin-off is launching later this year on PS5, PC,<em> and Nintendo Switch. </em>Now that’s strange!</p></div><div><p>We are always down for a new retro-themed beat ‘em up with couch co-op options. Watching the trailer for<em> Rita’s Rewind </em>made us remember how great <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge </em>from 2022 was, and this new <em>Power Rangers</em> brawler looks to be a lot like that game. That’s a good thing! <em>Rita’s Rewind</em> is set to arrive in late 2024.</p></div><div><p>What happens if you toss <em>John Wick</em>-like combat, <em>GTA V</em> gameplay, and uh...a walking bean into a blender? You get a weird but cool-looking video game called <em>Killer Bean.</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/killer-bean-game-90s-just-cause-max-payne-roguelike-gta-1850757817&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/killer-bean-game-90s-just-cause-max-payne-roguelike-gta-1850757817">We’ve been following this indie game for a bit now</a></span> and the latest trailer once again got us excited to play as a gun-toting bean on a mission to take down a shadowy organization. <em>Killer Bean</em> arrives later this summer on PC. After it leaves early access, it’ll arrive on consoles, too.</p></div><div><p>We all were hoping for a new<em> Gears of War </em>game to be revealed during SGF 2024 and it happened, but it’s not <em>Gears 6</em>. Instead, we got a trailer for something new: <em>Gears of War: E-Day,</em> which is a prequel set about 14 years before the original game and which will focus on Marcus and Dom’s first adventure together. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-e-day-gears-6-ending-storyline-2025-1851528933&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-e-day-gears-6-ending-storyline-2025-1851528933">While I hope we eventually get a<em> Gears 6 </em>(and it sounds like we still might)</a></span>, I’m excited for the OG bros to return. No release date yet.</p></div><div><p>Sometimes it takes a while for a trailer to catch our attention. And then other times you see something like <em>Phoenix Springs</em>—a modern spin on the classic point-and-click genre—and you immediately want to play it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/21&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/21"><em>Phoenix Springs</em></a></span> has a fantastic and instantly captivating lithographic-like art style that just pops off this screen. If this looks cool to you, good news: It’s out soon. <em>Phoenix Springs</em> arrives on September 16, 2024.</p></div><div><p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was not only a really good game, it’s also one of the biggest and most successful titles ever published by Capcom. So it’s not surprising to see the sequel, <em>Wilds</em>, going bigger as Capcom likely has a lot of faith in this upcoming game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-state-of-play-1851510565&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-state-of-play-1851510565">The new <em>Monster Hunter: Wilds</em> trailer looks epic</a></span> and we can’t wait to hunt new and old monsters in 2025 on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div><div><p><em>Astro’s Playroom </em>was a free pack-in for the PS5 meant mainly to showcase the new controller and features of the console. However, the cute platformer ended up being one of the best games for the next-gen console and Sony has thankfully realized that Astro Bot deserves a whole video game. The first trailer for this new game looks amazing, featuring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540">a ton of PlayStation Easter eggs</a></span> for old and younger fans alike.</p></div><div><p><em>UFO50 </em>was announced back in 2017. So it’s hard to believe that it’s finally, for real, almost here. But it is and the latest trailer for this 50-game retro-inspired anthology from the folks behind <em>Spelunky</em> (and a bunch of other devs) has us counting down the days until September 18. Then we can dive in and check out all the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/7">various games included in <em>UFO50</em></a></span> on PC.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span> was one of the best games released in 2023. It was spooky, looked great, had a wild story, and featured some of the best cutscenes we’ve seen in a horror game. So you can bet we were all hooting and hollering when we saw the first trailer for “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-dlc-night-springs-canon-1851525597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-dlc-night-springs-canon-1851525597">Night Springs,” a new DLC expansion for <em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span> featuring three episodes starring three different characters.

Now that we’ve seen some actual gameplay of <em>South of Midnight</em>, we are even more excited to play this action-adventure game set in the bayou of the American South. I mean, come on, did you see that giant talking catfish? How can we <em>not </em>be excited to play this in 2025 when it arrives on Xbox and PC?</p></div><div><p>None of us were expecting to be blown away by a new<em> Perfect Dark</em> game in 2024. And yet, here we are! The new re-reveal of this game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-xbox-is-getting-a-new-perfect-dark-1845855765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-xbox-is-getting-a-new-perfect-dark-1845855765">which was first announced in 2020</a></span>, showcases a fast-paced, first-person espionage-focused shooter with some cool parkour and rad gadgets. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864">If the full game is even half as fun as this trailer</a></span>, Xbox might have a hit on its hands when<em> Perfect Dark</em> eventually launches.</p></div><div><p>It’s been about a decade since the last <em>Dragon Age</em> game, <em>Inquisition</em>, so there was a lot of pressure on EA and Bioware’s big reveal of the next main entry in the RPG series. And while some fans may not like some of the changes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469">including the worse name</a></span>, the overall reaction to the new RPG and its focus on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">new and returning characters and their relationships</a></span> has been positive. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is set to launch in fall 2024.</p></div><div><p>Blumhouse, the studio behind a lot of popular horror films including <em>M3gan</em> and <em>Get Out</em>, is getting into the video game business. And its not starting with just one horror game. Instead, Blumhouse arrived at Summer Game Fest with its own mini-showcase featuring <em>six</em> different spooky video games. All of them look different and interesting. </p><p>The people at <em>Kotaku </em>brave enough to play scary games are very excited to check out these Blumhouse titles in the future. The others are hiding behind us and will eventually open their eyes again.</p></div><div><p>It might be hard for some to get excited about a new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game after Ubisoft has made so damn many of them, but this latest entry—set in Japan and starring two main characters—looks like it might be shaking things up just enough to win back some players. </p><p>Something we really appreciated in the new gameplay trailer was how different the two characters played and the large focus on stealth options. You can go prone, hide in the water, and take out lights to create shadows. We don’t have to wait too long to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer-ubisoft-1851530851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer-ubisoft-1851530851"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span><em> </em>as it arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 15.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Modern game remakes typically replace the cast voices for a new generation, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is bucking that trend by maintaining the original voiceover recordings, including David Hayter as Naked Snake. However, there will be a handful of new lines that were recorded for the remake according to series producer Noriaki Okamura.</p><p>"We're using all the original voice performances, but there are some lines where characters teach you the controls that really don't match anymore," said Okamura through an interpreter while appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase Deep Dive podcast</a>. "So we actually did get the original actors to re-record just those. Plus, back then, twenty years ago, we actually had to compress the voice acting down a lot to fill all that audio. Today, we aren't as limited. We don't have to compromise as much on formats and compression, so we can actually have those performances in even higher quality."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HDCppzRLwpw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>During the interview, Okamura touched upon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-will-let-you-play-the-game-with-its-original-ancient-controls/1100-6524131/" data-ref-id="1100-6524131">the updated and classic controls for Metal Gear Solid Delta</a>, as well as Konami's decision to move forward with this remake before tackling another take on the original Metal Gear Solid. He also explained why Delta is in the title.</p><p>"Delta is a Greek letter, and the original meaning is something like change or difference," noted Okamura. "But it also means to change the quantity of something without changing the composition or character. That's the core concept for the title. Not different, but more. So we chose to represent that in the title."</p><p>Konami hasn't set a launch date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but it is expected to be released later this year on or PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

<p data-characters="350" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Any time a new <em>Call of Duty</em> entry drops, the one question on everyone’s mind is, “How many gigs will this file need?” The franchise has been known to take up a substantial amount of space, especially with the introduction of <em>CoD </em>HQ. So, if you’re wondering about the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-directors-hope-omnimovement-will-become-a-new-standard-not-just-for-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a></em> install size, here’s what you can expect.</p> <h2 id="h-how-many-gigs-is-black-ops-6" data-injectable="false">How many gigs is Black Ops 6?</h2> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">As of now, Activision has yet to provide a definitive answer on the <em>Black Ops 6</em> storage size. However, what we do know is that the speculated 300GB file size is not a confirmed figure for the full release. The <em>Call of Duty</em> Updates page has clarified this, stating that the estimated storage space on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-pre-order-cod-black-ops-6-all-editions-and-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>BO6’s</em> pre-order</a> site is not an accurate reflection of the actual download size.</p> <figure data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a></p><p>Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</p><p>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone…</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>

It’s important to note that you can download </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Black Ops 6</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> as a standalone game without the necessity of having the other titles. </span></p> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">Based on the file sizes of previous games, we can try to estimate the <em>Black Ops 6</em> file size. For example, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a> </em>Multiplayer and Campaign Packs are about 58GB. On the other hand, my install size currently sits at a whopping 200GB due to other patches like <em>Warzone</em> and <em>MW2</em>. This suggests that if you want the full <em>Black Ops 6</em> experience, you may need to set aside a significant amount of storage space.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">We can also look at past <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-call-of-duty-black-ops-game-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops</a> </em>iterations to get another rough install size for the sixth entry. While <em>BO4 </em>requires a minimum space of 42.35 GB, <em>Black Ops Cold War </em>needs at least 312 GB (shown in the PlayStation Store). Although the <em>Cold War </em>download is pretty hefty, you can lower it by removing specific modes.</p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">By considering these numbers, I suggest having 100GB or even 200GB to play it safe. Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-the-black-ops-6-beta-early-access-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Black Ops 6</em> Beta</a> file size will be much lower than this, as these patches are roughly 27GB. Whatever the case may be, we’ll make sure to update this guide as more information becomes available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24175240/summer-game-fest-2024-best-trailers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Summer Game Fest can be hard to keep track of. The sprawling event is spread out across several days, ranging from blockbuster keynotes like SGF Live and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173601/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-microsoft">the Xbox Games Showcase</a> to smaller indie focused streams like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171195/devolver-digital-direct-2024-summer-game-fest-news-trailers">Devolver Direct</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best">Day of the Devs</a>. Some games even have their own dedicated showcases. That means there’s a lot to see, which also means it’s tough to see it all. So we’ve combed through each event and pulled out the best trailers to give you a good overview of what went down and what the next few months of video game releases will look like.</p><p><h4><em>Alan Wake 2: Night Springs</em></h4></p><p>Not only did Remedy show off the first expansion for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, but the studio also launched it: so if you’re interested in the very <em>Twin Peaks</em>-inspired new storylines (which include lots of coffee), you can play them right now.</p><p><h4><em>Arranger</em></h4></p><p>A puzzle game crossed with an RPG, <em>Arranger</em> is about, well, arranging things. It also looks incredible, with visuals from<em> Braid</em> artist David Hellman.</p><p><h4><em>Avowed</em></h4></p><div><p>We might not know exactly when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175155/avowed-might-launch-on-november-12th">this fantasy RPG from Obsidian will launch</a>, but it’s certainly shaping up to be a worthy follow-up to <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>.</p></div><p><h4><em>Cairn</em></h4></p><p>Despite how stressful mountain climbing can be, <em>Cairn</em> looks almost cozy in this new trailer, in which a climber goes an adventure to be the first to reach a summit.</p><p><h4><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></h4></p><p>The sequel to a tabletop-style cyberpunk RPG, the next <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> puts players in the role of an escaped android in a stolen ship, who also happens to have no memory. No pressure.</p><p><h4><em>Civilization 7</em></h4></p><p>As a teaser, this clip doesn’t show all that much, but it does confirm that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173575/civilization-7-summer-game-fest-2k-firaxis-trailer"><em>Civilization 7</em> is coming next year</a>, which is more than enough.</p><p><h4><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h4></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172041/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Doom</em> meets dark fantasy</a>, which means not only medieval-inspired weaponry but also apparently a mech suit and a dragon you can fly on. It looks as brutal as ever, though.</p><p><h4><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></h4></p><div><p>Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172872/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reveal">getting a new name</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware">next <em>Dragon Age</em></a> got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176005/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-summer-game-fest-2024">its first gameplay trailer</a> that gave a deep dive into the early moments of the upcoming RPG.</p></div><p><h4><em>Fear the Spotlight</em></h4></p><p>Blumhouse Games made its debut at SGF, and one of its first games is a PSOne-inspired survival horror title that looks delightfully retro. It’s shaping up to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">a good year for old-school horror</a>.</p><p><h4><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></h4></p><p>The best way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer">introduce a new <em>Gears</em> game</a> is with the classic “Mad World” by Gary Jules. The next entry in the franchise will be a prequel, which makes the callback very fitting.</p><p><h4><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></h4></p><p>Sony didn’t have much of a presence at the event, but the company did reveal <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24172801/lego-horizon-adventures-ps5-trailer-summer-game-fest">a Lego version of <em>Horizon</em></a><em> </em>that makes the post-apocalypse playful.</p><p><h4><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></h4></p><p>It’s not surprising that a new <em>Life is Strange</em> is in the works, but it’s nice to hear that <em>Double Exposure</em> will bring back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">original hero Max</a>.</p><p><h4><em>Lok Digital</em></h4></p><p>What makes this word game particularly unique is that it involves discovering a new language as you solve puzzles, which each have a strange effect on the world.</p><p><h4><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></h4></p><p>Developed by an all-star cast of former <em>Persona</em> creators, <em>Metaphor</em> looks like it will be taking all of the style of that RPG series and translating it directly to a new fantasy universe.</p><p><h4><em>Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</em></h4></p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">The retro experts at Digital Eclipse</a> are crafting a side-scrolling Power Rangers beat ‘em up that looks like a long-lost arcade classic.</p></div><p><h4><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></h4></p><div><p>It’s tough to follow-up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019">a massive, series-altering hit like <em>Monster Hunter: World</em></a>, but the next <em>MonHun</em> looks like it’ll build on its predecessor in some exciting ways.</p></div><p><h4><em>Neva</em></h4></p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming"><em>Gris</em> is one of the prettiest games I’ve ever played</a>, and it turns out a way to make it even prettier is by adding a wolf companion in the follow-up <em>Neva</em>.</p></div><p><h4><em>Perfect Dark</em></h4></p><p>Years after it was first announced, we finally got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24174839/perfect-dark-reboot-xbox-microsoft">our first glimpse of <em>Perfect Dark</em> gameplay</a>. The futuristic spy thriller is a co-production between The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics.</p><p><h4><em>Possessor(s)</em></h4></p><p>It’s from the creators of <em>Hyper Light</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820899/solar-ash-impressions-annapurna-interactive-heart-machine"><em>Solar Ash</em></a>, so you know the action will be excellent in this 2D side-scroller about escaping a “sprawling, flooded city overrun with surreal interdimensional horror.”</p><p><h4><em>Screenbound</em></h4></p><p>I’ve watched this trailer a few times, and I still can’t wrap my head around <em>Screenbound</em>’s mixture of 2D and 3D gameplay. But it seems confusing in a good way.</p><p><h4><em>Skate</em></h4></p><p>This doesn’t show much of the game, but the Tim Robinson-led video does imply that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23207209/skate-free-to-play-developers-interview-ea">the next <em>Skate</em></a> will be a lot funnier and weirder than I anticipated.</p><p><h4><em>Slitterhead</em></h4></p><p>The bizarrely-named horror game comes straight from the mind of <em>Silent Hill</em> creator Keiichiro Toyama, which explains just how disturbing this new trailer is. </p><p><h4><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></h4></p><div><p>There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172134/star-wars-outlaws-trailer-ubisoft-forward-2024">a lot of footage of Ubisoft’s open-world <em>Star Wars</em> game</a>, and thankfully most of it focused on the <em>GTA</em>-style gameplay.</p></div><p><h4><em>Starfield: Shattered Space</em></h4></p><p>More than a year out from launch, many <em>Starfield</em> players are looking for something new to explore — and it looks like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172097/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-xbox-bethesda-release-date-trailer-date">the game’s first major expansion</a> will deliver just that.</p><p><h4><em>Tenjutsu</em></h4></p><p>This brutal, pixelated action game calls to mind <em>Hotline Miami</em>, only you play as a “renegade yakuza.” Even more impressive: it’s the work of a one-person development studio.</p><p><h4><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></h4></p><p>This trailer for the slapstick comedy game reveals an August 1st release date but, more importantly, confirms that Matt Berry will be featured.</p><p><h4><em>Wanderstop</em></h4></p><p>This seems like a cozy little tea shop simulator about a retired warrior, but the end of <em>Wanderstop</em>’s reveal trailer implies that there’s something more sinister at work.</p><p><h4><em>While Waiting</em></h4></p><p>If you have the patience to make it this far into this list, your reward is... a game about being patient.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="62UQpi">The Pacific Northwest is <em>creepy</em>.</p>
<p id="rsWePZ">From the dark forests of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23932094/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, to the ghostly radios of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23791491/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-release-date"><em>Oxenfree</em></a><em>,</em> to the absolute freaks who populate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/7/8/21316347/deadly-premonition-2-review-switch"><em>Deadly Premonition</em></a><em>, </em>so many games set in the ol’ Pacific Northwest give it that <em>weird sauce</em>.</p>
<p id="6Es77m">This trend of Weird Pacific Northwest exists outside of games too — from quirky characters in <em>Portlandia</em> to the terrifyingly wet environment of <em>The Ring</em>.</p>
<p id="fykuv1">I wanted to know why that is, so I started looking.</p>
<p id="wvQMQ2">I came up with 122 games, mostly set in Washington (go Huskies). After whittling it down to 35, the themes of Pacific Northwest Bingo started to clarify.</p>

<p id="gUGiFF">Sixteen games were what I would describe as “creepy;” 22 of them have a supernatural element, and others emphasize survival and nature. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/28/21084016/coffee-talk-game-ps4-xbox-one-pc-nintendo-switch-impressions">One is set in a coffee shop</a>. And quite a few are mysteries.</p>
<p id="ABjwKq">But these trends didn’t <em>start </em>with video games.</p>
<p id="leLnny">Long before games made the Pacific Northwest weird, TV and movies were carving that trail, and the most notable is probably <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23434855/twin-peaks-november-lets-go"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a>.</p>
<p id="vFHZ5x">It’s me, the <em>Twin Peaks</em> enjoyer. I’ve logged on.</p>
<p id="phOrsZ">David Lynch’s soapy, surreal murder mystery debuted in April 1990, and became the blueprint for a lot of water-cooler shows today.</p>
<p id="noDGhs">On the surface, Twin Peaks is quaint and safe. But gradually, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23298759/twin-peaks-movie-fire-walk-with-me-anniversary-criterion">a seedy underbelly</a> of gambling, sex trafficking, and drug running is revealed — to say nothing of the actual crime that instigates the whole show. Alongside all <em>that</em>, the supernatural goes from implied, to <em>very</em> real and dangerous.</p>
<p id="D4OBis">It’s hard, if not impossible, to talk about Pacific Northwest media without talking about <em>Twin Peaks</em>. But the story runs deeper than that. Along the way I spoke with Stephen Groening, associate professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Washington, about how influential <em>Twin Peaks</em> really was — and what Washington state is like now, after decades of entrenchment from companies like Amazon and Microsoft.</p>
<p id="Lbobz1">I also spoke with Alex Dracott, creative director and studio head of Ironwood Studios, the outfit behind <em>Pacific Drive</em>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24079882/pacific-drive-review-steam-pc-playstation-5"><em>Pacific Drive</em> is a gritty, complex game</a> where the player drives a busted old sedan through the Olympic Peninsula — albeit an Olympic Peninsula besieged by strange, deadly anomalies after an experiment gone wrong.</p>

  <p id="ZSOcYw">The developers at Nightdive Studios have quickly become one of the greatest forces for game preservation by optimizing classic games for modern systems, giving them a fresh coat of paint, and updating them with modern quality-of-life features to be enjoyed by a new generation of players.</p>
<p id="bIb0px">If you’d like to see what Nightdive has accomplished in bringing some of your favorite FPS classics into the modern era, check out the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/polygon/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/fully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters?hmb_source=&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/___pl__p_23940205__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/fully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters?hmb_source=\u0026hmb_medium=product_tile\u0026hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;hmb_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hmb_medium&quot;:&quot;product_tile&quot;,&quot;hmb_campaign&quot;:&quot;mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle&quot;,&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23940205__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Nightdive FPS Remaster bundle</a> at Humble. While this $19.99 bundle doesn’t include the more recent remasters of <em>System Shock</em> and <em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>, virtually every other FPS Nightdive has retouched is included (a $154 value).</p>

<p id="sX3xry">Some of these remastered titles, like <em>Powerslave</em>, <em>Forsaken</em>, and <em>Rise of the Triad</em>, are a bit dated and difficult to revisit, even in their remastered states.

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24176073/skate-4-summer-game-fest-2024-update-socks-tim-robinson</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we%E2%80%99re-finally-getting-details-on-skate-4-%E2%80%94-including-custom-socks-and-tim-robinson.898470/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176073/skate-4-summer-game-fest-2024-update-socks-tim-robinson<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3fiTlI">The fourth game in EA’s cult skateboarding series — formerly known as <em>Skate 4</em>, now simply called <em>Skate</em> — is finally starting to come into focus, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/18/21296386/skate-4-ea-its-happening">four years after it was announced</a>... in a manner of speaking. Fittingly for a game which took an unusual route to becoming a reality, and which is quite a departure from its predecessors, EA is also tackling the marketing for the game a little bit differently.</p>
<p id="txcPiM">Instead of a flashy trailer highlighting the new game’s features, EA confused and delighted everyone by dropping a live-action sketch starring <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23737241/every-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-ranked-best-to-worst-itysl"><em>I Think You Should Leave</em></a>’s Tim Robinson into Friday’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173215/summer-game-fest-announcements-trailers-2024">Sumer Game Fest stream</a>. In the skit, Robinson plays Richie Dandle, an executive at M-Corp, the fictional corporation that previously owned and ran the city of San Vansterdam in which <em>Skate </em>is set. Robinson denies that M-Corp is leaving San Vansterdam while employees flee, cry, and shred documents behind him. (M-Corp is probably the new iteration of the tyrannical Mongocorp, which ran the city of San Vanelona in <em>Skate 2</em>. Yes, these skating games have lore.) Anyway, the video’s pretty funny, you should watch it.</p>
<div id="NhN4gj"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCM3EfAz8FY?rel=0&amp;start=1" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="MhZzk4">This is all great fun, and backed up by an official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-story-so-far">story so far</a> blog post as well as a gloriously dated <a href="https://themcorpwebsite.com/welcome">M-Corp website</a>. But what about the, you know, game?</p>
<p id="cEh2Q3">Fortunately, the developers at Full Circle, a remote-only game studio formed by EA specifically to make <em>Skate</em>, followed up the Robinson sketch by lifting the lid on the current state of the game in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/2024-development-update">blog post</a> and accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_877568xsPg">development update video</a>. <em>Skate</em>, as previously announced, will be a free-to-play, live-service skating MMO for PC and console. It doesn’t have a release date yet.</p>
<p id="4M3zVo">There’s quite a lot of detail in the post and video, none of it all that surprising; Full Circle is iterating on the Skate series’ signature “flick-it” control scheme using new physics and animation technologies, and going big on player customization. One of the most exciting tidbits is a “quick drop” system that gives players the freedom to customise the city itself, adding rails to a balcony to enhance its trick potential. You can do this in multiplayer in real time, and then challenge other players to try out your creations: Throwdowns are a way to instantly challenge other skaters as they roam around the deserted city turned giant skate park.</p>
<p id="i5PCLv">Elsewhere, much is made of the fact that players will now be able to customize the color of their socks (I’m guessing this is a top request among fans), and Full Circle promises that the game will constantly evolve over time, with new areas opening up, and new music being added to the soundtrack, too. The studio is actively appealing for new playtesters to help with development, and says it will be expanding from PC to console playtests later this year.</p>
<p id="HWD6LK">The Skate series seemed to have been consigned to history after <em>Skate 3</em> came out in 2010. But, starting around 2014, that game found a surprise second life on YouTube, as creators exploited its wild ragdoll physics for comedy. In 2016, it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/10/13587630/skate-3-xbox-one-backward-compatibility">made playable on Xbox again</a>. A fan campaign for a sequel built up steam and was finally rewarded by the announcement of <em>Skate </em>in 2020.</p>
<p id="rftPsJ"><em>Skate </em>may not be quite the game fans were expecting, and it remains to be seen whether EA’s decision to build it back as a free-to-play live-service game is a mercenary business move, or a smart way to serve this passionate audience. But <em>Skate </em>doesn’t look like much else out there, and that’s something.</p>

On crime-hub planet Mirogana, neon signs inject bright pops of color into dark, seedy alleyways, droids cook strange foods at little stalls, and citizens enjoy some back-alley gambling.

But there is <em>a lot of</em> playing to do here—<em>Outlaws</em> is a third-person open-world game that features gunplay, stealth mechanics, dogfights in space, platforming, and more. My hands-on demo was on rails and I was still somewhat astounded by how much Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment have packed into this game.</p><figure id="" data-id="ea7fb0c89d0f12cffbc4f95ea1e3567d" data-recommend-id="image://ea7fb0c89d0f12cffbc4f95ea1e3567d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess shoots her blaster at Stormtroopers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vess shoots her blaster at Stormtroopers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea7fb0c89d0f12cffbc4f95ea1e3567d" data-recommend-id="image://ea7fb0c89d0f12cffbc4f95ea1e3567d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess shoots her blaster at Stormtroopers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h27756"><a id=""></a><strong>Playing the scoundrel</strong></h2><p>I was able to play three missions during my <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> hands-on, each of which had a 20-minute timer. One required Kay to escape an Imperial ship and dogfight some TIE fighters, another saw her platforming her way around a derelict High Republic ship, and the final one tasked her with infiltrating a Crimson Dawn base on snow-covered planet Kijimi. Ubisoft was smart to give us these little slices, as each one showcased all the tools and tricks Kay has in her arsenal.<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> 1<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-new-trailer-gameplay-details-spotted-1851530971&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-new-trailer-gameplay-details-spotted-1851530971">4 Cool Details We Spotted In <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>’ New Gameplay Trailer</a></span></p><p>The Imperial ship level leaned into using Nix as a distraction, which requires you to hold down the left bumper on your controller to bring up some commands you can issue the little guy. He can attack enemies, distract them, or interact with objects. Distracting enemies is a bit simplistic—Nix will fall over dead in front of them so that Kay can sneak behind them and knock them out, but none of the other enemies ever noticed the bodies I was leaving behind as I snuck around. I also had to do a bit of hacking in this level, which takes the form of a Wordle-like minigame in which you try and guess which three symbols will crack the code. Guessing the wrong one will give you a big red X, the right one in the wrong spot will go yellow, and the correct one glows blue.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-recommend-id="image://f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-recommend-id="image://f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The High Republic level was all about platforming, which feels like a mix of the <em>Star Wars Jedi </em>games and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. Kay scrambles up yellow painted grates (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608">yes, yellow paint is in this game</a></span>), times her jumps to avoid getting her fingers caught in vents that are opening and closing, and can use her grappling hook to latch onto certain things and swing to faraway platforms. I struggled with the platforming at certain points, partially because I am bad at platforming but also partially because Kay can feel a bit unwieldy during these segments, and this mechanic does seem to be a bit too reliant on <em>Tomb Raider</em>-esque vibes and <em>Uncharted</em>-style gags (platforms fall out from under Kay <em>a lot</em>).<br></p><p>The third mission is all about stealth, which is another thing I am very bad at. You can really only duck behind cover and crouch-walk around in order to remain hidden, or duck into an occasional vent if you can do so without getting caught (I couldn’t). Nix can only distract one person at a time, and in the Crimson Dawn base there were quite a few baddies patrolling about. Fortunately, as soon as I’m spotted, a shoot-out ensues, and those are very fun.<br></p><p>Kay wields a blaster that can swap between lethal and EMP rounds, the latter of which works great for droids, shields, and powering up dead batteries. She even has a one-shot knockout round that’s on a long cooldown, and a <em>Red Dead Redemption-</em>style ultimate ability that slows down time and lets you mark up to three enemies to take out with ease. The gunplay is pretty tight and satisfying, but don’t expect much <em>Division</em>-style cover—Kay can duck behind things and dodge roll, but <em>Outlaws</em> feels more like you’ll either be avoiding combat or going into a room guns blazing. </p><figure id="" data-id="3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-recommend-id="image://3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-recommend-id="image://3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h27757"><a id=""></a><strong>A thoroughly <em>Star Wars</em> world</strong></h2><p>Though the gameplay was very structured and likely won’t represent the final, open-world product, I was able to get a great taste of <em>Outlaws</em>’ version of the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy— and I was very impressed by the vibes Ubisoft has curated. Kay Vess is a fantastic character, voiced with a slightly scummy, plucky perfection by Humberly González. Nix is adorable and animated, and feels at times like a secondary protagonist because of how often he gets involved, how reactive he is, and how much Kay chats with him. He’s BD-1 with teeth, and I would die for him.<br></p><p>The side characters all feel like they stepped off a movie set, and getting to delve into the seedy criminal underworld we only get tastes of in things like <em>Solo</em> is a devilish delight. Deciding who Kay will align with will affect her reputation with different factions, a mechanic which was hard to get a feel for during my hands-on, but seems like a smart way to allow players to roleplay their version of a <em>Star Wars</em> scoundrel. Everyone loves Han Solo, but what would you do if you were in his boots?<br></p><p><em>Outlaws</em>’ aesthetic is beautifully retrofuturistic. It feels like you’re playing through an unreleased ‘70s <em>Star Wars</em> film, from Kay’s shaggy haircut to the retro menu design and the tactility of the gameplay. Whenever Kay plucks her data spike from her hair to unlock a door, you’ll have to complete a little rhythm minigame by pulling the trigger in time with a flashing light, your controller vibrating with each pulse. It <em>feels</em> like you’re actually cracking the lock yourself, high praise for a lockpicking mechanic considering how they can often feel like throwaway features.<br></p><p>And though I was a little bummed that a lot of the world I encountered felt like it was behind a display case (I desperately wanted to order a drink at a bar, or sit down at a random table and play sabacc, rather than just lean on a railing via a somewhat sticky animation), these are beautiful virtual spaces that are steeped in <em>Star Wars</em> lore and vibes. And I’m sure once Ubisoft launches <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and we’re free to roam these spaces without restrictions, I’ll be even more excited for what Kay’s journey has to offer.<br></p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> launches August 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some village archers pick off a couple while others get stuck on a gate.

Made by the company’s Development Division 1, which includes the <em>Resident Evil </em>and <em>Devil May Cry </em>teams, <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>is also coming to Game Pass when it launches on July 19, making it Capcom’s 2024 subscription service successor to last year’s dino shooter <em>Exoprimal.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike that one, though, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> isn’t a live-service game. Instead it’s a more traditional single-player action strategy game that revolves around cleansing a mountain of evil spirits as you, playing as the warrior Soh, guide Yoshiro across each level so she can complete a final ritual. A day-night cycle means that time is always moving when you’re not navigating menus and ordering comrades around. Players prepare for the onslaught by rescuing villagers, killing possessed animals, and collecting spirt orbs that are the game’s currency for managing recruitments, upgrades, and buildings.</p><figure id="" data-id="0b296b4eaf03b8002801b0e6c023feea" data-recommend-id="image://0b296b4eaf03b8002801b0e6c023feea" data-format="gif" data-width="836" data-height="481" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Soh fights of Yokai to cleanse a village.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When night falls monsters, called the Seethe, come out of randomly positioned gates to try to attack the Maiden and end her journey. If that happens, it’s game over. But guiding Yoshiro farther along each level requires blazing a path with your spirit orbs, expending currency that can’t be used for your defenses. The result is a clever tension between trying to get her through the level as fast as possible and trying to take your time to build up your defenses. Take too long and you might get punished for it. After each nighttime the next wave of enemies gets progressively stronger. While there’s no time limit, dawdling can cost you.<br></p><p>But protecting her isn’t just a matter of just positioning your limited number of class-based companions on each level and utilizing the terrain, traps, and other structures to your advantage, it’s also about combat. Following a “Dancing Swords” fighting style, Soh completes combos by linking together strong and weak attacks that increase the power of his attacks while also helping him move around the battlefield gracefully and efficiently. There’s a stamina system, a dodge roll to get out of the way of enemies’ attacks, a guard gauge that can be broken, and a special power that can be used upon building up a meter to unleash more deadly moves. It’s not full <em>Devil May Cry</em>, which some of the developers also worked on, but it controls crisply and feels satisfying enough that <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> doesn’t suffer the normal intermittent doldrums of some other tower defense games, especially in boss fights where you have to not just worry about surviving but also finishing the fight before  Yoshiro gets killed. </p><p>Where the complexity comes in, and what makes me excited to return to <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>once it’s out next month, is in how varied loadouts and maps seem to get later on. As you complete levels you collect new gear that can be swapped out for certain bonuses that also come at a cost, like stronger attacks alongside taking more damage, offering the potential to give players the trade-off management of upgrades in a roguelike. You can also unlock new classes for your allies as you go, and earn resources that can be used to choose how they’re upgraded before going out into battle again. A representative from Capcom declined to comment but grinned when I asked if Soh would get to change weapon types during the game, so there might be that to look forward to as well. </p><p>As an action-strategy nerd, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> ticked all the right boxes for me. It’s impossible to know from a 30-minute demo if it can keep ramping up its complexity and challenge in an even and rewarding way across the whole game, but the slice I played showed a lot of promise. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Steam Next Fest for June 2024 is live now through June 17, and with it comes thousands of games to try out with new betas and demos. In addition to demos, there are also special offers on games with discounted prices to check out that you may have been waiting on for a while now.</p>



<p>From action-packed first-person shooters to being an over-the-top bike messenger to even a duck-themed survival game, there are so many options to choose from this time around. To help get you going with some new games, we’ve put together a list of games you should check out between now and June 17 during Steam Next Fest.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-steam-next-fest-games-you-should-play-in-june-2024">10 Steam Next Fest Games You Should Play In June 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-i-am-your-beast"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Am Your Beast</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the developer of El Paso: Elsewhere, I Am Your Beast is a first-person action game with comic book-style visuals. You play as a secret agent who’s forced to go against the Covert Operations Initiative after turning down missions because you’d rather stay retired. </p>



<p>I Am Your Beast will feature 20+ levels at launch with a fully voiced story. The game even allows you to throw your pistol as a boomerang to take out enemies. That was enough to sell me right there.</p>



<h3 id="h-striden"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052970/STRIDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STRIDEN</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>STRIDEN is the first title from 5 Fortress, a sandbox looter-shooter with some innovative – and bizarre – elements. With friends (or alone, if you’re brave), venture into a harrowing world to loot, survive, build, and ultimately escape, taking advantage of a slew of multi-generational weapons and shapeshifting abilities to dominate your enemies along the way. </p>



<p>That’s right – you can turn into a radioactive bear as the timer counts down and a toxic fog closes in around you.</p>



<h3 id="h-duckside"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682580/DUCKSIDE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duckside</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Duckside is one of the crazier entries for this month’s Steam Next Fest, a survival PvP/PvE title where you get to play as a Duck wearing a goofy hat. The developers state that the game is reminiscent of titles like DayZ and Rust, with the only differentiating factor being that you are a duck, which seems exciting enough. </p>



<p>This game will have you waddling around a post-apocalyptic open world, taking down your feathered opponents by wielding automatic and explosive weapons, while building and crafting a base and tools to protect your precious loot.</p>



<h3 id="h-enotria-the-last-song"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enotria: The Last Song</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>An upcoming Soulslike game inspired by Italian folklore. The game gives off an incredibly creepy vibe while still being absolutely stunning, visually. Where Enotria hopes to stand out is with its masks mechanic that will allow players to take on the role of your enemies by simply wearing their mask. Players will be able to quickly swap between loadouts and masks, each having their own benefits and weaknesses.</p>



<p>When it launches in the fall, the game will feature over 100 different enemies with a 40+ hour story.</p>



<h3 id="h-parcel-corps"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015960/Parcel_Corps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parcel Corps</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s always nice when a studio tries something different and new, and that’s what Parcel Corps is. It’s a game where you work as a freelance bicycle messenger who is working to simply get by until a crude oil CEO comes to try and ruin everything. The game is presented as satire on the gig economy we find ourselves in, and wants you to save the world — yes, you read that right — by making your deliveries.</p>



<h3 id="h-dungeons-amp-degenerate-gamblers"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Balatro was a smash hit and will likely win a number of awards this year. If you wanted more roguelike card games, then Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers might be right up your alley. Instead of Poker, however, you are playing Blackjack with the goal of beating the house. Each suit also offers an added bonus whether that be healing, protection, extra money, or extra damage.</p>



<h3 id="h-flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1832040/Flintlock_The_Siege_of_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A Souls-lite game with a unique tagline of “Kill All Gods”. The game sees you have to fight off the Gods and their armies of the dead as they attempt to end mankind. It launches in July, but you can check out the demo now on Steam.</p>



<h3 id="h-maximum-football"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691280/Maximum_Football/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maximum Football</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re looking for a football game with customization and both college and professional modes, Maximum Football aims to be that game for you. The game has a beta that only offers customization and exhibition play right now, but when it launches it’ll offer Dynasty and Franchise mode for players. It’ll also be completely free to play.</p>



<h3 id="h-g-i-joe-wrath-of-cobra"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2516170/GI_Joe_Wrath_of_Cobra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a fan of beat ’em up games, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra could be the next one you are looking for. The game sees you play as one of &nbsp;Duke, Scarlett, Roadblock, or Snake Eyes, among others as you fight to stop Cobra from succeeding in their destructive plans. Developer Maple Powered Games promises a game that’s “Easy to play, hard to master”. The game will support both local and online co-op.</p>



<h3 id="h-aero-gpx"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2160360/Aero_GPX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aero GPX</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’ve been wishing for a new F-Zero fix but are tired of waiting for an official game, Aero GPX could quench that zero-gravity thirst. Each races features 30 vehicles — or machines — all vying for first place, and they’ll do whatever it takes to get there. That means even using their machine to slam and spin opponents to improve their chances of winning. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest?snr=1_5_9_"></a></p>

The suits include some new designs and some that return from previous games.</p><p>Meanwhile, the update also “addresses some community feedback” and adds stability improvements to the game. This includes the ability to swap out your parry and traversal abilities from the Symbiote to Spider Arms, and vice versa.</p><p>Four new suits were created in partnership with Colm Dillane, AKA KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. Yes, even Brazilian footballers are designing Spider-Man suits these days. There’s even a comment from Real Madrid forward Vini Jr, who co-developed the Ginga Suit for Miles Morales:</p><p>“I wanted it to be a celebration of Brazil’s culture and people. I just love the overall design because it has the energy and action that I associate Spider-Man with, but it’s beautifully mixed with some Brazilian flair. Which makes this suit super special and different from others.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 KidSuper Suits Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The returning suits are from Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. These four suits are being “retrofitted” for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, including two for Peter and two for Miles, Insomniac said. One is the Into The Spider-Verse suit for Peter Parker, another Miles Morales’ Animated suit.

        <p>Raining demos like cats and dogs</p>

            <p>I'm a little sheepish about how much I'm looking forward to Cat Quest 3. It's neither big budget and mainstream, nor a conceptually thrilling indie. If the first two games are anything to go by, it'll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.
</p>
<p>Yeah. That's why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

<p>The cats are the problem. Plenty of other games feature melee combat with dodge rolls and dopamine-tickling levelling systems, but it's the presence of cats and cat puns that throw up a red flag. They're the warning sign that you're approaching something creatively shallow, a game which has opted to court the most tired of internet memes in lieu of developing its own personality.
</p>
<p>Yet I don't feel that way about Cat Quest. Its cat puns are so relentless, so laboured, they loop back around to being charming, and its combat has a reliable, does-what-it-says-on-the-tin sort of appeal. I feel the same way about Cat Quest that I do about the similarly-named Beast Quest children's books, which likewise have a straightforward fantasy world where there's always a monster, always a magical item, always a victorious final battle. I read those books to my son, and Cat Quest 2 introduced co-op which my son and I played together.
</p>
<p>And Cat Quest 3 adds sea combat! No guilty pleasure, only pleasure - right?
</p>
<p>I'm going to buy this and I'm going to like it, I can tell. It's out on August 8th, but there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305840/Cat_Quest_III/">Steam Next Fest demo if you want to play it now</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves Of Qud</a> has been under development for over 15 years, but it's finally reaching a 1.0 release later this year. Ahead of that happening, it's received a final major content update which seeks to make the complex, detailed roguelike more approachable. The Spring Molting update, which is out now, makes the user interface work with both mouse and gamepad, adds Steam cloud saves, and more.

<p>The new interface does look pretty friendly, with the previously overwhelming amount of text now joined by illustrative quest maps, character build layouts, and so on. It's enough - when combined with no longer needing to remember umpteen keyboard bindings - to convince me I need to give Qud another go.</p>
<p>The update also refreshes the starting town, giving it "the same lived-in texture as the rest of the world", according to the press release. There are also hundreds of new sound and visual effects, 40 new achievements, performance improvements, bug fixes, and new narrative elements. There are a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/4169849469500823121">full patch notes over on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Caves Of Qud is the work of Freehold Games, but they've partnered with the publisher Kitfox to help get the game ready for its 1.0 release. Kitfox seem to be the de facto choice for making hardcore roguelikes playable to masses, given their work on Dwarf Fortress's 2022 Steam release.
</p>
<p>We haven't made a proper appraisal of Caves Of Qud since nearly ten years ago, when Marsh Davies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">covered it for our Premature Evaluation early access column</a>. Marsh found plenty to excite him in Qud's procedural generation and systemic flexibility, but ultimately felt it required "more persistent, self-flagellating or forgiving gamers" than he to really scratch beneath its surfaces. Hopefully this update, and 1.0 to follow, will change that - for my sake, if not for Marsh's.</p>

This optional boss is found in Redmane Castle in southeast Caelid. However, he will only appear after meeting certain requirements, some more complicated than others.</p><figure id="" data-id="795cb6bff3b8df89bfa1ce4ab6fd32b8" data-recommend-id="image://795cb6bff3b8df89bfa1ce4ab6fd32b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2856" data-height="1478" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring's map showing Redmane Castle highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring's map showing Redmane Castle highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="795cb6bff3b8df89bfa1ce4ab6fd32b8" data-recommend-id="image://795cb6bff3b8df89bfa1ce4ab6fd32b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2856" data-height="1478" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring's map showing Redmane Castle highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The easiest way to unlock access to Starscourge Radahn is to simply advance through the game normally and rest at any Site of Grace in Altus Plateau. This will trigger the Radahn Festival back at Redmane Castle. With that underway, you can go to the castle and make your way to the plaza where you’ll find an NPC just up the stairs. Speak to him, then continue forward and down a lift to a wide-open desert arena. On the other side of the teleporter is the fight against the hulking Starscourge Radahn.</p><p>Since Starscourge Radahn rides on a horse and can maneuver around the arena very quickly, you can also use your steed, Torrent, to match his momentum. The fight is rather difficult solo, but if you’ve advanced through some of the many optional character storylines during your adventure, you’ll find summon signs throughout the arena that will grant you help from NPCs.</p><p>When Starscourge Radahn falls, it’s now time to make your way to Mohgwyn Palace to take on Mohg, Lord of Blood.</p><h2 id="h33934"><a id=""></a><strong>Step Two: Defeat Mohg, Lord of Blood</strong></h2><p>There are multiple ways to reach Mohgwyn Palace, but the most direct way is to follow White Mask Varré’s questline. You’ll first meet him at the beginning of the game when emerging into Limgrave, but you can’t advance his story until you’ve reached the Roundtable Hold.<br></p><p>After obtaining at least one Great Rune (you’ll have at least one from defeating Starscourge Radahn), speak to the Two Fingers in a chamber within the Roundtable Hold. This will cause White Mask Varré’s location to change to the Rose Church in Liurnia of the Lakes.</p><figure id="" data-id="b67aa4dc863e309f18a7324f2a930862" data-recommend-id="image://b67aa4dc863e309f18a7324f2a930862" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring's map screen highlights the location of Rose Church." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring's map screen highlights the location of Rose Church." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b67aa4dc863e309f18a7324f2a930862" data-recommend-id="image://b67aa4dc863e309f18a7324f2a930862" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring's map screen highlights the location of Rose Church." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speak to White Mask Varré at the Rose Church to obtain a Festering Bloody Finger.

He’ll now grant you the Lord of Blood’s Favor and ask you to soak it in the blood of a maiden.<br></p><p>There are multiple maidens whose blood you can use for soaking the Lord of Blood’s Favor, but the easiest and least storyline-affecting is a corpse at the Church of Inhibition. Go there, soak the item, then return once more to White Mask Varré.</p><figure id="" data-id="8d28c818a24e8c59189a2cedfcca1a11" data-recommend-id="image://8d28c818a24e8c59189a2cedfcca1a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Elden Ring map screen highlights the Church of Inhibition's location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Elden Ring map screen highlights the Church of Inhibition's location." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d28c818a24e8c59189a2cedfcca1a11" data-recommend-id="image://8d28c818a24e8c59189a2cedfcca1a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Elden Ring map screen highlights the Church of Inhibition's location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>White Mask Varré will grant you a Bloody Finger upon speaking with him again. However, if you speak to him a second time, he’ll also provide you with the Pureblood Knight’s Medal, which is exactly what we’ve been after this whole time.</p><p>Access the Pureblood Knight’s Medal in your inventory and use it to teleport directly to the entrance of Mohgwyn Palace. Work your way through this new area until you reach a large lift just past the Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint Site of Grace. Take it up to finally be standing face-to-face with one of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s most challenging bosses: Mohg, Lord of Blood.</p><figure id="" data-id="ffb3c59af4876328c0bc1588a69c2128" data-recommend-id="image://ffb3c59af4876328c0bc1588a69c2128" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Elden Ring map screen highlights the Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Elden Ring map screen highlights the Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ffb3c59af4876328c0bc1588a69c2128" data-recommend-id="image://ffb3c59af4876328c0bc1588a69c2128" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Elden Ring map screen highlights the Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mohg, Lord of Blood is an endgame boss and shouldn’t be tackled at low levels. If you’re feeling adequately prepared, though, equip gear that improves your fire and bleed resistances. This boss loves to cause bleed build-up, so it wouldn’t hurt to also bring along consumables that can reduce the frustrating damage this can cause.</p><h2 id="h33935"><a id=""></a><strong>Step Three: Enter the Land of Shadow</strong></h2><p>When you’ve tackled Mohg, Lord of Blood, you’ll finally have access to the Land of Shadow.

Hot off his run to a near-victory in Super Bowl LVIII comes San Francisco 49er running back Christian McCaffrey.</p>

<p>The reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year will grace the standard and Deluxe Editions. You can view both covers in the gallery below.</p>



<p>EA has yet to detail Madden 25’s gameplay but teases the next evolution of current-gen/PC exclusive features such as FieldSense, new commentary and presentation, and updates to Franchise and other modes. A press release states EA plans to announce gameplay details "soon."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-players-celebrate-the-games-mac-announcement-opening-it-up-for-a-wider-community/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=palworld-players-celebrate-the-games-mac-announcement-opening-it-up-for-a-wider-community<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Apple and PocketPair have confirmed that the <em>Pokemon</em>-esque open world survival crafting game <em>Palworld</em> will be heading to Mac later this year. This was revealed during Apple’s WWDC2024 and is slated for a launch in August 2024 alongside the new Mac operating system, Apple Silicon.</p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true"><em>Palworld</em> is one of the biggest games coming to Mac in terms of sheer player <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-has-just-one-game-to-beat-to-become-the-most-played-release-on-steam-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numbers and popu</a>larity. It quickly racked up players after its initial launch, and now, instead of coming to PS5 first, it’s coming to a platform that many people use, but few actually play games on. However, <em>Palworld</em> fans don’t seem to mind, and they are happy that there will soon be more new players hopping in to enjoy the game they all love. </p>
 <h2 id="h-palworld-s-mac-release-will-make-the-most-of-apple-s-latest-technology" data-injectable="false"><em>Palworld</em>‘s Mac release will make the most of Apple’s latest technology</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Pocketpair</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">User Hoak-em on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/1dcs4s7/palworld_is_coming_to_macos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Palworld</em> subreddit</a> commented, “I’m so excited. I wonder if this means that it will also be coming to other platforms like iPhone and iPad as well, since they share a universal games platform for other games like the new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.”</p>
 <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="272" data-injectable="false">The feel from the community is that they’re happy more players are about to join them. There are, of course, some disgruntled comments about how the Mac launch is happening before crossplay, and the inevitable discussion of how some Macs just can’t run games. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">As a Mac user myself, I like how this will make <em>Palworld</em> a bit easier to play for more people. Yes, it’s always been possible to use Boot Camp to run Windows and play the game, but running it natively will be such a massive step forward for those of us who do game on the platform. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Apple boasts that when <em>Palworld</em> arrives on Mac, it’ll make use of systems such as HDR and MetalFX Upscaling. At the time of writing, Mac users need nothing to do to secure their copy on launch day. However, pre-order information will be released soon. </p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="false">Also launching this summer is Palworld’s first expansion, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-adds-a-new-island-pals-and-more-in-just-a-few-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakurajima Update</a>. It’ll hit the game on June 27, 2024, and will add a new island, more Pals, an oil rig filled with enemies to attack, and a new raid. Between this and the Mac version, there’s never been a better time to get into the game and build up your collection of Pals to work tirelessly crafting every item under the sun for you. </p>

<p data-characters="111" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>This article is sponsored by War Thunder, <a href="https://warthunder.com/play4free?r=gamurs&amp;utm_source=destructoid&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=warthunder&amp;utm_id=branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">get it on PC for free here</a> or through the PlayStation and Xbox store.</em></p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">If you truly love military games and are looking for a community to match that energy, then <em>War Thunder</em> is the game for you. The free-to-play combat MMO boasts over 70 million players, so not only are you likely to meet your new best friend on the battlefield, but you might learn a thing or two about some real-world weapons of war while doing it.</p> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="841" data-injectable="true">With all manner of historic and modern vehicles to command, you can take the fight to some of the most passionate players on the planet on land, in the air, and at sea. Perhaps your new teammates are incredibly knowledgeable about the armor structure of the Challenger 2 tank, and the turret rotation speed of the Leclerc, or perhaps you’ll learn some interesting facts about the Apache helicopter. Either way, there will be plenty to talk about while you send rounds downrange at the enemy.</p>
 <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">You can experience the thrill of combat and the adrenaline rush of victory in some of the greatest feats of military engineering that mankind has ever devised, with access to over 2500 separate, highly detailed, and expertly modeled vehicles that cover over 100 years of warfare. More than 140 maps representing different theaters of war are waiting for you to devise cunning tactics and implement your battle plans. For those players who might be a little shy about some PvP action, there are rich PvE campaigns and solo missions for you to dive into.</p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">The remarkably passionate team of developers at Gaijin Entertainment has gone to great lengths to offer fans a challenging, exciting, and detailed experience, allowing them to feel what it is like to take on the ultimate combat challenge from the comfort of their own homes.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">And that passion is met by the most uniquely enthusiastic community that sees millions of people from all over the world take part in battles every day. Remember, you don’t need to know the ins and outs of every aspect of every vehicle in the game to have fun. You definitely don’t need access to any classified documents to take advantage of everything these vehicles can do in the game, but we guess it couldn’t hurt.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">If you find yourself caught up in a heated debate about the ins and outs of jets, helicopters, tanks, or battleships, remember that it’s best to believe the person you are talking to. They may just have the evidence to back up their point. Remember, <em>War Thunder’s</em> passionate players will go to great lengths to win a match, but they’ll go even further to win an argument.</p> <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">To join in the fun, you can <a href="https://warthunder.com/play4free?r=gamurs&amp;utm_source=destructoid&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=warthunder&amp;utm_id=branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">download War Thunder here</a> for free or head to the PlayStation and Xbox stores.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
