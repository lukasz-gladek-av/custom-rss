The likes of <em>Final Fantasy </em>are joined by plenty of delightful games both big and small, charming and horrifying, and above all else, rewarding to play. Here are some of the best games to pick up throughout Steam’s turn-based sale, which ends <strong>October 7.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>I’m pretty sure that <em>I’m</em> the resident <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165"><em>Sea of Stars</em></a></span><em> </em>enjoyer at this site, so let me make the case for it real quick. It’s an homage to the RPGs of yesteryear, namely <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and the original <em>Golden Sun</em>, but it’s a lot more light-hearted and looser than either of those games. I’ll be the first to admit that <em>Sea of Stars </em>doesn’t tell the most compelling story, but it makes up for that with a vibrant and expressive look, as well as a battle system that I absolutely cherish. In it, opponents have a set of “locks” that can be broken by attacks depending on things like weapon types or elemental weaknesses. If you manage to break every lock, which can be a bit of a puzzle in and of itself, you stagger your opponent, delaying their moves or even resetting their process. This is a layer added atop a battle system that welds the timing of <em>Super Mario RPG </em>to the combination attacks of <em>Chrono Trigger</em>.</p><p>If that’s enough to get you in the door, <em>Sea of Stars </em>takes you on a hell of a journey, and manages to succinctly do <em>a lot </em>in roughly 30 hours.<strong> </strong><em><strong>Sea of Stars </strong></em><strong>is easily some of the most straightforward fun you can have with a bite-sized RPG, and you can pick it up on Steam for $25 right now.</strong></p></div><div><p>The gloom of fall is fully setting in, and it’s now October so what better way to celebrate the time than grabbing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/darkest-dungeon-the-kotaku-review-1755308882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/darkest-dungeon-the-kotaku-review-1755308882"><em>Darkest Dungeon</em></a></span>? Easily the most terrifying and nerve-wracking entry on this list, <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> combines turn-based RPG mechanics with intense dungeon crawls, resource management, and takes ailment statuses and debuffs to the next level. In it, you have to assemble a party of various typical classes—this time cast in roles that adhere more closely to a dark medieval fantasy—and plumb the depths of several dungeons beneath a gothic manor. These dungeons contain the stuff of nightmares, including eldritch horrors, and your party must slaughter them or be slaughtered. It all takes place in gnarly, hand-drawn, turn-based combat where tactical positioning and timing is key, your team needing to endure the terror as best as they can without breaking.</p><p>If a party member’s sanity (which can be tracked) cracks in the face of these abominations, their resolve is challenged, prompting them to come back either stronger than ever, or worse off, and the matter is more or less decided by a behind-the-scenes die roll. In the meantime, you can manage the party as best you can by ensuring that they rest properly both in and out of dungeon crawls, are well fed, and crucially, are always in well-lit spaces. Nothing terrifies folks more than the dark, and the creepy crawlies that go stumbling in it. <strong><em>Darkest Dungeon </em>is a wonderful twist on turn-based RPGs and there’s even a </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/darkest-dungeon-ii-tries-something-new-and-it-mostly-w-1847948896&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/darkest-dungeon-ii-tries-something-new-and-it-mostly-w-1847948896"><strong>full sequel</strong></a></span><strong> out right now, but why not jump into the first game for just $3.74 or even pick it up along with all of its DLC for just about $10 on Steam?</strong></p></div><div><p>After reviving <em>XCOM </em>and popularizing the series throughout the 2010s, the noted strategy developer Firaxis took a wild swing with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171"><em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em></a></span>. A turn-based tactics RPG based on the popular comic book brand, <em>Midnight Suns </em>brings deck-building into the fold as an added layer to really make itself stand apart. In a sense, it succeeded.<br></p><p><em>Midnight Suns </em>is unlike any Marvel game before it, spinning a lengthy RPG tale out of this premise while also turning its cast of heroes, including beloved legends like Wolverine and overlooked characters like Magik, into likable personas that you can spend time befriending when you’re outside of missions. When you’re in the action, you can take a set of characters, as well as their customizable decks of techniques, and unleash hell on enemies—the fun of <em>Midnight Suns </em>often tends to be how ridiculous and over-the-top these tactical skirmishes turn out to be, which captures a whimsical energy that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been missing for a long time now.</p><p><strong>Unfortunately, people didn’t quite pick up on everything that <em>Midnight Suns </em>had to offer, but that hasn’t stopped it from slowly building a devout audience, and it shouldn’t stop you from picking it up for $15, or either of its more content-rich editions for $20 and $25, on Steam. </strong></p></div><div><p>Kenneth Shepard would scream at me if I didn’t shout out <em>Final Fantasy X/X-2</em>, whose remasters are currently on sale. Besides being some of his favorite games ever, these two are also the last <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-final-fantasy-games-rpg-7-6-10-12-square-enix-ff-1850560934&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-final-fantasy-games-rpg-7-6-10-12-square-enix-ff-1850560934"><em>Final Fantasy </em>titles</a></span>—save for maybe the MMO <em>Final Fantasy XIV Online</em>—where it felt like folks were unilaterally behind the series and championing every installment as some of the best in the biz. Most folks who have played one or both of them adore Tidus and Yuna, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-had-my-sexual-awakening-thanks-to-final-fantasy-x-1847331894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-had-my-sexual-awakening-thanks-to-final-fantasy-x-1847331894">as well as their romance</a></span>, and love either game’s progression systems and larger world, which are both what I’d consider integral pieces to a great RPG.</p><p><em>Final Fantasy X </em>and <em>X-2 </em>were also exceptional in their lineage because they were the first two games in the mainline series to be explicitly connected to one another. This would only really happen again with the <em>XIII </em>trilogy, the original <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> and its rebirth as <em>A Realm Reborn</em>—which could and should be treated as entirely different games—and the trilogy of games “remaking” <em>Final Fantasy VII.</em> <strong>Unlike most of those later examples though, </strong><em><strong>Final Fantasy</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>X </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>X-2 </strong></em><strong>are sharp and focused games across the board, telling two distinct halves of a story and ultimately coming to a satisfying conclusion. You can get both of them in a single package for just $12 on Steam.</strong></p></div><div><p>Look, there are a lot of <em>Pokémon </em>clones out there to pick from, and I’m sure there’s an absolute wealth of them on sale right now. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-m-gonna-play-the-heck-out-of-this-lo-fi-spin-on-pokem-1847895935&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-m-gonna-play-the-heck-out-of-this-lo-fi-spin-on-pokem-1847895935"><em>Cassette Beasts</em></a></span><em> </em>is, crucially, the only one that I’ve played, so it’s the one I’m going with—and there’s a lot to love about it. <em>Cassette Beasts </em>adapts the tried-and-true formula into an open world where you encounter the titular monsters in the wild, record them, and then use them in battle. Through a mixtape mechanic, you can even combine creatures into a whole new evolved set of monsters that blend types and have unique traits and skills.<br></p><p>The open world is filled with threads to pull on, encompassing a few different major arcs, like having to face off against elite Rangers, but then there’s also a storyline where you have to track down these nightmarish things called Archangels. It’s all in service of an isekai plot that drops you, as well as everyone else in the game, onto the island of New Whirral, where <em>Cassette Beasts </em>takes place.</p><p>You’re allowed to use your beasts’ traversal abilities pretty freely in the overworld, you can befriend and romance characters, and there’s even multiplayer in this game. <strong>Unlike its main inspiration these days, it looks good and runs reliably well too, meaning <em>Cassette Beasts </em>is everything you could really want out of a monster-collecting RPG, and it’s yours for $12 on Steam. </strong></p></div><div><p><em>Arco</em>’s got a lot of cool things going for it. First, it’s a Mesoamerican fantasy RPG, which is a combination of words I’m not used to seeing put together like that, and which brings me immense joy as a Latino. Second, its combat, which blurs the lines between real-time combat and tactics gameplay, absolutely rules.</p><p><em>Arco </em>allows you to plot a course of action and then carry it out at the same time as your enemies. In the middle of this action though, you can effectively pause and micro-adjust your course, which can include running in another direction, assuming a different tactical position, or launching an attack. Enemies telegraph their next move while paused, giving you an idea of how to respond after resuming time, and it leads to remarkably tense little skirmishes between bouts of exploration and traditional dungeon crawling. <em><strong>Arco </strong></em><strong>is currently discounted to $15 and it is well worth it.</strong></p></div><div><p>I’m right near the end of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a></span>, and you guys, it’s so good. I’m pretty sure I’ve got the full roster of possible teammates at this point, since we’re barreling towards a confrontation with the game’s big baddie. Yet, I constantly feel like I’m learning something new about how these characters operate individually and as a unit, reminding me of my favorite tactics game, <em>Into the Breach</em>.<br></p><p>I’ve got a druid now who can shape-shift into a dog, turn enemies against each other by biting them, and avoids enemy fire in his wild shape, and my tank unit can basically swap places with anyone regardless of sightlines, meaning my super-powered squad is just zipping all over the place, pulling people off ledges or knocking them out of windows and into portals. It has never stopped being anything but an utter blast and a laugh riot, it’s hard-as-hell politics are just the cherry on top. <strong><em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>really just is one of the best games of the year, and you should pick it up while it’s ever-so-slightly cheaper at $18 on Steam.</strong></p></div><div><p>I’ve both seen and heard of <em>Felvidek </em>before, but I’ve never actually gotten around to check it out. However, once you lay eyes on it, it’s the kind of game that begs to be seen through to completion. <em>Felvidek</em> is…different. It’s a short RPG that can apparently be finished in a handful of hours, but the most striking part about it is its art style, which makes it look like a PS1 game.</p><p>Set in 15th century Slovakia, you play as an alcoholic knight who must repel threats to his land, ally himself with people of different walks of life and belief, and suppress “surreal horrors” in first-person turn-based combat. <strong><em>Felvidek</em> is the most distinct game on this list, and one I’ve got an immediate need for, and you can pick it up for $12 right now.</strong></p></div><div><p>I’m still reeling from the passing of the legendary mangaka Akira Toriyama, but it’s a comfort to live in a world so full of the man’s beautiful work. I haven’t found the time to be able to dig into his games like I intended, but if you’re looking for a lengthy and gorgeous RPG with turn-based combat to sink your teeth into, you can’t possibly go wrong with the definitive edition of <em>Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age. </em>I’ve only sparingly played it myself, but it’s positively filled with that charm and hope that Toriyama-san’s best work managed to channel.</p><p>This definitive version of the game comes with a whole host of additions, including extra scenarios and a redone score, but its most wonderful quirk is that it can be fully played in 3D graphics <em>or </em>the series’ traditional 2D look. Considering <em>Dragon Quest</em>’s legacy and its current position as one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-preview-1851546965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-preview-1851546965">most enduring old-school series</a></span>, it’s a touch that goes a long way. <strong><em>Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age </em>is the most classic RPG you’re going to find on this sale, and it can be yours for $20.</strong><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Pikmin are being used to encourage younger visitors to grow and expand their appreciation for nature and the animals who live in the wild. Visitors at the zoo will be able to find Pikmin-themed locations and take pictures of the tiny creatures. According to the zoo, the Pikmin "can help guide your expedition around Wildlife Explorers Basecamp."</p><p>Additionally, there will be a My Nintendo kiosk in the San Diego Zoo at the Pikmin pop-up tent that will let registered Nintendo account holders claim 100 My Nintendo Platinum Points. Guests can also get a "Nintendo goodie bag" from the pop-up tent in exchange for small tasks like finding and photographing a Pikmin at the zoo. Platinum points can then be exchanged for physical rewards on the My Nintendo website.</p><p>The Pikmin promotion will be running at the San Diego Zoo until November 28, but the Pikmin pop-up tent will close a few days earlier on November 24. October is also Kids Free Month at the San Diego Zoo for all children 11 and under when accompanied by an adult with a paid ticket for the zoo.</p>

In fact, you have the chance to persuade all three NPCs at Herald's Rest to discuss Vaeric's whereabouts with you.

You're told that Tane should be arriving at the bar any moment.</p><p>After a few seconds, Tane will walk up the steps to Herald's Rest and you can confront him. Tane has tattoos on his face and neck, so he's difficult to miss. By speaking to Tane, you learn that he's not even a House Va'ruun member, which gives you some common ground with him. Once you go back and forth with Tane for a moment, you're given the chance to pay him 1,000 Credits for Vaeric's location. Just paying Tane is much easier than any alternative.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376794-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.43.13.35.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376794" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376794-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.43.13.35.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376794"></a><figcaption>You'll need to fork over some credits if you want to save some time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376794-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.43.13.35.png"></figure><p>Paying Tane reveals that he actually placed a tracker on Vaeric so he could come and find him once Vaeric escaped. Tane offers to join you outside the city walls so you can both track Vaeric. Head to the western wall of Dazra, exit the gate, and the tracking begins.</p><h2>How to track Vaeric in Starfield</h2><p>Tane's tracker works by beeping slower or faster depending on what direction you're facing. If you're facing the right direction toward Vaeric, the tracker will beep faster. If you start going in the wrong direction, the tracker slows down. While you're free to use the tracker to successfully find Vaeric yourself, you can also look below at the map to see exactly where the tracker will lead you:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376796-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.50.23.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376796" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376796-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.50.23.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376796"></a><figcaption>The map showing where Vaeric's tracker leads</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376796-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.50.23.79.png"></figure><p>The tracker eventually leads you to an Abandoned Camp to the northwest of Dazra. Here, you need to investigate the camp for clues as to where Vaeric went, seeing as he's no longer at the camp. Here are the clues you need to investigate:</p><ul><li>The tracker laying next to the bed on a crate</li><li>The Vortex Spawn on the ground to the left of the bed</li><li>The footprints directly next to the Vortex Spawn (Bounty Hunter only)</li><li>The bloodstains on a rock to the right of the bed</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376806-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.50.44.51.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376806" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376806-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.50.44.51.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376806"></a><figcaption>The tracker is one clue you need to find at Vaeric's camp</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376806-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.50.44.51.png"></figure><p>Once you discover all of the available clues, you and Tane will be ambushed by Foul Vortex Horror enemies. These are new enemies in Shattered Space and they're all at level 49. The enemies can manipulate energy to teleport themselves and you, so you need to be careful around them. Vortex Horrors have powerful melee attacks and are quite fast and aggressive. There are three total Vortex Horrors to kill before you can proceed with the quest.</p><p>After all of the Vortex Horrors are dealt with, speak with Tane and tell him what you discovered at the camp. This leads to tracking Vaeric old school style by trying to pick up his footprint trail at the base of the camp. Follow your quest markers until you reach a farm. Speak to the NPC at the farm and convince them that you know Vaeric came through there. Remember to use discretion in dialogue to appease Viktor.</p><p>The NPC will reluctantly say that an injured person came through there a week ago and they patched him up and sent him on his way. You'll be given a general direction as to which way Vaeric went, which gives you another quest marker to follow. At the end of the quest marker, you'll stumble upon a farmhouse, which you can enter and investigate. Here are the clues you need to find in the house:</p><ul><li>Vaeric's Log - Entry 1 is sitting on a table in front of a couch on the top floor of the house</li><li>Vaeric's Computer is located in the back room of the house</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376807-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-23.07.23.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376807" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376807-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-23.07.23.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376807"></a><figcaption>Vaeric's Log Entry 1 is a clue you need to find in the house</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376807-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-23.07.23.76.png"></figure><p>With those clues discovered, head back outside to tell Tane what you found. However, you'll be interrupted by Vaeric, who's been living at the farm and caring for some animals.</p><h2>Deciding Vaeric's fate in Starfield</h2><p>During the conversation with Vaeric, you can choose to listen to his side of the story or be hostile towards him. If you want to kill and be done with Vaeric, simply pick dialogue options that say his father wants him dead. However, it's worth listening to Vaeric, as there is a peaceful resolution to the situation that makes both sides happy.</p><p>If you choose to hear Vaeric out, you'll learn that he didn't want to get involved with his father's politics. Instead, he simply wanted the choice to chart a course for his own life. He feels immensely burdened by what he's put his father through but still doesn't want to be the heir to House Veth'aal.</p><p>At the end of the dialogue, if you heard him out, you're left with three choices:</p><ul><li>Persuade Vaeric to return home</li><li>Tell him he's free to go, but you need his Signet Ring as proof of death for Viktor. You can also demand 10,000 Credits in addition to the ring with this option.</li><li>Attack him and take his Signet Ring as proof of death</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376813-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-23.14.37.96.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376813" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376813-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-23.14.37.96.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376813"></a><figcaption>Vaeric can either live, die, or face his father's judgement</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376813-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-23.14.37.96.png"></figure><p>The best outcome for all sides is to let Vaeric live but take his Signet Ring to give to Viktor. Persuading him to go home is another good option, but requires you to pass a persuasion check. There's no real point in attacking him unless you're playing that kind of character in Starfield.</p><p>In the end, you return to Viktor with a Signet Ring or with Vaeric. You'll get the power grid codes you need for the main story in Shattered Space and can continue helping the House Va'ruun factions.</p>

                <p>The Duel is a side quest you can begin fairly early on in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-starfield-shattered-space-dlc/2900-5808/" data-ref-id="2900-5808">Starfield Shattered Space</a> DLC. The quest starts by listening to a heated conversation between three individuals in the main courtyard of Dazra, the sacred city on Va'ruun'kai. After listening in to the conversation, you learn that all three of the individuals are siblings, with there being two brothers and one sister.</p><p>Once you talk to the siblings, you understand why they are having a heated discussion. One of the brothers, Amila, desecrated their mother's urn and this caused the other brother, Borhal, to challenge him to a duel. The Duel allows you to determine the outcome of the brothers by working with their sister, Danika, so what choices should you make?</p><h2>Can you stop the duel from happening in Starfield?</h2><p>First and foremost, it appears impossible to stop the duel from taking place. The first part of The Duel requires you to visit with Danika and then the two brothers, who are both hell-bent on facing the other in combat. However, Danika wants you to try and convince them to see reason.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376768-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-21.59.20.34.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376768" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376768-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-21.59.20.34.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376768"></a><figcaption>It seems the duel must occur, so you can only influence the outcome, not prevent it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376768-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-21.59.20.34.png"></figure><p>After you visit with both brothers and go through all of the dialogue options, you won't be able to change their minds. Borhal wants revenge on Amila for destroying their mother's urn but also states his brother has had this coming for a while. On the flip side, Amila is too proud to apologize to Borhal for his actions and has to go through with the duel. Despite your best efforts through the dialogue options, which includes pleading with both of them to stop the duel, both brothers will insist they fight to the death.</p><h2>All outcomes of The Duel in Starfield</h2><p>Once the brothers have decided to go forward with the duel, you can return to Danika and tell her of their intentions. Not pleased, Danika will concoct a new plan that revolves around tranquilizing both brothers to stop them from dueling. She gives you this responsibility and you can go directly to a new quest marker. Here, you'll find the ceremonial drinks the brothers toast with before the duel.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376779-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.07.34.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376779" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376779-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.07.34.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376779"></a><figcaption>Hello, 47.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376779-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.07.34.66.png"></figure><p>When you go to tranquilize the ceremonial drinks, you'll see you have four options: Tranquilize Amila, Tranquilize Borhal, Tranquilize Both, or Tranquilize Nobody. Below, you can see the outcome depending on what tranquilization choice you select:</p><ul><li><strong>Tranquilize Amila</strong>: Borhal thinks Amila is faking an illness and still proceeds to kill his brother. <strong>(Rewards: 5,000 Credits and XP)</strong></li><li><strong>Tranquilize Borhal</strong>: Amila doesn't care that Borhal is apparently sick and kills his brother anyway. <strong>(Rewards: 5,000 Credits and XP)</strong></li><li><strong>Tranquilize Both</strong>: Both brothers are too sick to fight but say the duel will take place another day. Danika is happy with the outcome and states that her brothers will see reason with more time. <strong>(Rewards: 4,000 Credits and XP)</strong></li><li><strong>Tranquilize Nobody</strong>: Both brothers drink from the glass and emerge unharmed, and Borhal kills Amila in combat. Danika is extremely unhappy with the player after this occurs, stating you are responsible for her brother's death. <strong>(Rewards: 5,000 Credits and XP)</strong></li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376780-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.18.12.74.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376780-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.18.12.74.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376780"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376780-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-22.18.12.74.png"></figure><p>So, the choice is really yours here depending on how you feel about the situation. If you want the most Credits possible, don't tranquilize both brothers. However, that does leave both of them alive for the duration of the Shattered Space DLC in Starfield.

            <p>
Microsoft has confirmed it's discontinuing its HoloLens line of mixed reality headsets, with production now ceased and software support on HoloLens 2 ending in December 2027.
</p>
<p>
HoloLens launched in its original form back in 2016, offering a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-need-usd3000-to-buy-a-microsoft-hololens-dev-kit">$3,000 USD mixed reality experience</a> that built on at least some of the technology featured in Microsoft's Kinect accessory for Xbox. It's perhaps best remembered in gaming circles for the striking (albeit never ultimately released) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYgqf9rhTIs">Minecraft demo</a> shown ahead of its launch in 2015.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's first HoloLens was surpassed by the $3,500 HoloLens 2 in 2019, and while the line-up never saw a consumer device, it did make inroads in enterprise usage, including healthcare, manufacturing, and education. Microsoft also signed a $479m contract to provide 100,000 HoloLens devices to the US military in 2018, a deal that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-employees-fight-armys-plans-to-use-hololens-tech-to-increase-lethality">didn't go down well with employees</a>.

<p>
Soon, though, HoloLens will be no more. Microsoft confirmed it's discontinuing the line in a statement <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/microsoft-discontinuing-hololens-2/">provided to UploadVR</a>. Production of HoloLens 2 has now officially ceased (manufacturing of the original HoloLens ended in 2018), with software support for HoloLens 1 set to end on 10th December this year. As for HoloLens 2, that'll continue to receive "updates to address critical security issues and software regressions" until 31st December 2027.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft does, however, say it remains "fully committed" to providing HoloLens technology to the US army as part of its Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), but no further HoloLens devices will be developed, despite previous hints at a HoloLens 3.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's mixed reality ambitions have more recently been focused on its partnership with Meta, with the company introducing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-heading-to-meta-quest-vr-headsets">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and Office web app support for Quest headsets. Meta, meanwhile, just unveiled its own glasses-style AR prototype, Orion.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-ceo-recognizes-the-companys-immaculate-reputation-may-be-gone-forever-after-cyberpunk-2077/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-ceo-recognizes-the-companys-immaculate-reputation-may-be-gone-forever-after-cyberpunk-2077/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CD Projekt was not long ago the biggest European developer in terms of market capitalization, despite only having made essentially one franchise (the trilogy of The Witcher) with an IP that was not even its own. The Polish studio had garnered an impeccable reputation with those three games, largely due to the overwhelming success of The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, and it seemed like it could do no wrong in the eyes of many gamers.</p>
<p>All that came crashing down following the hype and subsequent disappointment of Cyberpunk 2077's release, which launched with many bugs and performance issues, especially on old-generation consoles. As you might remember, Sony even undertook the nearly unprecedented action of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delisted-from-playstation-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removing the game made by CD Projekt from the PlayStation Store</a> until it was fixed.</p>
<p>It wasn't until June 2021, over six months after the game's release, that Sony allowed Cyberpunk 2077 back on the PlayStation store. By then, the studio had already considerably improved the worst issues, although the real game-changer was the combo Update 2.0 and Phantom Liberty expansion, both of which launched around a year ago to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent critical and fan reception</a>, not to mention <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-has-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a>.</p>
<p>In a retrospective article <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by Eurogamer</a> and focused on what transpired with Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt joint CEO Michał Nowakowski admitted that despite the successful turnaround of the gaming community's sentiment, the studio may never recover the sterling reputation it once had.</p>
<p><em>At the level of the board, it was: a) the realisation of what happened, b) we self-acknowledged that what happened was a big, big challenge and a big hit for the company.</em></p>
<p><em>None of us were actually even thinking about it in any financial terms, but it's a problem for the future that we were hoping to build for this company, for its perception amongst fans. And that's something that, to be honest, we've probably lost forever. And yes, you can repair some things, but it's a certain perception of the company that's never going to come back. Is that good or bad? I don't know, but it's a fact.</em></p>
<p>Paweł Sasko, CD Projekt Associate Director on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel (codenamed Project Orion and in development at the new Boston office), commented:</p>
<p><em>I accept and understand that it might be a situation that never happens for some of them. But that's unfortunately the price we have to pay for what happened. But I hope that, throughout the work that we are doing, throughout the things we are showing, we can actually win some of those people around - and when they hear someone talking to them about the incredible experiences they can have in, let's say Phantom Liberty, or the next Witcher, next Cyberpunk, or Hadar [CD Projekt's new IP], at the moment when they see there's that incredible value in that game, they will actually reach out for it, play it and enjoy it.</em></p>
<p>In a way, though, it might work out in CD Projekt's favor. They won't have to deal with unrealistic expectations like with Cyberpunk 2077; after all, there's no perfect developer, and consumers should always carefully evaluate a game before purchasing it.</p>

Hexworks and CI Games are working on a sequel to 2023 action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Lords Of The Fallen, itself a sequel to 2014 action-RPG Lords Of The Fallen. It's slated to launch in 2026. Will the new Lords Of The Fallen also be called Lords Of The Fallen? Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The new Lords Of The Fallen – again, not to be confused with Lords Of The Fallen, to say nothing of Lords Of The Fallen – is currently called Project 3. It appears on a new <a href="https://cigames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CI-Games-Strategy-Update-and-Product-Roadmap-2025-2028.pdf">CI Games strategy report</a>, spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-new-details/">Insider Gaming</a>. It’ll run on Unreal Engine 5 and feature such “gameplay improvements” as “increased game mode optionality, more commercial art style and narrative, elevated production values”, which I would roughly translate as “larger selection of modes, an art style and narrative that will appeal to more players, and an overall posher look and feel with, I don’t know, catchier menu fonts and suchlike”. It’ll have a single player campaign with full “shared-progression” co-op, and we can expect a proper announcement in 2025. Oh, and Epic have ponied up to make it exclusive to Epic Games Store on PC. Sad trombone!
</p>
<p>
Resident RPS Soulsliker Edders wasn’t especially sold on Lords Of The Fallen, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallen-review">declaring</a> that “realm-hopping magic can't keep this Soulslike from getting on your nerves”, but he did rate it higher than Lords Of The Fallen, which Rich Stanton <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallen-pc-review">summarised</a> as “the game so average it doesn't want you to play”. CI Games reckon the series has plenty of juice, however – in the report, they describe it as one of “two major evergreen franchises”, adding that the 2023 sequel accounted for 72 percent of company revenue in the first half of 2024.
</p>
<p>
CI’s other “major evergreen franchise” is camo-faced shooter Sniper Ghost Warrior, which is due another “major iteration” in 2027, again running on Unreal Engine 5. CI are partnering with an unnamed external studio on this one. It’ll be a mix of survival game and shooter, and development has been “expedited” by reusing a bunch of stuff from two other projects, “Project Survive” – described elsewhere in the report as a “new survival genre IP” - and “SGW Next”.
</p>
<p>
We have not written much about the Sniper Ghost Warrior series of late, though Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sniper-ghost-warrior-contracts-announced">did a banger pun</a> about Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts having a smaller focus back in 2018. I think the last one I played was a preview build of Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 in… 2016? I wasn’t massively enthused, but on the upside, I can at least write about several Sniper Ghost Warrior games at once without feeling like I'm the butt of the joke in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIGRgmxRfiE">Who's On First</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, CI Games have a “major new action-RPG” forthcoming from Underdog Studio, which will use “systems and architecture” from the most recent Lords Of The Fallen and whatever the next Lords Of The Fallen game is called. It’s currently in pre-production with a small team, and will hopefully go into production in late 2025, at which point Hexworks should be in position to help out by way of “cross-studio talent allocation”. All going to plan, it'll release in 2028.

Then a dedicated staff member at Games Workshop works closely with its partners to provide feedback to make sure everything is perfect.</p><p>“Let me give you an example,” Willits told <em>IGN</em>, “the ankle armor we had, the ankle armor was the wrong size and they told us that the ankle armor was wrong.”<br></p><p>Keep in mind that that large, hulking Space Marine design seen today in games, books, and comics, was created over 40 years ago for a tabletop strategy game. So what might work on a tiny plastic model doesn’t always translate easily to a fully animated 3D video game character.<br></p><p> “45 years ago when the guy that made the little Space Marine that sat on the table, he probably was not imagining them animating in a video game 45 years later,” said Willits, “And let me tell you, that was hard to make it. I mean, when you walk and run and fight as Titus, it feels so good. But you’ve seen people cosplay as a Space Marine, right? They can’t even walk down a hallway without falling.” </p><h2 id="h172301"><a id=""></a>Working with Games Workshop isn’t always easy</h2><p>However, while the CCO of Saber did admit that sometimes these notes and approvals can cause headaches, generally Games Workshop is more about “steering” devs and creators and not demanding changes. </p><p> “When we’re coming up with Tyranid attacks, they’re like, ‘Oh, that Tyranid doesn’t really attack like that,’ or ‘That Chaos Marine, you can’t really have him do that.’ So we had to adjust things. And we pushed them a little bit. We did push them a little bit.” </p><p>But Willits understands why Games Workshop is so protective of the franchise, saying that “you have to be” when you own and operate something as massive as the <em>W4Ok </em>universe. </p><p>“When you have a universe as big as Games Workshop has with <em>Warhammer</em>, you have to protect it like it’s your baby, because it is,” said Willits, “And there’s millions of people that love this franchise, and if we screw up an emblem or we make the chapter wrong, it’s just embarrassing.”</p><p>After four years of working on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-chaos-arena-1851659411&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-chaos-arena-1851659411"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a></span><em> </em>and making sure everything is lore accurate, Saber’s CCO says he’s “very proud” of what the team pulled off with the game as they “truly” respected and honored the franchise. </p><p>“And when you have the respect of your core fans, everything else is easier.” </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, that doesn’t mean it’s without a touch of magic. Indeed, the wildly successful action-RPG provides you with a handful of spells, used during encounters to turn the tide in your favor. And while each spell can be powerful, using each in the right scenario is the secret to unlocking their true power. So, to help you prioritize, let’s rank the spells in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> from worst to best.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h472"><a id=""></a><strong>7 - Life-Saving Strand</strong></h2><p>Coming in last place is Life-Saving Strand, the game’s only passive spell. It’s also the one that can only be obtained in NG+ mode, meaning you won’t even have access to it until you’ve already beaten the game. Lame.</p><p>Life-Saving Strand will automatically resurrect you one time after being killed, but its extraordinarily long cooldown, coupled with the fact that it doesn’t provide any other boons, makes it a very situational spell that is outclassed by every other incantation on offer in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p><h2 id="h473"><a id=""></a><strong>6 - Ring of Fire</strong></h2><p>Ring of Fire lets you apply—wait for it—a ring of fire on the ground. You can stand in to receive enhanced protection from enemy attacks, and while inside the ring, the effects of consumables are also improved.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ring of Fire’s strict focus on defense makes it suck in a game with attacking combat as frenetic as <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. Enemies come at you quickly, and require you to stay on the move far too much to make this spell truly feel worth keeping around.</p><h2 id="h474"><a id=""></a><strong>5 - Rock Solid</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="7c6faaca515b58b0f954f3f871a7914b" data-recommend-id="image://7c6faaca515b58b0f954f3f871a7914b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A madsplosion of colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A madsplosion of colors." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c6faaca515b58b0f954f3f871a7914b" data-recommend-id="image://7c6faaca515b58b0f954f3f871a7914b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A madsplosion of colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rock Solid is <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s parrying spell, letting you deflect an enemy’s attack and then unleash a counterattack. It can be great when you perfect your skill with it, and it has a short cooldown that allows you to make use of it frequently. However, it requires a lot of practice to nail the timing, and even slightly missing the right moment to cast the spell can result in unnecessary damage.</p><p>Sorry to sound like a broken record, but <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> has very fast-paced combat that makes dodging and quickly countering enemies the most efficient way to overcome challenges. As such, it’s hard to recommend Rock Solid unless you’re willing to invest a whole lot of time learning how to use it just right.</p><h2 id="h475"><a id=""></a><strong>4 - Spell Binder</strong></h2><p>Spell Binder is a pretty straightforward spell that increases your attack power. This can make you extremely powerful against enemies that are less affected by your other spells, allowing you to focus strictly on relentlessly whooping their asses with your staff. But there’s a downside.</p><p>Spell Binder uses all of your mana when cast, meaning that you won’t have any available for using other spells you may need against specific foes. This makes the spell situationally helpful, but it’s not easy to recommend it for every encounter, as other spells can be invaluable depending on the situation.</p><h2 id="h476"><a id=""></a><strong>3 - Cloud Step</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b776a170984ad04f42e9b654f7cdb38e" data-recommend-id="image://b776a170984ad04f42e9b654f7cdb38e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Disappearing by using cloud step." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Disappearing by using cloud step." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b776a170984ad04f42e9b654f7cdb38e" data-recommend-id="image://b776a170984ad04f42e9b654f7cdb38e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Disappearing by using cloud step." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Cloud Step lets you be a trickster of sorts, temporarily disappearing from your foes’ sight while leaving a decoy behind for them to attack. When you’re ready, you unleash an attack from the shadows that will deal more damage than your average attacks.</p><p>Cloud Step can be particularly useful against enemies with shields, letting you get behind them easily for an easy surprise attack. Its low mana cost and reasonable cooldown time also make it a good choice any time you just need a brief moment to analyze a situation. As such, <strong>it’s definitely one of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s must-use spells</strong>.</p><h2 id="h477"><a id=""></a><strong>2 - Immobilize</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="61e9522f042c546e338928a9bee27474" data-recommend-id="image://61e9522f042c546e338928a9bee27474" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Immobilizing an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Immobilizing an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61e9522f042c546e338928a9bee27474" data-recommend-id="image://61e9522f042c546e338928a9bee27474" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Immobilizing an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Immobilize is your bread and butter in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and could just as easily take the top spot due to how immensely important it is to your kit. This spell, which freezes enemies temporarily to allow you to beat the hell out of them without fear of retaliation, is <strong>one you’ll be using in almost every fight</strong> throughout the entire game.</p><p>Immobilize isn’t just good for offensive onslaughts. When facing off against aggressive enemies, using this spell can also give you a second to breathe and take a sip from your gourd, or pop a consumable to aid you in the battle. Use it. Use it a lot.</p><h2 id="h478"><a id=""></a><strong>1 - A Pluck of Many</strong></h2><p>Though it could be interchanged with Immobilize as the best spell in the game, I’ve decided to list A Pluck of Many as number one because of how easy it can make many encounters. This spell spawns clones of yourself that will rush forward and start walloping any enemies in the vicinity, and it’s so damn satisfying.</p><p>A Pluck of Many can help you cheese a lot of tough encounters, and in many cases, your little army of clones can demolish nearly half of the health bar of some bosses before you even have to lift a finger. It’s brutal. It’s effective. It’s awesome. Pluck ‘em up.</p><hr><p>Keep in mind that each of these spells has its use, and can be viable if your build supports them, so experiment and enjoy your time with the game your way. Just because my ranking is objectively correct and the best ranking of all the rankings forever and always doesn’t mean you can’t disagree and be wrong. Have fun!<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sharkmob London is laying off an unknown number of employees. The move comes after the studio cancelled a game that it was working on.</p>



<p>In a statement released to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sharkmob-london-faces-layoffs-after-game-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the studio says it is working through trying to determine how many layoffs need to be made.</p>







<p>“As you know, our industry is facing challenges, meaning we must adapt to focus on the right opportunities as a business,” the company said. “Our team in London has been working on an unannounced game for some time and it is with regret that we now have to announce that this project has been cancelled.</p>



<p>“The decision to cancel the game, unfortunately means there will be a reduction in the number of people we can support in the London studio. This is an incredibly difficult time, and our focus is to provide the support and guidance to those potentially impacted.”</p>



<p>As far as when the layoffs will actually take place, that remains to be seen. Sharkmob London was founded in 2020, and is one of two Sharkmob Studios. The other studio, Sharkmob Malmö, is currently working on the tactical extraction shooter Exoborne.</p>



<p>Sharkmob was purchased by Tencent in 2019. It’s first game, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt was released in 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/jason-schreier-on-unearthing-the-secrets-of-blizzards-long-history-in-his-eye-opening-new-book<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If various news events in recent years have ever caused you to wonder, “What the heck has been going on at Blizzard Entertainment?” Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier’s new book has an answer for you.</p><p>Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment is Schreier’s third book on the games industry, following Blood, Sweat, and Pixels (2017) and Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry (2021). While both of Schreier’s previous books canvas multiple studios along a particular theme, Play Nice turns a focused lens on one of the most interesting and tumultuous studios in video games.</p><p>Play Nice covers three decades of Blizzard history, bookended by the foundation of the company by Allen Adham and Mike Morhaime in 1991 and Adham’s most recent departure from the company at the start of this year. To tell the story, Schreier has interviewed over 300 current and former employees about their memories and experiences with Blizzard. The story canvases the company’s rash of hits: Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Hearthstone, as well as a number of canceled or otherwise less successful projects. It examines the ups and downs of the company itself as it passed between corporate owners, the internal culture that resulted in both deep company loyalty, and one of the most prominent work culture lawsuits in video game history. </p><p>Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment is out on October 8, 2024. Ahead of its release, I was able to read through the entirety of an advanced copy of the book before speaking to Schreier at length about its contents, his work on it, and some of the insights readers can expect to glean from such a close look at Blizzard’s history. Our conversation is published in full below, lightly edited for clarity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>So why Blizzard? What was most interesting about this specific company that warranted a book like this?</strong></p><p><strong>Jason Schreier:</strong> I think the idea first started formulating around 2018, when co-founder and CEO Mike Morhaime left the company, and when I first started hearing inklings that Activision was slowly taking over. And not just that they were taking over, but that there was this huge cultural clash between the way Activision did business and the way that Blizzard did business. And as I started hearing more and more about that, I didn't really actively start thinking like, "Oh, I need to write a book about this." But it started seeming to me like a really interesting story. And then as I was finishing up Press Reset, my last book, I think about a few months beforehand, I was thinking about, "Okay, what am I going to do next?" Because there's this huge buffer period between when you actually finish the book and when you publish it. So you're just sitting there, twiddling your thumbs, and waiting for it to come out.</p><p>So a few months before Press Reset, I was thinking, "What am I going to do next?" And I sent this pitch to my editor and my agent, I was like, "I have this idea that keeps popping into my head, that is the story of Blizzard. Its entire history, getting taken over by Activision, and what happens next." And then on top of that, I grew up playing Blizzard's games, Warcraft II especially, and StarCraft I, and Diablo II, which I spent many, many hours playing. So it seemed like a good... It was certainly a subject I knew a lot about and it seemed like a good fit for me. And then of course, in the summer of 2021, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california"><u>California sued Blizzard's parent company, Activision, Blizzard, for sexual discrimination and misconduct</u></a>. And that was kind of like, "Oh, okay. This book just took a twist and a turn."</p><p>And then the number of developments that have happened since then have just made it seem even more vital to tell this story and to get this out there. But yeah, that was the sequence of events. I had started early preliminary work on the book before the California lawsuit, and I remember sending an email to my editor and my agent on that day when it hit being like, "Well, holy crap. This is a new twist in the saga." And then I spent the next three years after that reporting, talking to many, many people and writing the book.</p><p><strong>I think there’s an expectation from some readers that this book is going to be all about all these horrible, salacious things that people imagine must have happened at Blizzard because of that lawsuit. And you talk about it in there, certainly you don't ignore it, but that's not really the meat of Play Nice at all. Was that different from what you expected?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> No, I mean, this is a story that I wanted to tell. And it's also like, if you talk to women who were at Blizzard for a long time, which I have talked to many of those women, a lot of them are like, "Look, I mean, Blizzard is a lot more complicated than just this place that has been kind of portrayed by the lawsuit and kind of gotten this reputation for being this awful place. I don't know, this den of sex pests and misconduct and harassment." And there were certainly problems that I talk a lot about in the book, but I think one of the conclusions I came to from talking to a lot of different women who worked there was that women saw it as this kind of contradictory place a lot of the time. Where it's like, there were a lot of awful things, but there were also so many good things.</p><p>I think that's an important kind of aspect of that to capture here, and to make it clear that there's nuance beyond the splashy headlines and the California lawsuit. And as you see in the book, there's a lot of stuff that the California lawsuit misconstrued or got wrong as well. The other part of this is that this is a company with 33 years of history, and a lot of that history just says a lot more and is a lot more kind of multifaceted than just cultural stuff. There's a lot of business aspects of this story that I think really are interesting in and of themselves, and also say a lot about the video game industry as a whole.</p><p>And I thought that was really important to capture. And obviously the development of so many killer franchises is also an interesting story. I don't think you can do a Blizzard story without diving into why Warcraft... How Warcraft was created and what made it such a hit. And how StarCraft was created, how Diablo was created. The thing that I really enjoyed about doing this book is that I uncovered so many wild anecdotes that I don't even know where to start when I'm talking to people about it. Because every single kind of aspect of Blizzard history has its own just bonkers twists and turns. And yeah, the cultural issues are very real and an important thing to talk about, but not the only part of Blizzard's story.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Since we're on the subject, in the book you establish how this sort of bro culture that's been reported at Blizzard over the years, was built over time, both through people's choices and also just through circumstances that people were in. What do you think that people should be taking away from that aspect of your book? Especially as we start talking more as an industry about cultures specifically like that and how to avoid them in the future.</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Yeah, it's really tough. I think that when you have these companies that were formed in the 90’s when the video game industry was almost entirely men, it's very hard to get out of that. And especially with companies like Blizzard. And now we're seeing Bungie, we're talking about Bungie a lot these days. And <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch"><u>you've reported on this quite a lot</u></a>. We're seeing companies where people have been working there for 30 years, and some of that experience might be really good and really helpful and valuable in today's video industry. But some of it is also, there are some bad habits that people pick up on. There's some bad cultural quirks or tendencies, or even really bad behavior that people carry with them, and that gets infused into the culture. I think if you are one of these companies, really if you're any video game company, you really have to do a lot of work to make sure that that isn't part of your company culture.</p><p>And video game companies especially, I talk a little bit in the book about how Blizzard was a place where people would go and wear flip-flops and t-shirts to the office. And they loved that about it. They called themselves a frat house back in the nineties. They described it in the 10-year anniversary video, which I discuss in the book, they describe it as more like a frat house than a business, than an office, in a really positive way. And I don't think that when they say that... You can interpret that in a lot of different ways, but I don't think when they say that they're imagining it in a negative, nasty, boys club sort of way. I think they're imagining it in a context of, "Look at all these other companies where they have to wear button-down shirts and khakis to work, and work these strict hours and don't play games with each other, barely talk to each other. Here we are at Blizzard, we're all wearing flip-flops and t-shirts, and playing games together and hanging out after work. And this place is awesome. It's like being in a frat house."</p><p>And with that, you have to look at the positive and the negative, and there is a lot of negative with that. And you have to, as a company, kind of figure out how to deal with that. And maybe you do set boundaries or maybe you find ways to make sure that everyone is feeling inclusive, even if you are a casual place where people can wear gaming t-shirts to work and hang out with each other on the weekends and stuff like that. So yeah, I mean, I don't think there are easy answers to a lot of these questions, but you certainly need to be discussing them. And I think one of the things that Blizzard wasn't good at, especially during the 2000s, as more women started joining the company…was having that conversation, and looking around and people being like, "Wait a minute, why are so many people here dating each other and married to each other? Even high level people with people below them at the company.” Like, "Is this a little funky? Should we talk about this?" And I think that's the sort of thing that nowadays, will be discussed a lot more, and I think that's a very good step.</p><p><strong>When I asked about why you were doing this book, you'd mentioned the tension of Activision taking over. And certainly I'm a big WoW player, so the thing in the WoW community is, "Oh, World of Warcraft (WoW) used to be so good before Activision showed up and ruined everything.” And I think your book paints a much more nuanced picture of that relationship and the struggles that Blizzard had with Activision, but also the struggles that were sort of self-inflicted. I'm curious where you came down on it. Do you ultimately feel that Activision was good for Blizzard?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Yeah, it's interesting. I think that, not to sound too centrist-y here, but I think this is a case where Blizzard was so far on one end of the spectrum of, "We are going to be creative and take our time, and do what we want and have false starts, and let people just really take their time." And I talk quite a few times in the book about Blizzard's kind of glacial way of doing things, all the way up to them taking months to do tasks that, at other companies, might take a few days or a few weeks. That's one end of the spectrum. And then on the other end of the spectrum, entirely, completely polar opposite, you have Activision with their commercial-driven, "Release date comes first. We are putting out a Call of Duty every single year, no matter what it takes. And we will pull any sort of money and people resource to make that happen."</p><p>And those two, instead of finding a way to meet in the middle, for various reasons, they just could not. And there was no room for compromise. And you had a lot of strong personalities, especially on the Activision end, coming in and trying to yank Blizzard all the way to their point of view. And it just did not work out. But I will say, I mean…WoW was a good example. I mean, that game's kind of woes and flaws over the years, a lot of people point at Cataclysm as the first big turning point for WoW. And that wasn't Activision's doing, that was entirely Blizzard. Bobby Kotick is not coming in and being like, "You need to destroy the world. Or you need to add Dungeon Finder or whatever." All the stuff that actually changed on a creative level with WoW, including a bunch of stuff that fans didn't like, that was entirely Blizzard's doing.</p><p>That said, there were pressures for sure coming up from above… And one of the things I've seen over the years is this belief that Activision was coming in and being like, "You need to do things cheaper." And I actually think it was kind of the opposite approach where Activision was coming in and saying, "You need to hire 400 more developers so you can make these games more quickly." Which is a very different sort of problem set to solve for a company like Blizzard. But very different than the Reddit sentiment I've seen where people just think Bobby is going around cutting costs and slashing people's budgets, and stuff like that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>This might just be what we just talked about, but your book very much canvases a lot of ups and downs over time for Blizzard. It changed leaders, personnel, owners, projects, all this stuff. Do you think that there's any one specific turning point or inflection point for them?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> If you go back in history, I think a lot of people think that... A lot of people seem to believe that Activision bought Blizzard or Activision merged with Blizzard, and before then, they were independent and doing all great, and having autonomy and stuff. But really, I mean, Blizzard's path to what it is today started in 1994, when Mike Morhaime and Alan Adham decided to sell the company to Davidson and Associates, which of course was the education software company behind Math Blaster of all things. And from there, it just shuffled around in this kind of ridiculous whirlwind of going from a mail order catalog company to this debacle of a merger that was this company called Sendin. That, of course, was almost immediately investigated by SEC for fraud, a story you can read about in the book. And then moving to Vivendi, a French utilities company. And then eventually moving to Activision.</p><p>And that shuffling was really entirely out of the hands of the Blizzard folks. And there was one point during the early Vivendi drama days, in the early 2000s, where the people who ran Blizzard were looking into and came close to potentially spinning out and trying to go independent, trying to buy back the company for themselves. And that didn't happen. But they had kind of lost their agency as a company. They did not make the business decisions for their company because they always had a parent company since then. So that really is the turning point. And then of course the merger with Activision really just kind of completely changed things for Blizzard. Seemed like a good move at the time. Escaping Vivendi was pretty essential for them at that point. But obviously, did not go well in the long run. And I think if the people who ran Blizzard at the time could go back in history and prevent that from happening, I think they probably would.</p><p><strong>I want to hit on a couple specific things that were in the book that stood out to me. Pretty early on, you almost nonchalantly mentioned, I don't know that I'd ever read about this anywhere else, a Blizzard Star Wars game that got discussed for five minutes and then didn't even make it to a prototype. Are there any more details on that that you're able to share at all?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Fantastic catch. Yes. So I too, when I heard about that from early Blizzard people, I was like, "Whoa, is this a scoop from 1995 that nobody has ever revealed?" Because no, nobody's ever talked about it before publicly, and that's because it was never really real. So what happened was, Blizzard was working on this game called Shattered Nations, and it was canceled for various reasons, even after being announced. It was announced publicly and then it was quietly canceled.</p><p>And then Allen Adham, who was the president of Blizzard at the time, and he was one of the two co-founders of the company, he came to everybody and was like, "Look, we're not going to do Shattered Nations, but we have this other potential thing that we're going to do, which is we're going to work with [George] Lucas and we're going to make this Star Wars RTS game. And it's going to be awesome." And so people started getting really excited and making concept art, yada, yada, yada. But I actually spoke to Jack Sorensen, who was president of Lucas Arts at the time. And he said he didn't remember anything like that. So it couldn't have gotten that far. And so, I'm not sure how real it really was. A lot of the kind of lower level Blizzard employees were pretty stoked about it, but I'm not sure how long it lasted. It couldn't have been more than a couple of months. And despite them drawing some really exciting AT-ATs going at it and stuff like that, it never actually came to fruition. But yeah, that's a fun bit of history.</p><p>And then of course it would eventually turn into StarCraft because they were like, "Hey, we like the idea of doing a sci-fi, real-time strategy game, so let's make StarCraft out of this." But yeah, the Star Wars project never actually came to fruition, but it's a fun little kind of what if moment in Blizzard history for sure.</p><p><strong>Another thing that jumped out, I didn't realize the circumstances around the closure of Blizzard North, and I'm still I guess trying to wrap my head around it. Did the company leaders get fired because of the culture? Was it over the email they sent? Can you clarify what was happening there?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> The context here is that this is 2003, and Vivendi, Blizzard's parent company, is just constantly in the news for all sorts of drama, all sorts of struggles. It's billions of dollars in debt. And everybody's like, "Why does Vivendi own an entertainment conglomerate?" It had parts of Universal. It was a mess. And so there were these rumors hitting the press about Vivendi potentially selling off its games division to Microsoft or Take-Two. And all these other suitors. And the Blizzard North bosses, David Brevik, [Erich and Max] Schaefer, and Bill Roper, all get together and they're like, "This is messed up. We need to be able to communicate to our employees what's going on, and we don't know what's going on. We're seeing these rumors in the press without hearing it from Vivendi." So they got together and they sent this email to Vivendi being like, "We plan to resign if we do not get this, this, and this and this."</p><p>Essentially, it was a threat. And Vivendi responded by accepting their resignation. And Mike Morhaime and his group of executives flew up to Blizzard North and they said, "Goodbye." And put in a new person and laid off some people, and refocused the studio. The other piece of context here that's important is that after Diablo II, which came out in 2000, and the next expansion came out the following year, Blizzard North was really floundering. And they were going off in all sorts of different directions, working on all these different projects that just were not coming together. In some cases, like playing video games all day instead of actually working. And so I think that maybe there would've been more pushback, either on a Blizzard South level or an executive level, somewhere, there would've been more pushback to the idea of accepting their resignations if there was more productivity out of Blizzard North.</p><p>And in fact, David Brevik, who was the director of the first two Diablo games and really seen as kind of the lead visionary and also president of the studio, Mike Morhaime came to him as this was all going down and being like, "Hey, if you want to stay, we'd love to keep you around, but not the rest of the bosses." And he was like, "No, I'm not going to do that to my co-founders." But I think in other words, it was partially them making this big grand gesture and resigning, and then partially the studio not being in good shape at the time, that led to... But they were never fired. Technically they resigned and their resignations were accepted. Yeah.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p><strong>I noticed also that you didn't say too much about Odyssey in the book, the survival game. I know you've reported on it before. Was there anything new you learned about it that you can share?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> I think that game certainly seemed promising. I've seen some footage of it, it looked pretty. I think that I mentioned towards the end of the book a little bit about how it went through these technical challenges. But they had this concept at Blizzard to do this shared, company-wide game engine, which of course is the tech and tool set behind games. And Odyssey was going to use that… then the shared engine actually turned into the Odyssey engine, and they abandoned the idea of doing a shared engine. And they really struggled to get that thing working and to be able to get it to a point where they could actually make the game in it. So it came to the point where they had a ton of people on that team, they were trying to figure out how to enter production, and they realized they couldn't. And it was canceled as part of the big Microsoft layoffs earlier this year.</p><p>That game was in development for a very long time. It was pitched around 2016, 2017, something like that, as Blizzard's take on Rust. And there were some people really excited about the first couple of prototypes, which were done in Unreal Engine. And there was this notion among some people being like, "Hey, we should just put this out there because it's cooler than all the other early access survival games, and we could really seize on this." But there were other people at Blizzard who were like, "No, we're Blizzard. We make these big, epic games that sell millions and millions of copies. We don't want to just be another Valheim that maybe sells a few million and then is just in early access forever. And then it's just another survival game. We want to be the big Blizzard thing." And again, I mean to my point earlier about Blizzard moving slowly, this is a prime example of that, where maybe if they had released it after a couple of years instead of taking this six, seven year period to make it, and switching engines, then things might have looked differently for that project.</p><p><strong>You talk in the book about Chris Metzen returning to Blizzard, and in the last year he has taken on a more prominent role on Warcraft specifically. Did this surprise you? Do you have any thoughts about how his sort of grand return or whatever, might impact the direction of Warcraft as a whole or the company as a whole?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> I think it's really interesting. It certainly has fans jazzed because fans have always loved Metzen and his work, and his storytelling and his big, bombastic performances and showings, and him screaming, "Horde! Alliance!" at the BlizzCons. He's always been a fan favorite. And yeah, I think he brings... It's interesting, I was looking at the credits for Warcraft I, and I think after the most recent round of layoffs, which led to a few of the 30-year Blizzard veterans leaving as well, people like Sam Didier. Well, he actually left a couple months before the layoffs, but still. And people like Bob Fitch, I believe he left during that layoff, and he was one of the first Blizzard employees. What I'm getting at is that if you look at the Warcraft I credits, Metzen is now the only remaining person at the studio I believe, who worked on Warcraft I.</p><p>I think that him being there, him coming back brings a little bit of that old school Blizzard culture, for better or for worse, to the equation. Although, obviously Metzen, like most people, has changed a lot since his twenties. I have no indication in my reporting or anyone's reporting that Metzen was problematic in the way that some of the other people who have been named were problematic. And I think that there's something... I think if you're Blizzard, it's probably pretty important to have some of that kind of old school mentality around, even in a small dose. And having someone like Metzen around probably helps a lot of people boost the morale and makes people feel like, "Okay, this is still Blizzard. No matter what we've been through over the last few years, this is still Blizzard."</p><p><strong>It's interesting to see the community's obsession with him. People view him as this sort of savior, especially given his associations with the character, Thrall, in the lore.</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> I think that people tend to ascribe a little too much importance to single people for games, and there does tend to be a lot more collaboration. And anyone who's done anything creatively with a group of people knows that you can never really assign that much credit. A lot of it just comes... Ideas just kind of turn into a big stew and nobody could really take credit. I mean, even in Blizzard's case, in the case of this book, I went around actually, because I was very curious, and I asked a bunch of people who worked on vanilla World of Warcraft back before it actually came out. I said, "Hey, where did the name World of Warcraft come from?" And people were just like... Nobody really knows. It just kind of popped up. Everyone just started using it. And in the same way, a bunch of people all thought they had the idea to make a Warcraft version of EverQuest, that eventually turned into World of Warcraft.</p><p>Sometimes at a game studio, or on a game team within a studio, something just gets in the air, or ideas just kind of pop up and nobody really knows where they came from. In the case of Metzen, I mean he did play a pretty integral role in writing the story for a lot of Blizzard's games, for really most of Blizzard's games. So I think there is reason to look at him and be like, "Okay, if he had ideas for where this story of the Warcraft universe was going to go, maybe that's kind of coming now." But Blizzard has a lot of writers and a lot of people working on the story, and I think that you can't really give too much credit to a single person.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Your book ends on a real downer note for RTS fans. It sounds kind of like any dreams of Warcraft IV or StarCraft III got squashed when Tim Morten left. Do you think there's any hope?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier: </strong>No.</p><p><strong>That’s really sad!</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> I think there's hope for the IPs, like StarCraft definitely isn't dead. But the idea of a Warcraft IV or a StarCraft III does not seem very likely at Blizzard. And even one of the problems that Tim Morten, who was a production director on StarCraft II and tried to really get a new RTS game off the ground in the later years of Blizzard's history, even the problem he ran into was that he couldn't find a person who would be a really good director for that game, someone who had the experience making RTS games, and also most importantly, the interest in making a new RTS game.</p><p>And so, I think that was a bit of a struggle there. Because someone like Dustin Browder, for example, who was the director of StarCraft II, went off and worked on this new project, Aries, that was a shooter game. So a lot of times, it comes down to the people. And if the people aren't interested in actually making a game like that, then it's not going to happen. That said, I mean, there are a lot of spiritual successors to those games. Morten's game, Stormgate, just entered early access. And Battle Aces from David Kim, who was another StarCraft designer, and his team, that is imminent as well. So there are some games like that. But yeah, I would not hold your breath for one from Blizzard anytime soon.</p><p><strong>I don't know if I'm off base for thinking this, but there does seem to be sort of a phenomenon with Blizzard, maybe more so than most other companies, where so many other companies kind of spiral out of it. You're referring to a bunch of people who worked at Blizzard for a long time, became very known for their contributions, left, and then started their own studios, with sort of leaning on that Blizzard pedigree or that Blizzard culture. I feel like Blizzard has way more than most other studios. Do you get that sense as well? Why do you think that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Yeah, Riot is up there too these days… I think there are a couple reasons for that. One is that, as the book illustrates, there was a period, starting around 2018, really starting when Mike Morhaime left, when Blizzard was just losing so many veterans every single week that the company stopped sending emails about it because there were so many to announce. And it was demoralizing people.</p><p>And all of those people... Not all of those people, but a good number of those people went off and wanted to do new things, and wanted to start smaller teams. And especially a lot of the Blizzard veterans, and I'm actually writing an article about this for Bloomberg, there's this trend of veteran people who have worked in the video game industry for 10, 15, 20 years, looking around and being like, "We don't want to be on these teams of hundreds of people anymore. We want to go and do these smaller, focused studios where we can get back to the days where we could all fit in a single room and discuss ideas, and know each other's names and stuff like that, instead of being part of these big, massive, AAA machines."</p><p>So that's a big part of it. The other big part of it is that having that Blizzard cache makes it easier to tell a story about your studio. Which means it's easier to get investors, it's easier to get marketing and headlines, and gaming websites that are like, "Look at what these ex-Blizzard developers are doing." So it gives you more of a story to tell. That's another big reason. And then, yeah, I mean, I think the third reason is being able to do games that you wouldn't be able to do at Blizzard, whether it's RTS or whether it's other types of games that Blizzard shut down. There's a company called Notorious that was started by a guy named Chris Kaleiki, who essentially was like, "Look, I'm not able... Blizzard is not interested in this pitch that I'm doing, so I want to go and make a version of it somewhere else."</p><p>Or, because Blizzard expects their games to sell tens of millions of copies, and they're like, "We want to make a smaller, focused game that could potentially sell one million copies and do just fine for us because we're a team of 50 people instead of a team of 500 people." So yeah, there are a lot of potential reasons for that. And then also Blizzard, with so many people that inevitably there are going to be a lot of ex-Blizzard people who go and make stuff. </p><p><strong>Do you have any impressions from your work on this book, or thoughts on what Microsoft's acquisition of this company is going to change for it long term? Especially from the perspective of company and creative direction. Blizzard's now embedded basically three or four companies deep. So I'm curious if you think it still gets to be Blizzard.</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> I think that what nobody foresaw when it happened was that the Blizzard deal would close. It closed about a year ago, as of when the book will be out. So October 13th of last year. Nobody foresaw that Microsoft would be going through these massive... Or Xbox would be going through the massive changes that it is this year. And if you told someone two years ago, "Oh yeah, Xbox is going to have this year where they lay off thousands of people. And also they start releasing their games on PlayStation and all this other stuff. And shut down the makers of Hi-Fi Rush and all this other stuff," people would've been like, "What are you talking about? What are you smoking?" So it's hard to make predictions about what all this means because nobody even knows what Xbox is going to look like as a brand in two years.</p><p>But I do think that there's optimism on the Blizzard level about not reporting to the former Activision C-suite anymore. I think that's been big as far as morale and as far as what people want to do, are able to do. But yeah, I mean, as far as overall product strategy and roadmap for the next five, ten years, all bets are off. I will say, I mean, I've heard a lot of good things about Johanna Faries, who's the new president of Blizzard as of February. I think there's optimism around her and what she can bring to the table. So yeah, I guess we'll see.</p><p><strong>I mean certainly reporting up to Microsoft as opposed to the Activision C-suite, one of the main things we've already seen it lead to is this </strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-agrees-neutral-approach-future-activision-blizzard-unions"><u><strong>wave of unionization</strong></u></a><strong>, right? In World of Warcraft, </strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-entire-development-team-has-officially-unionized"><u><strong>the wall-to-wall Union over there</strong></u></a><strong>, I mean, that's huge. That's one of the biggest games out there, getting a five-hundred-person-something-strong union. Is this something that you thought was possible when you were putting this book together? Do you think there's any factors that made Blizzard right for this, apart from the fact that Microsoft just has this open policy about unions?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier</strong>: I think that this would not have happened if not for the California lawsuit, because I think that was the first domino really. After the California lawsuit, a lot of Blizzard employees, they started a big Discord for ABK people, ABK being Activision Blizzard King, the whole company. And a Discord so that they could have unofficial chats. And there was a lot more communication outside of official work channels and outside of work hours, as people started organizing... It was walk-ins or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-walkout"><u>walk-outs</u></a>, whatever you want to call it, picket lines, assemblies you might say, to protest Activision's reactions to the California lawsuit. And there were people standing in front of Blizzard's gates with signs and masks on, and just protesting Bobby Kotick and his responses to the lawsuit.</p><p>And I think that was really the first wave of organization. There had been some the year before, when people started talking about salaries within Blizzard and starting a spreadsheet, and pushing back against the administration about how much money they were making, and feeling like it was unfair and feeling like this big compensation review that they did was unfair. But really, the California lawsuit kind of spurred a lot of that stuff. And then what always happens, I mean, things move slowly and there are fits and starts along the way. What always, always happens in a lot of these companies is that the people who are most likely to be union organizers are also really unhappy or angry, and that's what's helping incentivize that. And then they wind up leaving and then there's nobody to fill their spot. So that happens a lot. And it's also really hard to organize because it's essentially doing another full-time job. So it took a lot for that to start happening.</p><p>And then of course, under the Activision regime, there was a lot of pushing back against unions...There were emails from Brian Bulatao, who was a C-suite member at the time, saying, "Hey, here are some reasons why organizing isn't a good idea for this company." And so, as part of Microsoft buying Activision, as part of its concessions to the FDC, as part of the whole antitrust regulation process, Microsoft agreed to take a stance of neutrality, which I think helped a lot when it came to actually getting this off the ground. So yeah, it was a lot of factors working together. To answer your question, I wouldn't say that I didn't envision it. In fact, the buzz I was hearing all along was that it was going to happen and people were having these active conversations. I couldn't have guessed that it would be the WoW team that was first to do it or anything like that. But yeah, it does not surprise me that this happened.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Activision Blizzard Lawsuit Timeline: The Story So Far</h3></div></output><p><strong>I know everybody is likely quite curious about what Blizzard's internal culture is like now, since the lawsuit has come out, it has been settled, all these things have happened. Do you get the sense that things are improving?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Yeah. Things were improving even when the lawsuit hit. I think that the lawsuit... The lawsuit definitely was referring to specific people and specific problems that had been identified by Blizzard's management and then changed. That's not to say everything was perfect. I mean, after the lawsuit hit, there were dozens of people who were either reprimanded or let go in the wake of that. So certainly more change needed to happen. But this was an ongoing cultural change. I mean, some of the people that I name in the book is some of the most accused people, people like Alex Afraciabi, who was the creative director on WoW for a while, and Ben Kilgore, who was the chief technology officer, those people had been exited, specifically let go by Blizzard in previous years, before the lawsuit. But yeah, the lawsuit definitely catalyzed things. And I think what we're seeing now at a lot of game companies is more willingness to speak out. People who are just not really going to tolerate this sort of stuff anymore.</p><p>So yeah, I mean, I certainly have gotten the sense. But it's really hard to talk about Blizzard culture as a whole because so much of it is so team- and department- specific. So I think people's experiences on, I don't know, the Overwatch team, are very different than their experiences on the Diablo team, as an example. And then these days, so many people are remote that they're having drastically different experiences. It's very hard to... If you're a woman working at a games company, and you're working remotely, I think the chances of you facing some of the same sort of bullshit you might if you went into an office are much lower. So that's played a big role as well. And then obviously during COVID, everyone was remote. So yeah, there are a lot of factors at play here. But overall, I would say the video game industry is slowly inching toward progress, one small footstep at a time.</p><p><strong>Are there any lingering questions you had about Blizzard and its history, or anything going into this book, that you weren't able to answer?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier</strong>: Nothing I can think of. I think the book is hopefully pretty definitive when it comes to telling the Blizzard story. I think the biggest complaint about this book will be that even though it's a hundred thousand words, like 380 pages or whatever it is, I think people will say, "Man, I wish he had spent more time on this thing or this thing." Because when you're talking about the 33-year history of a company with as many games and teams and sagas that Blizzard went through, I think people are always going to be like, "Oh, why wasn't this thing mentioned? Why wasn't that mentioned?" But at the end of the day, I needed this book to be a manageable size so it can fit on shelves, and people will actually want to read the whole thing, that aren't just hardcore Blizzard fans. So I did have to leave some stuff out. But no, I don't have any lingering questions, at least that I can think of right now.</p><p><strong>Are there any wild stories or just silly facts that you didn't include, but you're just dying to share?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Oh, man. Let me think. Yeah, here's a fun story. So let me make sure I'm telling this the correct way. So back in the mid-nineties, when Blizzard was just a few dozen people, they played a lot of games in the office and they would even make up their own games. And there was this programmer who created this game that was sort of like a mix of Risk and Magic, The Gathering, where everyone had different territory and you would battle each other through magic games, and you would capture territory.</p><p>And there was a lot of politics involved. So people would just kind of betray each other, form alliances and stuff like that. And basically, long story short, this guy named James Phinney, who was a designer there, programmer turned designer, he concocted this scheme to get someone else to betray Alan Adham, the president and founder of the company, and come to James's side, so James could then defeat Alan Adham. And Alan looks at him after this betrayal and he is like, "Oh, James, you son of a gun. You have my respect now." And James Phinney believes …this epic orchestration of strategy is at least one of the reasons that Alan Adham then gave James the responsibility of lead designer of StarCraft I. So turns out, if you play games in the office really well, you might get ahead at the studio.</p><p><strong>Was there anything in this book that you discovered that surprised you?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Everything. Yeah, a ton of stuff surprised me.</p><p><strong>Well, you've been on the beat for so long, at a certain point, I assume that not too much surprises you at all.</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Yeah, but you know what? I think when you're going into history, there might be stuff that's publicly documented but you don't necessarily know about. I mean, even just to pick a random example, and there's a ton of stuff in here that really surprised me, but to pick a random example, diving into the history of Activision and how Bobby Kotick wound up taking it over and leading it out of bankruptcy into the behemoth it is today, is just so wild.</p><p>And a lot of that stuff has been... Some of the stuff I'm revealing for the first time, or at least packaging for the first time in the way that this is told, but still, most people don't know it. Most people don't know how Bobby Kotick kind of happened to sit next to this guy Steve Wynn at a fundraiser in Texas and befriended him. And Steve Wynn, of course the casino mogul, who would then go on to become Bobby Kotick's godfather and mentor and biggest business advocate, helped Bobby put together this deal and kind of hostile takeover, to take over Activision and then turn it around as a business. And that whole saga is just mind-boggling.</p><p><strong>Is there anything that I'm not asking you about that you are just dying to talk about?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> So many things. The thing about this book is that there's so many directions that I could go in. There's so much stuff we haven't gotten into. Everything from the Overwatch story to the Hearthstone story, to the Diablo redemption story, to Armin Zerza, who became the kind of CFO of Blizzard. And he's quite a personality. God, there's just so much stuff that we could get into. Yeah, I don't know. I hope this book resonates with folks. I think it will. I think people will enjoy reading it. I think what really is exciting to me about this book is that hopefully it's appealing even to people who don't care about Blizzard or don't play their games, or just have a cursory interest in Blizzard. Because I think the story of Blizzard just says so much overall about the entire gaming industry, both from a business perspective and from a cultural perspective, and from a creative perspective too. I just think it's a very illuminating story for a lot of different reasons.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

Among the best of them is the bed, which was featured in various trailers and is seemingly intended to get players comfortable with the game's echo mechanics. But as time passes, Zelda fans are finding more and more uses for this unassuming item.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Nintendo UK (@NintendoUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1830915070575939645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Not only can beds be used to traverse gaps, they offer an easy way to regain health, too. But there are more advanced uses as well. One enterprising player posted a video showing how they were able to combine a bed with a tornado echo to gain access to a normally unreachable area, which has some interesting applications for speedrunning.</p><p>As time has passed, fans have started to pay tribute to Echoes of Wisdom memes with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1ft1mze/gimme_a_stack_o_beds_anyday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social posts</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1fthh03/eow_literally_any_platforming_challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memes</a>. There have also been some early debates on whether it's more useful than the water tower, another popular echo, though the bed seems to have the advantage thanks to sheer versatility. </p><p>All of this is an echo (ahem) of the appeal of Tears of the Kingdom, which saw players use items in all kinds of creative ways to solve problems (or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-kingdom-how-to-build-mech-zonai">build killer mechs</a>).

                <p>While the 2024 iteration of Fortnitemares hasn't yet been announced, this week's Fortnite update included a loading screen that appears to be the key art for this year's version of Fortnite's annual spooky event--and it spills the beans on six new skins you'll be able to buy this October. The headliners are two new horror movie collab skins: Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Billy the Puppet from Saw.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4376784-fortnitemares2024leatherfacebillysaw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376784" data-ratio="0.56246401842257" data-width="1737" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4376784-fortnitemares2024leatherfacebillysaw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376784"></a><figcaption>Fortnite's newest Fortnitemares event looks packed with horror collabs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4376784-fortnitemares2024leatherfacebillysaw.jpg"></figure><p>On top of that, there are five other previously unrevealed new skins here. There's a new purple version of Guff, a new remix of Red Knight that glows purple, a pumpkin remix of Ultima Knight, a witchy new iteration of Lexa, and a spooky new version of Marshmello. Considering how Epic has handled the Ariana Grande and J Balvin Icon skins lately, it's very possible that this new Marshmello is an entirely new skin that will have to be purchased separately, rather than a new style for the existing Marshmello skin.</p><p>We don't really know much else about what's in store for Fortnitemares this year since nothing has been announced yet, but it usually involves at least one existing map location being converted into a new creepy place, and a mythic gameplay item of some sort--<a href="https://x.com/Guille_GAG/status/1841034240189681936" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leakers indicate</a> it may be an exploding Saw puppet on a tricycle.</p><p>The gameplay details of Fortnitemares is hardly the only part of it that remains under wraps--we don't actually even know when it starts. But we have a big potential clue: There will be <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1841115998948053458" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some sort of battle royale live event</a> taking place this Saturday, December 5 at 2pm ET, according to a new countdown on the map. With four weeks left in the season, it's a bit early for a season finale event, so it could be that Doctor Doom is going to unleash the Fortnitemares himself.</p><p>Aside from the skins in the image, there are two other reported upcoming collabs that we just learned about. Shaquille O'Neal will be getting a <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1840859765548707889" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set of Icon skins this week</a>, and it also appears as though Sally and the Pumpkin King from The Nightmare Before Christmas <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1841036058206577075" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">are being added</a>. If you're a Fortnite cosmetics collector, this October is looking pretty expensive--but, hey, it's nice to have options.</p>

The patch notes reveal buffs for several Modern Warfare 2 weapons. Other small changes include spawn adjustments for Shipment map variants in multiplayer and improvements for challenges in Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">For Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer, the update adjusts the spawns for Shipment maps to make them more consistent across the different variants. The developer says this change was based on player feedback and analytics, which revealed the spawn quality was better on the Shipmas version of the map, so now all Shipment maps should have spawns more in line with the Christmas variant.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - The Haunting Season 6 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The crossbow from Modern Warfare 2 received a significant buff to make it more viable to use. The changes include an 81% increase to the bolt velocity, a 70% decrease to bolt-gravity influence, and a small increase to the neck-damage multiplier. The update also removes the aim-down-sight spread for the Brightblaze, Blastcap, and Caustic 20" bolt types.</p><p dir="ltr">Several shotguns from Modern Warfare 2 are buffed. This includes damage-range buffs for the KV Broadside, Lockwood 300, Expedite 12, Bryson 800, and the Bryson 890. Buffs are also included for MW2 handguns, which aim to improve the damage and damage range of the pistols. This list includes the P890, .50 GS, X12, and Basilisk handguns.</p><p dir="ltr">While last year's guns are getting improvements, Season 6's DTIR 30-06 battle rifle is nerfed for multiplayer. The gun received a slight decrease to the lower-torso damage multiplier, with a drop from 1.3x to 1.0x.</p><p dir="ltr">The update is much smaller on the Warzone side. The only weapon balancing is the crossbow change. MW2's crossbow receives a similar buff as mentioned above for multiplayer. The neck-damage multiplier didn't get adjusted, but it does have the 81% increase to the bolt velocity and a 70% decrease to bolt-gravity influence. It also removes the aim-down-sight spread for the Brightblaze, Blastcap, and Caustic 20" bolt types.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes include an adjustment to the Terriball challenge for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzones-new-purgatory-ltm-cant-be-won-and-thats-why-its-great/1100-6526671/">Warzone's Purgatory LTM mode</a>.

The team wants to take a "new approach" to licensed games after working on titles like John Wick Hex and Hellboy: Web of Wyrd.</p><p dir="ltr">No new games were unveiled with the introduction of Big Fan Games. The publisher notes that it wants to work with indie developers on games that aren't just "marketing tie-ins" to help launch a movie or comic book.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grounded-no-longer-requires-microsoft-accounts-on-steam-for-multiplayer.997596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grounded-steam-microsoft-account<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new update for downsized survival game&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>has been released, and if you're not a fan of having to sign into your Microsoft account when you play on Steam, this is the update for you.</p>
<p>Per the update's (admittedly small) <a href="https://grounded.obsidian.net/news/grounded/grounded-patch-145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, you'll no longer need to sign into your Microsoft account if you want to play&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>'s multiplayer modes with your friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're not logged into your Microsoft account, you can now host and join standard multiplayer sessions with other players who are already on your Steam friends list, so if you've been hoping to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>without your Microsoft account getting in the way, today's your lucky day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grounded-microsoft-account-steam-multiplayer.jpg?itok=o2frAHft 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grounded-microsoft-account-steam-multiplayer.jpg?itok=Povo7SAg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>no longer requires you to sign into a Microsoft account to play multiplayer on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>There is one major caveat, though. If you want to play&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>cross-platform, or you want to play on shared worlds or in Playgrounds, you're still going to need to sign into your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>As well as this change, Obsidian and Microsoft have also implemented a new switch that lets you toggle between a Crossplay State and a Steam Native State, and you'll need to be in the same state as your friends to see them online.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you can also unlink your Microsoft account from your Steam account completely via&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>'s Options menu; just navigate to Game, then Unlink Microsoft Account. Again, though, this will prevent you from accessing some of the game's features on Steam.</p>
<p>Naturally, if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass, you'll still need to use your Microsoft account to access it, so there haven't been any changes on that front.</p>

<p>This change comes in the wake of the controversy surrounding Sony requiring a sign-in to a PlayStation account in order to play its games on PC, with&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>coming in for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">particularly vicious criticism</a> over this decision.</p>
<p>Eventually, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">walked the change back</a>, and the fact that both&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>don't require external accounts will probably set tongues wagging the next time a Sony game hits the PC.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>is available right now across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/962130/Grounded/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/grounded/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/grounded/9pjthrnvh62h" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/grounded-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259402/devolver-digital-big-fan-licensed-indie-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital has announced the creation of a new publishing label designed specifically for licensed games. The label, named <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/">Big Fan Games</a>, is helmed by industry veterans who have worked with brands like Disney, Dark Horse, and more. In a press release, Devolver said that the new company’s goals are “helping independent game developers breathe new life into their favorite movies, comics, TV shows, and cult heroes through the power of video games.” Big Fan already has a number of games on its roster, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/23/17764070/reigns-game-of-thrones-hbo-devolver"><em>Reigns: Game of Thrones</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/11/23791503/a-hellboy-game-that-looks-like-the-hellboy-comics"><em>Hellboy Web of Wyrd</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682291/john-wick-hex-hands-on-mike-bithell-interview-e3-2019"><em>John Wick Hex</em></a>.</p><p>Licensed games were a big portion of the video game industry in the late ’80s and early ’90s. A lot of games that have been enshrined in older gamers’ imagination as being harder than the games of today were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12375434/disney-video-games-aladdin-the-lion-king-the-jungle-book-gog">licensed platformers like Disney’s <em>Lion King</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4265996/making-ducktales-remastered"><em>DuckTales</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22969751/tmnt-classic-games-bundle-konami-ps4-ps5-ninja-turtles-retro"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em></a> on the NES. However, their quality started to decline, and soon, licensed games became thought of as little more than interactive commercials. </p><p>Though sentiments regarding licensed games have changed, the team at Big Fan is aware of the stigma, sharing in the press release that the “goal at Big Fan is to nurture fun and inventive games that stand on their own, rather than serving as marketing tie-ins for other media launches.”</p><p>The launch of a label centered on licensed properties seems right on time as those kinds of games are experiencing a new renaissance and attention from the industry’s biggest studios. Respawn Entertainment has seen enormous success with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20965741/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-xbox-ps4-pc-respawn">duology of</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Star Wars</em> games</a>. <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em> launched in 2022 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interviewhttps://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interview">to critical acclaim</a>. MachineGames is due to release <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24040391/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-gameplay-trailer-xbox-bethesda">a new <em>Indiana Jones</em> video game later this year</a>, while IO Interactive, maker of the <em>Hitman</em> franchise, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575090/james-bond-game-origin-io-interactive-007-project-hitman">is working on a James Bond game</a>.</p><p>Big Fan seeks to keep the trend going, saying that “independent games created in these universes can explore them in new and unexpected ways, and it’s our goal to raise the bar of what fans can expect.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>For reasons that seemingly amount to japery, Google have unveiled a double-sided, endlessly looping keyboard design – but only in Japan, and they’re not actually making it. However, the blueprints for 3D-printing it are freely available on <a href="https://github.com/google/mozc-devices/tree/master/mozc-doublesided">GitHub</a>, which is enough to convince me that someone needs to develop some kind of chaotic party game that uses the Möbius strip-shaped Gboard (good spot, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/keyboards/google-showcases-bizarre-double-sided-japanese-keyboard-which-it-wont-sell-the-keyboard-uses-a-mobius-strip-as-its-foundation">Tom’s Hardware</a>) as a controller.</p>

<p>While the keyboard itself is quite literally a joke – see its tee-hee ho-ho 'trailer' above – I am dead serious that it could be the centrepiece for an enjoyably competitive, 2-4 player button mash-off that would make the average <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-jackbox-party-pack">Jackbox</a> session look like a model UN meeting. The circular, omnidirectional shape makes it perfect for gathering round in a group, and its fully mechanical keys – besides giving the Gboard some cred as a gaming peripheral – should be hardy enough to survive the furious bashing that 'friendly' party games inevitably devolve into.</p>
<p>As for the actual game design... I’ll leave that to the pros, though inspiration is out there. Chiefly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/play-unique-alt-controller-delights-at-egx-2023-in-london-this-week">Karting Khaos</a>, a simple top-down racer that we hosted at the Future of Play booth at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/egx-london-2023">EGX 2023</a>. Each player gets assigned a kart, but their steering and acceleration controls are randomly assigned across 24 comedy quiz show buttons – producing thrillingly disorganised contests, as racers hunt for their gas pedals and contend with mid-race input scrambles. It’s tremendous fun, and in the course of writing this paragraph, I have become tremendously sad that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-has-a-new-parent-company">Gamer Network sale</a> means I won’t be able to hang around the booth playing it again this year.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Still, bigger picture: a keyboard like this twisting monstrosity could easily allow us to recreate Karting Khaos’ madcap vibe, but in the comfort of our own homes, and without the need for a table-sized controller. Just one about as big as a generous birthday cake, and that can fascinate mathematicians for centuries.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>XR Games, the VR studio behind games like Starship Troopers: Continuum and Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded, has told a number of employees that they are at risk of being laid off.</p>



<p>According to a number of employees on LinkedIn — first reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-vr-studio-xr-games-placing-72-employees-at-risk-of-redundancy-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a> — management has said that at least 72 employees are at risk of redundancy. For those that may not know, being at risk of redundancy means that a position is being considered by a company for termination. While it’s not necessarily a set in stone decision, it can be viewed as a writing on the wall type of move.</p>



<p>The moves come as part of a “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joe-hopson-664381162_opentowork-activity-7246871973954301954-B1a3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive restructuring</a>” at XR Games.</p>



<p>“Multiple redundancies (72 to be exact) are taking place at the company,” QA project lead Tamara Whymark said. “I know the games industry is hard at the moment but I also want to give support for all my colleagues, they’re some of the most talented people I’ve ever met so please keep your eye out for them!”</p>



<p>XR Games recently released Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded to numerous criticisms due to the quality of the game. It prompted the studio to <a href="https://x.com/xrgamesvr/status/1833192314891571244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release a statement</a> saying that the game’s release didn’t meet their “high expectations”. They also said that they were committed to updating and improving the game to meet those expectations of both players and the company.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to XR Games for comment on the reported layoff plans.</p>



<p>So far this year, the gaming industry as seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 13,000 known</a> positions lost across nearly 150 companies. It’s expected that more layoffs will happen as the year comes to a close.</p>

                <p>Fortnite has slowly become the ultimate Celebrity Deathmatch game featuring, collaborations with Pixar, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-update-introduces-iron-mans-stark-industr/1100-6482006/" data-ref-id="1100-6482006">Marvel</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naruto-is-coming-to-fortnite-on-november-16/1100-6497915/" data-ref-id="1100-6497915">anime series</a>, and even real-life celebrities like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-adds-will-smiths-bad-boys-character-mike-lowrey/1100-6495685/" data-ref-id="1100-6495685">Will Smith</a>, Eminem, Lady Gaga, and now--possibly--Shaquille O'Neal. According to a leak by the famous Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1840828705150804316" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, Epic Games has teamed up with the basketball and entertainment icon to release cosmetics based on him to Fortnite on October 4.</p><p>Shaq, who sometimes goes under the alias of DJ Diesel, posted a clip of his latest set to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shaq/video/7420143472214297902?lang=en" rel="nofollow ">TikTok</a> Monday night. You can briefly see the screens at the venue showed brief clips of Shaq's apparent in-game Fortnite model (warning for those with photosensitivity).</p><p>"Toronto...last night was EPIC ;)", Shaq posted along with the video, with the not-so-subtle nod to the Fortnite maker.</p><p>Shaq's quasi-reveal is just one of the characters to join up shortly as the game's annual Halloween event, Fornitemare, as Shiina also <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1841030598049018179" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> horror icons like the Saw franchise's Billy the Puppet, Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, and a spooky version of DJ Marshmello are on the way.</p><p>Obviously this is not the first time Epic Games has made skins based on NBA teams or specific players. In 2022, Fortnite released skins of the 30 teams in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fortnite-nba-skins-celebrate-75-years-of-the-league-alongside-in-game-all-star-hub/1100-6500732/" data-ref-id="1100-6500732">entire league</a>.
