<p>Now, in a recent developer livestream, the team has shared the first gameplay footage from this particular build of the game now that they've got their hands on some dev kits. It highlights faster load times, higher shading quality, improved frame rate, and much more.</p>

<p>You can see a little <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2575538613">more gameplay footage</a> in the stream around the 28-minute mark. Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair reiterates how the load times are much shorter than the Switch counterpart, and also notes how this new version of the title will apparently run at 60fps in docked mode.</p>
<p>There's no information about when exactly the Switch 2 version will be released, but when we hear more, we'll let you know.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99ve-been-playing-town-to-city-from-dawn-to-dusk.1313095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello there, fans of city-builders and/or idyllic 19th-century Mediterranean getaways! You two very specific groups of people need to know that I spent the entire weekend playing<em> Town To City </em>and did little else, because I couldn't stop playing <em>Town To City</em>.</p><p>It's a game that shows the people of its world, much like our own, tired of the brutalities of modern industrial life and yearning for greener pastures. So it puts you in charge of those pastures, a town where a steady stream of treechangers arrive at a train station seeking a new life, and it's your job to first build them a house, and then put them to work.</p><p>Zooming out to survey everything you're able and asked to do in this game, <em>Town To City </em>looks like a city-builder. People's homes and jobs create numbers which then impact other stuff, there is happiness to worry about, warehouses to distribute resources to and from and shopfronts which draw on a complicated supply network of farms and granaries that you're given full control over. If your idea of city-building is to get lost in the numbers, managing a settlement's nerve centre and making sure its connections and creations all intertwine and sing in harmony, <em>Town To City </em>absolutely lets you play like that.</p><p>Zoom in, though, and there are huge sections of <em>Town To City</em> where you're not really city-building at all, and everything feels closer to<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-glade-is-a-lovely-stress-free-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tiny Glade</em></a> or <em>Townscaper</em> than <em>SimCity</em>. Through a combination of the game's flexible voxel graphics and a creation suite more interested in painting than laying along grids, <em>Town To City </em>lets you spend countless hours just...being creative. I lost track of the amount of time I spent making little bendy roads up hillsides, planting little hedge parks in between houses, putting flowerpots on people's balconies and planting flags where needed, not because it was important (though it can be, because your inhabitants’ happiness is linked to the aesthetics of their neighbourhood), but just because I thought it looked nice.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Town to City | Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMXIUgRoqTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>What makes the game so good is the way both these halves politely respect each other's contributions and boundaries. If four families arrive in town at once and need somewhere to live, you obviously need to build them a house, but if you want to spend an hour designing the perfect cul de sac for them all first, planting every decorative shrub in their yards and agonising over the placement of every single lamp adorning their walls, you can do that. They won't complain, or get cold, or <em>starve</em>, or leave; they'll just patiently wait for you to be done, <em>then </em>you can move them in.</p><p>Unpopular shops won't lead to crime, unhappy people don't riot, empty houses don't rot or catch fire. You're basically never hassled. This isn't the real world, these aren't real people, the game knows these are dolls with some needs. You're here to build a dollhouse, and if it takes you three hours to get a family out of the cold and into a farmhouse then they're not only cool with it, they'll appreciate your effort once you do.</p><p>For me, this is everything that's good about city-builders (a sandbox, a plaything, a set of numbers to mess around with) and nothing I hate about them (the stress of having bad things happen to you or the things you make). It creates a frictionless experience; you're always building but never having to rework (unless you want to!), always expanding but never circling back because you made a logistical mistake.</p><figure><figcaption>I made everyone a nice little park, not because I had to, just because it's nice</figcaption></figure><p>The game's dual focus--the grander designs of your town at one end of the zoom lens, the <em>Sims</em>-like attention to each individual household at the other--made me prouder of my towns than I think I've ever been of any town or city, in any game, ever. I had made all of it. From the widest boulevard outside a towering cathedral to the placement of each park bench and individual flowerpot.</p><p>For a game with such a chill vibe, I felt strangely all-powerful, more godlike than I'd felt playing games where I'd been a literal god. Though not in a cackling, vengeful god way; just a warm, glowing, benevolent way, like I was putting in six days of work before I could rest on the seventh and watch everyone go buy some eggs and play hopscotch.</p><p>Does all this cosiness and coddling rob the game of any sense of peril? Of course it does. If you're into games like <a href="https://aftermath.site/frostpunk-2-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Frostpunk</em></a><em> </em>because you like the feeling of playing a video game with a gun to your head, you might hate <em>Town To City</em>. It's more polite than Canadians lining up at a line shop, and I suppose there's an argument that at some level a city-builder requires some element of threat, otherwise it just becomes a game about building stuff.</p><p>But that's exactly what I love about <em>Town To City</em>. It gives me the systems of a city-builder but the elegance of a town-painter, the challenge of juggling morale but letting you cheese your way to improving it by drowning your residents in dogs and fancy clothing stores. It's given me everything I love from this genre and tossed out everything I don't, then played some wonderfully soothing accordion music over the top, just for good measure.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Town To City</em> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3115220/Town_to_City/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out in Early Access on Steam</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As a life-long lover of sci-fi battle scenes, it is always a joy to order a fleet of dozens of starships of all shapes and sizes to hyper-jump to a neighboring planet, then zoom in and watch as they burst into existence on the other side, bearing down on the entrenched enemy as they scramble fighters and bring their guns to bear. It’s something we’ve seen play out many times in Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and more, though few games let you control warfare between interstellar powers on the scale of Sins of a Solar Empire 2. It often takes hours of slow and steady management across layers of intimidatingly complex grand strategy systems to build up to those major confrontations, but the payoff is spectacular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The important thing to know going in is that while this is a bewilderingly complicated real-time strategy/4X hybrid that lets you zoom from a view of an entire solar system down to an individual spaceship in a fleet of hundreds, you do not need to know everything about it to have a good time with it, or even win. I should know – after a few dozen hours playing largely against Unfair (the setting above hard) AI opponents, mostly in four-way free-for-alls, I’ve won more than I’ve lost even though I still have a lot to learn about the many, many differences both large and subtle between the six playable factions and how their fleets, structures, and upgrades interact. Unless you’re in this to mostly play at a high level against human opponents who’ve optimized their build orders and mastered the mechanics, once you get your head around the basics of building your economy, research, and fleet management, I’ve found that you can lean into the aspects that you enjoy most and all but ignore things you aren’t interested in, and still enjoy building your empire and crushing enemies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sins of a Solar Empire 2 Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fundamentally, all six of Sins 2’s playable factions operate in a fairly similar way in that they all colonize planets, extract resources, build orbital structures for research and production, and have similar lineups of corvettes, frigates, cruisers, and capital ships, but beyond that their differences are significant and complex as hell. The two human TEC factions both generate money in part by setting up networks of trading outposts, but they come with different upgrades and bonuses that makes Enclave better suited for a defensive playstyle and Primacy more aggressive – among them, the Novalith Cannon superweapon that can bombard planets from across the solar system and the ability to earn money by sending in raiders. The Vasari Alliance, meanwhile, have no use for the TEC’s money at all and are focused on diplomacy with minor factions that let them periodically call in favors like reinforcements or upgrades, while their Exodus counterparts are the only faction that can completely destroy planets as they strip them for resources. The Advent Reborn and Wrath are big on resurrecting destroyed ships and mind-controlling enemies, respectively. All of that is a gross oversimplification, of course, but in the interest of avoiding turning this review into a mirror of the <a href="https://wiki.sinsofasolarempire2.com/space/SSEFW/1684832258/Guides" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>massive guides to each faction</u></a> on the official site, rest assured that they’re pretty distinct. The list of unique technologies and items they all have access to means there’s a lot of replayability here just from trying out each one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It really does look spectacular when major battles are joined and the lasers and missiles start flying.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you played the classic 2008 Sins of a Solar Empire (or its half-step sequel Rebellion) Sins 2 may seem a bit unambitious when you first begin – at least, after you’ve stopped gawking at how much better and shinier all the ships look in an updated game engine that can handle cool things like all the rotating, target-tracking turrets you could ask for. It really does look spectacular when major battles are joined and the lasers and missiles start flying, but it takes a while to get to that point. The early hours of Sins 2 play very similarly to its 17-year-old predecessor: the routine of starting from a single world, exploring the map around you with automated scouts, and racing to colonize every planet and asteroid you can clear of local defenses with your chosen starting flagship and small fleet (as you research the technologies required to inhabit each planet type) is for the most part indistinguishable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main new wrinkle is presented by an exotic materials system that limits how quickly you can ramp up high-powered military assets like capital ships and starbases, but later on this becomes kind of irrelevant. At first they’re hard to come by, and you have to either unearth random ones from planets and asteroids you colonize or destroy enemy capital ships and salvage them – and because most major ships and starbases require a specific material, you may have to improvise with what’s available rather than go with your favorite ships out of the gate, which adds some variety from game to game. Eventually, though, you can research the ability to build refineries that slowly produce exotics out of the standard resources of metal and crystal you’ve extracted, and then you can build whatever you like – it’ll even auto-research the technologies and then produce the materials if you have the resources available, so all exotics really do after that point is add to build times. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In the midgame, Sins 2 really starts showing off what makes it different from the original.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When you reach the midgame, Sins 2 really starts showing off what makes it different from the original by layering on so many different systems that I had to play multiple, hours-long games before I came close to engaging with them all. Even having gone through an in-depth series of tutorials (there’s no traditional RTS story campaign in which to learn the ropes) and after over more than 40 hours of practice, it’s an overwhelming amount of things to keep track of: two parallel research trees with multiple paths, numerous planetary upgrades, buildable items you can equip on your individual capital ships and worlds, simple diplomacy with both player-controlled factions and independent worlds, culture expansion, resource management, pirate raids, other faction-specific mechanics like trade routes and castable powers, and unique Titan superships, among others. With the default settings, planets will even slowly orbit the sun in the center of the map at different rates, which sounds interesting but can be annoying if you forget to check the movement preview for a while and suddenly one of your worlds has drifted to the middle of enemy territory and is cut off from reinforcements. (It is, however, very funny when this happens to someone else.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For that matter, everything in Sins 2 appears to be moving slowly when you’re watching a fleet glide across a planet’s gravity well before jumping to the next or a progress bar for research or construction fill up, but it’s deceptive in that there’s virtually always something you can be doing to improve your empire. Once you figure out which menus to peruse to manage equipment on individual planets, capital ships, and starbases, view and expand available build slots on your planets, search for which of the dozens of technologies to research next, keep tabs on your economy growth, and more, it can feel like things are moving too quickly to do all of that and build fleets to send on lengthy journeys to where they’re needed to defend or attack. It’s workable because the tools for organizing fleets are simple and mostly intuitive, with improvements such as letting you build reinforcements directly from a fleet’s menu instead of seeking out a shipyard, but I’m still glad that I’m allowed to pause time (in single-player) to figure things out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also a good thing that you don’t really have to micromanage your ships in combat if you don’t want to. You’ll certainly get more out of your battleships if you’re zooming in to manually do things like send out swarms of nanites to do damage over time, restore allies’ shields, or launch a massive missile salvo at a particularly bothersome enemy ship, but they’ll also auto-cast those abilities for you by default (as long as you’ve taken the time to choose which ones to unlock when a ship levels up). Similarly, precise positioning certainly matters because you can do things like keep your vulnerable ships outside the firing range of a starbase or stationary defensive turrets, and it’s always wise to try to save your experienced capital ships to fight another day by withdrawing from a fight before they’re destroyed (you’ll get frequent notifications when their shields are down or their hull is crippled, so it’s hard to miss those opportunities). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wars are won on a logistical level by making sure your fleet is well supplied and fully upgraded.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But those maneuvers matter most when you’re fighting an equally matched opponent, and the key to victory is to never do that if you don’t have to: wars are won on a logistical level by making sure your fleet is well supplied and fully upgraded, and has a good composition of light frigates and heavy cruisers along with speedy fighters, corvettes, and long-range support craft all backing up your capital ships. All the micromanagement in the world can only take you so far when you’re outnumbered two to one because your enemy had more shipyards and a more powerful economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Granted, part of the reason I’ve been able to win most of my games without making full use of every tool at my disposal is because the rival empires’ AI tends to drop the ball in the late game. I’ve played multiple matches where enemy fleets would gang up on me by attacking on two fronts simultaneously and push me back to my core worlds, but then they’d back off while I still held enough territory to be able to rebuild my fleet. Eventually I was able to regroup and then steamroll them, even though they beat me to building the massive Titan warships at the very top of each faction’s tech tree. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s entirely possible that in these cases my opponents were too busy fighting each other to deal with me while I rebuilt my fleets, but the fact that neither took the time to deliver a killing blow to my home world and seize my territory when they had the chance seemed a little silly. Until that point, though, the AI puts up a good fight, with lots of opportunities for skirmishes and trading blows around border worlds.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite RTS Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In theory, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 works best as a multiplayer game because humans would have no such trouble going for the jugular. However, in practice I’ve never been able to actually finish a multiplayer game because of how long and involved they are. Even a “small” game of Sins 2 with two players on one of the pre-built or randomly generated maps is sprawling, involving dozens of planets and other heavenly bodies to fight over, which can take hours against an opponent who knows better than to leave his homeworld undefended; a large one can actually have multiple solar systems you can jump between and up to 10 players, so it’s quite a commitment for a group to see one through. To its credit, Sins 2 does allow for players to easily jump in and out, with AI taking over control of a faction until a human returns to pick up the reins again so you won’t be left unfulfilled if your opponents have other obligations to attend to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this is before you get to the modding scene, which is busily churning out conversions that let you add Star Destroyers, Battlestars, and Romulan Warbirds (among many others) to the mix using the built-in mod manager. If the original Sins of a Solar Empire is anything to go by, that community will keep giving us new fan-pleasing toys to play with for a very long time – maybe even decades – to come.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Sins of a Solar Empire 2 is a grand-scale real-time strategy game that asks that you keep up with its many complex systems for marathon sessions, but in return it gives you control over some of the most spectacular space battles in gaming. Ordering huge battleships, small fighters, and everything in between to launch all-out assaults on an enemy’s home world is a rewarding payoff for hours of navigating menus and keeping your eye on what feels like dozens of balls at once. Fully mastering the mechanics of its six factions will take many hours of tutorials, browsing guides, and watching explainer videos, but don’t let that intimidate you away from playing. Once you’ve learned the basics of making enough cash to buy a few spaceships, you can jump in and have a stellar time successfully conquering solar systems long before fully wrapping your head around all the nuances you’d need to compete in a multiplayer war. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wizards of the Coast is going to turn as much <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817">paper into gold</a> as it can with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and leading the way is its best-selling <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set. The company recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">announced at MagicCon Atlanta 2025</a> that it will be releasing additional <em>Final Fantasy</em> box sets with new cards featuring more beautiful art spanning the Square Enix RPG franchise’s history. If you’re worried about your wallet, relax! The initial wave of pre-orders sold out instantly.</p> <p>This mini-expansion includes a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">Chocobo Bundle</a>, a new Commander Deck, and four new Scene Boxes. They all arrive on December 5 and all of them are basically impossible to find online right now. Hopefully, fans have better luck with the inventory that comes directly to their local hobby shops. The Chocobo Bundle is $110 and comes with a bunch of booster packs, Chocobo-themed lands, alt-art reprints, a new promo card, and an incredibly neat life total click-wheel:</p>

   <p>Then there’s the new $100<em> FFVII</em> Limit Break Commander Deck that comes with a PC download code for the HD remaster of the original game and an exclusive Traditional Foil promo card that shows Cloud looking up at Shinra HQ. It seems way over-priced but is also completely sold out right now on Amazon.</p>

 <p>The new Scene Boxes are what really have my attention. There’s one each for <em>Final Fantasy</em>,<em> Final Fantasy VIII</em>,<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>, and<em> Final Fantasy XV</em>. Each comes with six Foil Borderless Scene Cards, six Art Cards, three Play Boosters, and one Display Easel for $42. The six cards go together to recreate scenes from each game. These new cards aren’t legal in standard play but look cool as heck. The art on the boxes alone makes me want one.</p>

   <p>There was no shortage of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Scene Boxes when they arrived in 2023, offering hope that after the initial frenzy subsides, fans will be able to get access to the new<em> Final Fantasy</em> ones without too much trouble, and without paying over MSRP for them. Are the boxes worth even that? In the grand scheme of things, probably not. But that’s the whole point of Universes Beyond: subverting logic with passion.</p> <p>The result has been very lucrative for Wizards but a pain for many fans. “This whole collab has been so confusing,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">wrote</a> one after the latest <em>Final Fantasy</em> products were announced. “Every attempt I’ve made at actually purchasing cards has shown that the set is sold out everywhere, and they don’t seem to be printing any new ones. But there’s new cards still coming out too?” Yes. And I suspect these won’t be the last ones either.</p>

            <p>
The thing about an adaptation, is that sometimes you've got to twist things slightly to better do what you want to do. Whether that's the right choice or not depends on how militant you are about the concept of faithfulness. When it comes to The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher</a> series, however, I expect most people won't care, except for the author of the original books Andrzej Sapkowski himself. His personal gripe? The very existence of different witcher schools.
</p>
<p>
In The Witcher games, there's various Witcher schools that crop up here and there, with Geralt of Rivia coming from the School of the Wolf. Except according to a recent AMA with Sapkowski on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-author-andrzej-sapkowski-says-one-of-cd-projekts-big-story-points-is-actually-based-on-a-mistake-but-videogame-people-have-clung-to-the-idea-with-remarkable-tenacity/">PC Gamer</a>), the whole idea of schools was completely blown out of proportion. "The issue of 'witcher schools' requires - I apologise - a longer explanation," Sapkowski wrote. "A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot."
</p>
<p>
For some context, The Last Wish is the first book he wrote in the series. The author goes on to explain that he didn't include any references to any other schools in any of his other books from that point on. "However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these 'witcher schools.' Completely unnecessary."
</p>
<p>
Sapkowski also noted how he's not sure how he wants to go about dispelling this idea of schools, suggesting removing any mention of them in future editions of The Last Wish, or even just outright expanding and clarifying the idea in future books. "Perhaps I'll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit."
</p><p>
I have to admit, this does tickle me quite a bit. I'm not a mega Witcher fan, I enjoyed the third one enough, but the schools did feel important enough to be relatively memorable. And they're just not really a thing apparently!
</p>
<p>
Ultimately Sapkowski's comments don't really matter as the games have obviously taken on a very large life of their own. I doubt there'll be anyone at CD Projekt Red who's going to lose any sleep over this either.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there was meant to be one last Witcher 3 patch this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-final-patch-delivering-cross-platform-mod-support-has-been-delayed-until-2026">but that recently got the boot to 2026</a>. I'm sure you can wait a while longer for your cross-platform mod support.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s Prime Day sales event starts next week on October 7. But the online retailer has already marked down a ton of products ahead of its made-up holiday, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox?tag=kotaku01-20">including a long list of 4K UHD Blu-ray movies</a>. As streaming becomes more expensive and content is split up across more platforms and hidden behind more paywalls, owning a movie on Blu-ray is the best way to ensure you can watch it anytime you want at no extra cost. And, assuming you have the proper cables and setup, with 4K UHD Blu-rays, you get a picture quality that is better than compressed streaming content, too!</p> <p>Remember, you’ll need a UHD player to watch any of these movies. Your PS5 and Xbox Series X are solid UHD players, assuming they have disc slots and you are using the correct HDMI cable.</p> <p>With that all out of the way, here are the UHD movies currently on sale on Amazon. Heads up that in the past, popular movies have sometimes sold out during these big UHD sales, so if something catches your eye, don’t wait too long to snag it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony have teamed up with Reebok to create three special sneakers to celebrate <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/the-limited-edition-30th-anniversary-ps5-consoles-look-fantastic/">thirty years of PlayStation.</a> There are three designs and all are quite tasteful, personally I’d love a pair of the Reebok Pump Omni Zone II kicks, but there is zero chance of that happening.</p>
<p>That’s because each of the three designs is exclusive to single store, in a single country.</p>


<p><br>
First up is the Reebok Workout Plus.</p>
<p>“Get fit, be fit with the stylish PlayStation | Reebok Workout Plus trainers. With two lace options, removable lacelock cable attachment, internal arch band for enhanced fit, and anniversary grey sockliners, the Workout Plus trainers are made for play.”</p>
<p>These are only available in the UK from <a href="https://www.endclothing.com/gb">End Clothing</a> from 15th October.</p>


<p>Next up is the Reebok Pump Omni Zone II.</p>
<p>“The Pump Omni Zone II are the ultimate throwback trainers. Featuring a custom pump ball styled in PlayStation colours, two lace options with metal tips, and tonnes of rad retro details, these kicks will have you balling in style, on the court or with a PlayStation controller.”</p>
<p>These are only available in the USA from <a href="https://cncpts.com/pages/new-york" rel="nofollow" data-di-id="di-id-3767a0f2-6251d66c">CNCPTS</a>&nbsp;starting 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;October.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, we have the Reebok Instapump Fury 94.</p>
<p>“Step back to where it all began. The original PlayStation launched in Japan in 1994, and these throwback trainers pay homage to the classic console with a pump ball with “Press Play” feature, a memory card design on the tongue, and fun, hidden details in the retro design.”</p>
<p>These can only be purchased in Japan from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beams.co.jp/en/shop/j/" rel="nofollow" data-di-id="di-id-40e706b6-e9584e22">Beams</a>&nbsp;starting 24th&nbsp;October.</p>
<p>No doubt these will be expensive to purchase and if you really, really, <em>really</em> like PlayStation and Reebok <em>and</em> have more cash than Jeff Bezos then you might want to grab one of 750 limited editions box sets that contain all three designs.</p>

			<p>Hades 2 v1.0 is here, and even though it's been in early access for over a year, there are plenty who waited for its full launch before jumping into Supergiant's latest.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Myself included, as I said in my review</a> of Hades 2, I avoided the sequel so I could have the same experience I had with the first game. Now that I've spent a good deal of time with the game and have felled Chronos and reached Olympus' peak, there are a few nuggets of wisdom I feel ready to share.</p>



<p>Starting with what is undoubtedly the only thing that the action fans of the first Hades game are curious about when it comes to jumping into Hades 2. How good are the weapons and which one is the best?</p>



<p>This tier guide will go through which are the best weapons in Hades 2, and where their pros and cons lie, even if they're not always what you want to grab on your way down into the Underworld, or up towards Mount Olympus.</p>



<h2 id="h-hades-2-weapons-tier-guide">Hades 2 Weapons Tier Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-s-tier-the-sister-blades-lim-and-oros">S-Tier: The Sister Blades, Lim and Oros</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Sister Blades, Lim and Oros, in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting with the best of the best, there is really only one weapon sitting at the top of Mount Olympus compared to the other five Nocturnal arms available to Melinoë, and it's the Sister Blades, Lim and Oros.</p>



<p>They're the fastest weapons in Hades 2, with each of their starting aspects all extremely viable for wherever you are in the game. They don't need certain boons to be powerful; you can build around them easily, no matter what you're trying to lean into.</p>



<p>The Special lets you hit multiple enemies with different curses quickly, and while the two aspects you can unlock are more than viable, Melinoë's own aspect is already so powerful that you don't need to focus your resources and efforts on upgrading anything else.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-tier-the-witch-s-staff-the-black-coat-and-the-moonstone-axe">A-Tier: The Witch's Staff, The Black Coat, and The Moonstone Axe</h3>



<p>Half of all the Nocturnal Arms sit in the A-tier, because they're all better than the rest but none are as good as the Sister Blades. </p>



<p><strong>The Witch's Staff, Descura</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Witch's Staff in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting off with The Witch's Staff, Descura, which is also the first weapon you'll have available to you right at the beginning of Hades 2. The Staff is similar to your starting sword in the first Hades. It's an all-around solid choice, even with a reliance on its charged attacks that really make the Staff shine. You'll definitely want to be levelling up your mana bar throughout your run with this weapon equipped, or have Arcana cards like The Unseen equipped, but that doesn't hold the staff back from being a strong choice.</p>



<p><strong>Moonstone Axe, Zorephet</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Moonstone Axe in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Zorephet, the Moonstone Axe's major drawback is that it's unfortunately slower than you might like for a typical run in Hades 2. That said, the aspect of Thanatos changes that, bringing it up to speed so you'll be able to do the immense amount of damage the axe already does even faster.</p>



<p>Even without the aspect of Thanatos, the Moonstone Axe more than makes up for its slow attack speed with the massive amounts of damage a single hit can deal. It's Special attack is also great at taking out multiple enemies and dealing Curse damage to every enemy in any given encounter since it easily reaches across most of the tighter spaces in Hades 2. </p>



<p>Yes, you might need to get used to how slow it can be, and you might not find your groove with it until you've unlocked the aspect of Thanatos, but even before that, it is a solid choice to build around and one of the better weapons to use in the game overall.</p>



<p><strong>The Black Coat, Xinth</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Black Coat in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps the biggest drawback to The Black Coat, Xinth, is that it's the last weapon you'll unlock out of the six. That doesn't stop it from reaching above the other weapons you'll have had more time with by the time you get to it.</p>



<p>It's a jet pack that launches missiles and punches through enemies like nothing else. What more could you ask for, really? How it changes your sprint might take a bit to get used to, but it's Special attack lets you hit multiple enemies at once, its main attack is quick and akin to the speed of the Sister Blades, and one of its aspects even unlocks a powerful hidden Hex that is otherwise unavailable to you.</p>



<p>Like every other weapon mentioned so far, it's fairly easy to build around and doesn't require any particular boons or upgrades to be effective.</p>



<h3 id="h-b-tier-umbral-flames-ygnium">B-Tier: Umbral Flames, Ygnium</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Umbral Flames in Hades 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Umbral Flames can take some getting used to, and like the Witch's Staff, it's reliant on you having a large mana bar or Arcana cards like The Unseen equipped, so you're not running around without the use of your charged attacks. That said, there's more to these flames than meets the eye when you first grab them in hand.</p>



<p>Its range lets you do consistent damage while staying out of the line of fire, and its Special orbiting around you helps keep enemies at bay when you don't have your Cast available to you. It's Eos aspect also adds a slow-moving grenade ready to do massive damage on top of the damage you're already dolling out with its base attack. </p>



<h3 id="h-c-tier-argent-skull">C-Tier: Argent Skull</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Argent Skull in Hades 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This will probably be the most controversial placement for this whole list, because yes, the Argent Skull, Revaal, can be massively powerful - if you have the right upgrades. That's why I have it all the way down in C-tier.</p>



<p>Out of all six weapons, the Argent Skull is the most 'great with the right upgrades' weapon in the game. At least for me, in a roguelike, that's not the marker of a good weapon choice. Without those upgrades, it packs a strong punch but makes you grab your ammo after firing.</p>



<p>I'm not saying this weapon isn't viable - all six can lead you to a win at the peak of Mount Olympus or in the depths of the Underworld, including the Argent Skull. But out of all of them, it's the one that comes with the biggest asterisk, because not only does it only get more useful with the right upgrades, it actively puts you in harm's way with how you'll need to move across each encounter to keep the skull loaded and ready to fire.</p>



<hr>



<p>Ultimately, these rankings are based on my own experiences with each weapon, and what you prefer might be different. Just make sure to give each a try to find what you like and what fits your playstyle.</p>

            <p>
It's been a while since we've had a new game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> director Cory Davis. As far as I can tell, the last game he made was 2016's Here They Lie, a survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game. He's currently working on another horror game in fact, Sleep Awake, which is a horrendous name, though I think it's doing some interesting things. Weirdly, he's making the game alongside Nine Inch Nails guitarist (for live shows, anyway) Robin Finck, and while the game doesn't have a release date, it did just receive a demo.
</p>
<p>
Lemme tell ya, if there's one thing you can take away from Sleep Awake it's that PS3 games are back! Let me define what I mean here so I don't just sound like I'm trying to press some buzz words for the fun of it. I think a key thing about the PS3 era of games is that there was so much more scope for much more intimately designed, linear spaces, with much more room for detail compared to the PS2, but not quite enough resources to design something completely lifelike.

<p>
In a lot of ways, these intricately designed games often just had facades up, they looked bigger and more impressive than they actually were. The upside is that it also often made for interesting art direction, and a better established sense of space. So many big budget games now do look life-like, but the tradeoff is that all of this detail gets lost through the sheer quantity of it.
</p><p>
Sleep Awake's demo was only short, and very much felt like one long corridor, but it was an interesting to look at corridor. Your classic case of random bits of graffiti and wall carvings to denote story, interacting with random objects that does nothing but let you look at them close-up, data logs with bits of flavour text to build up the lore, it's all there.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of lore, or story I suppose, this game is set in a world where there's some kind of weird illness thingy that whisks people away if they fall asleep, so the protagonist is doing what they can to stay awake at all times, which occasionally leads to some hallucinations.
</p>
<p>
To be perfectly honest, the narrative didn't feel all that compelling. As mentioned, the demo was short, and did quite a bad job of bringing me into this world, it felt too jarring and disconnected. There also just wasn't really anything to actually do apart from walk around, look at some bits, and one very short section at the end where I had to hide from an enemy. I'd be remiss to not mention the fact that the writing was stilted and awkward, and the main character's performance matched that feeling a little too well unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
Still, the atmosphere and visuals pulled me in all the same. There's parts that are intercut with live action footage which, to its credit, actually unnerved me. A real arthouse, '70s vibe about it I feel I could really get down with. It is certainly going for a unique look, and I felt charmed by its 2009 throwback vibes, even if I'm uncertain of whether it'll be any good or not.
</p><p>
Still, it's a curious thing to have a game from someone that designed one of the most discussed games of the 2010s, and someone that plays guitar for Nine Inch Nails sometimes. Worth a punt! You can try it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Capcom Cup started in 2013 with <i>Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition</i> as the Japanese publisher sought to professionalize and take more direct ownership of its hit fighting franchise’s competitive scene. It expanded into multi-month tours leading up to the big finals, with all of the biggest matches streamed for free online. And it’s continued that way, until now. Capcom announced this week that the 2026 finals for <em>Street Fighter 6</em> will be a pay-per-view event, and fans are not happy. “No one should be deprived of the opportunity to enjoy the pinnacle of <em>Street Fighter</em>,” Evo 2025 winner Saul Leonardo “MenaRD” Mena II <a href="https://x.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376">wrote on X</a> in response to the news.</p> <p>The two-time Capcom Cup champion hails from the Dominican Republic and noted, as many pros have, that locking esports behind a paywall particularly impacts fans from regions where the financial barriers are already higher. “I find it hard to accept,” he wrote. “I understand that in Japan, this is considered normal, and fortunately, the community is still able to support each other in this way. However, in many regions, including my own, there is hardly even the leeway to play this game.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">納得しがたいです</p> <p>日本ではこれが普通だと理解していますし、ありがたいことにコミュニティはまだこの方法で支え合えています。</p> <p>しかし、私の地域を含む多くの地域では、このゲームをプレイする余裕すらほとんどない。ストリートファイターの頂点を楽しむ機会を阻まれるべきではない。… <a href="https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu">https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu</a></p> <p>— WBG MenaRD🇩🇴 (@_MenaRD__) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <a href="https://sf.esports.capcom.com/capcomcup/cc12/en/">Capcom Cup 12 Finals</a> will take place on March 14, followed by the <em>Street Fighter</em> League World Championship on March 15. Both will take place live at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in Tokyo, Japan, where front row seats will cost roughly $135. In a major break with the past, however, even virtual viewership will be ticketed this time around. The pay-per-view ticket price will be roughly $40 for both days. Anyone who doesn’t want to pay will have to wait until a week later to stream the matches online for free.</p>

 <p>The move caught many competitive<em> Street Fighter</em> pros by surprise. Next year’s Capcom Cup sports a $1,282,000 prize pool, unchanged from the prior year, despite the new income stream. “If this decision is final, then I hope at the very least a % of the PPV earnings be used to support the prize pool to improve the payout distribution for the players,” Arman “Phenom” Hanjani <a href="https://x.com/PhenomSF/status/1972393910438883538">wrote on X</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The issue is that while Capcom funds the CC Finals, they absolutely do not pay to run all of the tournaments where people qualify for Capcom Cup. Individual TOs and communities in countries around the world operate those events. Capcom benefits from the hardwork of those TOs and…</p> <p>— 女 Molly_Bee (@MollyAmberBee) <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyAmberBee/status/1972796918666260953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also unclear how the PPV requirement will impact the rest of the competitive scene’s content creators who traditionally co-stream events. Others have wondered why Capcom doesn’t just try to extract more money through Capcom Cup-specific in-game outfits and other cosmetics. “I don’t know why they’re not doing this anymore. I used to buy the CPT costume pack every year, everyone wins and everyone is happy,” <a href="https://x.com/Bigbird_fgc/status/1972303220908417059">wrote</a> Adel&nbsp;“Big Bird” Anouche.</p>

 <p>Fans are equally bewildered, pointing to all of the local events that feed into the Capcom Pro Tour but aren’t directly financed by the publisher. “I thought Capcom organized this circuit as a marketing tool for the game,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nss7ou/capcom_announces_that_capcom_cup_12_finals_stream/">wrote</a> on Reddit. “Makes no sense to charge viewers to watch it. And esports is, unfortunately, still way too niche for that to be profitable.”</p> <p>While <em>Street Fighter</em> is massive in Japan, many are worried the move to PPV for such a big event will just end up excluding people in other parts of the world. Does Capcom care? Apparently not.</p>

            <p>
With Call of Duty: Blacks Ops 7's 14th November release date looming and its early access beta just days away, Activision has aired a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX3kSg2np68">big old Call of Duty Next showcase</a>, featuring - amid the enthusiastic shouting and endless "official partner" promotion - a heap of multiplayer news and gameplay, including a look at Warzone's new Resurgence map, and more.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty Black Op 7's open beta, as you probably already know, runs 5th-8th October, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-starts-2nd-october">early access beginning Thursday, 2nd October</a>. Things kick off at 6pm in the UK/10am PDT and those taking part will have access to six 6v6 maps. There's Blackheart (an off-shore oilrig), The Forge (a Tokyo R&amp;D facility), Toshin's downtown Tokyo, Exposure (the Australian outback), Imprint (an Alaskan weapons manufacturing facility), and Cortex's human testing site. Zombies fans, meanwhile, can try out the Vandorn Farm survival map, with beta pre-loading starting tomorrow, 1st October.

<p>
Still on maps, Activision also used its showcase to whizz through a few of Black Ops 7's 18 launch maps (16 for 6v6 matches, two for the series' new 20v20 Skirmish mode). Colossus, for instance, is a Black Ops 2 "callback", while Den takes players to a Japanese castle full of 2035 tech. There's Express, set in a Tokyo train station; Hijacked, whose action unfolds on a Tokyo Bay yacht; Homestead, set in and around David Mason's Alaskan childhood home, plus Paranoia - a more fantastical map inspired by the nightmare of David Mason's mind. You can see those and more in the flythrough trailer above, but if your mappetite still isn't sated, Activision says a further seven multiplayer maps will arrive as part of Black Ops 7's post-launch Season 1 plans, alongside two Survival maps and one round-based map for Zombies mode. Nuketown 2025, for instance, is due "shortly after launch".
</p><p>
Weapon-wise, Black Ops 7 features 16 new multiplayer weapons at launch, including the M10 Breacher - a pump-action shotgun that can be charged to reduce spread and land mid-range shots with more accuracy. Additional weapons (both new and returning favourites) are promised - alongside the likes of attachment rewards and weekly challenges - once Black Ops 7's post-launch seasons get underway. We also got a peak at some of the new Weapon Prestige attachments and camos coming in Black Ops 7, with Activision promising a "big" year for camo fans. Alongside a dedicated camo track in the co-op campaign, there are 16 mastery camos (split across multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and co-op), plus plenty more coming as season rewards.

<p>
Rounding out the multiplayer portion of Activision's showcase, there was a brief bit of Black Ops 7's "very competitive" new Overload mode. This, if you're unfamiliar, is a 6v6 objective mode in which each team attempts to secure the overload device and get it to one of the oppositions two zones. Success earns the victors one point and eight points equates to a win.
</p>
<p>
Next up, Zombies mode and its round-based Ashes of the Damned map. Inspired by the legend of the Bermuda Triangle, it's constructed from landmarks - all with a violent history - dragged into the Dark Ether. There's a ruined version Janus Towers Plaza, for instance; Black Water Cabin, where a famed horror director drowned his leading lady; Vandorn Farm, home to a murderous family and their unfortunate victims, plus the fractured Southern Georgia town of Ashwood. Between them lie endless waves of respawning undead, including the loot-snatching Ravagers. That's where your trusty wonder vehicle Tessie comes in though, providing an essential means of transporation that can be augmented with thrusters, chomp attacks, and more.
</p>
<p>
There's a closer look at Ashes of the Damned above, and if you like the sound of Vandorn Farm, it's playable as a Survival map in the imminent beta. More survival locations taken from round-based maps are promised post-launch.

<p>
Zombies mode also got a nod as Black Ops 7's showcase turned its attention to Warzone. That's thanks to Warzone's new Resurgence map, Haven's Hollow - a small Appalachian town that might look familiar to Zombies fans. It's essentially a pre-outbreak version of Liberty Falls, featuring nine unique points of interest across its autumnal expanse. There's the train station, mansion, lumber mill, riverboat, pond, coal depot, homestead, and Main Street, all of which appear in the flythrough above. And if that's got you ready to go, Haven's Hollow arrives with Season 1 later this year.
</p><p>
You'll need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX3kSg2np68">delve into the full several-hours-long showcase</a> if you want to properly scrutinise Activision's extensive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 gameplay. As a reminder, open beta early access begins this Thursday, 2nd October, and the full game launches on 14th November.

Each chapter on Mangaplus is riddled with copycat comedians, remarking that it was a good 12-second read. And straight up, <em>Chainsaw Man</em> is a pretty quick read, balancing punchy back-and-forth dialogue and exposition between characters fortunate enough to have survived the rapture that is popularity poles. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that the manga has…</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPB_J6Egi28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol start="2"><li><span>Drawings</span></li></ol><p>Sure, <em>Chainsaw Man</em>’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shineyezehuhh.bsky.social/post/3liaxgu3g3k2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art style has changed ever so slightly</a> over the course of Part One and Part Two on account of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/chainsaw-mans-influence-can-already-be-felt-beyond-its-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fujimoto’s assistants</a> (read:disciples) going on to make manga of their own, like little-known works like <em>Dandadan</em>, <em>Spy x Family</em>,<em> Hell’s Paradise</em>, and <em>Centuria</em>. Still, that hasn’t stopped <em>Chainsaw Man</em> from having some of the most provocative manga panel spreads in the industry right now. From an infinite corridor of doors leading to hell to that one panel of dismembered astronauts lined up like a row of flowers praying to the devil, this manga is guaranteed to provide shock and awe with its money shot pages and sidesplitting comedy and horror with its minimalistic, repetitive panel work to set a breezier mood to lead up to those shocking revelations. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that Mappa has been going whole hog in adapting the manga, making the viewing experience feel <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-11-18/the-chainsaw-man-anime-style-feels-off/.191720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more like watching a film than a typical anime</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let’s compare that to the Bible’s illustrations. Wait, hold up… it doesn’t have any. Unless you count <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10172724/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VeggieTales' Larry-Boy movie</a>, <a href="https://www.theactionbible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Action Bible</a>, or those <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7967302/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meekly released animated films that go straight to DVD</a>, the Bible is lacking in visual imagery on the animated front. If anything, the good word is still being carried today by efforts like <em>The</em> <em>Prince of Egypt</em>, which remains a revered animated film regardless of whether you’re religious. And no, art museums and tapestries in the Sistine Chapel don’t count. If you can’t immediately experience its artwork without planning an expensive trip to the Vatican or freaking out your local church by gawking at its stained glass artwork, we don’t count those.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPB_J6Egi28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol start="3"><li><span>You can actually identify the author</span></li></ol><p>The Bible doesn’t have one set author. No part of it mentions The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit as its scribe. For thousands of years, only the most learned theologians could identify various authors, including those such as Moses, David, Solomon, Paul, and the gospel writers Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Still, there’s contention to this day on how much each scribe contributed to what is essentially an anthology, part historical, part self-help, and if any of its authors’ contributions were overstated. There’s even been a <a href="https://www.history.com/articles/who-wrote-the-bible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-author theory</a> that prevailed concerning the Old Testament in religious circles that I can’t even fathom as a lapsed Lutheran. Now, consider Tatsuki Fujimoto, a name I have just mentioned and identified as the creator of <em>Chainsaw Man</em>. Badabing badaboom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Funnily enough, Fujimoto had a crisis of proving his identity when his Twitter account—which he used to roleplay as a little sister he doesn’t have (<a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2022/11/11/chainsaw-man-creator-tatsuki-fujimoto-officially-joins-twitter-after-his-little-sisters-account-gets-banned?srsltid=AfmBOorh9k1SiPlyIKIdT7aMU_tpy18TLjoAiA7DzAth5UGkUDnkkrPy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we don’t have to get into it</a>) was <a href="https://kotaku.com/chainsaw-man-mangaka-tatsuki-fujimoto-twitter-account-1849793349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily banned for age verification reasons and fraud</a>. This, in turn, led him to have to prove his identity by providing early draft sketches of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> characters in tandem with <a href="https://x.com/SHIHEILIN/status/1590854706804719616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his editor</a>, who pleaded with the then-existent moderators on Twitter to verify his identity. Not precisely a Moses and the burning bush situation, but a dumber modern-day version of it, for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump </a></figcaption></figure><ol start="4"><li><span><em>Chainsaw Man</em> Parts One and Two are equally cruel, unlike the Old and New Testaments</span></li></ol><p>Old Testament Bible stories have a reputation for being crueller than Jesus-era New Testament tales. And for good reason, fathers were asked to kill their kids to prove their faith, men were locked in pits with lions (also to demonstrate their faith), and leaders like Moses were exiled from the Promised Land on account of bleeding water from a rock to shut up nagging followers wondering, “Are we there yet?” Lotta faith proving ultimatums in the Bible.&nbsp;</p><p>Side bar, no one talks about the end of Moses’ tale as often as the setup, and I’ve always found it fucked up that his impatience at being a chaperone basically pulling up to McDonald's to shut up the kiddos got his shepherding privileges revoked.&nbsp;</p><p>Old Testament God was kind of an asshole, and New Testament God was less wild with his only big thing being sacrificing his own son for our sins for three days like that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Fj_h0ou90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob jail bit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Chainsaw Man</em> Part Two is just as fucked up as its first part. Cute anthropomorphic animals, kids, and bystanders get got, and any semblance of being a core cast member doesn’t protect folks from getting put on an airbrushed shirt either. And with Fujimoto bringing out a<a href="https://www.shonenjump.com/p/sp/2509/vote_chainsaw3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> popularity poll</a>—a fan event meant to <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Popularity_Polls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrate favorite characters</a> he’s infamously used as a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChainsawMan/comments/1nj5w2m/dont_fall_for_the_popularity_voting_fujimoto_will/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“to kill” list</a> in the past—it’s not showing any sign of slowing down on the cruelty front.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump </a></figcaption></figure><ol start="5"><li><span>Polytheism FTW</span></li></ol><p>By far, one of the coolest aspects of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> is that it’s essentially a revival of the polytheism of old, which modern-day Christianity has relegated to the past as an archaic concept. Roman and Greek idols, which represented concepts that people prayed for as blessings, are turned on their head as <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Devil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devils</a> and <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Fiend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiends</a>, the physical manifestations of concepts made powerful in relation to humanity’s fear of them. Reading about how Denji and the gang handle devils like Eternity, Typhoon, Falling, Bomb, and War Devils is just one of the many inventive ways <em>Chainsaw Man</em> approaches modern-day polytheism as a narrative foothold for its story and how humanity can overcome those fears, whether primordial or innocuous, through its heroes.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump </a></figcaption></figure><ol start="6"><li><span>Dog Is God (kind of)</span></li></ol><p>The story of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> is actually as close an analogue to The Holy Trinity in the Bible. Denji grew up with his pet, the chainsaw puppy <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Pochita" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pochita</a>. When they died, Pochita gave up its body, becoming Denji’s heart and transforming him into Chainsaw Man, so that he could witness him fulfill his dreams. It’s very Holy Trinity-coded, but it's especially Christ-like when you consider Chainsaw Man’s motion within the story.&nbsp;</p><p>In tandem with Devils and Fiends, Chainsaw Man is lauded as the most fearsome of all. While Chainsaw Man, being a defender of humanity, makes him as breathless as a hero like Jesus, like any other shonen hero, it’s his reputation among devils that feels the most akin to Christianity. You see, any Devil felled by Chainsaw Man and sequentially consumed by him is erased from the world and the minds of humanity. That’s right, instead of taking away sins, Chainsaw Man takes away concepts humanity fears.&nbsp;</p><p>The manga has showcased what this looks like in action by having concepts like ears removed from the world and mingling for those who have aftiphobia, as well as bigger tentpole fears like Nazis, World War II, nuclear weapons, and AIDS from humanity. Chainsaw Man is worshipped and feared for this power, and that’s kinda radder than what Christianity has with the weaponized placebo of thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol start="7"><li><span>Is actually about gun control</span></li></ol><p>While the real world often weaponizes things like The Bible and Amendments as excuses for persecuting marginalized folks and ignoring policies that could otherwise better humanity, the main thrust of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> is pretty much about a topic America is too gun-shy to address whenever tragedy strikes: Gun control. Denji’s mission in Part One is to collect bullet fragments to eventually face off against the <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Gun_Devil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gun Devil</a>, who mysteriously disappeared. Still, it has been gaining power from folks' fear of it after wiping out a massive swath of humanity with one devastating blast. That’s as prescient as a hero’s journey can go.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol start="8"><li><span>Denji is basically Samson, the oddest character in the Bible, but with chainsaws for arms</span></li></ol><p>While it would be easy to say that Denji is basically Naruto Jesus about my sixth point, I’d reckon Denji is the closest thing manga has gotten to adapting the tale of Samson. Samson, one of my favorite tales in the Bible, is notable for its out-of-place feel in relation to the rest of the tales, as it follows a man who’s super strong and fights for God. All God asks of him is to swear off alcohol, touching dead bodies, and cutting his hair. That last point is crucial since his hair is the source of his strength. Samson went around killing lions with his bare hands, defeating Philistines using the jawbone of a donkey, and carrying the Gates of Gaza on his shoulders for miles on some comic book character shit.&nbsp;</p><p>To counteract Samson, the Philistines sent out a woman named Delilah, whom Samson fell head over heels for, to uncover the source of his strength. After several trysts where he lied about his strength, he finally told her about his hair, and she betrayed him,&nbsp; leading to his capture, blinding, and imprisonment. In a last-ditch effort, Samson prayed to God, leading to his hair growing back and him pulling down the pillars of a temple, killing himself and thousands of Philistines who imprisoned him.&nbsp;</p><p>Reader, if that isn’t Denji and Makima’s whole relationship, replacing hair growth with his heart, then I don’t know what is. It also doesn’t hurt that the story of Samson’s themes are about squandered potential, diving purpose, and sacrifice. That aligns nicely with Denji slowly figuring out his Maslow’s hierarchy of needs throughout the series as he grapples with his humanity and the fame that comes with being a hero.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump </a></figcaption></figure><ol start="9"><li><span>Cringe girls doing girl-failure things representation</span></li></ol><p>The Bible, for all its divine drama, is kind of a boys’ club where women rarely get the spotlight unless they’re birthing messiahs. Sure, there’s Mother Mary and Esther (forever immortalized as a <a href="https://veggietales-the-ultimate-veggiepedia.fandom.com/wiki/Esther" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">green onion in <em>VeggieTales</em></a>), but the canon’s pretty thin on women doing rad, messy, morally ambiguous stuff that feels genuinely human. <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, on the other hand, is overflowing with female characters who aren’t sanitized paragons. They’re chaotic, vain, vulnerable, and painfully relatable—case in point: <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Asa_Mitaka" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asa Mitaka</a>, the deuteragonist of Part Two.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Denji, Asa fulfills gendered tropes—she’s awkward, selfish, and thirsting for romantic validation in ways that are both cringe and cathartic. <a href="https://kotaku.com/chainsaw-man-asa-female-incel-shonen-jump-manga-1850208738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As Sisi Jiang points out</a>, her inner monologue is a masterclass in emotional dissonance. She wants love but refuses to look like she’s begging for it. She also has no issue with others sacrificing themselves for her but finds it hard to cope with the guilt of feeling like she could do more to save others. In a genre where women are often relegated to being shy support beams in a male-centric trio, <em>Chainsaw Man</em> gives them the spotlight and a majority of the series’ big hero moments. They’re not just reflections of virtue, but mirrors to our messiest selves, and that’s rad.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://youtu.be/zZniAuAzeG8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol start="10"><li><span>Hates America&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p>In a series rife with reality-altering devils and fiends, whenever the U.S. government is mentioned, it carries a presence like a shadowly, manipulative force responsible for undignified deaths far more brutal than its fantastical villains. The key difference in their menace is that Devils and fiends are disorganized in their terror, almost downright random, like encountering an animal in the wild. America is a fear-fueled machine and a huge component of why the Gun Devil is such a huge problem. The Gun Devil, in a way, is a literal embodiment of mass violence and national trauma that America has played a significant part in on a global scale. Plus, all you have to do to get a vibe check on Fujimoto’s thoughts on America is to check out his drawing of Captain America.&nbsp;</p><p>Hell, the series recently revealed that the War Devil loves America because it reverse-engineered nuclear weapons despite being a concept Chainsaw Man erased from the world. Not every day a modern-day theocratic-leaning work displayed its politics bare for the world to enjoy on a weekly comic book basis, but not everything can be <em>Chainsaw Man</em>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone"><h3>The EA Sale Is Bad News For Everyone</h3></a><p>Except--you'll never believe it--the guys who already have the money</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/chainsaw-man-reze-arc-tatsuki-fujimoto-the-bible]]></content:encoded>

Avalon has changed several times over the years, and we don't know how it might change for this 2026 release, so none of the locations from the original map are guaranteed to return.

			<p>Starting tomorrow, October 1, 2025, you'll no longer be able to redeem Microsoft Rewards points towards Xbox Game Pass subscriptions, which means today, September 30, 2025, is the last day you'll be able to redeem any Microsoft Rewards points you may have towards Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m22wu2q4st2f">first spotted by Wario64</a>, who shared the statement from Microsoft announcing that you'll no longer be able to redeem Microsoft Rewards points for Xbox Game Pass. That said, there is still a way to get Xbox Game Pass through redeeming Microsoft Rewards points; you'll have to use your Rewards points towards redeeming an Xbox gift card.</p>



<p>As Wario64 points out, that means if you want to use your points to get even just one month of Game Pass, you'll need 6,000 more points than you would have if you could still redeem them directly for a Game Pass subscription.</p>







<p>It's the latest change to the Rewards Points system, and one that hasn't been met with favour from those who actively use the system. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1nuhtri/microsoft_rewards_starting_october_1st_users_will/">quick scroll through the Xbox Reddit page regarding the news</a> shows users are not happy that they'll need to spend thousands more points than before. </p>



<p>In other Game Pass news, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-making-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-xbox-game-pass/">Microsoft and Xbox are reportedly putting more behind the subscription service than ever before in 2025</a>, while former Microsoft and Bethesda executive Pete Hines says that <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/">subscription services like Game Pass don't properly reward the developers and studios making the content that fills the services</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Celebrities are just like you and me. They enjoy some video games, just like the rest of us. And back in 2002, Sony was thrilled that so many famous people really enjoyed playing the PlayStation 2. Sony was so excited, in fact, that the PlayStation maker compiled a large list of “celebrity testimonies” and shared it with the press via the company’s 2002 E3 Press Kit. And thankfully, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ultrabrilliant.xyz/post/3m22r6klg722i">as spotted by Devolver Digital PR manager Andy Kelly</a>, someone all the way back in 2016 uploaded this <a href="https://archive.org/details/PlayStation2CelebQuotes">press kit to the Internet Archive</a>. Now we can all enjoy it.</p> <p>I’ve formatted all of the testimonials below, with minimal editing or tweaks. Now you can easily enjoy all of these testimonials, some of which don’t seem like something Sony would actually want people to read or share. And yes, some of the people below are not great and are super canceled in 2025. Take a shot for each time that happens. (Don’t do that.)</p>

 <hr> <h2>Matthew Perry, actor, <em>Friends</em></h2> <p>“I used to have a social life, go on dates, go to dinner parties, have a job. Now all I do is sit in a big chair and play PlayStation 2. 1 never leave my house. My friends have wondered what happened to me. Howard Hughes must have had one of these.”</p>

 <h2>David Arquette, actor,<em> Scream 3</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is to the gaming world what the computer was to the typewriter. It’s not just an entertainment luxury, but a necessity.”</p> <h2>Hayden Christensen, actor, <em>Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones</em></h2> <p>“I just got [PlayStation 2] a few days ago, but I’ve been playing it non-stop; it’s a great system. The graphics are fantastic, I’ve never seen anything like it before.”</p>

 <h2>Carmen Electra, actress/model,<em> Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“I grew up playing video games. PlayStation 2 takes it to the next level.”</p> <h2>Jeff Probst, host of TV’s <em>Survivor</em></h2> <p>“When we did the first <em>Survivor</em>, I didn’t realize I’d have some downtime between challenges and Tribal Councils, but for <em>Survivor 2</em>, I was ready. I brought a PlayStation 2 as my luxury item. So, we’d finish Tribal Council, head back to base camp, toss in a game and start jammin’. It was a great way to get your mind out of your work and not a bad way to relieve some tension as well.”</p> <h2>Joey Fatone, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I use PlayStation 2 because it is fun and has good graphics. It gives us something else to do on<br> the bus and helps pass the time while traveling from city to city. Got a PS2 in my car too like Chris [Kirkpatrick], and I play at least four to five hours a day.

It is the coolest brand.”</p>

 <h2>Drew Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I’m keeping [my PlayStation 2] in my bunk on the tour bus because I’m afraid I’ll play it too much at home and cause fights with my wife.”</p> <h2>Eddie Cibrian, actor, <em>Third Watch</em></h2> <p>“You are talking to a true PlayStation 2 fan.

 <h2>Lance Bass, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I love my PlayStation 2 because it helps me to get rid of stress on and off the road.”</p> <h2>Michael Rosenbaum, actor, <em>Smallville</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is more fun than my blow-up doll.”</p> <h2>Nick Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I know we’re going to bum through the first PlayStation 2 unit on the first leg of the tour.”</p> <h2>Robert Horry, athlete, Los Angeles Lakers</h2> <p>“I am a big PlayStation 2 fan. I went to the launch party last season and it was the best party I went to and I had to come back and check out the anniversary party. I don’t play the basketball games because I get frustrated. The games won’t let me do moves that I know I can do in real life.”</p> <h2>John Salley, former athlete, Los Angeles Lakers</h2> <p>“My daughter and I compete [on PlayStation 2]. Whenever we get in a fight, we say ‘See you on PlayStation.’ It’s better than a spanking. Just spank them on PlayStation.”</p> <h2>Simon Rex, actor, <em>Jack and Jill </em>(2002 TV show)</h2> <p>“Incredible fast graphics that would make Mario run for the hills. If my friends thought I spent a lot of time on PlayStation, just wait until [PlayStation 2] comes out!”</p>

 <h2>Stefan Lessard, bassist, Dave Matthews Band</h2> <p>“People know when they can’t find me, I’m in my bunk playing PlayStation 2. It’s my saving grace on the road – but I love playing it at home too!”</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel, host, <em>The Man Show</em></h2> <p>“My son is eight years old and is hooked up like an IV to the PlayStation 2 — it keeps him busy.”</p> <h2>Adrien Brody, actor, <em>Dummy</em></h2> <p>“I don’t even have a TV, but I’m going to get one and go crazy with PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Vincent Pastore, actor, A<em>fter the Storm</em>, <em>The Sopranos</em></h2> <p>“I am a big PlayStation 2 fan.

Now I want one for me.”</p> <h2>Nick Stahl, actor, <em>The </em><em>Thin Red Line</em></h2> <p>“The PS2’s graphics are amazing. I can’t wait to own one of these. . .I’ll play it all the time.”</p> <h2>Norman Reedus, actor/model,<em> Gossip</em></h2> <p>“I love playing the PlayStation 2. It’s like meditation.”</p> <h2>Vincent Young, actor</h2> <p>“The sports games are addictive. I can’t put <em>Madden Football</em> down once I start playing. The graphics are so realistic – you can even see the hair on the players’ arms move.”</p> <h2>Catherine Bell, actress,<em> Jag</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is amazing and it looks really cool. Plus, the graphics are incredible. I love the fighting games, especially <em>Tekken Tag</em>, because I find all these crazy combinations, and when I play against my husband I always win.”</p> <h2>Ashley Poole, singer, Dream</h2> <p>“Me and my dad play PlayStation 2 when I go home — I love it. I love it. Holly and I are the PlayStation 2 babies of Dream. On our bus we have all the games and love to play.”</p> <h2>Daphne Zuniga, actress, <em>Melrose Place</em></h2> <p>“My whole life, I’ve never liked video games, but after playing PlayStation 2, I have to get one…”</p> <h2>Debra Cox, singer</h2> <p>“I am a huge, huge, huge PlayStation fan.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades.1312933/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Yakuza fan, I’ve recommended the series from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, otherwise known as RGG, to plenty of people, but it has long come with one big caveat: Yakuza 3. It’s not that there is anything necessarily wrong with it, but with high-quality remakes of the first games in the series, and the more modern and refined graphics and gameplay of the newer entries, it has stood out a bit as a bit of an odd duck, looking and playing worse than the games before and after. However, with the just-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rgg-studio-direct-2025-confirms-yakuza-kiwami-3-remake-spinoff-dark-ties-and-more-heres-everything-announced"><u>Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</u></a>, a twin pack combining a remade Yakuza 3 alongside a brand-new companion game, that might all be about to change. I had a chance to play both at Tokyo Game Show 2025, and I came away impressed by how much RGG Studio is trying to improve and expand on the original. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yakuza Kiwami 3</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza Kiwami 3 isn’t just an up-rezzed port; it’s a full remake. Everything is rebuilt, from the graphics to the combat to the new cut scenes and voice acting – including some modern motion capture to better bring the characters to life. While it will still follow the story of Yakuza 3, some scenes will play out differently or expand. It’s an ambitious agenda, but probably the right one to bring the now 16-year-old game to modern audiences. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My hands-on begins with Kazuma Kiryu chopping wood outside the Morning Glory Orphanage, where he was raised and now runs, in Okinawa. The modern graphics look great as he swings his axe, his sweat glistening in crisp 4K (for those that are into that sort of thing). After the events of Yakuza 2, he’s moved on from being a Yakuza and is trying to live a peaceful life running the orphanage. An eviction notice arrives, and Kiryu heads into town to confront the head of the Ryudo family, the owners of the land on which the orphanage is built. He runs into Rikiya Shimabukuro, a member of the Ryudo clan and, naturally, a brawl ensues, giving us our first taste of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-official-combat-gameplay-trailer"><u>updated battle system</u></a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Charging Kiriyu’s Heat Gauge to execute brutal finishers like smashing a chair on an opponent’s head never gets old.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiriyu has two fighting styles to employ. The first is Dragon of Dojima, his classic brawling style, mixing punches, kicks, throws, and environmental weapons like street signs, traffic cones, and even the odd bicycle when the opportunity presents itself. It’s as flashy as ever, and charging Kiriyu’s Heat Gauge to execute brutal finishers like smashing a chair on an opponent’s (in this case, Rikiya’s) head never gets old. The real magic comes when I switch to his brand new Ryukyu style, however. This style is rooted in Okinawan culture, and while using it, Kiryu combos through eight different weapons, like a pair of tonfa, a weighted chain, or, my personal favorite, a boat oar. I put away my opponent with a mix of all of the above, which was enough to convince Rikiya to direct me towards where to find his boss. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This opened up an opportunity for a bit of open-world exploration, which I took full advantage of, exploring a nearby street market, beating up some ruffians with a crowbar, and taking in a quick round of a golf mini-game. Okinawa looks great on the modern engine, and getting around was a breeze thanks to the new Street Surfer Mk. 0, a Segway-like rideable that Kiryu seems to be able to summon out of thin air for some quick joyriding. Zooming around on that, hopping off to beat the snot out of some goons with my tiny shield (also part of the Ryukyu set), then making a speedy getaway was so Yakuza in the best way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I turned my attention back to the main story. As Rikiya escorts me to his headquarters, we are interrupted by a commotion as a rival family trashes a local market, taking the shop owner hostage. Kiriyu, sweet guy that he is, agrees to help, leading to a massive nine-vs-two melee, as he and Rikiya take on the boss and his lackeys. This really showcased how much more refined the combat is, as I was able to take advantage of the smooth movement and dodging, creating windows to bash the bad guys and escape, with a slick double-team KO of one poor crony eating a massive kick to the face from Kiryi while restrained by Rikiya. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My time in Yakuza Kiwami 3 ended there, but I barely scratched the surface of everything new coming to it. There will be more personal moments with supporting characters, time dedicated to running the daily operations at the orphanage and taking care of the kids, even a new team battle mode where you build your own biker gang to fight for turf with others. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dark Ties</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The bigger surprise of the Yakuza Kiwami 3 announcement was the reveal of Dark Ties, an all-new companion story to the main game.  This places you in the role of Yoshitaka Mine, the antagonist of Yakuza 3. Dark Ties covers Mine’s rise from a disgraced businessman, driven from his own tech startup, to the underworld boss that acts as Kazuma’s foil in Yakuza 3. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-a0751c8f4adedccafc6ce8de3d09f3147e1c1ff7-1920x1080-1759256313741.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">His story begins with Mine reflecting on his life and the loneliness that drove him to pursue wealth and influence. By happenstance, he witnesses a deadly fight between rival Yakuza families, and seeing the bond of men willing to die for their boss, Daigo Dojima, acts as a catalyst, and he sets out to see if he can find that same loyalty in the criminal underworld. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo takes place early in the game, with Mine tracking down Tsuyoshi Kanda, an infamous Yakuza just released from prison. Mine hopes Kanda will be his entry point to begin his own rise, though as is Yakuza tradition, you don’t go more than a few early steps before some punks decide to pick a fight. Apparently, Mine's suitcase looks expensive, and they want whatever is inside. A bad decision. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-ba732b95bcacaf8be1e93757deb185452b404294-1920x1080-1759256328386.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The core battle system is roughly the same as Yakuza 3, but with a few significant twists. Mine’s fighting style is very different from Kiryu’s, relying heavily on quick boxing combos, technical wrestling moves, and new aerial attacks. He can jump and plant a foot on the chest of one enemy, then leap to another, dishing out damage all around as he delivers an array of flying moves, like springboard jump kicks or mid-air tackles. They look very cool, and make for a fun bit of planning ahead as you scope out which enemies to latch onto and jump towards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The core battle system is roughly the same as Yakuza 3, but with a few significant twists.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the standard Heat Gauge that fills up to enable special moves, Mine has three chained hearts that fill up as he lands attacks. Once at least one is full, he can activate a powerful buffed mode called Dark Awakening. This functions like a new fighting style, with a different moveset unleashing extremely powerful attacks.  More than one chained heart can be activated at once, increasing the potency of Dark Awakening. It’s a neat twist to make Mine’s gameplay more distinct, and tapping into the rage behind his calm exterior fits his character well. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-9cba6bf65a0beef3fe9d84599989fa573efcdfb4-1920x1080-1759256341008.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It quickly became clear these punks picked the wrong suitcase to try to snatch, as I knocked them senseless to the cheers of onlookers who witnessed the attempted robbery. With the ruffians handled, I’m given the option to head to the prison to track down Kanda or kill some time exploring the city. This sorry mission seems important, so naturally I… immediately go find a karaoke bar to sing a song. Hey, it is Yakuza after all. I rent the room, and Mine pours his heart and soul into his solo performance, which is really funny given his normally extremely stoic nature. I nail rhythm on my button presses, delivering a perfect performance befitting a man of Mine’s talents. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buoyed by my outstanding singing, I decide it’s time to get down to business and try to hail a cab to the prison where Kanda is being released. One more group of punks tries to stop me (nothing a fireman’s carry followed by a quick kick to the face couldn’t solve), and I find myself outside of the prison as Kanda takes out his frustration on his paltry, two-man welcoming committee. Kanda is penniless, his branch of the Yakuza family disgraced. As Mine tails him through the streets of Kamurocho, my hands-on time ends just as he rounds a corner to meet his future right-hand man for the first time. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-f6d5496302d2de4c46d55e782221f7e6f0f03ffb-1920x1080-1759256356109.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As a sucker for a good organized crime story, I’m definitely intrigued to see how much we get to witness Mine channel his inner Vito Corleone and build his criminal empire from the ground up, especially if it means some proper bromance time with Mine and Diago. The fact that it comes as part of the package with Yakuza Kiwami 3 is great, and I’m excited to see how it all turns out when Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties release on February 12, 2026. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades]]></content:encoded>

                <p>No one likes waiting, especially when there's nothing to do to pass the time. Peak developer Landfall Games had that same thought when working on Peak's most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/520850995978175752" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DillyDally update</a>. It adds a handful of activities to lobbies while waiting for other players to join, including a basketball hoop, photo booth, and chess pieces.</p><p>Players went straight to work with the chess pieces, but not according to official rules the classic game uses.</p><p>"My friend and I got bored after we finished a climb," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Imanthony89/" rel="nofollow ">Imanthony89</a> in a post on the Peak subreddit. "Used all the chess pieces and bing bong. That's a queen and a few pawns above the rafters"</p><p>The update released last week, and social media was flooded with chess pieces stacked ceiling-high in the airport lobby over the weekend. Peak's physics system, which can lead to some quirky antics on climbs, turned out to be perfect for some extracurricular activities for the scouts.</p><p>Peak lobbies are set in airport waiting areas, as the game begins with a playful loading-screen plane crash that sets you and your friends off on your journey to summit a procedurally generated mountain. The climb is almost never easy, so it makes sense that scouts should have some fun while waiting in the terminal.</p><p>Landfall Games and publisher Aggro Crab have released a few updates since Peak became a massive hit when it launched in June. A new biome, the Mesa--complete with tornadoes, scorching heat, and scorpions--was added in August. Another biome has also been teased, but no confirmed details have been shared yet.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my article about the $55 billion EA buyout deal</a>, I singled out BioWare as the likely target of potential layoffs following the closure. Indeed, later today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming posted an article</a> citing inside sources from the Canadian studio, revealing that the employees are already worried about this sudden transition.</p>



<p>Two of the anonymous sources allegedly said:</p>



<p><em>Look at the negativity that came after Dragon Age. If we felt it was only going to get worse then, you can imagine what some of us think now.</em></p>



<p><em>I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs. Kind of feels like a matter of time.</em></p>



<p>The reference is to last year's launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the studio's first new game since the massive failure of Anthem. Unfortunately, despite a fairly positive critical reception, the game did not sell nearly as well as publisher Electronic Arts had hoped (the goal was to hit 3 million players, but in January 2025, EA said Veilguard had only 'engaged' 1.5 million players), <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading to layoffs that brought the studio headcount to less than a hundred</a>. </p>



<p>BioWare is now focused on making the next Mass Effect game, but will they even get the chance? For now, the sentiment inside the studio is simply to go ahead until they are told otherwise:</p>



<p><em>We're going to keep working until they tell us we are done. It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.</em></p>



<p>Insider Gaming even reports having heard that there were attempts to sell off BioWare at some point, though they must have gone nowhere for the time being, as there was no such official news alongside the buyout deal.</p>



<p>Perhaps that would be the best chance for the studio that made some of the greatest Western roleplaying games of all time, such as Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age. As things stand, on one hand, Electronic Arts going private could mean slightly less pressure to deliver right away; on the other, the publisher has a lot of debt and its new owners (PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners) may want immediate cost-cutting measures to deal with it. </p>

            <p>
What if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> was a bit less sci-fi, and a lot more medieval? You would, in theory, get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pax-dei">Pax Dei</a>, a game that first entered early access in June last year. Responses to it so far appear to be, well, mixed, but as seems to be quite common with These Kinds Of Games, everyone that's played it appears to be going through some kind of Stockholm syndrome kind of situation, as the game is still going. It's going so far as to launch into 1.0 in fact, and developer Mainframe Industries have even put a date to it.
</p>
<p>
That release date is October 16th, about half a month away at the time of writing (assuming I still know how to read calendars). Mainframe outlined what you can expect in the leadup to the launch, as well as what will happen at launch itself in a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1995520/view/510718530665054707?l=english">Steam news post</a> too.
</p>
<p>
From October 6th until the 14th, servers for the game will be completely offline. On the 14th, at 3am PDT, anyone that owns a founder's pack will have access to the game's 1.0 servers, and then on the 16th at 8am PDT, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> will be available to everyone. Something to note is that with the launch of 1.0, everyone that has been playing so far will have everything wiped - shards, characters, plots, inventories, skills, and more. This is the final wipe though, Mainframe explained, so you won't have to worry if you're new to the game.
</p>
<p>
One big difference is that Pax Dei will also have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1995520/view/524223243273373577">subscription model</a>. You can just play the game by buying it, but memberships give you a whole bunch of extras that do seem a little bit unfair. In particular, depending on which membership plan you go for, you'll get a number of plot tokens, which let you literally own certain pieces of land - that you have to continuously pay for with said tokens. Yes, this is essentially digital rent. Whether this works out or not, well, we'll find out in the next few months.
