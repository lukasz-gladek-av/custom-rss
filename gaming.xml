  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Progress on the third chapter of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-are-making-great-progress-confirms-director">has been steady and smooth</a> so far, with the game having already reached a "playable" state <a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/">according to game director Naoki Hamaguchi</a>. Now, we've received an update on its (still secret) title and what engine the team is using.</p>
<p>The news came via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">GameSpot's latest interview</a> with the director, which was shared on 23rd January, right as Final Fantasy 7 Remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-still-excellent-on-xbox-and-switch-2-even-if-its-beginning-to-show-its-age">arrived on Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2</a> with excellent ports. Without getting into actual spoilers, the "Remake" label of these games goes beyond the traditional use of the word, as there's a meta narrative which has gradually reshaped the direction of the overall trilogy.</p>
<p>As a result, fan expectations since Rebirth's release was that Part 3's title would be in line with the previous two. No word on what the final name is yet, but Hamaguchi has now said "the title has been locked" following creative director (and OG FF7 veteran) Tetsuya Nomura making the final decision recently.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit which explains the threequel's fast-moving development comes from Hamaguchi confirming they've ultimately decided to use Unreal Engine 4 over UE5 after making "a lot of modifications to fit our needs." As impressive as UE5 can be when used properly, it's also led to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/unreal-engine-5-has-been-a-disappointment">several high-profile disappointments</a>, so it's not surprising to see one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s key teams playing things safe in the last stretch of this hugely ambitious trilogy. "It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs," he added.</p><p>This should also help with getting Rebirth and the as-yet-untitled third chapter running on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> following Remake's remarkable looks and stable performance. At this moment, the team has "gotten [Rebirth] to function" on Nintendo's still-infant hybrid console, but a release date won't be locked until more optimizations are done.</p>
<p>It's all quite impressive considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> launched less than two years ago and "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-final-fantasy-7-interview-part-3-hamaguchi">almost no documentation</a>" remains from the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>'s development, but in the age of the average AAA project taking around half a decade to finish (if we're lucky), Hamaguchi's team seems to have cracked the code with this daring three-part effort.</p>

<figure data-uuid="14d63d770966d"><a title="FF7 Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14d63d770966d/ff7-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>So, the third entry in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy officially has a final title (or subtitle, as is more likely), according to an interview with director Naoki Hamaguchi over at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">GameSpot</a>.</p>
<p>It's a pretty significant milestone, and as stated by Hamaguchi-san, the team had it down to two potential titles during Paris Games Week at the end of October 2025. He said that the final decision was ultimately up to creative director Tetsuya Nomura, who served as co-director on Remake alongside Hamaguchi and Motomu Toriyama.</p>
<p>Here's what Hamaguchi said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was up to Mr. Nomura to decide which it is. And yes, after returning from Paris Games Week, he did choose one, so I can say the title has been locked."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine having such a crucial decision rest on your shoulders. The power!</p>
<p>Of course, this news has merely reignited our curiosity as to what the title will actually be. 'Reunion' certainly sounds plausible, but then that's already been used for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crisis_core_-final_fantasy_vii-_reunion">Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion</a> and the recently-announced <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/life_is_strange_reunion">Life is Strange: Reunion</a>.</p>
<p>We're also not too sure when Square Enix will decide to fully reveal the game given that it will also need to coordinate the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> on the Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S. Phew!</p>
<p>Still, that certainly won't stop us from speculating. So we've compiled a poll below with some possible (and not-so-possible) subtitles for the third entry, so go ahead and choose which one speaks to you the most. And if you have a completely different idea, then be sure to let us know with a comment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clive Barker’s Undying RTX Remix Path Tracing Mod Alpha Release Now Available]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod-out-now/</link>
            <guid>1415950</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The latest<strong> RTX Remix path tracing mod</strong> to be <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-mod/addons/undying-rtx-remix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on ModDB</a> is dedicated to <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong>. The original game, an acclaimed first-person survival horror released by <strong>EA Los Angeles</strong> nearly twenty-five years ago, was made <strong>with the very first iteration of Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>With the power of NVIDIA RTX Remix, modder <strong>Pathtracedparadise</strong> heavily overhauled the visuals. Some of their work includes <strong>replacing more than a thousand of the original game's textures</strong> so far with high-resolution (2048x2048) PBR materials that have been upscaled with additional levels of detail added by running each texture multiple times through various Topaz Gigapixel models and then hand-edited as needed. The PBRFusion model was used to generate the PBR map via ComfyUI.</p>



<p>That said, <strong>this is still just an Alpha release</strong> of Clive Barker's Undying RTX Remix path tracing mod. The modder has so far focused on revamping the first couple of hours, as well as a few sections later in the game. The remainder of the game is playable, as lights were automatically placed throughout by a custom D3D9 renderer, but they are not placed in ideal locations and have not yet been adjusted to look good. Furthermore, there are other issues at the moment:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mirrors still need to be fixed</li>



<li>Portals do not animate</li>



<li>Skyboxes aren't rendering correctly</li>



<li>Only some of the Scrye reveals work </li>
</ul>



<p>If you still want to check out the mod (whose download is around <strong>10.5 GB</strong> at the moment) even at this early stage, you'll have to <strong><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/undying-renewal1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first install the Undying Renewal mod</a></strong>, which adds proper widescreen support with more resolution options (up to 4K), quality of life improvements, controller support, multiplayer support, subtitles support, restores cut content, adds a Vulkan renderer for improved performance, reduces load times, and adds a functional in-game settings menu. </p>



<p>After that mod is installed, extract the files from the "Place contents in Undying System folder" folder to the System folder of your Clive Barker's Undying installation (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System), overriding any existing files. Then, <strong>you must run the game once to ensure the RTX Remix hooks are installed</strong> (you should see a message in the top-left corner of the screen and be able to access the RTX Remix menu by pressing Alt+X). Close the game, then open the System folder location (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System) and create an 'rtx-remix' folder within it. Extract the entire 'Undying RTX Mod' folder into this 'mods' folder. To adjust the Field of View (FOV) value, you'll have to edit it directly in the User.ini file.</p>

<p>Fans of Clive Barker's work <a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-gamescom-hands-on-preview-pleasure-and-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can look forward to the new <strong>Hellraiser: Revival</strong> game</a>, in development at <strong>Saber Interactive</strong> and scheduled for release this year.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s shift from early access to full release came with heap of tweaks and changes as Larian finalised their huge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. Naturally, this meant certain bits or plans not making it into the final cut, and if you've come to long for any of those after playing them initially or hearing about them, then odds are a new mod is right up your alley. It's also really cool if you, you know, just want more BG3.</p>

<p>The mod's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16830?tab=description">Early Access Scenes Restored</a>' by modding whiz HyperspaceTowel, who's been working on restoring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17511">bits</a> of early access Baldur's Gate 3 for a little while now. This latest creation's the culmation of all that effort, delivering a bunch of restored "deleted scenes, encounters, and NPCs" in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>According to the modder, that's "over 100 conversations and more than 1000 lines of voiced dialogue" so far, with plans to keep adding more going forwards. Making that up are the likes of chats with resurrected early access characters, camp chats, and companion reactions to the various stuff you get up to. HyperspaceTowel explains that most of these returning bits were a case of bringing back an early access scene as "pretty much a 1:1 transplant" with minor camera or dialogue tweaks, though there were some that had to be "built from the ground up based on the scraps I could find".</p>

<p>The modder cites shell-collecting kid Lotan, whose reconstructed chat's shown in the video above, as an example of the latter. Among the other revived NPCs or chats you can expect to run into include would-be music box seller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um9-w9ovbn8">Nerela</a>, some enthralled fishermen, Shadowheart issuing an ultimatum, and Gale channeling his best Nigella Lawson as he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiSvKArS4ac&amp;t=3s">yacks about his deer stew</a>.</p><p>HyperspaceTowel's opted to stick to including bits of early access BG3 which fit into the final version of the game, which means the likes of early Wyll and Karlach - plus some romance scenes featuring Gale and the former - have been left to go into another mod or mods which'll keep non-can stuff separate. They've also opted to keep separate a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/20098">freshly restored quest</a> surrounding whether or not to chow down on a hermit crab. The reason in that case looks primarily to be the fact the files it's been restored from are very old, so some of the dialogue lacks voice files.</p>
<p>If you fancy seeing what these restored early access encounters add to your next BG3 playthrough, the good news is that the main restoration mod appears not to require any other framework mods to work. However, you will want to make sure you kick off a new run once you've installed it and avoid ditching it midway through a playthrough you plan to finish.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-is-back-at-a-record-low-in-another-clearance-move-on-amazon-not-the-official-store-2000662800</link>

              <p>There are deals, and then there are deals that make you say “This is the way.” (It’s OK to mix metaphors in a galaxy far, far away.) Right now, LEGO’s Star Wars Millennium Falcon has been restocked at Amazon after a heavy-duty holiday selling burst and it’s arrived in 2026 in one of those rare price windows where it’s genuinely worth firing up the hyperdrive and snagging it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">The Amazon limited-time deal for the 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set is going for $68, 20% off its usual price.</a> That might sound like pocket change compared to what some of us drop on boxed trilogy marathons or obscure action figures, but when a set that’s this beloved dips below its typical tag, it’s actually worth paying attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Grown-Up LEGO Fun</h2>
<p data-start="855" data-end="1359">Now before you go imagining the 7,500-plus-piece Ultimate Collector Series starship that’s the size of a studio apartment and costs about a much — let’s be super clear: This is the smaller 25th Anniversary edition 921-piece Millennium Falcon that’s been popping up in deals lately. That said, 921 pieces is still plenty of bricks to keep your fingers busy and your inner kid grinning ear to ear, and this version comes with a display stand so you aren’t sacrificing precious shelf real estate to chaos.</p>
<p data-start="1361" data-end="1855">This isn’t one of those microfighters you flick at your coffee table. It’s the kind of model that earns a place of prominent display as a collector’s item and conversation piece, and not in a heap of other half-wrecked LEGO sets after a pretend battle. Kids probably <em data-start="1649" data-end="1654">can</em> build it, but this adult-oriented set feels more like a collectible for anyone who’s ever whispered “She’s faster than she looks” at a spaceship dangling from a peg at a toy store.</p>


<h2 data-start="1361" data-end="1855">Use the Force</h2>
<p data-start="1857" data-end="2195">LEGO Star Wars sets — even ones that aren’t giant — don’t linger on sale for long. They’re the kind of things that disappear off retailer sites faster than the Falcon makes the Kessel Run. When the price drops to a fresh low and stock comes back, it’s usually fleeting.</p>
<p data-start="2197" data-end="2503">So if you’ve been on the fence about adding this to your collection, now’s the time to decide. Whether it’s for a gift, a weekend build sesh, or a new centerpiece atop your entertainment center, a 20% drop on a fan-favorite set isn’t something that happens every week. See it while you can, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">while it’s still on sale at Amazon for just $68 — because once it sells out again, there’s no guaranteeing when it’ll be back.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mention of Starfield 2.0 is leading fans to believe the update is real; however, there’s still no word on when it might be released. </p>



<p>We have heard about Starfield getting a new update and a DLC several times back in 2025, without a concrete release date. We have seen Bethesda mention it for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third time</a> some months ago, and we also saw a tease with the words ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ in an anniversary post; however, no concrete details have been shared. </p>







<h2 id="h-bethesda-is-handling-starfield-2-0-in-a-weird-way">Bethesda is Handling Starfield 2.0 in a ‘Weird’ Way</h2>



<p>The latest mention of Starfield 2.0 comes from the popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXqlxb0a6xk&amp;t=8136s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defining Duke Podcast</a>, with co-host MrMattyPlays, who claims he saw it behind closed doors. When talking about Starfield 2.0’s upcoming update with guest Gene Part, Matty started by saying, “The way Bethesda is handling 2.0 (Starfield 2.0) is weird.” </p>



<p>Matty confirmed that he saw it “behind closed doors”, but he can’t say anything else other than the fact that he saw it. He also confirmed that he wasn’t provided a release window. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-starfield-2-0">What to Expect from Starfield 2.0?</h2>



<p>Though no concrete details have been revealed about Starfield 2.0, some information has been shared in a previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>. It seems the game’s spaceflight mechanics will step away from loading screens for “more free-form and continuous” traversal, and the Creation System has also been enhanced for better spaceflight and future-proofed for upcoming titles. </p>



<p>Additionally, the Starfield 2.0 update will bring the long-anticipated PS5 and Switch 2 ports, with the developers optimising the title for “low power” devices like handhelds. Some sources have also shared that it won’t be on par with Cyberpunk 2.0. However, readers should treat this info with caution as it hasn’t been officially confirmed. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-all-kennys-quests-explained/</link>
            <guid>1415938</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite’s collab with South Park continues, with the stars of the show dishing out a bunch of tasks to tick off to earn rewards, but understanding Kenny’s quests is a tough task.</p>



<p>There are no direct instructions to complete Kenny’s quests in Fortnite, so you will be shooting in the dark unless you know exactly what is being asked of you.</p>



<p>To make the task much easier, Insider Gaming has all the details on exactly what you need to do to work your way through Kenny’s tasks in Fortnite before they expire.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-kenny-quests">All Fortnite Kenny Quests</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tick them off. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kenny’s quests in Fortnite shouldn’t take too much difficulty to complete, once you know what they are, as they can mostly be ticked off by general gameplay.</strong></p>



<p>The tricky aspect comes from the fact that you need a translator to understand what Kenny is tasking you to do as, just like in South Park itself, it’s difficult to understand exactly what he is saying.</p>



<p>Like the other South Park quests, completing these tasks provides CRED and Memberberries to advance the Born in Chaos mini pass. However, they won’t appear or be completable until you complete four of the Cartman quests. If you haven’t completed the stages before that, there’s a fair bit of grinding ahead of you.</p>



<p>A full list of the quests is shown in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Fortnite Kenny Quest</th><th data-align="center">How to Complete</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpphmmph</td><td data-align="center">Visit the zipline tower in Battlewood Boulevard</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mmmmpmpph mmhhmph</td><td data-align="center">Get Eliminated</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpmphh mmmph</td><td data-align="center">Get revived by teammeates three times</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mphmmph mhhmmph</td><td data-align="center">Get 10 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mmmh mpphh mmmph</td><td data-align="center">Travel 200m in the air</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpph mhppmmph</td><td data-align="center">Hire a Specialist</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-when-do-kenny-s-quests-in-fortnite-expire">When do Kenny’s Quests in Fortnite expire?</h2>



<p><strong>Kenny’s quests will remain available in Fortnite until the end of the South Park collab on February 6.</strong></p>



<p>That gives players plenty of time to tick off all of the tasks and claim all of the rewards before they disappear, though, if you do miss out, the items could return to the Item Shop in the future.</p>



<p>Kenny’s quests are not the final batch coming to Fortnite before the end of the collab, either, as Part 6 will arrive on January 29, providing more tasks to complete.</p>

            <p>Mawning all and happy new week to the sickos who celebrate the return of Monday. It’s time for another helping of cosmic despair as we slide irresistibly down the Gullet of Entropy, pawing in vain at the Tonsils of Hubris. Also, some new PC game releases. Maybe save your pennies for Wednesday and Thursday, which are uncommonly rammed. </p><!--more-->

<li>It’s time for John Highguard to guard high in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">Highguard</a>, the Keighley-anointed sci-fantasy raid shooter that has attracted more critical writing pre-release than most games get in total by virtue of 1) it being made by former Apex Legends and Titanfall devs 2) nobody knowing a goddamn thing about how it plays</li>

<h2>Tuesday 27th January</h2>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2362060/CODE_VEIN_II/">Code Vein 2</a> is Bandai Namco’s latest anime Soulslike with a time-travelling, fix-the-past-to-save-the-NPC premise and some crackpot character designs and outfits.

<li>It’s time for a remake of turn-based mech bonanza <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3795900/FRONT_MISSION_3_Remake/">Front Mission 3</a>. Ah, I remember playing this briefly on PS1. I think I was lured away from it by Alundra 2, in the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question for the comments thread: how do I stop Steam game pages autoplaying trailers when shuffling the top media display? It routinely scares the pants off me when I have several tabs open. Some day, Gabe Newell will pay for his crimes. In the shorter term, the RPS team are spending this week thinking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, Yakuza, Arknights Endfield and various secret things.</p><p>What are you up to? Nothing good, I hope. Let us know if there's a recommendation-worthy game we've skipped. I left a few out because I'm utterly aghast at your apathy on this front. Don't let me tell you what to like. Show me you have guts and a little spine! Not like the lady in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/code-vein">Code Vein</a> 2, though.</p>

<p>Your Code Vein 2 efforts will be in vain without knowing the Code Vein 2 trophy list. Imagine getting all the way through the game and not knowing a crucial piece of information or encountering a missable trophy? The game’s trophies and achievements will test you.</p>



<p>Finishing a Soulslike deserves a physical trophy in itself. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein 2</a> isn’t going to be easy, and anyone could tell you that, judging from the first game and what was shown before launch. In addition to the relentless difficulty and dastardly obstacles Bandai throws at you, there are plenty of extra things to do through trophies and achievements.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Nothing to worry about, right? Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can find 36 trophies and achievements to earn throughout your Code Vein 2 journey, with Xbox owners only getting 35, due to the PlayStation’s Platinum Trophy counting as extra.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not an exhausting amount from the outside. However, the reality is that bosses, exploration, and upgrading abilities and items to the maximum is going to take time. Make sure you’ve got plenty of free time for this one!</p>

So, while other titles are expected, Undisputed will be February's main addition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undisputed is expected to become available on February 3, for PlayStation Plus subscribers across all tiers from Essential upwards. As ever, it should remain available for a month, until March 3.

Still, the fluidity of its gameplay animations and reactiveness of its commentators don’t come close to living up to the high bar that was set by the Fight Night series back in the late 2000s, and its realistic fighting can be a little dull if you’re in the mood for a KO instead of a TKO."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Ashly Burch, who voiced Chloe Price in the first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game, says her character and that of Max Caulfield will "always have a special place" in her heart, despite the actress not returning to the series.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and Deck Nine lifted the lid on the next series entry, Life is Strange: Reunion. Reunion is billed as the "thrilling finale to the Max and Chloe saga", which began over 10 years ago with the eponymous Life is Strange.</p>

<p>Since Life is Strange's original story from 2015, the character of Chloe has appeared twice more: once in 2017's prequel Before the Storm, and again in Reunion, which is set to debut later this year. However, unlike the original, Chloe in these two games is voiced not by Burch, but by Rhianna DeVries.</p>
<p>Now, speaking with Eurogamer following Reunion's reveal, Burch says she doesn't "know a lot about this project", but regardless, Max and Chloe's characters still mean a great deal to her, and there is no doubt that they always will.</p>
<p>"I wasn't asked to reprise my role as Chloe, so I'm learning about Reunion at the same time as the fans," Burch tells me, before adding she is "grateful people still care so much about these characters".</p>
<p>Closing, Burch says: "Max and Chloe will always have a special place in my heart."</p>

<p>As well as Life is Strange, Burch has also lent her talents to a myriad of other projects across games, films and TV. This includes Borderlands' Tiny Tina, The Last of Us Part 2's Mel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-developer-replacing-all-actors-with-robots-not-going-to-happen-says-aloy-voice-actress">Aloy in PlayStation's Horizon series</a>, and many more. In addition, Burch is the creator of the YouTube series I'm Happy You're Here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ashly-burch-gets-into-bed-with-puppets-to-talk-about-mental-health">which she describes as "like Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, but for adults"</a>, about the many mental health hurdles we face today.</p>
<p>As for the Life is Strange series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-reunion-will-be-the-thrilling-finale-to-the-max-and-chloe-saga-coming-march">Reunion is set to arrive on 26th March</a>, across Xbox Series X/S, PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Work on Banjo: Recompiled, a PC port of the iconic N64 platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, had been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-decompilation-project-for-banjo-kazooie-is-now-100-complete.968472/">advancing in the background</a> for a while now, but no one was expecting a shadow drop. That's happened now, and we're impressed by the full list of features.</p>
<p>Wiseguy, a modder who'd already worked (alongside a team) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIp7C2ro2T8">Zelda 64: Recompiled</a>, an adaptation for PC of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a>, shared the trailer on 24th January via his own YouTube channel:</p>

<p>The nearly-four-minute look at the ambitious port isn't just a gameplay reel, as custom scenes and text boxes in the style of the classic game tell both veterans and curious newcomers about all the new features (and even a few surprises) added to this <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a>-based version of the game.</p><p>In humorous and colourful fashion, we're told about high framerate support (60, 120, and "whatever FPS you want") and even adjustments for ultrawide monitors. Moreover, the custom options menu is full of settings for general, graphics, controls, and more. It really achieves the feeling of an official port or traditional remaster, alternative control schemes included.</p>
<p>The most surprising reveal comes with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom">Doom</a>-themed puzzle that confirms full mod and custom level support. New content will supposedly be easy to make and throw into Banjo: Recompiled for those with the right tools and knowledge, so expect more on that front fast. "We're getting one step closer to a community made Banjo-Threeie," one comment under the trailer says. Looking at <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/quake-brutalist-jam-iii.549/">other ambitious projects</a> born out of preservation efforts, that's entirely possible.</p>
<p>Banjo: Recompiled also works out of the box on Windows, Linux (also SteamOS), and Mac. You can grab it <a href="https://github.com/BanjoRecomp/BanjoRecomp">here</a>, but you'll need a "copy of the North American 1.0 version of the game" that's been previously dumped from a cart you own, as the port loads the assets from the original game release.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c51be720f7b91"><a title="Age of Imprisonment" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c51be720f7b91/age-of-imprisonment.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Koei Tecmo <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir6_20260126e.pdf">has confirmed</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> has now surpassed <strong>1 million copies sold</strong>.</p>
<p>This comes via key financial data (thanks, <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19438-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-sales-numbers-1-million-copies">RPG Site</a>) in which Age of Imprisonment is listed with a note stating 'Over 1 million copies sold worldwide' when translated. Seems pretty clear to us!</p>
<p>The game launched on <strong>6th November 2025</strong> exclusively for the Switch 2 and tells the story of the Imprisoning War referenced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. It still has a little ways to go to surpass <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> on Switch at 4 million copies sold (at least!), but we have to keep in mind the much larger install base of the Switch compared to Switch 2.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2sigohp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Overall, it's a great start for the game, and it thoroughly deserves to see sustained success.</p>
<p>Plans to make Age of Imprisonment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/lets-make-it-nintendo-and-koei-tecmo-on-the-genesis-of-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">came to fruition quickly</a> for Koei Tecmo and Nintendo, with producer Yosuke Hayashi pitching the idea after playing Tears of the Kingdom during the weekend immediately after launch.</p>
<p>We gave the game a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">9/10 in our review</a> and called it the "best entry in this spin-off franchise to date".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> may be the best selling Blizzard game of all time, according to the LinkedIn profile of an Activision Blizzard employee.</p>
<p>Lauren Ashling Hill, Activision Blizzard's communications lead for Northern Europe, states as much in her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-ashling-hill-4a194837/">LinkedIn bio</a>. It describes Diablo 4 as "the best selling Blizzard game of all time". This bio also describes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as "the best selling game in CoD history".</p>
<p>We already knew that Diablo 4 was the fastest selling Blizzard game of all time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-says-diablo-4-is-its-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time">as this fact was announced by Blizzard itself back in 2023</a>. Within a few days after its early access release, the game racked up over 10,000 years of play time according to Blizzard, an eye-watering figure for the series and studio.</p>

<p>Since then, Diablo 4 has undergone plenty of quality-of-life changes and gained multiple expansions, including the most recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Vessel of Hatred major content update</a>. Later this April, its Lord of Hatred expansion is set to launch adding a new class, a new region, and other goodies.</p><p>It should be no surprise that Diablo 4 is selling boat-loads, given the series' history of high player demand. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iii">Diablo 3</a> was certainly no slouch when it came to bringing home the bacon, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5972671/diablo-3-activision-blizzard-pc-sales/">selling at least 20m copies back in 2014</a>.
</p>
<p>Midway through last year, the Diablo 4 team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-diablo-team-forms-union-seeking-protection-in-wake-of-microsoft-layoffs">looked to unionise following widespread layoffs across Microsoft's gaming division</a>, which did impact various staff within Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">thanks to the company being acquired by Microsoft back in late 2023</a>.</p>

		<p>Developer Vedinad has released a new update for Megabonk, with update 1.0.64 bringing hats into the game, so you can style your character even more. There are 21 hats in total, some new achievements, and a new Megachad skin. The new update also addresses a save and progress bug, where players have had progression reset due to errors with Steam Cloud or the game having issues. The fix is a new setting in settings which will use Steam achievements to recover lost progress, though it won’t be perfect.</p>

<h2>Megabonk update 1.0.64 update patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>21 Hats and Achievements<wbr></li>
<li>New Megachad skin</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You can see what items you have banished in the pause menu and when opening a chest / shrine<wbr></li>
<li>Stats now show while holding tab and showing map<wbr></li>
<li>Added a little window in the Unlocks tab in the main menu showing what stats are upgradable and useful for different weapons (suggested by NintenDoingIt on reddit). Also shows all stats unique to each character</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Pots / Vases now give a little luck, which scales with the stage, suggested by nate_codes. I think it’s a fun suggestion, as it incentivizes collecting pots, which increases value of good movement and map routing, as well as Movement speed stat and Pumpkin item. Let me know what you think<wbr></li>
<li>Slightly buffed Robinette’s passive in late game. Damage per 1k gold after 1M gold: 2.5% -&gt; 3.5%<wbr></li>
<li>Feathers now give about 10% more speed forward when jumping, as well as giving +1 jumps<wbr></li>
<li>Bone now has higher default knockback (1.25 -&gt; 1.5) and no longer has Knockback as an upgrade offer, but instead has Crit Chance and Crit Damage<wbr></li>
<li>Shotgun now has higher default knockback (2.5 -&gt; 3) and no longer has Knockback as an upgrade offer, but instead Crit Damage<wbr></li>
<li>Vlad now has 5% Lifesteal (flat) added to character stats<wbr></li>
<li>Robinette now has 5% Gold Gain (flat) added to character stats<wbr></li>
<li>Spaceman now has 5% XP Gain (flat) added to character stats<wbr></li>
<li>You can now obtain a max amount of 25 Za Warudos per run</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed some issues with certain characters heads or hats clipping through Santa Hat<wbr></li>
<li>Items no longer tick / proc in the order they were obtained. They are now ordered by the name of the item (enum name specifically). This is just to make the game more consistent, and make it so that the order you pick up items doesn’t actually matter.<wbr></li>
<li>Proc Order: BloodyCleaver, Bonker, Dragonfire, EagleClaw, GloveBlood, GloveCurse, GloveLightning, GlovePoison, GlovePower, GrandmasSecretTonic, IceCrystal, IceCube, LightningOrb, MoldyCheese, QuinsMask, SluttyCannon, Snek, SpicyMeatball, UnstableTransfusion<wbr></li>
<li>Xp shards now have a little size difference so you can tell the better xp shards apart from the normal ones<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an annoying thing where if you are in-game and moving forwards or backwards as you level up and the level-up screen shows, it no longer moves your cursor selection with that old input you used for movement<wbr></li>
<li>Can spin the character in the Character Selection to see them from different angles. Use Mouse or Controller Shoulder buttons / triggers<wbr></li>
<li>Lowered the volume of Scythe a bit, as it was too loud<wbr></li>
<li>New setting in Effects tab: Enemy Attack Indicator Color – Allows you to change the color of the red spheres that indicate where an enemy attack will hit<wbr></li>
<li>New setting in Effects tab: XP &amp; Gold increase text – Toggle the small text next to your player that shows how much xp and gold you gained</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed some errors caused by Steam Rich Presence, which might’ve stopped achievements from working properly sometimes in-game<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where if you had more than 350 items, it would sometimes fail to upload your score to the leaderboards<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a pretty big bug with Dicehead where if you received multiple levels at once from a big chunk of XP, his passive would only trigger once…. yikes (thanks to Noll Reed for the find)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Chunkers was only affected by its own Projectile Speed stat on the weapon itself, and not by the Player Stat (also Noll Reed)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Joe’s Dagger Execute sometimes did no damage (also found by Noll Reed…)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Roberto’s ghost chests would spawn inside of walls on the Boss Stage<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could get 5 tomes or weapons with auto leveling enabled (found by メープル)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where minibosses would spawn under the map (reported by virgules)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a default game setting that caused some lower fps and a translations error (reported by Justicetom)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where poison could sometimes bring you below 0 hp and kill you (found by Snek)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some projectiles didn’t properly change their opacity<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Spicy Meatball and Bush’s passive Bullseye would keep multiplying its damage with the Elite Damage Multiplier for every Elite Enemy, and also applying this amplified damage to normal enemies, instead of just applying that damage multiplier to the individual elite as it should.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a UI bug in the “Unlocks” window, where the buy button would overlap with the achievement description<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where hats would not be affected by the shield outline<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where money would keep circling you and not be picked up… at least i think its fixed<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could stand on the invisible floor below the final boss arena<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the front swing of Corrupted Sword and Hero Sword only damaged one enemy<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Rollerblades didn’t work properly after teleporting to the next stage</li>
</ul>

		<p>The bobcat is back as Bubsy returns in a brand new platforming game from Atari and studio Fabraz on May 22nd 2026.&nbsp; Bubsy 4D will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, Windows and GOG, and Xbox Play Anywhere, and probably your smart fridge and Nokia 3310 if they have enough time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bubsy 4D - Official Physical Pre-Order and Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EpZg1FJgc4k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This will be the first Bubsy 3D adventure game since 1996 (the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/02/bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back-review/">2017 reboot</a> was a side scrolling platformer) and it finds the wisecracking bobcat on the hunt for the Golden Fleece, which somehow has been stolen from Greek mythology and is now in the hands of the alien BaaBots. I think this is a case of “Just go with it, it’s a video game”.</p>
<p>Busby will be bounding around alien planets themed around fabric and crafts and will be meeting up with some old pals from previous games including Terri, Terry, Virgil and Oblivia.</p>
<p>“Get ready for the comeback you never saw coming,” said Bubsy T. Bobcat. “It’s no secret that I’ve got a questionable track record, but Atari and Fabraz are determined to give me the game I’ve always deserved. This time, my claws are out and I’m ready to show off.”</p>

<p>The digital version will cost you $19.99 but you can <a href="https://atari.com/products/bubsy-4d-deluxe-physical-edition?variant=47396647698597">pre-order a collector’s edition</a> ofBubsy 4D&nbsp;for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. The physical edition, which includes a game cartridge, tuck-in exterior box, user manual, poster and artbook, for $39.99/€39.99/£34.99 on Nintendo Switch and $49.99/€49.99/£44.99&nbsp;on Nintendo Switch 2</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a> have revealed the final signature count for their European Citizens' Initiative, dubbed Stop Destroying Videogames. According to the folks behind the campaign, the European Union have been able to verify that 1,294,188 of the petition's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-half-the-148-million-stop-destroying-videogames-signatures-have-been-okayed-as-campaigners-seek-expert-backing">nearly 1.5 million signatures</a> are the real deal, putting it above the one million signature goal required for EU politicians to look into the issue of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">server shutdowns rendering online-only games impossible to play</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Things are moving quite fast right now, and we’ve decided to share the final count with you ahead of schedule," volunteer Moritz Katzner wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1qluxts/stop_killing_games_final_count_of_verified/">a Reddit post</a> which includes a breakdown of the verified signatures by country.  "Originally, this wasn’t possible due to certain background limitations, and our plan was to wait until shortly before our next meeting with the EU Commission.</p>
<p>"At that point, we intended to reveal everything through a video, alongside a redesigned website, a restructured Discord, and several other updates that - ironically - I still can’t talk about just yet. We didn’t want to present our case unprepared, unintentionally leak information to lobby groups, or worst of all burn out our team."</p>
<p>According to the breakdown, the largest signature total a single country contributed to the petition was 233,180 from Germany, followed by France with just over 145,000, and Poland with around 144,000. Katzner expanded a bit further on the relatively low number of signatures - at least in the context of the overall total - which have turned out not to be valid.</p><p>"I’d say we’re definitely in the top three when it comes to low rates of failed signatures," he wrote in a comment on the post. "We’re sitting at around 10%, while the best-performing initiatives tend to fall in the 10–15% range, which puts us firmly in the upper bracket. Some initiatives see failure rates as high as 20–25% and still manage to get over the line, but it’s worth noting that the overall sample size is quite small, only 11 initiatives."</p>
<p>While a wait for the campaign's organisers to begin meeting with EU lawmakers and properly discussing the issue looks to be on the cards for now, the group have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1qlknp0/stop_killing_games_announcement_on_anthem/">seperately announced plans</a> to "take some proactive steps" with regards to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-private-server-experimentations-underway-as-the-shooters-subreddit-mods-rethink-retirement-plans">recent shutdown</a> of Bioware's online-only exoshooter Anthem. Those steps have taken the form of providing intructions as to how Anthem owners in France and Germany can report the shutdown to relevant consumer rights organisations. The hope is that getting in touch with the <a href="https://www.quechoisir.org/">Federal Union of Consumers - Que Choisir</a> and <a href="https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/">Verbraucherzentrale</a> might help those who bought the game secure refunds, with establishing "more generalised international reporting mechanisms for any games killed in the future" being one of Stop Killing Games' goals going forwards.</p>
<p>The Stop Killing Games campaign was the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">a debate in UK parliament</a> late last year. Recently, a small group of UK Green Party members <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uk-green-party-mps-would-be-compelled-to-support-stop-killing-games-if-a-proposed-policy-amendment-passes">revealed plans to propose an amendment to policy</a> which would "compel" their MPs to support Stop Killing Games, were it to pass a vote at the party's next conference.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement for the devs has revealed that Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition has been delayed indefinitely, with no new release date announced. </p>



<p>Back in September 2025, Koei Temco surprised fans with an announcement trailer revealing the return of a beloved 2001 title: Dynasty Warriors 3. The Remastered edition is recreated in Unreal Engine 5, with striking new visuals and other significant upgrades. However, it seems that the developers will need more time to bring it to the level the fans deserve. </p>







<h2 id="h-dynasty-warriors-3-complete-edition-delayed-with-no-new-release-date">Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Delayed With No New Release Date</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://x.com/KoeiTecmoUS/status/2015726489149276652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) from the official Koei Tecmo America account announces the delay of Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition. It was earlier scheduled to arrive on March 19, 2026, and now a new release date will be announced at a later date. The producer of the upcoming title has revealed that, as this is the first remaster of the series, they would like more time to “fully satisfy” the fans and “improve the quality of the game”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered includes the original game and the Xtreme Legends expansion. The upcoming title will feature a cast of more than 40 officers, with iconic 1 vs 1,000 action sequences all redone for modern systems. Additionally, the Xtreme Legends comes with new stories, bodyguard customization, new weapons, and four types of challenge modes. Check out the announcement trailer below: </p>

That's also just over $4 for each booster ($4.17, to be precise), which is more than a couple of bucks off what you’d usually pay when buying them individually. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In comparison, the market price for these is still sitting around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8lWq?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$139, according to data at the trusted resale marketplace TCGplayer</a>. While this will likely continue to drop (fallen 45.71% in the past three months), you're certainly ahead of the trend if you pick up the preorder at Amazon right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, just a heads up, as it's important for those looking to buy: Amazon doesn't charge until dispatch (so your card won't be charged until closer to release on March 6. Plus, the retailer also has a preorder price guarantee, so if it drops even further or somehow goes<em> back up </em>in price, you can be absolutely certain that you're paying the lowest price possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magics-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-is-months-away-but-play-boosters-are-discounted-already"><u>This is also even better than the deal we saw just before Christmas</u></a>, and now even lower than the next best price at Amazon from earlier this month ($148.20). Although it does make you think, is the discount indicative of Wizards of the Coast’s expectations for the set? Let's hope not!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, the price dropped to $159.99, bringing the Universes Beyond box of Play Boosters to around the standard price of a Universes Within box, but dropping even further to just $125, this seems like a mighty good deal for what is already looking like a very popular set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We saw similar drops for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJe7m?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spider-Man</a>, which would be a little worrisome if <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm8mKK?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Avatar</a> hadn’t got the same treatment - and that set was great.

            <p><strong>UPDATE 26/1/2026:</strong> Embark Studios <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2015107332271706495?s=20">has announced</a> the Headwinds update drops tomorrow, 27th January.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' narrative ambitions have been limited so far, with Embark Studios' extraction shooter first looking to ease players into its post-apocalyptic world. After the winter-themed Cold Snap event, however, it appears the developers are putting the pedal to the metal with an "impending escalation" that will happen over the next four months.</p>
<p>The studio locked and <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">shared</a> an early 2026 roadmap on 23rd January. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-robot-bosses-set-to-become-even-scarier-pve-escalate-embark">talking earlier this month</a> about how the team could "escalate the experience" in surprising ways, it seems that's happening as soon as February. In fact, the four-month roadmap that begins later this month (an update should drop this week) and ends in April is aptly titled Escalation. Things are about to get more dangerous topside.</p>
<figure>

<p>"The increased ARC presence continues to trouble Shani as the Rustbelt grows more overwhelmed, but no one holds all the pieces," the last post teases. Answers won't be coming this month, as the next content update, dubbed Headwinds, focuses on adding a new matchmaking option for high-level players looking for extra excitement, a new map condition, and a new player project to work on.</p><p>Things will start getting spicier in February with Shrouded Sky. Map conditions and player projects will be recurring additions, but next month, a new Arc threat, expedition, and raider deck (battle pass) are arriving. No details yet on what's going to happen on the live narrative front, but things will continue to ramp up in March's Flashpoint update with yet another map condition and an all-new Arc menace.</p>
<p>The grand finale of this first multi-part chapter in Arc Raiders' post-launch is set to arrive in April (unless delays happen) through Riven Tides. An entire new map will open up, and a previously unseen type of huge Arc will join the war. Hopefully, diehards looking for tough endgame content will have a harder time trying to take the new giants down.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">Arc Raiders crossing the 12m copies sold mark</a> earlier this month, expectations around the premium extraction shooter are sky-high. So far, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">player numbers</a> are holding up and steady, and we're of the opinion its success could even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">help Bungie's Marathon</a> come March, as more players are now eager to jump into the still-infant shooter subgenre.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As you are all aware, the internet is powered by cats, and they are rather useful in the new horror game The 18th Attic, which is out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3403660/The_18th_Attic__Paranormal_Anomaly_Hunting_Game/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_18th_attic_paranormal_anomaly_hunting_game">GOG</a>, and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-18th-attic-e2c83f">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The 18th Attic - Now Released On Steam - Out Now Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2SVKOeb_Jk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the title suggests, you will be exploring a haunted attic armed only with a camera that can uncover the real truth behind the mysterious hauntings. Each picture will reveal unseen ghosts as well as clues and secrets that will tell the story of the attic.</p>
<p>As you can see from the trailer, you will be spooked by all sorts of ghostly goings-on, including an antlered mannequin that has stepped out of the brilliant Hannibal television series.</p>
<p>The USP is that to restore your mental stability, you must pet your cuddly kittie companion. Anyone with a cat will know this is also a very useful tip in real life. You can even customise your cat, in the game that is, if I could do that in real life, I would find the “Stop meowing loudly for breakfast at 6am” option and quickly turn it off.</p>

            <p>Old School <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>, the ancient MMO <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/with-a-new-record-240-000-players-online-old-school-runescape-is-roughly-8x-bigger-than-its-sister-mmo-and-would-be-the-fourth-biggest-game-on-all-of-steam-if-not-for-a-technicality/">that's still proving to be incredibly popular all these years later</a>, is getting its fourth raid later this year: The Fractured Archive.</p>
<p>Revealed during the Winter Summit event over the weekend, The Fractured Archive is described as the game's "toughest one yet", and will allow between 2-8 players to take on a new collection of bosses deep underground. It will also be soloable, but doing so will prove quite daunting.</p>
<p>Set to release in late 2026, The Fractured Archive will require the completion of the Tears of Guthix quest. Initially, if your entire party dies against a boss the raid will reset, which should add an additional layer of difficulty to the shindig. Eventually, this will shift to a different system, where wipes incur penalties to the loot you get at the raid's conclusion.</p>

<p>That's not all announced during the summit. The game is getting a new limited-time League called Demonic Pacts. In this, players will be able to modify their usual journey over eight weeks. Through completing certain tasks, powerful pacts can be unlocked that flip the typical rules of the game on their head, and help you to collect unique rewards.</p><p>Finally, there's a new bovine-based boss that could be added to the game incredibly soon depending on whether the community approves it in upcoming polls. Aiming to be a new early game challenge, a Bull fight has been created in a Game Jam session and would bring with it a new quest, a bottomless milk bucket, cow slippers, and a cow pet if given the go-ahead by Old School RuneScape players.</p>
<p>Indeed it seems like there's a lot going on in this British MMO, which maintains a strong community all these years later. If you're curious as to why, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/old-school-runescape-interview-why-people-still-playing-25-years-later">you can read Eurogamer's interview with its developers here</a>.</p>

			<p>Following the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> show, <strong>Xbox Game Studios</strong> head Craig <strong>Duncan</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-studios-changes-leadership-rares-craig-duncan-steps-into-the-role/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formerly head of <strong>Rare</strong></a>) was <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/were-going-to-try-and-be-more-consistent-with-what-we-do-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-on-the-developer-direct-reveals-multiplatform-strategy-and-hard-lessons-learned-from-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Gamesradar</a>, with a particular focus on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fable</strong> reboot</a>, arguably the showcase's centerpiece. The executive called Fable 'mindblowing', sharing his excitement particularly for the <strong>Living Population</strong> feature, which will allow players to interact with the NPCs in many different ways.</p>



<p><em>When I think about Playground and their history with the Forza Horizon franchise, and their desire to take on Fable as a franchise, I think it's really about this relentless pursuit of excellence. We all know what that means in Forza Horizon, we've all seen that franchise get bigger and bigger every year, but what does that mean for Fable? I have played a bunch of the game, I've messed around with the combat and the Living Population, and it's just mind blowing. I'm so excited that we talked about it in the Developer Direct, because it's something that people wouldn't expect.</em></p>



<p><em>There were some really special ideas in the original Fable trilogy, but what I think Playground has done is take some of these ideas and modernized them – my brain pops every time I think about the Living Population, how it works, and what it adds to the overall game; it's an incredible invention, and Fable is going to be an incredible RPG. It will be amazing to see what players do with it, and it'll be massively shareable.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Duncan acknowledged some inconsistencies in Xbox Game Studios' multiplatform releases. For example, at the Xbox Developer Direct, Fable and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/double-fine-productions-kiln-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double Fine's Kiln</a></strong> were announced to launch day-and-date on PlayStation 5 (as well as PC and Xbox), whereas <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a></strong> will launch on PC and Xbox first. Duncan said the goal is to be more consistent in the future, but he also clarified that it may not always be the same, depending on the game and the resources behind it.</p>



<p><em>There's always development realities about when these projects start – how big a team is, and what plans we have at the start of development. When a strategy changes, maybe you've got a plan that exists with a game and maybe you can adopt that, maybe you can't. So that's why. And to be clear, this is totally fair feedback. Sometimes we are inconsistent. You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places. Just know that we're going to work on that, and we're going to try and be more consistent with what we do.</em></p>



<p><em>But you know, for our game makers, if you're on the Fable team you just want as many people who love Fable to appreciate the great work that the team's doing. That's always our goal. It's rarely more complicated than that. It's like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?</em></p>



<p>In other Fable news, Playground's Game Director Ralph Fulton <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-lead-confirms-mockumentary-style-is-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the action RPG <strong>will actually feature the mockumentary style</strong> we've seen in previous trailers in the game itself, inspired by the hit show '<strong>The Office</strong>'. We won't have to wait too long to see whether it's a good fit, as the game <strong>now has a Fall 2026 release window</strong>, with more details expected to be shared in the next months.</p>

<p>Bandai dips its hands into various action games and Soulslikes. So it’s good to see the studio hasn’t overlooked how popular and successful the first Code Vein was, which is why so many of you are looking for the Code Vein 2 release date and times—which is covered here.</p>



<p>The original Code Vein is one of the wackier <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-non-fromsoftware-soulslike-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslikes</a> in recent memory. It didn’t hit all the high notes with critics, but fans saw through the game’s flaws enough to help the game ship a few million copies, making a sequel a no-brainer. You asked for it, you got it, and here’s everything you need to know about the Code Vein 2 launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-code-vein-2-release-date">Code Vein 2 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even wackier and weirder, please. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Bandai’s Code Vein 2 has a January 29 release date, making it the first big Soulslike</strong> <strong>launch of the year.</strong></p>



<p>If you want to lay down a marker for the rest of the year, this is how you do it. Code Vein 2 has crept in front of Nioh 3 and is taking the first step for Soulslikes in 2026.</p>



<p>The difficulty of this (not the game’s inevitable difficulty) is that it needs to be memorable enough to be talked about come the end of the year. If Code Vein 2 is anything like the first game, this shouldn’t be an issue.</p>



<p>With a more open world to explore and a motorcycle to help you do so, expect a wider and wilder experience this time around.</p>







<h2 id="h-code-vein-2-release-times-explained">Code Vein 2 Release Times, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Code Vein 2 should be launching for all players on January 29 at 3 PM PT, with other regions releasing slightly at different times.</strong></p>



<p>Start your Code Vein 2 preparations now with the table below, showing key regions and time zones around the world for the game’s launch.</p>



<p>Let IG know if you want more time zones added.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven DLC Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/26/cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Cult of the Lamb was easily one of my favourite games of 2022, being a truly unique take on the cult simulator and roguelike battler.&nbsp;It’s a game that has stayed with me over the years, but while it has had a few DLCs over the years, there hasn’t been anything big enough to pull me back into the game. Time moved on and I had other things to play. That is, until we got Woolhaven.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cult of the Lamb | Woolhaven Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7FoRUNf8xns?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven is a spectacular expansion. In a way, it follows in the spiritual footsteps of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/04/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review/">Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</a> in that it’s released a few years after after the base game and it’s almost the same size…</p>


<p>A DLC of this magnitude is certainly enough for us to dip our cloven hooves back in the water and see what’s going on. However, I immediately regretted not playing Cult of the Lamb game in three years, because I had no idea what state my cult was in. There were new systems and previous updates I had also completely missed, and I had a bit of catching up to do.</p>
<p>Tempting as it might have been to just start from scratch, you can only start Woolhaven after completing the base game. If you have time to start New Game+ (i.e. you aren’t working through a stack of other games to review), it might be better to start fresh and enjoy it all over again. Fortunately, the game is still relatively easy to pick back up, so I forged ahead on.</p>


<p>To reach Woolhaven, you need to have defeated the base game end boss, at which point a new totem appears in your base camp. Donate a few items to it and a new path opens up, taking our intrepid hero to the ruined mountain village, the ancestral home of your species.</p>
<p>As the last living lamb, you have caught the attention of the almost dead Yngya, Goddess of Winter and the forgotten deity of lambs. She was also slain by the Bishops and left to rot, so you have that in common. After resurrecting what little is left of her,&nbsp;she tasks you with not only making your collective killers pay, but returning the lost souls of your brethren to her.</p>
<p>In doing so, you not only restore her powers but raise the ghosts of her disciples. As they repopulate Woolhaven, you unlock a bevy of new features, like a ranch for livestock and a variation of Rock Paper Scissors. Some of these are cool, others a little woolly. You also get to pretty much double the size of your camp, which is nice.</p>

<p>What’s less nice is that as the Goddess of Winter grows, so does your to-do list. It starts out fairly manageable, with the weather turning a little cold, and people being a little chilly, but happily frolicking in the snow. However, once winter sets in, you quickly realise you have a life-threatening problem to contend with. The ground is frozen, you can’t grow crops and your followers will literally freeze to death.</p>
<p>You have to build a new furnace, unlock a ritual to lock in warmth and even build an onsen to thaw the cultists close to frozen death. Winter will quickly wreck you if you’re low on resources. If you thought you were in for an easy time, you’re sorely mistaken. This DLC is tough to bleat.</p>
<p>But that’s just the cult management side of things — there’s also the bit where the lamb brings the slaughter. The DLC adds two new procedurally generated dungeons. The first, Ewehaven, is where Yngya reigned before death. It’s all snowy cliffs with frozen fish in giant icicles poking out of the ground. After Yngya was slain, the evil Marchosias and his wolves moved in — your mission is to clear them out.</p>

<p>The second map is The Rot, which is exactly what you’d expect and forms the caves inside the mountain. There’s fewer wolves in here, and more demonic enemies alongside some returning characters.</p>
<p>As you might expect, both biomes bring new enemies, weapons, tarot cards and so on. There’s even a new Rotten follower type, which comes with its own pros and cons. Namely, they have no soul, so they don’t need to sleep. However, they always die in 10 days, no matter what happens. They’re a surprisingly useful addition to the team, even if they die annoyingly fast.</p>

<p>In all, there’s not much to complain about here, other than the occasional slowdown — I had a few rooms where it took 20 seconds of running around to force the enemies to spawn. Beyond that, the instructions aren’t always clear in terms of what you need to do, more so if you’ve been away for a long period of time.</p>
