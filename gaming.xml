Available now on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, this playable slice lets players experience the game’s first chapter and a big boss fight.</p>

<p>The demo begins in the middle of Chapter 1 at Rime Falls and takes players through areas such as Fallow Steppe and Rhata Harbor. The chapter’s final boss, the Kraken, awaits the playable party of Val, Careena, and Morley.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHIJtLufSsM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Unfortunately, save data will not transfer from the demo to the full game. Square Enix states this is because the final version of this section has been altered “for a more satisfying experience.” Instead, those with save data from the demo who purchase the full game will receive three weapons for Val upon reaching Chapter 1: Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Visions of Mana marks the first original Mana entry in 15 years. Set in a vibrant, semi-open, fully 3D world, the adventure stars Val, who travels to the Mana Tree alongside his lifelong friend Hinna. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/12/visions-of-mana-gets-august-release-date-in-new-trailer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visions of Mana launches on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.</p>

            <p>I am a big Hobbit and Lord of the Rings fan. That whole world that Tolkein created fills me with an immense amount of wonder and awe. While I don't fancy coming face to face with an orc anytime soon, I would relish the opportunity to explore Middle-earth with my backpack full of lembas bread and a pint from the Prancing Pony in hand.</p>
<p>That is why when I was scrolling through X the other day, I stopped and did a brief double take. In a welcome change to some of the rubbish on social media these days, my algorithm had presented me with a beautiful, photorealistic re-imagining of Lord Of The Rings' The Argonath scene, made in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>For a tranquil minute and a half, I was transported from my desk to a small boat on the River Anduin, as the two monumental statues made famous in Fellowship of the Ring watched over me. After playing the video again, I quickly got in touch with the footage's creator Micah Malinics to find out more about his project, and - importantly - if I would ever get the chance to play through this fan-made recreation myself.</p>

<p>"The idea for the scene actually came from a prompt I had given myself, which was 'What games should exist, but don't?' and after jotting down a bunch of ideas, a bunch of Lord of the Rings ones really gravitated toward me," Malinics tells me via email.</p>
<p>"So I actually wanted to create a LOTR 'proof of concept' tiny adventure game like this silly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aBGnmQ8Gntc">Shrek Western </a>I had made, but after a friend shared Leo Torres' beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0DKoV4SbLY">river jungle</a> scene, I immediately wanted to do the Argonath scene from Fellowship of the Ring as a first person experience."</p>
<p>On the technical side of things, this scene was made in Unreal Engine 5.4, using Lumen and Nanite heavily. "The scene still ran at a steady 30-50 fps on an RTX 3080Ti. And you could lower the graphics yet to perform on other machines," Malinics adds.</p>
<p>"The fluid system is completely dynamic, so it automatically interacts with the geometry in the scene. To me that is the most impressive part, and it's all a result of the masterful Fluid Flux plugin."</p>
<p>You can check out Malinics' scene, which was made in "six days from start to finish", via the video below.</p>

<p>Malinics now wants to work on some of the other ideas he jotted down during this brainstorming session. This includes a Helm's Deep scene with a dynamic weather system which changes from the iconic moment's pre-battle sunset to the storming night time. And of course that marching Orc army would also be there. </p>
<p>"I also have been playing around with movement mechanics a lot, and it would be fun to create a little moment when you are the hobbits running away from the Ringwraith on your way to the Prancing Pony," he continues. "There's so much you could do there that it could almost be it's own game in the vein of 'escape the monster' type genre. I hope to make both at some point - as it's such a blast utilising this technology to re-imagine Tolkien's world, and of course the Peter Jackson films are the ultimate visual inspiration."</p>
<p>However, while Malinics has all of these new ideas waiting to be realised, he tells me "if there was enough demand for the Argonath scene" it could be released as a playable project.</p>
<p>"[Unreal Engine] would handle it like a champ, but the challenges to releasing it be a good amount of project cleanup, some optimisation, and there are some areas that aren't fully built out for a 360 degree viewing experience, so I would need to go back in and finish building out those parts of the environment," he says.</p>
<p>"The project sits at a whopping 100GB right now, so it's also not yet 'release' friendly haha."</p>

<p>Malinics originally wanted to expand this scene so the boat could dock on a beach after it passes the Argonath, and the player would then be able to walk around the beach area. "I also was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v75dSep_kbE">this creator</a> to add Orcs in the woods that you can ride the boat past," he says. However, at this time, this would have been "more of an easter egg" than a playable experience. </p>
<p>"If I had more time I would have added those, but I started to get eager to finish this scene up."</p>
<p>So in short, "it just comes down to prioritising time," Malinics says regarding that playable demo, before adding: "If there's a big rally for it and demand, I'm happy to put in the time. Otherwise, I have some other cool stuff I'm really excited to make that I think people will enjoy, too!"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dr Disrespect Was Just ‘An Influencer’ For Midnight Society, Studio Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-influencer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespect-was-just-%E2%80%98an-influencer%E2%80%99-for-midnight-society-studio-claims.940368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-influencer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Dr Disrespect is still missing from the internet after disappearing on vacation with his family following the controversy that surfaced little more than a month ago. In a shocking revelation, it came to light that Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm had been banned on Twitch in 2020 because of an incident in 2017 during which Dr Disrespect knowingly and inappropriately messaged a minor on the platform.</p>



<p>He subsequently lost his spot with Midnight Society shortly after this news dropped, per a new report by Bloomberg. In this interview, Midnight Society’s Robert Bowling set the story straight about Dr Disrespect’s claimed involvement with the ‘Deadrop’ extraction shooter project.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-an-influencer">Just an Influencer</h2>



<p>Robert Bowling spoke to Bloomberg, attempting to soothe troubled waters by stressing that Dr Disrespect was only involved in the Deadrop project as an influencer. From the moment Deadrop went public, Dr Disrespect appeared to be the face of the project, heavily involved in marketing the game and keeping his followers updated regarding the ongoing development of this ambitious extraction shooter.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-30/how-dr-disrespect-almost-derailed-new-studio-s-first-video-game?embedded-c">In the interview</a>, Bowling explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>His job as an influencer was to bring eyeballs and community to it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was explained that he was brought into the fold to ‘exploit his 4.5 million YouTube subscribers’. </p>



<p>Bowling went on to explain that when the allegations about Dr Disrespect dropped online, they held an emergency call, during which Beahm joined and straight up admitted to messaging a minor on Twitch in 2017. On that topic, Bowling said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We knew it was the right decision after talking everything over with all four of us. We made agreements on what our principles were and are as a studio, and his actions don’t align with our principles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not known if or when Dr Disrespect will resurface. If he does, some theories suggest he’ll rebrand or relocate to another platform, like Kick. The big question is, will he have anything tangible to come back to?</p>

			<p>A new Elden Ring patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing some welcome improvements to summoned spirits and plenty of other balance changes.</p>
<p>Patch 1.13 focuses on balance changes, introducing some PvP-exclusive changes alongside some general ones which improve the Repeating Crossbow, Spread Crossbow, Rabbath's Cannon, Shield of Night, Golem Fist armaments, among others, the Savage Lion's Claw, Swift Slash, Overhead Stance skills, among others, select spells and incantations. The biggest changes, however, were made to several summoned spirits, which now hit harder and have better damage negation when the Revered Spirit Ash Blessing is at 5 or more and when upgraded to +8 or higher. The Mimic Tear, however, hasn't been changed, which isn't surprising considering how effective it continues to be even after getting nerfed since the game's launch.</p>
<p>Rounding up the Elden Ring 1.13 patch are multiple bug fixes. You can learn everything there is to know about the new update by going<a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-113"> here.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring and its expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the expansion by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/creator-of-garrys-mod-receives-dmca-on-behalf-of-skibidi-toilet-creator/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Garry Newman, the creator of Garry's Mod, has received a DMCA on behalf of the SKibidi Toilet creator. The DMCA is a notice for utilizing Skibidi Toilet assets in Garry's Mod, which he is claiming to be his assets. However, most of the assets from Skibidi Toilet come from Half-Life 2, meaning that the creator of Skibidi Toilet doesn't really have a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>Despite the DMCA being sent on behalf of the creator, they did not approve of the DMCA or ask them to send it in the first place. "Significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere. There is absolutely no licensed Steam, Valve, Garry's Mod content related to Skibidi Toilet." In addition to this statement, they go on to provide their Copyright Registration Number, which shows everything within the meme content that has a copyright.</p>
<p>This includes characters such as "Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, Titan TV Man, and Skibidi Toilet" who all have their own copyrights, giving them the rights to characters developed with Half-Life 2 assets that are owned by Valve.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what will happen with this DMCA attempt going forward, as Skibidi Toilet blatantly uses Half-Life 2 assets belonging to <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadlock-footage-leak-characters-world-details/">Valve</a>. The creator of the meme content released a small statement on their Discord server. <a href="https://x.com/Thafnine/status/1818112776403132615/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They go on to say</a>, "Sup y'all. Is there a way to contact Garry? I did NOT strike Garry's Mod, and I'm trying to understand what else is written in the letter!"</p>
<p>The company Invisible Narratives, owned by Adam Goodman and Michael Bay, created this DMCA on behalf of the creator. In recent news, this company has secured the rights to create a Skibidi Toilet movie. It remains to be seen whether this strike came as a joke or whether they were illogical when writing the letter to be sent to Garry Newman.</p>
<p>Whether or not Valve will get involved in this process or whether Garry Newman will make a statement on the DMCA is unknown for now. Still, it's unlikely that Invisible Narratives will have a leg to stand on, considering that the assets they use for the meme content already belong to Valve, regardless of whether they have copyright over the characters or not.</p>

<p>EA Sports has pushed a new patch for College Football 25.

According to multiple sources, another update on the first major patch is expected to come over the next couple of weeks or so. The goal, they said, is to make sure nothing gets pushed that might cause other issues to arise to they are taking extra time to get things done.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Cocker spent almost two decades at <a href="https://www.ismltd.com/about" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ISM Fantasy Games</a>, a company that counts itself as one of the "creators of the worldwide Mario &amp; Sonic Olympic Games series." ISM also touts that the now-discontinued franchise "sold over 30 million copies."</p><p dir="ltr">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games began in 2007 on Wii, with the title celebrating the 2008 Beijing Games. It's also notable for teaming up the two iconic mascots, especially after the console wars between Nintendo and Sega in the 1990s.</p><p dir="ltr">Eurogamer points out that instead of Mario &amp; Sonic, the IOC has <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Olympic Go! Paris 2024</a> as the main video game release for this year's Olympics. It's a free-to-play title available on mobile and PC. And yes, there are NFT digital pins to collect separately, as well. Meanwhile, next year, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-olympic-esports-games-will-be-held-in-saudi-arabia/1100-6524936/" data-ref-id="1100-6524936">IOC is bringing the 2025 Olympic Esports to Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and this one is all about fire, so if you're a fan of flamethrowers and incendiary weapons, you're in luck.</p>
<p>In some ways, the Freedom's Flame Warbond, which lands on August 8th, is the polar opposite (hem, hem) of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond">Polar Patriots Warbond</a>, although this one's packing significantly more weaponry themed around its title.</p>
<p>First up, you're getting two new primary weapons. The SG-451 Cookout, which is likely named after Ray Bradbury's iconic&nbsp;<em>Fahrenheit 451&nbsp;</em>(or perhaps the temperature to which the title refers), is a "pump action shotgun that unleashes a burst of incendiary phosphorus pellets". Sounds like fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond-flamethrower.jpg?itok=RVqijWHu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond-flamethrower.jpg?itok=xPw5BJGX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond is perfect for fans of fire.</figcaption></figure><p>The second new primary weapon is a literal flamethrower. The FLAM-66 Torcher works in a similar way to&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s existing flamethrowers, so make sure that you're not near your squadmates when you start blasting (or, alternatively, make sure you are if you're looking to lose some friends).</p>
<p>Lest you think that's the only flamethrower you're getting, think again. The Freedom's Flame Warbond also brings the P-72 Crisper secondary weapon, described as a "flamethrower that fits in your pocket". It's essentially a pistol that shoots fire. Finally, my childhood dreams have come true!</p>
<p>A new Booster gives you the chance to set fire to the battlefield when you land, which is ideal for clearing out hordes of enemies (but perhaps not ideal if you're planning to land next to your squadmates). You'll also find new armor sets that grant resistance to fire, though, so perhaps you could recommend your squadmates wear that armor.</p>

<p>There's plenty more coming in the Freedom's Flame Warbond too, so make sure to read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4339865428697564653" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full list of additions</a> if you're planning to drop some Super Credits on this one next week.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Freedom's Flame Warbond lands on August 8th. The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/553850/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy">read our review of it right here</a>.</p>

He said on X, “For the people that are asking, there will be no [<em>Mario &amp; Sonic</em>] for @Paris2024,” adding that the franchise apparently finished with 2020's Tokyo edition. “I know,” Cocker adds, “because I worked on all the games in the franchise.”</p><p>Then more recently, <em>Eurogamer</em> is reporting that the IOC “walked away from its partnership with Nintendo and Sega,” in order to, the site claims, “explore deals with new partners, NFTs and esports.”</p><p>And they aren’t kidding about the NFTs.

The series often nonsensically released the year <em>before</em> the games took place, sometimes <em>eight months</em> before the games started, which always seemed like the weirdest marketing decision imaginable. A total of six games came out over the last 17 years, but it seems that there shall be no more.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paris-2024-olympics-video-games-assassins-creed-mario-1851608095&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paris-2024-olympics-video-games-assassins-creed-mario-1851608095">Play These 10 Video Games To Feed Your Summer Olympics Obsession</a></span></p><p>Perhaps the most obvious reason why was that absolutely no one noticed when one didn’t come out last year, with even <em>Kotaku</em> only realizing how odd it was that a 2024 edition hadn’t been released come the start of the French games.

<p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Eurogamer</a>, fans are missing a Mario &amp; Sonic tie-in game for the 2024 Olympics after the International Olympics Committee ended its partnership with Nintendo and Sega.</p>



<p>Eurogamer reported that series veteran Lee Cocker directly reached out to them. Cocker claims that the IOC “wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports.” </p>



<p>They added that the IOC aimed to bring it “back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money.” The new report says the IOC simply allowed the licensing deal with Nintendo and Sega to “lapse in 2020.”</p>

<p>Mario &amp; Sonic are a staple of the Olympic Games, as the series released tie-in titles for well over a decade. </p>



<p>The most recent game celebrated the Tokyo 2020 games, which included both new and classic sports. It did launch to mixed reviews, and still has a 6.9 user score on Metacritic. However, it was a kind of tradition, and many fans are disappointed by 2024’s departure.</p>



<p>Last week, the IOC <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-officially-becomes-a-part-of-the-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced</a> that eSports has become part of the Olympics, though it will exclude first-person shooters.</p>



<p>Super Mario fans can still look forward to Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-luigi-brothership-announced-for-november-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming in November 2024</a>, and Super Mario Party Jamboree in October. </p>



<p>Most recently, Sonic fans learned that Sonic the Hedgehog veteran Takashi Iizuka showed interest in developing an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rpg-sega-takashi-iizuka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG for the franchise</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skibidi-toilet-movie-dmca-garrys-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Michael Bay's company Invisible Narratives has issued a DMCA claim against physics sandbox&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod</em>, alleging the appropriation of assets from YouTube series&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>.</p>
<p>The claim relates to certain&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em>characters, including three Titan character models and one of the titular Skibidi Toilets (which are essentially human heads that protrude from toilet bowls).</p>
<p><em>Garry's Mod&nbsp;</em>creator Garry Newman posted the DMCA claim he received in the Discord server for his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/garrys-mod-successor-sbox-enters-open-beta-next-week">upcoming game-slash-platform&nbsp;<em>S&amp;box</em></a>, and the claim, along with a message sent to Newman by Invisible Narratives, was subsequently spotted by YouTuber T9 and <a href="https://x.com/Thafnine/status/1818055148817760348" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skibidi-toilet-dmca-garrys-mod-camera.jpg?itok=f-CDId9h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skibidi-toilet-dmca-garrys-mod-camera.jpg?itok=yU_HKDeX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Things are getting ugly in&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>&nbsp;land.</figcaption></figure><p>At first, T9 suggested that it was&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em>creator DaFuq!?Boom! who issued the DMCA takedown, but the YouTuber quickly reneged on that allegation, citing <a href="https://x.com/Thafnine/status/1818112776403132615" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message from DaFuq!?Boom! himself</a>&nbsp;in which the creator disavows any involvement with the DMCA.</p>
<p>We've also independently verified that Newman's message, as well as the message sent by DaFuq!?Boom!, are legitimate, so unless the DMCA claim is an elaborate fake, it looks like this is a genuine claim being made by Invisible Narratives.</p>
<p>The claim itself alleges that&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>'s assets are "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand", and that revenue is being generated by "unauthorized&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em><em>Garry's Mod&nbsp;</em>games" despite the fact that there is "absolutely no licensed Steam, Valve, [or]&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod&nbsp;</em>content related to&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>".</p>
<p>If you're across&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>,&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod</em>, or both, you'll likely know just how wrong-headed this claim is. Plenty of&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>'s assets, including some of the assets at the center of this DMCA claim, are taken from Valve games like&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>, so Invisible Narratives arguably don't really have any right to claim said assets as their own.</p>
<p>The claim presumably derives from the fact that Invisible Narratives <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-adam-goodman-1236077245/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">secured the rights</a> to a&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em>movie recently, which is likely the reason behind the company's lawyers apparently looking for opportunities to hunt down&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em>"imitators", as it were.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skibidi-toilet-dmca-garrys-mod-assets.jpg?itok=M3BTeqT9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skibidi-toilet-dmca-garrys-mod-assets.jpg?itok=iIVbroWd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skibidi Toilet</em>'s assets aren't really DMCA-able, but here we are.</figcaption></figure><p>As T9 points out, it's entirely possible that the DMCA claim is nothing but corporate trolling. It could also just be an attempt to stake a claim by lawyers who aren't familiar with either&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod</em>, but it's not a great look either way.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Invisible Narratives, as well as Newman's company Facepunch and DaFuq!?Boom!, for comment, and will update this story as soon as we hear anything back.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/spin-rhythm-xd-vr-review-virtual-reality-of-rhythm</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spin-rhythm-xd-vr-review-%E2%80%93-a-virtual-reality-of-rhythm.940269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/spin-rhythm-xd-vr-review-virtual-reality-of-rhythm<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em> hit 1.0 last year, I’ve been a fan of its unique approach to the rhythm game genre. I loved it so much, I put it on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/techraptor-robert-scarpinito-top-games-2023">my personal top 10 games of 2023</a>, the year I also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ragnarock-review-psvr2">played&nbsp;<em>Ragnarock</em>&nbsp;on the PlayStation VR 2</a>.</p>
<p>Back then, I thought the Steam Deck was the perfect instrument to experience <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em>. The track pads feel like an intuitive, one-to-one interaction with the gameplay. It just works, and spinning the wheel feels so satisfying.</p>
<p>Well, on July 9, Super Spin Digital proved me wrong when it released the VR update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spin-rhythm-xd"><em>Spin Rhythm XD</em></a>.</p>

<h2>Step Into the Rhythm Dimension</h2>
<p>In <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em>, you spin a two-colored wheel to match the notes that come down the note highway. In VR, you simply tap on the wheel to hit notes, and once you’re highlighting it, you’re able to spin it. Tapping outside the wheel hits the beats, denoted by the green lines.</p>
<p>These motions give it a unique mix of feeling like drumming and DJing, which feels very ODESZA. It took me a bit of time to get used to, but once I felt comfortable with the controls, it was much easier to slip into a flow state.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain, but at a certain point, my level of understanding the VR controls and my ability to read the music matched up, and I was able to “feel” the music. Hitting the notes and beats, sliding the wheel side to side along a melody—it all became second nature, in a way.</p>

<p>And much like with the Steam Deck’s track pad, spinning the wheel proves to be the most satisfying part of the game, even more so in VR. Using my whole arm to “spin” the deck left and right with no regard for the safety of others is viscerally gratifying.</p>
<p>Nailing a hard song in <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em> feels almost euphoric. It can be tiring, sometimes with only adrenaline pulling me through, but it’s an all-encompassing musical experience, fueled especially by the immersion of virtual reality.</p>
<p>EDM makes up a majority of the game’s track list, and a big part of the culture is arguably visuals. Lasers, motion graphics, visualizers, choreographed LEDs—all this and more are standard fare at these shows.</p>

<p><em>Spin Rhythm XD</em> carries that torch well, accompanying every song with unique visuals, often matching the vibe. Teminite’s “Ghost Ship” has you approach a giant skull and crossbones at the end of the note highway, while other songs have neon ships pass you by.</p>
<p>Everything behind the note highway reacts to the music, but it’s never enough to be distracting. Instead, it complements the overall experience, putting you in a whole new dimension of music. Pair that with a flow state and you’re golden.</p>

<p>Overall, if you aren’t a fan of electronic music, you won’t find a lot to love here. There’s a lot of house, dubstep, and synthwave here, though there’s the occasional chillhop or jazzy track to find too. If you’re looking for rock or metal though, you’re pretty out of luck.</p>
<p>A lot of the tracks come from Candian record label Monstercat, though that did leave me wanting a little more out of the track list. Overall, I found songs I really liked, but after noticing how many Monstercat artists were here, I did wish for stuff from other artists, too, like ARMNHMR, Sullivan King, or Blanke.</p>

<h2>When It Gets a Little Too XD</h2>
<p>There are five levels of difficulty, with the last one, XD, feeling like a huge leap. I’m usually the type to jump into the highest difficulty of rhythm games like <em>Cytus</em>, <em>Voez</em>, and <em>DJMax Respect</em>. But even now, some harder Expert-level songs give me some trouble.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more than 14 hours in <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em> between the PC and PS5 releases, and I still feel like I’m scratching the surface on how high the skill ceiling is, especially in VR. XD-level songs move fast, and it’ll take hours of more practice for me to get it.</p>

<p>Granted, moving your whole hand takes more effort than, say, flicking a stick, especially when higher difficulties demand frantic, fast movements. Sometimes, I do wonder just how possible the highest difficulty is in VR.</p>
<p>Luckily, <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em> offers multiple ways to play the game, even letting you plug in a MIDI controller for maximum DJ immersion. That player choice is one of the game’s biggest strengths. There are so many ways to play the game, including using the touchpad or gyro controls on the PS5’s DualSense controller. Keyboard or mouse are viable options, too.</p>

<p>It’s a fairly accessible rhythm game with a very high skill ceiling, and watching people full-combo songs on XD difficulty is almost hypnotic. But if you’re not a sweaty rhythmhead, it’s still a ton of fun on a difficulty that challenges you just enough.</p>
<p>Adding onto that, the PC version has access to SpinShare, a modding community with all sorts of fan-made tracks that can be loaded into the game. Combine that with the free VR update and you’ve got a new rhythm game juggernaut on the scene.</p>

<h2><em>Spin Rhythm XD</em>&nbsp;VR Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Spin Rhythm XD</em>, especially with its new VR update, easily stands as one of the most satisfying rhythm games on the market today. It’s a new spin on the note highway system that’s popular in the genre, with a lot to offer for electronic music fans.</p>
<p>There’s a pretty big difficulty spike between Expert and XD, but that also feels like a moot point. As long as you’re playing on a level that comfortably pushes you, you’re bound to have fun—and maybe even enter a flow state.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Spin Rhythm XD</strong>&nbsp;was reviewed on a PlayStation VR 2 with a code provided by the publisher over the course of 14 hours of gameplay (including previous time with the PC version). All screenshots were taken during the process of the review.</em></p>
</div><div><p><span><div>
<div>
<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Spin Rhythm XD is an innovative take on rhythm games, with the VR version feeling somewhere between drumming and DJing. With a plethora of control options, immersive visuals, and intuitive controls, it’s an electrifying way to feel your music—as long as mostly electronic music is your jam.

Ideally, you should use another Pokémon to poison opponents and then use Pecharunt's ability to enhance the poison. Using it alongside Garbador's "Poisonous Puddle" ability from Rebel Clash would be a fantastic combination from a player's Bench, allowing an active Pokémon to clean up!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/pokemon-tcg-shrouded-fable-preview-2-1722334096650.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet—Shrouded Fable - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><h3><strong>Pecharunt EX</strong></h3><p><strong>Stats:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Type:</strong> Psychic</li><li><strong>HP:</strong> 190</li><li><strong>Attacks:</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Ability: Controlling Chains:</strong> Once during your turn, you may switch 1 of your Benched [D] Pokémon, except any Pecharunt ex, with your Active Pokémon.

It's also extremely playable, so it's likely to be in high demand!</p><p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Using Pecharunt EX alongside any Loyal Three EX is a winning combination and allows for switching of Dark types once a turn with no retreat cost. In our opinion, this can really slow down opponents, saving Pecharunt EX when you are low on Prize Cards to devastate an opponent's active Pokémon.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where to Preorder Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet—Shrouded Fable</h2></p><p>Shrouded Fable is busting out all of the usual box sets and booster bundles, this time centered around the Loyal Three of Kitakami, Okidogi, Munkidori and Fezandipiti. </p><p>They'll all be getting EX cards alongside the malicious Pecharunt, looking to shove its cursed Moochi treats into the face of any human or Pokémon it can.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-the-team-behind-reus-2-nurtured-a-studio-and-ip-back-to-life<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Reus 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> guides giant gods as they reshape worlds and guide ecosystems to help lead human civilization to greener futures on their own planet or to find prosperity (or spread darkness) to the stars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer caught up with Adriaan Jansen, one of the co-founders of the game’s development studio, Abbey Games, to talk about how this sequel was born from the studio reaching its lowest point, the challenges of giving the player creative potential to alter the world within a 2D space, and how they had to carefully work within constraints and limitations to get this sequel out the door.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Reus 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> sees players affecting the growth of human civilization through acting as powerful, world-shaping gods. What appealed to you about giving players the power of gods to alter the course of humanity?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jansen</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Peter Molyneux is an important part of it! But most importantly, I just have a lot of love for our planet. It's not just the nature that I love, it's also history, and us humans. I love reading about cultures, histories, and how they interact with humans. I also love the bizarre yet efficient ways of nature, like how all clown fishes are born male, with the most dominant turning female after a fight. All of it is beautiful. It's also an idiotically big subject, and a god game allows us to touch all of that (which we realized when we finished the game).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The original </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Reus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> came out over a decade ago. What interested you in coming back to do a sequel? What new things did you want this game to do?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the answer depends on whom you ask at Abbey Games. Personally, as the person mainly responsible for the game design, I knew </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Reus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be so much more. I'm not a "dream game" builder. I just want to see games come alive as the best versions of themselves possible. I'm extremely proud of the result in that regard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the team as whole, there were also other powers at play. When we started preproduction of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Reus 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Abbey Games was probably at its lowest point ever. We lost 75% of our team. It was a way for us to regain confidence. We looked at each other and went: "We must be able to do this, right?... right?!" The power of the IP was also an important factor, given that over the decade, more than a million people have bought </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Reus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That was something we could build on.</span></p><p>Images via Firesquid.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Why did you choose to have the game play out in a 2D sidescrolling perspective? What benefits and drawbacks did this perspective have on how you could design the game and gameplay?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was less of an idea and more of a premise, really! It creates a unique screenshot that is immediately intuitive. However, there are actually many drawbacks. Technically, it's quite a feat to make that round planet so malleable and natural as it is. The direct cost is already high. It also has huge secondary costs because you set a hard limit to what you can realistically do with the gameplay. You only have a small strip of land where gameplay is done. It's a bit like somebody giving you a gorgeous chessboard with a high fantasy theme, then sawing off all but the last two rows and telling you, "Now make an immersive high fantasy game". And no matter how good of a job we do, the abstraction of space itself limits the game a lot, which makes me even prouder of the result.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into designing the gods and their abilities in the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is, oddly enough, more of a production issue. The giants tie all the elements together, representing a biome as well as the placement of specific types of nature. So, when designing a giant and its abilities, I'm 100% constrained by what we can make. I don't think we got even 50% out of the potential from the giants simply because we didn't manage the interactivity space where those abilities would fall. For example, The Rock giant would love to have an earthquake ability. But what for? There is no war. There are no enemies. And the biome building surely doesn't need another layer of multipliers and buffs. The same could be said about all human-giant interactions. We see this as the biggest missed opportunity, one we wish to rectify.</span></p><p>Images via Firesquid.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you design the visuals for the varied gods? What feelings did you want to evoke with the look of these creatures?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had some constraints, but honestly, they just needed to look cool and harmonized. At first, we did not want them to look too much like animals, but then we got a giant crab, frog, and monkey. They also couldn't be too human—but then we have a bearded ice guy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a fantastic garden, and I like it for its richness.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into creating connections between the various things the gods could do and create and into developing synergies that could lead humanity in all sorts of directions?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Too many! The hard part was where to draw the line. You can't model the world; you have to pick your abstractions. In the end, we laser-focused on having fun, synergetic gameplay and let the humans react to it as a secondary. In a way, we didn't have a choice: many aspects of humans interacting with nature or each other were just not coming together quickly and we had to abandon them.</span></p><p>Images via Firesquid.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>When your god changes a part of the world, the visuals smoothly show the transition between its old state and the new one. How did you design these visual transitions so that players could watch the land change in such a striking way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We knew this was important from the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Reus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so we put a good amount of effort into keeping this intact. It was some iterative work, but we had good constraints to work from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you design systems that would lead humanity down different paths depending on how the gods shaped their world? How did this kind of narrative weave into the player's choices in what animals and terrain to populate the world with?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Actually, chatGTP was quite useful here! We were looking for nature-human relationships, and polling Google or Wikipedia is a lot of work. So, we asked AI to give us examples: what are plants, animals, or minerals used by humans throughout history to gain prosperity? Then we only needed to fact check, instead of finding an obscure blog list somewhere to draw inspiration from. In the end, it was very welcome help; it allowed us to scale up the number of natural elements to almost 300 pieces! Then, we could just pick examples of human inventions or turning points.</span></p><p>Images via Firesquid.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What paths did you want to create for humanity? What thoughts went into creating the various ways humanity can change over the course of the game (becoming spacefarers, starting cults, etc)?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here, we were obviously limited by our capabilities because we had ideas to spare. We went with a few more visually explosive ones like the ones you mentioned, but we also needed some more basic ones. Who knows what we might add in the future?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What ideas went into the various planets players could start off with? How did you design worlds that would create interesting challenges and benefits for the player and their choice of god?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was actually the hardest part to get right in the end. We had so many constraints: the villages, the biomes, the giants... getting them all to work together smoothly retroactively was a lot of work. We also faced our limitations with what we could do, too, especially with the cities and the giants. The key was to keep it simple. Some players have noticed that the giants don't take up much of the design space, and they're right. In the end, it fell off a little because of the other limitations we had. Although we have some plans moving forward! The game is doing well, and we're looking forward to expand on the universe.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>UK developer Playground Games has opened a third office to work on the Fable reboot. The studio revealed as much on its dedicated <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/playground-games/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn page</a>:</p>
<p><em>Playground Games was established in 2010, bringing together some of the most experienced and talented developers from the UK industry, with the vision to create genre-defining titles for a global audience. Since then, we’ve created five critically-acclaimed, award-winning hits; our Horizon games have garnered more than one hundred awards and have been played by many millions of fans.</em></p>
<p><em>Today, Playground has three world-class studios in Leamington Spa. In our original HQ, we continue to support and grow the huge, vibrant Horizon community. In our new studios on the other side of town, we are excited to be developing Fable, a new beginning for the legendary franchise.</em></p>
<p>The two previous offices are located on Portland Street (St. Albans House) and Newbold Terrace (Rossmore House). No details have been shared on the third office as of yet. According to the <a href="https://playground-games.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>, there are currently 32 open positions across all departments for the Fable team:</p>
<ul>
<li>3C Engineer</li>
<li>AI Engineer</li>
<li>Associate Lead/Lead Environment Artist</li>
<li>Associate Technical Designer (Contract)</li>

<li>Senior UI Artist</li>
<li>Senior UI Engineer</li>
<li>Senior VFX Artist</li>
<li>VFX Artist (all levels)</li>
</ul>
<p>It would seem a lot for a game that's scheduled to launch in less than a year and a half, although, of course, it is possible at least some of those job openings have already been filled, and the website simply needs to catch up.</p>
<p>You can check out the latest Fable trailer from June's Xbox Games Showcase <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

The Filipino studio has created narrative games since 2018, but with <em>Until Then</em>’s release, they finally have struck gold.</p>
<p>This game is one of the few video games that spoke directly to my soul. It unearthed emotions that I thought I'd already moved on from. I couldn't be more wrong.</p>
<p>The game's story&nbsp;follows a high school student, Mark, who lives in a world affected by an almost world-ending disaster called “The Ruling.” Throughout his journey, he encounters different people and makes difficult choices as he tries to make sense of the world around him.</p>
<h2>Reading Between the Lines</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/inline-images/late-night-texting-in-until-then.jpg?itok=acYJcB_b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/inline-images/late-night-texting-in-until-then.jpg?itok=jXd0--A1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Their group's banter fills me with life</figcaption></figure><p>Just like other narrative adventures, there’s not much in terms of gameplay in <em>Until Then</em>. You’re mostly going to move around and talk to the people around you. At times, there will be minigames that would keep the players more engaged compared to just hitting the space bar and reading texts.</p>
<p>However, some of these minigames can be tedious at times, particularly the rhythm game parts, which I will explain further down the line.</p>
<h2>Proudly Filipino</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/inline-images/fishball-vendor-in-until-then.jpg?itok=SFq17YrM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/inline-images/fishball-vendor-in-until-then.jpg?itok=WadmTY-e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Street Food Vendors are all over the place in the Philippines</figcaption></figure><p><em>Until Then</em>'s setting is my home country, the Philippines. The developers have paid close attention to this detail as they've used an alphabet Filipinos used before the Spanish colonization, called the Baybayin. Graffiti and vandalism also use the native language which are nice touches.</p>
<p>Some of the banners and shops seen in the game&nbsp;are also direct references to real-life stores and banners that we see here daily. Attention to detail like this can be a make-or-break games that have a focus on narrative as a single article that feels out of place can break immersion. Even the main menu sound effects, where someone is shouting “Taho!” at the top of their lungs, are nice touches as these are the exact sounds people in the Philippines hear when they wake up in the morning. Especially, if they’re located in an urban area.</p>
<p>Most of the minigames in this game are also Filipino-influenced. For example, there's a minigame about skewering fish balls from a street food vendor which is a thing that we do quite a lot when we want to eat something really quick. The fairs and the minigames associated with them also transport me back to when I was a kid and always went to one with my parents. These minigames are properly implemented and don't seem intrusive.</p>
<p>While the setting is undoubtedly Filipino, some parts of it have been changed due to one of <em>Until Then</em>’s central events, The Ruling, morphing much of the landscape outside the main area where the game&nbsp;takes place.</p>
<h2>An Emotional Masterpiece</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/inline-images/everything-shines-until-then.jpg?itok=gtR2Q8O5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/inline-images/everything-shines-until-then.jpg?itok=82uMGM9V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>She's shining</figcaption></figure><p>The most important part of a narrative adventure game is the story it tells, and I’m happy to say that <em>Until Then</em> is a masterpiece in this regard.</p>
<p>The feelings of regret, love, and loss are strong here,&nbsp;and how the game navigates around these themes is masterful. Coincidentally, these were emotions that I thought I had already moved on from. The way Mark deals with his emotions and the situations he’s put into, despite just being a high school student, left me in shambles at times.</p>
<p>Face-to-face dialogue isn’t the only way characters interact in <em>Until Then</em>. In fact, the first piece of character interaction in the game comes from a text message. Not just that, there’s also a social media site that closely resembles Facebook that is fully interactable.</p>
<p>You can comment on some posts, like them, and share them. You can even click on articles and read them. I found this fascinating as it makes the game feel much more alive as you see characters–even those that you don’t interact with–have their own lives separate from the story. They’re all just chilling and doing their own thing.</p>
<p>Polychroma Games has also achieved something I haven’t seen much with games that have similar graphics: convey emotions. Most pixel-art games usually let the dialogue handle the emotional part of a scene. However, <em>Until Then</em> managed to find ways to convey a character’s emotions using just a few pixels. This is evident in scenes where characters are seen tearing up and a few light blue pixels can be seen under their eyes.</p>
<p>However, <em>Until Then</em> is not without its faults. If you’re familiar with how <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/nier-automata-review-robots-in-love">NieR: Automata</a></em> handles its storytelling, then you probably have an idea of the kind of problem the game is suffering.</p>
<h2>Not As Smooth</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/inline-images/rhythm-minigame-in-until-then.jpg?itok=5nq8j2tc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/inline-images/rhythm-minigame-in-until-then.jpg?itok=YtKq-DfX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Still surprised when this first popped up</figcaption></figure><p>As I mentioned earlier, this game needs to be played a couple more times after the first one to get to the true ending. However, as you go through it the second time, it suffers from pacing issues.</p>
<p>Just like <em>NieR: Automata</em>’s second playthrough, much of <em>Until Then</em>’s second playthrough is similar to its first playthrough. There are some minor differences to keep the players engaged, but the overall story progression remains the same.</p>
<p>At times, I found the second playthrough boring as there was not much new, and things wouldn't make sense until the latter half of it. This is a huge step away from the first playthrough which left me a crying mess. However, it’s still worth going through for the&nbsp;true ending.</p>
<p>Another part of <em>Until Then</em> that I wasn’t too happy about is the rhythm game sections. Towards the latter part of the first playthrough, you will encounter rhythm game sections where you have to press the arrow keys to the beat. I know that music is a huge part of the game, with Mark being intent on becoming a pianist, but there are a few times I found the rhythm game sections pretty tedious due to the randomness of their appearance.</p>
<p>I still remember the first time I encountered it at the latter parts of the first playthrough and was bewildered by how abrupt it was. During the first part of the second playthrough, you’ll also encounter a random rhythm game section that’s pretty similar to <em>Rhythm Heaven</em>. Which just seemed completely out of nowhere. While I do appreciate that they’re highlighting Filipino culture with the latter minigame, I think the developers&nbsp;could’ve done a better job of easing the player into it.</p>
<h2>A life-changing experience</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/inline-images/nicole-crying-in-until-then.jpg?itok=swIDmv2R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/inline-images/nicole-crying-in-until-then.jpg?itok=mViaJMhw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is literally me after I finished playing <em>Until Then</em></figcaption></figure><p>While it suffers a little in pacing and the rhythm game sections, it doesn’t dull the wonderful story <em>Until Then</em> is trying to tell. The game’s top-notch graphics and story left me smiling and even crying in its strongest moments.</p>
<p><em>Until Then</em> is a game for the masses, but it also has its target audience. As someone in that specific set of player base, I can proudly say that it&nbsp;has destroyed me emotionally. But at the end of it all, it has also taught me how to forgive myself.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Until Then doesn't shy away from its Filipino references and it delivers a masterpiece of a narrative. While there are problems with pacing and some minigames, Until Then's cast of lovable characters makes it memorable. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/30/new-helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond-burns-bright-on-august-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a> today, PlayStation confirmed the details and release date for the Freedom’s Flame Warbond, coming to Helldivers 2 on August 8, 2024.</p>



<p>Freedom’s Flame will add “fresh emotes, capes, and skins,” as well as a variety of new equipment. That includes a SG-451 Cookout pump action shotgun, the FLAM-66 Torcher flamethrower, and P-72 Crisper. </p>



<p>Players can also find the new I-09 Heatseeker and I-102 Draconaught armor. These introduce the new inflammable passive that gives “75% damage resistance to fire.”</p>



<p>The official announcement closely follows Sony’s own accidental leak for the Warbond. However, the leak did not feature the specific details unveiled today. Fans also got a look at the new Warbond in action with a cinematic teaser.</p>

<p>The most recent Helldivers 2 Warbond was Viper Commandos, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-is-coming-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in June 2024</a>. </p>



<p>Alongside that announcement, developer Arrowhead Game Studios also revealed plans to slow down the pace of Warbond releases. </p>



<p>The devs explained they expect to release Warbonds that are more polished. Just a couple of weeks ago, Arrowhead pushed a hotfix that finally helped with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-receives-hotfix-for-infinite-drop-in-glitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the infinite drop-in glitch</a>.</p>



<p>The new Freedom’s Flame Warbond will join Helldivers 2 just days after the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-update-coming-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escalation of Freedom update</a>. The update will arrive August 6, 2024, introducing new enemies, objectives, difficulty level, and more.</p>
