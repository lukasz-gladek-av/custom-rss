<p>In December, MachineGames and Bethesda released Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a critically acclaimed epic featuring the titular adventurer front and centre. For this spin around the whip, Indiana Jones was played by Troy Baker, one of the most instantly recognisable names in gaming.</p>



<p>Harrison Ford has made it clear that he’s more than happy to pass the torch to Baker, and in the past, he has praised the actor for his replication of the character. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, the legendary actor once again showered Baker with adoration for his portrayal of Indiana Jones.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nothing-but-good-things">Nothing But Good Things</h2>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle received positive reviews across the board when it was released on December 9. It looks great, plays better, and features the iconic tropes of the Indiana Jones series that are intensely familiar to fans of the franchise.</p>



<p>In an interview that took place before the game was released, Bethesda Game Studios’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-troy-baker-indiana-jones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Howard revealed</a> that he <strong>didn’t want Troy Baker </strong>to play Indiana Jones. He explained that the team cast a wide net when fielding auditions, but time and again, those vetting the ‘blind taste tests’ picked Troy Baker.</p>



<p>Recently, Harrison Ford sat down to speak to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/harrison-ford-shrinking-1923-captain-america-7b1f9b3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Wall Street Journal</a> about his acting career – which is still going strong despite the performer being 82 years of age.</p>



<p>Amid a deep conversation about the Indy franchise and Ford’s most recent work, including the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World, the topic turned to Baker’s performance of Indiana Jones in the December release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul. You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent.</p>



<p>He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With the mention of AI, Harrison Ford was talking about using ‘synthetic versions of famous actors’ to apply them to roles after they’ve passed on. This is something that, quite understandably, actors are wary of pursuing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-warning-buying-abandoned-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-will-now-warn-you-before-you-buy-an-%E2%80%98abandoned%E2%80%99-game.1101378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-warning-buying-abandoned-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Valve has released a new update to the Steam interface that’ll offer users a prompt detailing how long it has been since an early-access game was last updated. This new feature is designed to prevent gamers from investing in a game that might be abandoned, or from buying one that might not be accurately represented by what’s detailed on the store page.</p>



<p>It’s not immediately obvious what the ‘cut-off point’ is for this label to appear, as not every early-access game has it. Most of them just have the typical breakdown that features an explanation from the developers as to why the game has been released in an early-access state.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-transparency-update">Transparency Update</h2>



<p>One of the most heartbreaking revelations you can have as a gamer is investing in an early-access game that has you excited, only to find that the developer hasn’t touched it in years. That’s the case with some early-access games on Steam that remain in that state for <strong>a very long time </strong>after hitting the digital storefront.</p>



<p>Valve’s latest update challenges that notion, letting users know if it has been several months (or more) since the last major update to the game. This change was noticed and publicised on social media <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1887107461879832746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>For instance, Heartbound, which was released in 2018 and remains in early access, was last updated ‘over 13 months ago’. The game was once taken positively by the PC gaming community, but the recent review rating has dropped to Mostly Negative because of the lack of updates.</p>



<p>Another example is a game called ATLAS, which sees players take on an ambitious pirating adventure across the high seas. It looks good enough at first blush, but it has mixed reviews overall – some 36,000 in total. It too was released in 2018 but hasn’t been updated in more than 20 months:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many early-access games ‘graduate’ from that state, becoming a full-release title that launches with a 1.0 version that’s often bursting with improvements and features. One great example is Sons of the Forest, which was released in early access in February 2023, graduating to a full release one year later and succeeding all over again.</p>



<p>This is a nice move by Valve – but what do you think? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

          <p>AMD announced its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, and the numbers were <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial">mostly rosy</a>: $7.7 billion in revenue and a 51 percent profit margin, compared to $6.2 billion and 47 percent <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1180/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial">a year ago</a>. The biggest winner was the data center division, which made $3.9 billion thanks to Epyc server processors and Instinct AI accelerators, and Ryzen CPUs are also selling well, helping the company's client segment earn $2.3 billion.</p>
<p>But if you were looking for a dark spot, you'd find it in the company's gaming division, which earned a relatively small $563 million, down 59 percent from a year ago. AMD's Lisa Su blamed this on both dedicated graphics card sales and sales from the company's "semi-custom" chips (that is, the ones created specifically for game consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation).</p>
<p>Other data sources suggest that the response from GPU buyers to AMD's Radeon RX 7000 series, launched between late 2022 and early 2024, has been lackluster. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/">Steam Hardware Survey</a>, a noisy but broadly useful barometer for GPU market share, shows no RX 7000-series models in the top 50; only two of the GPUs (the 7900 XTX and 7700 XT) are used in enough gaming PCs to be mentioned on the list at all, with the others all getting lumped into the "other" category. Jon Peddie Research <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/discrete-gpu-sales-increase-as-intels-share-drops-to-0">recently estimated</a> that AMD was selling roughly one dedicated GPU for every seven or eight sold by Nvidia.</p>
<p>But hope springs eternal. Su confirmed on AMD's earnings call that the new Radeon RX 9000-series cards, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-promise-to-fix-two-of-amds-biggest-weaknesses/">announced at CES last month</a>, would be launching in early March. The Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT are both aimed toward the middle of the graphics card market, and Su said that both would bring "high-quality gaming to mainstream players."</p>
<h2>An opportunity, maybe</h2>
<p>"Mainstream" could mean a lot of things. AMD's CES slide deck positioned the 9070 series alongside Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti ($799) and 4070 Super ($599) and its own RTX 7900 XT, 7900 GRE, and 7800 XT (between $500 and $730 as of this writing), a pretty wide price spread that is still more expensive than an entire high-end console. The GPUs could still rely heavily on upscaling algorithms like AMD's Fidelity Super Resolution (FSR) to hit playable frame rates at those resolutions, rather than targeting native 4K.</p>

            <p>
Call of Duty veteran Michael Condrey has reportedly been fired as the head of 2K Games studio 31st Union after its debut project, free-to-play hero shooter Project Ethos, recieved a muted reponse on its reveal toward the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
Condrey, who co-founded Call of Duty developer Sledgehammer Games, was confirmed to be leading 2K's 31st Union in 2019. A year later, Condrey <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-rebrands-studio-headed-by-sledgehammer-co-founder-to-31st-union">teased</a> the studio was working on an "ambitious and inspired new IP" - but it wasn't until last October that the game, now known as Project Ethos, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-veteran-reveals-project-ethos-a-roguelike-hero-shooter-backed-by-2k">finally revealed</a>.
</p>
<p>
Project Ethos was officially described as a free-to-play "roguelike hero shooter", and featured a colourful art style reminiscent of Blizzard's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. Unfortunately, its unveiling came just months after consumer apathy led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">rapid demise of PlayStation's Concord</a> - and it appears there wasn't much enthusiasm for Project Ethos either.

<p>
In a <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173">new report by Kotaku</a>, sources claim Project Ethos - which is said to have faced a "challenging and rocky development cycle" under Condrey - was revealed to "little fanfare or apparent player interest". That seemingly sparked a chain of events leading to Condrey's reported firing as 31st Union's studio head earlier this week.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Kotaku, 2K confirmed Condrey's departure as 31st Union president, saying he would be "transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project Ethos". The publisher also insisted it remains "very committed to the forward path for Project Ethos and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio."
</p>
<p>
"We are grateful to Michael Condrey," it added, "for the dedication, passion and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union."
</p>
<p>
2K, of course, has packed slate of major releases over the next 12 months, with Civilization 7, Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine's Judas, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> behemoth <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> all on the way.

<p>2K has shaken things up at the top of one of its developers. A new report has surfaced claiming that 2K Games has fired 31st Union president Michael Condrey after the poor response to Project Ethos.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, 2K made the move after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-games-project-ethos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s reveal</a> left players and critics, alike, underwhelmed. One preview from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-ethos-first-hands-on-impressions-of-2ks-new-roguelike-hero-shooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> last year stated, “It seems to fall short of delivering anything that’s truly genre-defying in either the roguelike or extraction shooter departments.”</p>



<p>In a statement to Kotaku, 2K says that Condrey is “transitioning” from the project and that the company is still “committed” to the game.</p>



<p>“We are grateful to Michael Condrey for the dedication, passion and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union,” a 2K spokesperson told the outlet. “Michael will be transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project ETHOS. We remain very committed to the forward path for Project ETHOS and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio.”</p>

<p>Condrey joined 31st Union in 2019 after leaving Sledgehammer Games, a studio he helped found in 2009. He has yet to make any statement on the change, or what’s next for his career. </p>



<p>Take-Two Interactive is scheduled to report its Q3 FY2025 earnings on Thursday, February 6 at 430pm ET.</p>

But drafting, where you pick a card to keep and pass the rest on, is pretty boring with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two players</a>, seeing as you know exactly what you’re going to be given on each pass. So, eventually, the game got a spin-off for two players only called <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGGP8?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">7 Wonders Duel</a> which cleverly mimicked a draft by giving players a mixture of face-up and face-down cards to choose from. That was also hugely popular: indeed popular enough that it’s now received a shiny new Tolkien reskin in the form of Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGVvB?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DFF3V1Q7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>).</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What’s in the Box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/lotr-duel-box-contents-1738777284021.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this is essentially a card game, that’s the majority of the box contents. Fortunately they’re great cards, vibrant with evocative Middle-earth art. Some of the art actually joins together to make panoramas – although it’s unlikely you’ll manage to collect a set during play. Cards have a colored top bar to indicate what type they are, and most also have several symbols indicating both what that card can do for you, and the prerequisites for acquiring it.</p><div catalogid="466bb9b4-b3ca-4bef-ae41-7721c86b6fee" id="214615"><div id="214615" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of The Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players new to this version might be more interested in the other components, which are used for tracking the game state. There’s a mini-map of Middle-earth onto which you place delightfully tiny wooden army and castle pieces. Another lovely touch is the hunt for the ring track, over which you place a plastic slider with the hobbits at one end and a movable plastic ringwraith at the other. This ensures the hobbits can inch closer to their objective at Mount Doom, the wraith can inch closer to the hobbits, but the hobbits can never get further away from the wraith. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaining pieces are punchable cardboard. There are several stacks of shields, one for each of the neutral factions of Middle-earth that the players hope to ally with, featuring icons on the reverse to indicate the reward for doing so, and lots of gold coins. Finally there’s a tile for each region on the board indicating what fortress you can build there, what it costs, and what you gain for doing so.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and How It Plays">Rules and How it Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/lotr1-1738782689175.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">7 Wonders: Duel simulated drafting for two by having each of its three rounds set out a pattern of cards in which a row of face-up cards overlapped a row of face-down cards. That same layout is replicated here exactly, except rather than competing civilizations, one of you is the dark lord Sauron and the other represents the free people of Middle-earth. You can’t pick a card – or flip it, if it’s face-down – until the cards beneath it in the pyramid have been cleared. This makes your choice of which card to take each turn difficult and tense, because you want to try and minimize the options available to your opponent while also maximising your own further down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This card pyramid isn’t the only thing that Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth retains from its predecessor. Indeed, pretty much the entire game flow will be familiar to veterans of that game. Most early cards are free, so you can pick them up and add them to your growing tableau. But as the game progresses, more powerful cards will either require you to have particular skill icons or prerequisite symbols from cards you already own in order to take them. If you can’t afford anything, you can use gold to make up the shortfall of matching symbols or discard a card for gold instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are thus quickly caught into a dilemma as to whether to specialize in certain sets of skills, which will make it easier to get similar cards, or play as more of a generalist. There’s no right answer to this: it depends on what cards you get and in what order, and learning when to break one way or the other is a key tactical skill that comes with experience. Either way, this makes flipping face-down cards surprisingly exciting because there can be a lot riding on it if it’s the next key part in the specialist chain that you’re building. There’s nothing worse than suddenly finding you’ve handed the opportunity to pick-up a critical card to your opponent because grabbing something else you wanted revealed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to cards that grow your tableau economy, there are also cards that move you forward on victory conditions. These are where Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth makes clear water between itself and its predecessor. Ring symbols let you advance on the quest for the ring track. If either side reaches the end of its track, it’s an instant win, with identical bonuses to be had along the way. Green cards represent an alliance with another faction such as Elves or Ents: six different such symbols and you win, while duplicates get you a bonus token from a stack specific to each faction. Finally, red cards let you place armies on the map of Middle-Earth, kicking out rivals on a one-to-one basis. If you conquer all seven regions you win, otherwise the player with the most regions when the card stack runs out takes the victory.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/lotr4-1738785279052.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each victory condition is cleverly designed to close in on its apex during the third round of play. You are pretty much guaranteed to be within touching distance of one, if not two, by then and play becomes a matter not only of trying to inch yourself over the line but selecting cards that prevent your opponent from doing the same. This ensures that play builds towards a truly thrilling climax almost every time, lending the game an epic feel that belies its relative simplicity and snappy half-hour play time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, after a few plays it’s hard not to wonder how much of this comes down to skill, and how much of it is luck. As mentioned previously, revealing a card that either you, or your opponent, need, can be absolutely critical to which way the victory breaks and there’s very little you can do about it. The decisions you make along the way certainly matter, but the game is engineered to be close because whatever you don’t have the opportunity to get, your enemy will. You thus pay for that crescendo of excitement with the seeds of doubt about how much your efforts influenced the final outcome. In fairness, it is difficult to design really dramatic games that don’t involve a lot of random moments, and this one hides it fairly well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Play builds towards a truly thrilling climax almost every time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One other secret weapon the game has in this regard is its other major new feature: fortresses. At any given time there are three fortress tiles available of the full seven, one for each space on the map. They all cost large amounts of skill symbols and gold, but come with benefits to match. Not only do these rewards tie in with the central game mechanics, such as free ring track spaces if you gain the tower of Minas Tirith in Gondor, but they allow you to place a fortress piece in the matching space, which acts as an undefeatable army there. Fortresses are thus huge pivots in winning over map spaces. At the same time, buying a tile is the only way you can delay taking a card and thus potentially force your opponent into taking one that flips those critical unrevealed cards instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all the vibrant card art and name-checking of key places and people in Middle-earth, the game doesn't end up feeling like an evocation of Tolkien’s trilogy. Grabbing ring cards is no substitute for the long, desperate chase depicted in the books and there’s no real matchup between allying factions and the rewards they offer. Worse, the game often feels counter-thematic. There’s nothing to stop Sauron allying with his most implacable foes, the Elves, and the armies of the free peoples often end up conquering the shadow realm of Mordor and buying its fortress of Barad-Dur. These outcomes would have been unthinkable in the carefully constructed legendarium, but they’re so common here it makes light of Tolkein’s vast imaginative effort.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/lotr2-1738785230220.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGVvB?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX22kO?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL55oR?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Asmodee</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXXBm?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Miniature Market</strong></a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>See More Lord of the Rings Board Games: </strong></h2></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 5, 2025 8:57 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Concerns over the game’s theme and potential depth aside, Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth deserves to be lauded for presenting such an exciting and varied game off the back of such an accessible setup. One caveat has to be offered to those familiar with 7 Wonders Duel, though: while the new mechanics make this a cut above that game, the two feel very similar and you can’t really justify owning both. If you’re new to this series, by the time you’re knee deep in rings and things, frantically wondering what the next card flip will be and whether you’ll be able to stop your foe one space from winning, you won’t care that much about the niceties of skill or story. You’ll be too busy having a good time.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Saber Interactive founder Matthew Karch has shared some pointed words about the state of the AAA video game market. Speaking to reporter <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/saber-interactive-matt-karch-private-jet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo aboard a private jet that he paid $23 million for</a>, Karch said incredibly expensive AAA games may become a thing of the past and are contributing to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">string of job losses in the market today.</a></p><p>"I think that the age of the $200 million, $300 million, $400 million AAA game is on its way out. I don't think it's necessary. I don't think it's appropriate," Karch said.</p><p>The executive went on to say he believes the costs associated with making such big-budget games may help explain why the video game industry is seeing so many layoffs today.</p><p>"I don't know how best to put it….I think if anything has contributed more to the loss of jobs, it's the multi-hundred million dollar budget," he said.</p><p>In 2023, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-ceases-all-operations-in-russia-through-the-divestment-of-selected-assets-from-the-operative-group-saber-interactive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Karch's Beacon Interactive</a> bought certain assets from Saber's parent company Embracer as part of a divestiture from Embracer's business operations in Russia. It was at this time that Karch and Embracer officially parted ways, with Beacon effectively buying Saber our of Embracer.</p><p>Before this, Karch lamented how "games are getting cut left and right" due to certain economic conditions within the video game business. "The consolidation that's been going on in the industry is gonna hurt that as well, and the costs and the turmoil that the industry has been going through… Teams will regroup but the capital at the moment, it just isn't there," <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sabers-matthew-karch-the-aaa-model-is-going-to-change" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told GI.biz</a>. "And so the industry is actually contracting somewhat and the supply of content is going to be way short of the demand."</p><p>Karch has also questioned the $70 price point for games, saying he would prefer not too charge that much and believes it's "almost not fair" to do so. He cited Helldivers 2, which launched at $40, as being an example of a lower-priced game that went on to enjoy huge success. One of Saber's biggest recent releases was 2024's Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, which was priced at $70 despite what Karch thinks about that price point.</p><p>Saber's Tim Willits, commenting on the success of Space Marine 2, said it's a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-didnt-need-to-sell-4-million-units-to-be-a-success-but-it-did-anyway/1100-6527262/" data-ref-id="1100-6527262">sad truth</a> that many game studios declare a game a failure if it doesn't sell 5 million copies. "I mean, what business are we in where you fail if you sell less than 5 million?" he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another day, another set of layoffs it seems. Iron Galaxy layoffs are the latest to strike the industry as the studio responsible for a lot of porting work, co-development, and the creation of the free-to-play game <em>Rumbleverse</em> and fighting game <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killer-instinct-anniversary-edition-coming-years-after-latest-update-with-patch-notes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Killer Instinct Anniversary Edition Released Years After Latest Update">Killer Instinct</a> </em>has let go of over 60 people.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.irongalaxystudios.com/blog-posts/an-update-on-our-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="AN UPDATE ON OUR STAFF">announcement on their site</a>, they mention the state of the industry which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/topic/layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Video Game Layoffs">seen many layoffs</a>, many studio closures, and a lot of games fail to perform, including <em>Rumbleverse</em>. This follows the layoffs yesterday at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Sumo Group Announces Layoffs Amid Refocus on Support and Work for Hire">Sumo Group</a> who were a similar type of studio that had focused on co-development and services, before expanding to do more their own work. Through the last two years they had managed to keep their team together, but they no longer have the room to continue without cutting some of their staff, after having taken many steps over the past few years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, Iron Galaxy is parting ways with some of our developers and support staff. In total, we have reduced our employee base by 66 people. This was a means of last resort for us. It’s a measure we do not take lightly to enable our long-term survival.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iron Galaxy has four studios, and the contraction comes after they had spent the years growing in the lead-up to <em>Rumbleverse</em> as they attempted to build doing original projects on top of their co-development, and porting work. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, they <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/inno/stories/news/2021/07/23/video-game-studio-iron-galaxy-hires-100-it-s-sti.html?ana=e_or_ae&amp;j=24538920&amp;senddate=2021-07-23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Video-Game Studio Iron Galaxy Hires 100-Plus, It's Still Growing">hired 100 people</a>, which took them near 300 people in the studio, thus this represents likely somewhere between 20 and 25% of the headcount among employees.</p>

<p>Beyond their work on <em>Killer Instinct</em> and <em>Rumbleverse</em>, many ports for PC and Switch bear the marks of Iron Galaxy's work. Titles like <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em> on PC were ported by them, and they helped Blizzard bring games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/overwatch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Overwatch"><em>Overwatch</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-diablo-3-found-itself-journey-through-hell-and-madness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-diablo-3-found-itself-journey-through-hell-and-madness"><em>Diablo </em><em>3</em> </a>to Nintendo Switch. Other titles that they have done some work on include <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Spyro Reignited Trilogy"><em>Spyro Reignited Trilogy</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy"><em>Crash Bandicoot N-Sane Trilogy</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Skyrim"><em>Skyrim</em></a>, and <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-next-gen-difference" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection - The Next-Gen Difference">Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves</a></em>.</p>

<p>In the note, the studio concludes by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this moment, our focus is on our teammates who have begun a journey toward their next role. We thank them for working with us. We’ll be doing everything we can to support them in the search for the next phase of their careers. Keep an eye out for them if you need good people. We are sorry to see them go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We wish everyone impacted by layoffs over the past few years the best, and our hearts go out to all the people impacted by the Iron Galaxy layoffs. Here's hoping you find the perfect job for you just around the corner.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-game-size-revealed-on-mac-app-store.1101303/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is confirmed as the largest game in the franchise’s history, at a whopping 123.2 GB in size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows game size was revealed through its listing on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-shadows/id6497794841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mac App Store</a>. The title can be pre-ordered now for $69.99. Players will need macOS 14.0 or later and a Mac with an Apple M1 chip or later to play the game. The 123.2 GB file size is the largest in the franchise’s history, more than double that of recent instalments like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla or Odyssey, which needed around 50 GB and 45 GB only, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such a massive file size for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will expect Ubisoft to go all out on the game. The visual fidelity and attention to detail should be second to no past Assassin’s Creed title if the game size exceeds the previous instalments by that much. If you are wondering about Assassin’s Creed Shadows PC system requirements, check out the details <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Players should note that SSD storage with 123.2 GB of free space is mandatory for any preset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is an upcoming historical, open-world action-adventure by Ubisoft set in Feudal Japan. Players will experience this adventure through the eyes of 2 characters: Naoe, a shinobi Assassin and Yasuke, a legendary samurai. Both characters feature distinct playstyles. Naoe is more stealthy and agile, whereas Yasuke is the tank responsible for dealing the heavy blows. If you are interested in the game, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac on March 20, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ art book recently leaked online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-artwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on an 18+ website</a>, showcasing new art for the game. Also, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shaodws-censored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graphic content will be censored in Japan</a>. What are your thoughts on Assassin’s Creed Shadows Game size?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Valve has quietly implmented a useful new Steam feature warning users - and potential purchasers - how long it's been since an early access game last received an update.
</p>
<p>
Steam early access has unquestionably helped a huge number of games get over the development finish line since its introduction in 2013, including some major success stories - Hades, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rimworld">RimWorld</a>, Rust, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, and Larian Studios' 2023 smash hit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> were all early access releases, for instance. But many titles never make it that far, ending up abandoned and languishing in early access forever.
</p>
<p>
And historically, it's not always been easy to distinguish the abandoned games from those still in active development - not without poking around though user reviews and developer update, at least. But now - as spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y">SteamDB on Bluesky</a> - Valve is seemingly looking to make that process easier by placing a warning on early access titles that haven't been updated in a year, enabling users to make a more informed purchasing decision.

<p>
Users viewing an affected release will now see a message in its early access box warning, "The last update made by the developer was over [x] months ago. The information and timeline described here by the developers here may no longer be up to date." The message appears to trigger after 12 months without an update, increasing monthly then yearly from there.
</p>
<p>
Valve hasn't publicly detailed its thinking behind the new feature, something it occasionally does over on the official Steam blog, but it's certainly a useful addition given the increasing number of games adopting the Steam early access development model - a figure that's risen from seven in 2013 to 2,605 last year, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tagid=493">according to SteamDB</a>.

			<p>To celebrate the 6th anniversary of Apex Legends, Respawn Entertainment has released a Dev Diary where players can find out about what to expect for the rest of the year, as well as some major updates coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/">the game</a>. This includes features such as Matchmaking, Anti-Cheat, and Competitive Integrity. If you want to see what's coming in Apex Legends: Takeover, make sure to check out the Dev Diary below, where Game Director Steven Ferreira and Design Director Evan Nikolich will be discussing the update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apex Legends: Takeover Dev Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRAKqGo_wBE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are some major changes coming with Takeover, including Creator Commissioners. This means that some of the community's favorite Creators will be bringing in unique and curated challenges to Apex Legends with Creator-selected Legendary Weapon Skins and Apex Pack rewards. If you want to participate, you can get these rewards both solo and as a community, giving you plenty of opportunities to get the skins.</p>
<p>For those who have a competitive streak, there will be some major meta changes to give the game a mix-up. This includes Assault Legends getting new perks such as Extra Firepower, Armed and Dangerous, and players now getting extra ammo, grenade slots, and improved weapon handling. For the first time in Apex Legends' history, every single weapon in the game has got a buff this season, meaning some of the favorite weapons used will be more dangerous than ever.</p>
<p>To celebrate six years of Apex Legends, there will also be an anniversary event. In total, there are 36 Anniversary Event items that you can obtain, with every item being Legendary or above. This includes Heirloom Shards and the first-of-its-kind Mythic R-301.</p>
<p>The Mythic R-301 is a Wraith-inspired weapon that has three unlockable tiers with a void-inspired look. Along with its release, there will be new animations for the weapon, including reloads and enemy knock effects.</p>
<p>There were already many ways to get weaponry and gear from around the map, but Apex Legends is now receiving a new feature named Arsenals. These are weapon stations that bring every weapon of a single ammo type and can be seen from the sky. Having these in the games it means that there is a level of planning that players can utilize rather than relying on RNG to get good loot.</p>
<p>For information on the Anti-Cheat changes and Competitive Integrity, there is a news post available on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/dev-update-0225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Apex Legends website</a> where you can find out more about what changes they've made to the system.</p>
<p>The Apex Legends: Takeover trailer will be released tomorrow, where you'll get to see some of the brand-new features in action. After that, you won't have long to wait, as the update will be launching on February 11 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nearly seven years after the original, Kingdom Come Deliverance II has finally landed with much fanfare. The first-person open world roleplaying game by Warhorse Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has earned a perfect score from Wccftech</a> and several other major publications. In our review, Chris Wray summarized his experience playing Kingdom Come Deliverance II with the following words:</p>
<p><em> If I were honest with myself, I don't think I've ever enjoyed an open-world game in the same way I have Kingdom Come Deliverance II. Or, more accurately, the last time a game ever felt this transformational as to what I would expect from an open-world RPG of this nature was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion almost twenty years ago. The Witcher III is up there, but even that doesn't feel as responsive as this. [...] I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</em></p>
<p>The game also just <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially became a million-seller</a>. On Steam, it <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1771300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peaked</a> at 167K concurrent users, which is almost double the peak of the original, and there's a solid chance it will get higher during the coming weekend. With this kind of popularity and an active modding community already hard at work, here's an early Kingdom Come Deliverance II mod roundup for PC users.</p>
<p>Warhorse's franchise is known to be quite simulative and realistic, but some players may not necessarily love all the restrictions put in place by the developers. Arguably, the key one is the limited save system. Just like in the first installment, this sequel only lets you save if you sleep in an owned bed or if you use the mythical Saviour Schnapps potion. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlimited Saving II by EddieShoe</a> restores regular quick saving functionality, which can be triggered in-game simply by pressing the traditional F5 key.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/13?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weight Radius XP PTF by zsadik52</a> mixes various convenience tweaks: weight capacity increase to 600, herb picking radius increase, and XP increase. The author provided various options to pick from; the herb picking radius can be increased by 10x or 100x, and the experience gain can be tweaked with five options: 0.5x XP, 1x XP, 2x XP, 4x XP, and 10x XP.</p>
<p>Speaking about gathering herbs, authors HerrTiSo and CryptLoad have released two dedicated mods: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instant Herb Picking II</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First-Person Herb Picking II</a>. As you'd guess from the respective names, the first one removes the third-person animation to make herb picking much quicker, whereas the second mod simply lets the regular animation play out while keeping the first-person view.</p>
<p>Continuing with the convenience theme, modder pavelk has released mods to double <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputation gains</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/60" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potion duration</a>. He also removed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/61?tab=posts&amp;BH=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">food decay</a> (so it doesn't rot in your inventory), the map's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fog of war</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/34" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letterboxing in cutscenes</a>.</p>
<p>ryhBread's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/59?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stay Clean for Longer</a> ensures that Kingdom Come Deliverance II protagonist Henry doesn't have to wash as often, while <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Jump Stamina</a> removes any stamina costs associated with jumping. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Stamina</a> by MagusTheMagician increases stamina regeneration for both Henry and his horse.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Helmet Vision at 75% opacity</figcaption></figure>
<p>JustAnOrdinaryGuy also released several useful mods, such as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/93" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Helmet Vision</a>, which either outright removes helmet vision or optionally makes it more bearable. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/83" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Smithing</a> makes it easier to craft weapons by eliminating quality loss and reducing the amount of hammering required, while <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/68" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Sharpening</a> expands the ideal angle when sharpening your weapon on a grindstone. Lastly, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/73" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richer Merchants</a> increases the wealth of NPC merchants, ensuring they've got money to purchase the stuff you're selling.</p>
<p>So far, there's not much on the technical front when it comes to Kingdom Come Deliverance II mods, except for the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cutscene FPS Unlocker</a>. However, that will undoubtedly change over time, and we'll make sure to cover any major graphics or performance mod.</p>

There are no new products, but a new way for players can obtain and enjoy the miniatures of the officially licensed skirmish game. The entire game's range will be available to 3D print.</p>

<h2>The <em>Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms</em> 3D Print Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius announced that the complete range of Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms will be available as digital 3D print-at-home and print-on-demand releases.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-call-to-arms-dragon-priest.jpg?itok=T01LgYcr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-call-to-arms-dragon-priest.jpg?itok=uGgxiBQ_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first four Chapters of the game will be re-released as pre-supported STL print-at-home sets. Buy the set, feed them into your (or a friend's) 3D printer, and create as many miniatures as needed for your game.</p>

<p>For those who want print-on-demand for <em>Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms</em>, that will happen as part of a FronTier campaign on MyMiniFactory. The first campaign will go live on March 5, 2025. This will cover the first Chapter of the game alongside existing add-ons of existing core sets and terrain. Another campaign will follow six months afterwards covering the next chapter.</p>

<p>Those who sign up early for this campaign will receive an extra: An STL file of a Dragon Priest miniature at no additional cost. You can even take part in a painting contest. Whoever has the best-painted priest will receive Modiphius vouchers for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-tv-show-miniatures-announced-by-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em> </a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-elder-scrolls-call-to-arms-dawnguard-sets" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Elder Scrolls</em></a>-related minis, a 3D printer, and two Thin Coats paints.</p>

<p>For those concerned this means the end of active support, Modiphius isn't done with this game yet. All prior releases, including the recent Two-Player Starter Set, are still going to retail stores. This includes Chapter 5 of the game and the recent Tales of Tamriel rules, which introduced settlement building and warband progression.</p>

<p>In addition, the game's core rulebook has been updated with streamlined rules and updated errata. The updated core rulebook is available for free in print and PDF format.</p>

<p>Iron Galaxy Studios—known for Rumbleverse and bringing The Last of Us to PC—has let go of 66 employees in what the company has called a “last resort”.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7292952527195516929/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, the studio says that it has been “making sacrifices” in order to keep its team together. Unfortunately, those efforts haven’t been able to keep things sustainable leading to the moves being made.</p>



<p>“It has been our hope that we could emerge from this long winter alongside all the teammates who have come to work with us over the years,” they said. “Today, we’re making the unfortunate announcement that we have run out of room to maneuver amidst this slow recovery.</p>



<p>“Today, Iron Galaxy is parting ways with some of our developers and support staff. In total, we have reduced our employee base by 66 people. This was a means of last resort for us. It’s a measure we do not take lightly to enable our long-term survival.”</p>



<p>The latest employment numbers put Iron Galaxy Studios at <a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/company/iron-galaxy-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">270 employees</a>. The 66 employees account for nearly 25% of the companies workforce. </p>



<p>The studio says it’s still “committed to serving” its partners in game development. They are also going to look for “new ways to support” the industry.</p>



<p>“At this moment, our focus is on our teammates who have begun a journey toward their next role,” they added. “We thank them for working with us. We’ll be doing everything we can to support them in the search for the next phase of their careers.:</p>



<p>What do you think of Iron Galaxy Studios letting go of 66 people to try and keep the company moving forward? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> will look to reward players for positive social behavior in the future, according to Blizzard. It's just one of several new community-focused features the team is looking at implementing as part of a new initiative within the WoW development team.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24174878" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> reflecting on WoW's last year and the year ahead, executive producer Holly Longdale revealed the team is "doubling down" on the social elements of the longrunning MMORPG by forming a new Social initiative that will work on new social features or come up with solutions to community-related problems.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"You are what brings Azeroth to life, and you make our game truly unique," Longdale said. "To properly commit to this fundamental aspect of World of Warcraft, we now have a dedicated Social initiative within our development team."</p><p dir="ltr">Longdale cites a number of projects and solutions the initiative is currently working on, including making it easier to connect with "like-minded players," more tools for role-playing, and "rewards for positive behavior." The team is additionally looking at making improvements to the in-game friends list, better integration for social media platforms (something <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-shutting-down-wow-in-game-twitter-integration/1100-6511314/" data-ref-id="1100-6511314">WoW once had</a>), and updates to the in-game Group Finder.</p><p dir="ltr">"The team is working on Social projects now that we hope to be able to share more about over the next year," Longdale said.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog is light on details, but from the examples given, it's easy to see the potential. Every WoW player has had bad experiences in a dungeon group where one jerk ruins the entire run, so a way to better incentivize players to play nicely with one another seems like a positive solution.</p><p dir="ltr">News that Blizzard will officially be supporting roleplaying (RP) is also exciting. Though WoW does have a vibrant RP community, it's not something Blizzard has ever done much (or anything) to build features for or support, seemingly content to let the community just do its thing. In an interview with GameSpot for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">WoW's 20th anniversary</a>, Longdale said serving the RP community was an area where Blizzard could "absolutely do better." She said the team was recently inspired by the documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-remarkable-life-of-ibelin-review-the-real-warcraft-movie/1900-6418311/" data-ref-id="1900-6418311">The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</a>, much of which is an animated film using WoW's engine, to look for ways it could add more lifelike interactions into the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing will be coming as part of WoW's Midnight expansion</a>, and a glimpse at how the feature might be implemented in the form of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-not-quite-player-housing-but-wow-players-can-earn-an-apartment-soon/1100-6528953/" data-ref-id="1100-6528953">in-game apartment</a> that is coming as part of the game's next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">goblin-themed update</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Sims franchise just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/as-the-sims-turns-25-ea-wants-to-embrace-the-series-past/2900-6185/">celebrated its 25th anniversary</a>, and the festivities included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-1-and-2-are-now-available-on-pc-every-expansion-included/1100-6529140/">legacy editions of The Sims and The Sims 2</a>, along with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-25th-anniversary-celebration-features-free-content-in-game-events-and-a-25-hour-stream/1100-6528814/">announcement of several new DLCs</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a>. Acknowledging the series' past while looking toward its future certainly sounds like the right way to honor a franchise that has been around for a quarter of a century, but EA has hit a few snags along the way. The Sims 1 and 2 re-releases launched with some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-and-sims-2-legacy-editions-are-full-of-bugs-according-to-players/1100-6529205/">pretty serious bugs</a>, and with over 70 expansions, not everyone agrees that more DLC is what The Sims 4 really needs.</p><p dir="ltr">The Sims 4 has been around for nearly half the franchise's lifetime, celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2024. But as EA continues to provide glimpses of what the future holds for The Sims 4 and the franchise overall--including the mysterious, still-in-development Project Rene--long-time Sims fans are beginning to feel a hint of deja vu. For those who witnessed The Sims 4's extremely rocky launch, Project Rene feels like Groundhog Day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439314-grim.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439314" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439314-grim.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439314"></a><figcaption>The Sims 4 wasn't quite dead on arrival, but its launch was definitely a rocky one.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439314-grim.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When The Sims 4 launched in September 2014, it was in pretty rough condition. GameSpot gave it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-sims-4-review/1900-6415867/">a middling 6/10</a>, noting the game's lack of depth and, perhaps most glaringly, its lack of features. Sims themselves arguably looked better than ever, but some players were surprised that EA had taken the art style in a more cartoonish direction than previous iterations of the game. But what really had long-time Simmers simmering with anger was the fact that gameplay itself had seemingly been gutted. Prior to The Sims 4, each iteration of the game had included whatever new features were introduced in the last game. Removing a feature--especially one as popular as the ability to choose custom colors and textures--was unheard of.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, there were new features. Create-A-Sim--referred to by players as CAS--now included the ability to customize a Sim's face by clicking and dragging facial features themselves, giving players much more control over a Sim's bone structure. But features like eyelashes and fingernails (which had been present in The Sims 3) were absent when the game launched, and hairstyles (especially those intended for non-white Sims) were extremely limited.</p><p dir="ltr">Another glaring issue was the absence of any option to customize a clothing item's color or texture. This feature was introduced in The Sims 3 and became pivotal to The Sims experience. Its absence from The Sims 4 meant that if players didn't like the handful of color swatches available for a given clothing item, there was nothing they could do about it. Creating matching outfits was therefore a huge challenge, as even color swatches that were meant to be identical often differed from each other in-game. The Sims 4 included 24 hair colors, a large step back from the any-shade-you-want color-picker players had access to in The Sims 3.</p><p dir="ltr">EA claims that a color wheel for custom Sim hair colors would be impossible to implement in The Sims 4, but it's worth noting that Sim-cats, Sim-dogs, and Sim-horses can be any color a player's heart desires. Players can even design the pattern of their pet's coat. Somehow, turning a Sim-cat into a multicolored Lisa Frank-esque monstrosity is baked into the game's DNA, but customizing a Sim's hair color is an engineering problem <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/tmmpty/sims_4_claimed_a_color_wheel_would_mess_up_the/" rel="nofollow ">EA says it doesn't have the resources to solve</a>. The ability to tweak the lightness and darkness of the 24 default hair shades was recently implemented, but the game still lacks any ability to truly create custom hair colors, let alone the multicolored custom paintjobs Sim-pets have access to.</p><p dir="ltr">Customization woes followed the game into Build Mode and Buy Mode as well. The Sims 4's Build Mode was easily the best the franchise had ever seen, with powerful tools that gave players more control than ever over their Sims' homes, but those tools were hampered by the lack of a texture selector and color picker. The same color-matching issues found in CAS were also present in the game's furniture, flooring, walls, and roofs, making home decoration just as painful as Sim creation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439315-terriblemap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439315" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439315-terriblemap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439315"></a><figcaption>The Sims 4 launched with neighborhood maps so flat some players thought they'd been left in the game by accident.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439315-terriblemap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Live Mode--the game's main mode, in which Sims live out their lives in the outfits and homes players have created for them--also felt anemic. The moodlets and memories of The Sims 3 had been replaced with dynamic emotions that could turn on a dime simply due to the way a room was decorated. Despite being popular features of previous Sims games, things like vehicles and pools were inexplicably absent from The Sims 4. Even the toddler life stage was missing--after spending a few days as a baby, Sims would just morph into a roughly 9-year-old child and start attending school. The game's once-vibrant open-world neighborhoods were replaced with a map so empty players initially thought it was leftover placeholder art that devs had forgotten to remove from the final release, and players encountered long loading screens any time a Sim wanted to explore further than their own doorstep. Even the game's pre-made houses had issues--stairs led directly into walls, bathrooms had no toilets, and the impressive premade builds found in previous Sims games were notably absent.</p><p dir="ltr">The launch of The Sims 4 left players who had grown fond of the franchise wondering, "How did this happen?" It felt as though EA had plucked out the game's most charming, useful features, and the question on most players' minds was, "Why?"</p><p dir="ltr">The answer to that question was Project Olympus.</p><p dir="ltr">Back in 2002--fresh off the success of The Sims' initial launch--EA released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-sims-online-review/1900-2908060/">The Sims Online</a>: an MMO version of The Sims in which players could take their Sims into various chat rooms, dress them up, and make friends. The main issue The Sims Online faced was the fact that in 2002, the average America Online subscriber's internet connection could barely handle a trip to the official Sims website, let alone maintain a sustained connection with other players. The Sims Online shut down in 2008, having done little to justify its budget, which was <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/will-sims-online-alter-gaming-world/">estimated to be over $25 million</a>, but EA felt there was still potential in an MMO Sims game. The Sims Online sold roughly 2 million copies in its lifetime--it wasn't a failure, it was just ahead of its time.</p><p dir="ltr">So the same year The Sims Online servers went offline for good, The Sims 4 entered production as Project Olympus. Olympus was envisioned as--you guessed it--an online, MMO-style Sims experience. From 2008 to roughly 2013, The Sims 4 was developed as an MMO meant to run on mobile devices and PC. One mistake EA wanted to avoid repeating was creating a game that struggled to run on the average Simmer's PC. As much as players loved The Sims 3, it put a lot of strain on most PCs, and crashes were common. Thus, The Sims 4 was stripped of various features--most notably its open-world neighborhoods and color/texture customization options--in order to ensure it could run on just about any machine.</p><p dir="ltr">But in 2013, with just a year of development time left on the clock, EA decided to change course. The Sims 4 would not, in fact, be an always-online MMO. It would be the next iteration of The Sims, with all the features players had come to know and love. (Well, some of them, anyway.)</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard to say exactly why EA decided to reroute its course at the last moment, but one popular theory is that the rocky launch of 2013's SimCity gave EA cold feet. 2013's SimCity could not be played or saved without an internet connection, even for those wanting to play solo. Server issues and other bugs only bogged the game down more, and the game's reception was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/simcity-review-a-real-mayor-s-perspective/1900-6415554/">generally negative</a>. EA apologized for the way the game launched, but said that creating an offline mode for the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-simcity-offline-mode-didnt-fit-with-our-vision/1100-6405424/">didn't fit their vision</a> and was an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140308065331/http://www.geekshut.com/simcity-to-not-go-offline-any-time-soon/9045" rel="nofollow ">intensive undertaking that simply couldn't be managed</a>. Meanwhile, players quickly found that modifying a single line of code <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modders-find-way-to-play-simcity-offline/1100-6405296/">made offline play instantly accessible</a>. EA would eventually release an offline mode as a part of SimCity 2013's 10th update.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439316-simssocial.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439316" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439316-simssocial.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439316"></a><figcaption>Leaked images from The Sims 4's website showed a toolbar with icons for a user profile, DMs, IMs, a friends list, and other social MMO features.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439316-simssocial.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the wake of the SimCity debacle, EA opted for a 180-degree turn. The Sims 4's launch was pushed back from March 2014 to September 2014, while the dev team worked to turn the streamlined MMO back into something players would recognize as a mainline Sims game. But developers just didn't have enough time to pull this off, and the end result was a game that felt distinctly hollow.</p><p dir="ltr">In the years after its launch, The Sims 4 was slowly improved. Free updates to the base game reintroduced toddlers, pools, and more hairstyles, though cars and texture/color customization options still remain absent. As for the game's lack of furniture and clothing variety, EA's solution seems to be "release as much DLC as humanly possible." While The Sims 2 and The Sims 3 each had a total of 20 expansions and DLC packs, The Sims 4 alone has over 70 DLC packs, which, if bought separately, cost over $1,600.</p><p dir="ltr">This much DLC has led to another problem: recurrent bugs. Each time the game is updated, a plethora of bugs seem to rise to the surface, and until very recently, they weren't fixed quickly. The launch of the Get To Work expansion pack reintroduced Alien-Sims to the franchise, but a bug that caused their faces to warp when they move into a new life stage was left unaddressed for years. The My Wedding Stories pack completely broke the game's wedding mechanic, leaving players with no choice but to disable the pack if they wanted their Sims to experience bug-free nuptials. (This issue was addressed by EA in 2024, two years after My Wedding Stories launched.) The Eco Lifestyle pack and Laundry Day pack both launched with a multitude of issues, and for years, it felt as though fixing The Sims 4 was the last thing on EA's to-do list.</p><p dir="ltr">But in 2024, things changed. EA released several free updates that added new content to the base game, and addressed a number of long-term issues, including the bug that made wedding guests sit down in the middle of the aisle and generally just refuse to cooperate while Sims were trying to get married. Missing features from The Sims 3--like eyelashes and manicures--were finally implemented. Most notably, EA released two expansions that really seemed to embrace the series' wacky, off-the-wall roots: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-lovestruck-is-more-than-just-a-lot-of-dirty-talk-but-its-cool-that-it-has-that-too/1100-6525164/">Lovestruck</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sims-4-life-death-expansion-lets-you-reap-souls-plan-funerals-and-unmask-the-grim-reaper/1100-6526893/">Life &amp; Death</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439319-lovestruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439319-lovestruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439319"></a><figcaption>The Lovestruck expansion added some desperately needed depth to Sim romances.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439319-lovestruck.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to the iconic vibrating heart bed first seen in 2001's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-sims-hot-date-review/1900-2825792/">Hot Date</a> expansion pack, Lovestruck also introduced jealousy settings and polyamory. In previous Sims titles, a cheating spouse could be easily caught, and Sims did not respond well to being cheated on. In The Sims 4, a Sim's partner needs to be close by--like, uncomfortably close by--to even notice that their spouse is being unfaithful. The Lovestruck expansion allows players to set the tone for Sim relationships. Some Sims may not be happy to find their beau in bed with the maid, while others might offer them a high-five. Some Sim-couples may have an excellent relationship, while others may be distrustful of one another. Lovestruck added some much-needed depth to the way Sims interact with each other, and while some players may feel it's too little too late, others are just happy to see the game improve.</p><p dir="ltr">2024's Life &amp; Death expansion also served as a ray of hope for jaded Simmers. Life &amp; Death implemented a touch of much-missed morbid mischief that the squeaky-clean Sims 4 desperately needed. Despite being rated T for Teen, The Sims 4 has an overly safe, distinctly Disney-esque feel to it. But the Life &amp; Death expansion allows players to work for the Grim Reaper, adds a number of ghoulish new ways for Sims to kick the bucket, and allows Ghost-Sims to live interesting, enriching, occasionally hilarious lives.</p><p dir="ltr">It would seem that The Sims 4 got its fairytale ending just in time for the series' 25th anniversary, but a closer look reveals that rather than finally righting the ship, EA appears to once again be chasing its elusive white whale: an online Sims experience that, frankly, nobody asked for. For years, fans of the franchise who became frustrated with The Sims 4 have been anxiously awaiting any news about The Sims 5. For these players, nothing can truly get the franchise where it needs to be like a fresh start. Unfortunately, it seems that The Sims 5 is no longer in the cards. Instead, Project Rene--an online, MMO-style game that's just as much about socialization and connection as it is about creating and playing with Sims--is next on the agenda. Sound familiar?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439317-projectrene.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439317" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439317-projectrene.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439317"></a><figcaption>On the bright side, screenshots from a 2022 Project Rene playtest do show texture and color customization options.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4439317-projectrene.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We've only seen a <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims" rel="nofollow ">glimpse of Project Rene</a> so far, so it's hard to judge it. But given EA's previous struggles to turn The Sims into an MMO, some fans of the franchise are skeptical--especially those who have been around since the days of The Sims Online. Although a screenshot from a Project Rene playtest showing texture/color customization options similar to The Sims 3 has offered a ray of hope, it's hard not to feel like EA has fundamentally misunderstood what Simmers really want. The implementation of recent features like login rewards underscores this misunderstanding--any Simmer will tell you that The Sims isn't a game you play every single day forever. Like Animal Crossing, it's a set-your-own-pace sort of game that you frantically play every single day for a week after deciding you need to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/i-recreated-twilight-in-the-sims-4-and-everyone-died/2900-4176/">recreate the Twilight trilogy in Sim-form</a>. Then you forget about it for a few months until the latest expansion pack (or a stray creative urge) sucks you back in. Trying to copy and paste Roblox's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_to_Impress_(video_game)" rel="nofollow ">Dress To Impress</a> into The Sims likely won't go over well unless Project Rene also launches with a traditional offline mode alongside its social MMO mode.</p><p>When original The Sims creator Will Wright first pitched the game, he wanted to call it "Dollhouse." After all, that's what The Sims effectively is: a digital dollhouse, full of potential stories to tell and lives to live out. Ultimately, Maxis and EA decided on "The Sims," for fear that "Dollhouse" was too feminine, and might be off-putting to male players. 25 years later, it's abundantly clear that the franchise is a hit with players of all genders, but it's concerning that after a quarter of a century, EA is still trying to make its Sims MMO dream a reality, seemingly oblivious to the fact the majority of Sims players ultimately want one thing: to be left alone to play with their dolls.</p>
