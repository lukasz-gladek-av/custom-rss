            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">on December 17, 2025</a>, Splitgate developer <strong>1047 Games</strong> relaunched Splitgate 2 as <strong>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</strong>. The new title is meant to signify a fusion of the best of the first game and its maligned sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">after Splitgate 2's initial launch went terribly</a>, and 1047 Games co-founder <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">promised to "<em>make FPS great again</em>."</a></p>



<p>If you didn't know that Splitgate 2 had relaunched under its new moniker, or that it had relaunched at all, then don't worry; you're not alone. Arena Reloaded doesn't seem to have fared any better than Splitgate 2, at least according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max">its concurrent player numbers on SteamDB</a>. The game <strong>currently struggles to hit 1k concurrent players,</strong> and two days after some publications reported on those poor numbers, 1047 Games has taken it upon itself to respond.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982">In a statement posted to its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, the caption reads, "<em>1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations</em>," almost like it was trying to write a headline for publications to use. The statement goes on to begin with, "<em>Steam Charts don't measure fun</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment. They don't show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible. To our amazing community: thank you. Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day. And to everyone who hasn't</em> <em>played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay's the best it's ever been, and we'd love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The thing is, 1047 Games is absolutely right. It's not the best thing to get stuck in the weeds of SteamDB numbers when it comes to multi-platform games. Those numbers are only showing one platform, and we can't even take it as a proper read of PC players because Arena Reloaded is also available on the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Console platforms like PlayStation and Xbox don't share concurrent player numbers, so we can't really know how popular the game is outside of Steam. And SteamDB charts are only ever worth keeping an eye on when it comes to multiplayer games; they absolutely do not matter for single-player titles. </p>



<p>With all that said, if 1047 Games felt the need to make a statement like this, that can't be a sign that things are actually going fine internally when the team looks at its player numbers. If its numbers on Steam were low, but on consoles, it has thousands or even hundreds of thousands of players each day, then why care about chatter surrounding a platform that isn't the one your community is on? Some games are more popular on PC, while others are more popular on consoles.</p>



<p>So yes, SteamDB charts are never the full picture and anyone claiming that Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is dead in the water based solely on those numbers doesn't have all of the facts. But making a statement like this two days after initial reports of the low numbers seems more like an attempt to keep Splitgate in the news as much as possible, hoping more people will remember that it exists and give it a chance.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, of course, but if Splitgate: Arena Reloaded's concurrent player numbers on Steam are an accurate representation of how unpopular the game currently is, and the dire straits it is in, then that also feels like the exact kind of thing you would do if you were desperate for anyone to play your game.</p>



<p>Let us know below if we've got the situation completely wrong, and you're playing Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on your console or PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Japanese company Hitachi has announced a new voice command software protocol for the Switch 2, and I, for one, am daring to hope it could be used to finally bring old DS games to the system.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hitachi-launches-multilingual-intuitive-voice-command-recognition-software-for-nintendo-switch-2-game-devs/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, the Ruby Spotter software allows developers to incorporate voice command features beyond simply using the microphone for communication. It's actually already available in a number of other places, including "car navigation systems" and "industrial equipment", according to Automaton.</p><p>Hitachi's decision to bring the software to the Switch 2 is driven by a desire to create an environment for developers to include "highly flexible operations" for the microphone in their games, including menu selections and issuing in-game commands.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>New voice command options will soon be available to Nintendo Switch 2 developers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The possibilities are endless; developers could use Hitachi's Ruby Spotter software to allow you to issue commands to troops in a strategy game, for instance, or to communicate with an in-game character, <em>Nintendogs</em>-style.</p><p>That might as well bring us onto what I really hope this software can be used for: porting DS games to the Switch 2. Since there's already a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-klonoa-mr-driller" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="201c59bf-eb51-4121-bbf8-ae2b52eff44c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">robust library</a> of Game Boy Advance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40d7514b-1ab5-4518-bcb1-2874c7dd70bf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the Switch Online service, I think the debut of DS titles is way past due.</p><p>Games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass </em>and the aforementioned <em>Nintendogs </em>used the Nintendo DS' microphone as part of their gameplay, and Hitachi's Ruby Spotter could allow Nintendo to bring those games (which are otherwise unavailable) to the Switch 2.</p><p>As it stands, there are tons of DS games, including the ones I've mentioned, that you'll need to turn to the second-hand market to enjoy, and so this would seem like the perfect opportunity to port them to modern systems. Come on, Nintendo. You know it makes sense.</p><figure role="group">

            <p>Right, get ready for some chatter about where the contents of our collective wallets have gone over the past year. Valve's list of the highest-grossing games on Steam in 2025 has emerged from the great mists, and in a nice revelation, features a larger number of fresh releases than last year's ranking. That's alongside all of the moderately to quite old stuff which more folks keep hopping on the train of with every passing 12 month period. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025?tab=2">data</a>'s been dissected, shared, and otherwise <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18eg0P-P-swZ8v6kWyA4XkJpIEhr7UZospSWqJMEmDK4/edit?gid=0#gid=0">spreadsheeted</a> by <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-steams-best-of-2025-revenue">GameDiscoverCo</a> in their latest newsletter. The big news is that of the top 100 highest grossers, 31 were new games - that meaning games released in 2025 or 2024 in this case. Fresh games made up 24 of the 100 spots in last year's version of this ranking, so things have trended marginally newer.</p>
<p>"It’s possible that 2025 was just a super-strong year for new games," GameDiscoverCo boffin Simon Carless wrote of potential explanations for this shift. "It’s also possible that with more and more ‘catalog games’ being sold cheaply on discount, sorting by revenue will favour $60 newcomers &amp; viral hits (vs. games at 25-50% of the price that still do good ‘long tail’.) It’s probably...a combo of these things?"</p>
<p>As for the new games which made the cut, Valve split these rankings into four tiers of moneyness - platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. Platinum's the top ranking, with seven of its 12 this year meeting the new game requirements. Those were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>, plus viral hits Schedule 1 and REPO. There's also Call of Duty, which technically counts as new thanks to Activision's switch to dishing out its latest shootering via an app. The remaining four platinumers are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, all of which have shot their way to defending the honour of the non-brand new games.</p><p>Moving down to gold tier, you find newbies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a>. They're hanging out with a number of other well-established big hitters - your Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur's Gate 3. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> are also in that club, proving their staying power. The tier below that, silver is home to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, while Hades 2's nestled in bronze. Taking a glance at the list of most played Steam Deck games, both Silksong and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> have vaulted straight into the platinum section this year.</p>
<p>As Carless eludes to, pinning down exactly what's caused this year's shifts is complicated, but the wider trend at least appears to suggest the continued strangulation of folks' ability to spend on new games without worrying they might suddenly need that money because they've been laid off isn't pushing things even more starkly away from newer games which're usually more pricey than their older brethren.</p>
<p>Then again, the fact Steam's free of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a> - two perennial stalwarts of lists like these for other platforms - is probably helping make that sunny assessment easier to reach.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon’s Promo Card For Its Natural History Museum Collab Could Scare Off Scalpers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-natural-history-museum-pikachu-card-scalper-2000657713</link>
            <guid>1399387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After the destructive shitstorm that happened when </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131"><span>collaborated with Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum</span></a><span> in 2023, I’m surprised any esteemed establishment wants to partner with Pikachu and friends. Videos of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers pulling a Black Friday-level raid</span></a><span> on the museum’s store are still lodged in my brain, and when I heard the Natural History Museum in London was going to have a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>exhibit later this month, I started bracing myself for a repeat. It may still happen, but now that The Pokémon Company and the museum have </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-natural-history-presents-pokecology"><span>announced the card</span></a><span> they’ll be giving out at the event, some fans are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1q6bqwn/new_natural_history_museum_promo_for_the/"><span>letting out a sigh of optimistic relief</span></a><span> that scalpers might leave the whole thing alone.</span></p> <p><span>The “Pikachu at the Museum” promo card is super cute, and shows the little yellow guy excitedly walking through a museum adorned with what look like fossils of Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum. At a glance, it doesn’t look like a great card for competitive play, with reasonably low stats and good but not great damage output for the amount of energy cards you’ll have to feed into it, but none of that actually matters because this card won’t be used in a deck. It’s a jumbo card, not suitable for use in a playable deck or, perhaps more notably, for placement into a collector’s binder.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657715" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657715"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657715">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is significant because jumbo cards tend to go under scalpers’ radars, specifically because they’re often harder to sell. Though its rarity may still bring in vultures, fans are hopeful this choice will take the wind out of resellers’ sails. On top of this, the card will be available at select UK retailers on January 30, so if scalpers want it that badly, they might have better luck bothering a store than a museum.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love how their scalping prevention is ‘let’s make it a jumbo, nobody cares about jumbos,’” ZVAARI wrote on Reddit. “Hope someone makes a nice normal sized reproduction of it, the art is cool and I’d like to have it in my binder.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Its both a shame it’s oversized (won’t fit in my collection nicely), but also will hopefully prevent too much hype,” PlopTheOwl wrote in the same thread. “Love the art. Would have liked it to be a full art, but honestly so pleased to see some Pokémon bones like in-game Pokémon museums.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657714"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657714">© The Pok<span>émon Company</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>After this announcement, I’m more concerned the collab’s exclusive merchandise might be targeted by scalpers, rather than the card itself. The museum will also be selling an exclusive collection of art, stationery, clothes, collectibles, and a Pikachu plush showing him hugging a miniature museum. These will also be sold online at the UK Pokémon Center shop and the museum’s online store. If nothing else, it seems the museum and Pokémon Company are trying to avoid a second Van Gogh debacle, but we’ll see if these safeguards actually amount to anything, as scalpers still find a way to ruin anything with Pikachu’s face on it. If nothing else, I hope the fans who show up to see the exhibit are able to have a good time without being trampled by someone looking to flip the merchandise.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>x Natural History Museum event will last from January 26 to April 19.</span></p>

              <p>Tired of running out of screen real estate when working on your laptop? The ASUS ZenScreen 16″ (viewable 15.6″) is a mobile monitor that can give your laptop or tablet the feel of a complete desktop wherever you go. It adds extra screen space for work, school and play, without having to carry a large additional display. And best of all, it can make working with multiple windows much more comfortable at home, at the office, or on the go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6687/">You can find the ASUS ZenScreen 16″ (viewable 15.6″) at Amazon for the low price of $119, which is a $30 savings off of the original price of $149</a>. This is an excellent opportunity to save money on this product, since it’s been discounted 20%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6687/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An additional portable monitor to give you more space</h2>
<p>This 15.6-inch viewable display is large enough to be used as a true secondary monitor. That means you can keep email, chat, or reference documentation open on one window while you are working on the primary window. For example, this would be ideal for students researching papers, professionals managing spreadsheets and taking phone calls, or anyone that likes to keep streaming video and/or social media feeds open while they work. The text appears clear, and the widescreen format works well for having multiple windows side-by-side.</p>
<p>The ASUS ZenScreen 16″ is also extremely portable. The monitor is very thin and lightweight, making it easy to fit into a backpack or laptop case without being too bulky. Whether you’re traveling a lot or you just want to give yourself more room to work, game, or browse online, ou can’t do much better than this.</p>



<p>Setting up the ASUS ZenScreen 16″ is also easy. Just connect it with a single USB-C cable that provides both power and video in minutes. That means you don’t actually need any additional power bricks and cables. And who wants to figure out a place to put all of those, anyway? This results in a clean workspace and allows for easy movement between locations. Mostly, that means you might actually use it instead of tossing it in the closet.</p>
<p>Tech can be prohibitively expensive in some categories these days, and it can be hard to find deals on things you want to add to your stack. An extra monitor can be expensive, but this deal makes it relatively painless to spend.</p>
<p>This portable monitor might just change the way you get things done online. It can help, first and foremost, make your digital life seem less cluttered. Whether you’re creating graphics and placing tool palettes to the sides, keeping notes open during online classes, or monitoring chat windows while gaming, the additional screen will make a difference. All you have to do is make sure to grab it while it’s discounted.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is an online multiplayer extraction shooter that features PvE as well as PvP systems. You can run in and shoot NPC enemies or, if you're feeling particularly violent, you can blast player-controlled characters. But for developer Embark Studios, the latter isn't really the point of the game, so don't expect more PvP systems in the future.</p><p>In <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an interview</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video playthrough</a> with GamesBeat on December 30 (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-mechanics-like-leaderboards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund explained that the team isn't planning on adding anything like PvP leaderboards because the PvP environment merely creates tension in the game. It isn't the bedrock on which the rest of the game was built.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Arc Raiders Solo Experience Changed My Brain</p>
      </div>
<p>"We've had several discussions about Nemesis systems and all types of things," he said. "I don't know where the team [is] on them right now. I think one of the beauties of this game is the fact that we don't have those leaderboards, and it's not competitive. We don't want to necessarily foster that type of gameplay. The game isn't about shooting other players. You can do that if you want to, but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players. It's a part that we use to craft tension."</p><p>There's a risk-reward system at play when you embark in Arc Raiders, as you make calculated assessments on the situations around you. Söderlund said that, in one iteration of the game, other players weren't visible, but bringing them in and making the game an online multiplayer environment further enhanced that tension as you determined the risks you're willing to take.</p><p>"The game was without other players for a long time," Söderlund said. "And yes, there were instances where the game was fun, and there were areas where it worked quite well. But also, the minute you added other players and then use subtle ways of signaling--you don't know how many players are on the server, you don't know how many players have died, you don't know how many players are around you--but we signal to you that there are other players. You hear them shooting. That's why audio is a very important part of this game. You hear them encountering Arc and other players. You see the raider flares as they go down. At one point--it was funny--I came back into a playtest, and the raider flares were gone. I'm like, 'Why did you remove those?' And they're like, 'Well, well…' So I just said, 'Just bring them back.' They're such an iconic part of this game."</p><p>This tension, as well as the myriad players you could encounter as you shot your way through Arc Raiders, made the game feel alive and populated in a way that was missing during developmental playtests. Söderlund once again emphasized that tension, but said that other players were only one part of the equation. The sound, the enemies, the world--these make up the rest of it.</p><p>Speaking of tension, Arc Raiders is fielding some intense pressure lately. The game has come under fire for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">using AI for things like voice lines</a>, with Embark Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">defending the technology</a>, saying it's beneficial for developers and players. Still, the game continues to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">a huge success for the Swedish studio</a>, so much so that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-received-movie-and-tv-offers/1100-6537191/" data-ref-id="1100-6537191">Embark Studios has received movie and TV offers</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-jan-2026-amazon-prime-2000657707</link>
            <guid>1399354</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Epic Games Store’s holiday giveaways are over but it’s getting 2026 started with another batch of very good freebies. That’s on top of a bunch of free games Amazon is giving away for paid Prime subscribers.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/total-war-three-kingdoms-the-kotaku-review-1834993637"><em>Total War: Three</em> Kingdoms</a>, normally $60, is the Epic Games Store’s first big free game of the year, which anyone can go and claim just by logging into the PC <em>Fortnite</em> launcher. The sprawling strategy game is one of the <em>Total War</em> franchise’s best and will cover you for the rest of the month and beyond if you’ve never played it before. It also won’t break your PC in terms of specs, with only a GTX 650 equivalent needed to get the game running.</p> <p>The other freebie right now is <em>Wildgate</em>, the sci-fi PvPvE multiplayer shooter from ex-Blizzard developers. The idea of <em>Sea of Thieves</em> in space with Moba elements is neat, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The player counts have gotten low on Steam, so if you want to check out what this one’s all about before it’s potentially put on ice, now’s the time. Both<em> Wildgate</em> and <em>Three Kingdoms</em> are free through January 8.</p>

 <h2>Prime Gaming free games for January 2026</h2> <p>Amazon also revealed the games that Prime subscribers can claim for free this month, starting with <em>Civilization 6</em>. Here are the rest:</p> <blockquote> <p id="available-now"><strong>Available Now</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Reflections of Life: Dark Architect Collector’s Edition</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-15"><strong>January</strong> <strong>15</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Deathkeep</em></li> <li><em>Brigador: Up-Armored Deluxe</em></li> <li><em>Gunslugs: Rogue Tactics</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-22"><strong>January 22</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Harold Halibut</em></li> <li><em>D&amp;D Stronghold: Kingdom Simulator</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-29"><strong>January 29</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Elderborn</em></li> <li><em>Technotopia</em></li> <li><em>Al-Qadim: The Genie’s Curse</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>Given<em> Civilization 7</em> still isn’t quite where fans want it to be following its launch last year, <em>Civ 6</em> is a great place to start for anyone who’s been away from the 4X series. <em>Brigador: Up-Armored Edition</em> is also an oldie but a goodie. The top-down, twin-stick shooter is like the old J<em>ungle Strike</em> games but for mechs.</p>

              <p>Smartwatches do a lot more than just track your steps and monitor your heart rate. The best options out there are made to help you stay connected, plus on top of your health and fitness levels, right from your wrist.</p>
<p>Google makes some of the best Android smartwatches out there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/">Now is a great time to pick up its latest Pixel Watch 4, as Amazon has dropped it by 22%. This brings the price of this $450 watch down to just $350</a>. The offer applies to all color options, including the black case with obsidian band, the champagne case with lemongrass band, and the silver case with iris band, so there are options to choose from. Those looking for something basic yet classy should consider the black model. And if you want your watch to pop, the lemongrass band is sure to turn some heads!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plethora of Health and Fitness Features</h2>
<p>The smartwatch flaunts a stunning Actua 360 domed display that’s 10% larger and 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3. You will be able to comfortably use it in both a sunny day and a dimly lit room without squinting. The scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass, paired with aerospace-grade aluminum housing, makes Pixel 4 more durable than ever, meaning you won’t have to constantly stress about those accidental scratches and everyday wear that’s almost inevitable. Speaking of durability, the watch is also IP68-rated, which means it can withstand most weather conditions well. Wearing it while walking in the rain or during sweaty workouts won’t affect its functionality one bit.</p>
<p>Fitness-wise, the watch offers over 40 exercise modes to let you track a range of workouts, from early morning stretches to midday cardio and late-night runs. It features custom run plans and even offers real-time guidance with advanced form tracking to help you train better. When it comes to health, Pixel 4 monitors your heart rate, plus tracks your sleep. The latter helps you understand how well you rest at night, and you can then use those insights to improve your sleep quality.</p>



<p>When connected to your phone, the watch helps you view important notifications, take calls, reply to texts, and manage music – all from your wrist. Additionally, the Satellite SOS feature lets you update your loved ones on your whereabouts, even when you’re off the grid. Gemini comes built in, so you will have a smart AI assistant to help you with stuff throughout the day. You can use it to quickly search stuff, brainstorm ideas, get reply suggestions, create schedules, and more; without picking your phone up.</p>
<p>A single charge gets you up to 30 hours of battery life. You can extend it up to 48 hours in Battery Saver mode. That’s more than enough to go a couple of days without worrying about plugging the watch in. Even better, when you’re running low, a quick 15-minute top-up can get you an additional 15 hours of usage. This is great for when you’re in a hurry and don’t have the time to recharge the watch fully.</p>
<p>Note that while the basic health and fitness features are available for free, advanced metrics can be accessed using Fitbit Premium. This membership offers AI-run recommendations based on your goals, deeper insights, and even access to energizing workouts by Peloton instructors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/">There’s plenty more to like about the Google Pixel Watch 4. You can now grab a $100 discount, which applies to all color options</a>. It won’t last long, though, so it’s best to place your orders without wasting time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Last of Us actor recently shared his thoughts on AI, stating that we shouldn’t “demonize” it and that it could help people seek more authentic experiences. </p>



<p>As technology continues to evolve rapidly, the presence of AI is becoming more prominent than ever. It’s impossible to ignore the growing impact of AI across all areas of tech, and we recently saw Sony file a patent for an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-patents-ai-technology-that-can-play-the-game-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI “ghost player”</a> that can basically play a section of the game for you. Now, one of the gaming industry’s prominent members has shared his thoughts on this tech. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-actor-feels-ai-will-make-people-seek-authentic-experiences">The Last of Us Actor Feels AI Will Make People Seek Authentic Experiences </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-troy-baker-could-we" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Business</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/troy-baker-ai-shouldnt-be-demonized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer</a>), The Last of Us actor Troy Baker spoke about AI and its impact on the industry as a whole. Baker first spoke about ” a fundamental premise to making art that people are not remembering right now, and it’s that it requires artists.” People usually look at AI and are amazed by what it can do, but that shouldn’t matter. </p>



<p>Baker adds that people don’t need “don’t need to diminish it, we don’t need to denigrate it, we don’t need to demonize it.” All they need to do is accept its existence while also knowing that their choice as a performer and producer still exists. The Last of Us actor added that AI “there is no doubt that AI can make content way better than humans,” however, the tech “can create content, but it cannot create art” as it “invariably requires the human experience.” </p>



<p>Troy Baker also stated that the growth of AI will drive people to seek more authentic experiences, such as “‘I want to go and watch this person sing this song live.’ ‘I want to see theater’. ‘I want to read books.’ ‘I want to have this first-hand experience as opposed to the gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror”, which is a good thing, “a revolution”. </p>

Paul wore the card and chain during his WWE debut at WrestleMania 38, and again for his bout against Anthony Joshua in Miami last month.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/07/gettyimages-2250850216-1767791039243.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Logan Paul and his $5.3 million Pikachu Illustrator card.

Only 40 copies of the Pikachu Illustrator card were ever manufactured, and given away to winners of a 1998 Japanese fan contest. Of these, only one has been given the unsurpassable PSA 10 quality rating — and it's this card that Paul bought back in 2021 in an exchange for a lower-grade Pikachu Illustrator (valued at $1.275 million) alongside $4 million in cash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the ranks of expensive collectible card game sales, Paul's $5.3 million card stands several million higher than anything else, including a Magic: The Gathering Black Lotus sold in 2024 for $3 million in bitcoin. The only question now is how high this new auction reaches. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cannily, Paul has set the sale to end next month, in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the Pokémon franchise, when excitement around the brand will be at its peak. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-pokmon-fans-expect-a-gen-10-reveal-next-month-fat-pikachu-heralds-30th-anniversary-celebrations">Fans are expecting a major announcement by The Pokémon Company</a>, with new video games and a 10th generation of the franchise's creatures anticipated, alongside more details of the promising-looking Pokémon life simulation spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road is a football game that feels, almost wholeheartedly, like it’s not really about football. This is a sports drama through and through, focusing on the interpersonal relationships, the individual journeys, and the yearning for acceptance that epitomises our teenage years, rather than sporting glory. You play as Destin Bellows, a young man with a heart condition, who appears to hate football and attends South Cirrus Academy, a school where football is banned. None of this really screams the word ‘football’ – or ‘soccer’ if you’re so inclined – and yet, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road also revels in the joy, the purity, and the companionship that football can bring. This juxtaposition also makes it one of the best sports RPGs you’ll find.</p>
<p><iframe title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road – Final Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8MDQRe5b7s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’m a sucker for sports dramas. Maybe it started with The Mighty Ducks, a movie that took a rag-tag team of unlikely players who went from being woeful nobodies to the best team in the league. With Emilio Estevez! While there’s no Young Guns alumni here, there’s that same sense of camaraderie and overcoming adversity throughout Victory Road, starting from incredibly meagre beginnings, before working your way towards rebuilding the school’s football club and setting forth on a path to sporting greatness. It’s the characters that pull you through this drama though, rather than the extraneous bumps in the road, and you’ll quickly embrace Destin and his myriad teammates wholeheartedly.</p>


<p>Level-5 have made this character focus easy, because you won’t be playing football any time soon, at least not in the central story mode. My save file had clocked up an oddly impressive 4 hours before I played my first 5-a-side game against an ageing group of shopkeepers, and I kind of love the investment that’s been built into Victory Road’s narrative. To a certain extent, you won’t care that there’s no football, and when it does arrive, with its quirky stop-and-start gameplay, special moves and occasionally clunky controls, you’ll want to persevere, learn and get a grasp of it so you can lead the team you’ve built to victory. It’s something that wasn’t ably captured in Victory Road’s early beta testing, and it feels a lot more natural within its proper context.</p>


<p>The original Inazuma games were mostly exclusive to Nintendo’s DS and 3DS, using the stylus to move your players around the pitch, and selecting special moves as you went. It was a system that I loved across multiple games, and I was sad to see it go, but Victory Road’s updated take does a good job of replicating and replacing it, with more action and reaction than you needed before.</p>
<p>It’s best to think of Victory Road’s matches as a series of RPG encounters, strung together in quick succession, rather than a football match. Every time your player meets an opposing player, whether you’re playing offence or defence, it begins an encounter. Depending on the player, you’ll have basic options like passing, shooting, or dashing past, but you may also have special moves available to you, each wilder and more unbelievable than the last. That can mean creating clones of yourself to confuse defenders, or unleashing a shot that’s the result of a thousand kicks, but, with the level of variety on offer, it makes matches continually action-packed and exciting. It’s definitely not regular football, but it’s a hell of a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Destin’s tale is easy-going, and occasionally a little slow, but it’s all so amiable, and the characters are so likeable, that I found I didn’t mind all too much. Destin loves to investigate and collect data, so there’s a fair bit of running back and forth, and that’s interspersed with funny turn-based RPG battles/conversations that use rock-paper-scissors mechanics as you try to argue your way to victory. I preferred the original Japanese voices over the English dub, but only marginally so, and if you prefer to play in your native language, it’s perfectly satisfactory.</p>
<p>While the central story mode strings you along without any matches, there’s a secondary story that gets you into the action much quicker. Chronicle Mode brings a time-travelling tale to the Inazuma timeline, sending you back in time to form the ultimate eleven, in the hope of preventing a world-ending apocalypse. Newcomers might raise an eyebrow at first, but returning fans have been here before. Chronicle Mode manages to perform a whole bunch of functions at once: introducing people to the series’ extensive history, getting into the football sections quicker, and bringing an Ultimate Team-like experience to the game to boot. It’s a winning formula, and one that shows how strong the revised gameplay formula is.</p>

<p>Level-5 have given players an absolute avalanche of places to play in Victory Road. From the two story modes, you can then set forth with your created team into a tournament, in either single player, multiplayer or online modes, or there’s another mode where you can play with full-powered historical teams from each of the previous games. If you need a break from all that, you can even create your own Inazuma Bond Town where you can meet up with friends online, filling them with all sorts of decorations, buildings, people, cats or giant statues of Mark Evans. To be fair, it’s probably the weirdest inclusion here, and yet, it feels thoroughly Inazuma.</p>
<p>All of this is wrapped up in a lovely 3D anime aesthetic that ties really well with the traditional cartoon cutscenes. It often feels like you’re playing an interactive cartoon – a fact heightened by the story modes’ many cutscenes, and chapter-by-chapter framing – with Level-5’s design department clearly working at the height of its powers. It definitely bodes extremely well for this year’s Professor Layton and the New World of Steam.</p>

			<p>While heavy hitters like <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/"><strong>Tekken 8</strong></a></em>, and <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> will continue to be updated with new characters and balance changes, which should be even more interesting for the <strong>Bandai Namco</strong> game following series creator Katsuhiro Harada's departure, 2026 will also see the release of some major fighting games. This is set to make it a landmark year for the fighting game community, particularly for those interested in <strong>tag fighting games</strong>.</p>



<p>Luckily, <strong>2026 will also offer plenty to those who prefer traditional 1-versus-1 fighting games</strong> with the launch of a new game based on a successful franchise and a massive overhaul of one of the best fighting games of the current console generation.</p>

<p>If you checked out our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">best fighting games of 2025 list</a></strong>, you may find the inclusion of 2XKO in this list weird. However, there's a good reason why the tag fighter set in the world of League of Legends is also one of the most anticipated fighting games launching in 2026.</p>



<p>After years in development as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Project L</em> and its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC early access release</strong></a>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">2XKO</em> officially launches <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/">its console versions and full Season 1 this January</a></strong>. This free-to-play 2v2 tag-team fighter is built from the ground up to be accessible yet competitive, featuring some deep tag mechanics that provide players with a lot of options and a "Duo Play" mode that allows four players to compete at once. </p>



<p>Launching alongside a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2026 Competitive Series</strong> featuring 20 sanctioned tournaments, Riot is positioning <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2XKO</em></strong> to be the next big pillar of the fighting game community.

<p>While not a "new" game in the traditional sense, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Arc System Works</strong> has confirmed that 2026 will see the launch of<em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/"><strong>Guilty Gear -Strive-</strong></a> Version 2.0</em>, a massive overhaul that will reportedly be rather big.</p>



<p>This substantial shift in gameplay philosophy, as described by producer Ken Miyauchi, will coincide with the start of&nbsp;Season 5,&nbsp;which is expected to introduce additional characters following the addition of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners'</em></strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lucy</strong> to the roster in late 2025.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-steam-deck-docking-station-hits-its-lowest-price-compatible-with-rog-xbox-ally-legion-go-and-more-2000657269</link>
            <guid>1399312</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A few years back, Valve changed the way we think about portable PC gaming with the launch of the Steam Deck. While comparisons to the Nintendo Switch were inevitable, the real game-changer was the ability to play your existing Steam library on a handheld device. That innovation sparked an entirely new category of gaming hardware: PC gaming handhelds. Being able to take full PC games on the go was something gamers could only imagine a decade ago (I’m ignoring laptops for the sake of this argument), and it’s a level of flexibility that’s hard to beat.</p>
<p>Handheld gaming is what the Steam Deck does best, but sometimes a 7.4-inch display just isn’t enough. You might want to kick back on the couch and play on a massive 65-inch TV instead. The Nintendo Switch has made this concept familiar—but can the Steam Deck do the same? With the right dock, absolutely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6686/">One superior option comes from UGREEN, and it’s currently available at a 33% discount</a>. Normally priced at $60, the dock is reduced by $20, bringing the cost down to just $40 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6686/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Extensive Connectivity for Gaming</h2>
<p>The UGREEN docking station lets you connect your Steam Deck to an external monitor or smart TV, supporting 4K output at up to 120Hz. That level of visual performance simply isn’t possible in handheld mode, where the Steam Deck tops out at a 1280 × 800 resolution and up to 90Hz. It’s also worth noting that this dock isn’t limited to the Steam Deck—it’s compatible with other handheld PCs like the Lenovo Legion Go and various versions of the ASUS ROG Ally.</p>
<p>The dock charges your Steam Deck via USB-C using 100W PD fast charging, ensuring your device stays powered while docked. It essentially becomes a home base for your Steam Deck, keeping it fully charged and ready to go whenever you pick it up.</p>



<p>In terms of ports, the dock includes two USB-C and two USB-A ports for wired controllers or accessories, though Bluetooth controllers work just as well. HDMI handles video output, and there’s also a built-in Ethernet port capable of speeds up to 1,000Mbps, making it suitable for stable online play or fast game downloads.</p>
<p>The thoughtful design of the UGREEN dock allows it to fold up for easy storage—ideal for travel. You can game in handheld mode on a flight, then dock the Steam Deck to a TV when you arrive at your hotel or Airbnb. The adjustable viewing angle also allows you to use the Steam Deck in a tabletop-style setup, similar to the Nintendo Switch’s Tabletop Mode, while keeping it charged.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ditched-free-to-play-because-of-helldivers-2/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders CEO reveals that games like Helldivers 2 inspired them to move away from free-to-play to a more traditional model. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ new extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, has cemented itself as one of the top dogs in the multiplayer shooter genre, doing so without pursuing a free-to-play model. The title’s success is apparent, with the game recently hitting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million sales</a> within 2 months of release. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-wanted-to-make-the-game-feel-like-it-s-totally-worth-40-bucks">ARC Raiders Devs Wanted to Make the Game “Feel Like It’s Totally Worth 40 Bucks”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBeat’s Dean Takahashi</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-boss-says-arc-raiders-usd40-price-was-inspired-by-the-likes-of-helldivers-2-wed-rather-make-people-feel-like-its-totally-worth-40-bucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Patrick Söderlund, Embark Studios CEO, revealed why they ditched the free-to-play model for ARC Raiders. Söderlund stated that they “looked at games like Helldivers” and realised that’s the same space they want to be in, rather than releasing a free-to-play game. Söderlund adds that he is unsure whether this was the right or wrong decision, but is happy about the fact that the game is “relatively affordable”. </p>



<p>Söderlund then spoke about how they arrived at $40 as the game’s price point. The dev team knew that the game didn’t have a campaign, so they didn’t want the price to be a “offender for someone”. Therefore, they decided to “rather make people feel like it’s totally worth 40 bucks.” The hope is that players feel that they got value for their money, “given how much time they seem to spend in the game.”</p>







<p>In other news, the CEO of Embark Studios has stated they don’t want to promote PvP because “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceo-the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game isn’t about shooting other players</a>”. Additionally, ARC Raiders&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-tv-show-and-movie-ideas-being-pitched-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV show and movie ideas</a>&nbsp;are being pitched to the developers.

                <p>More than a decade after its last release, Carmageddon is returning with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/carmageddon-rogue-shift/" data-ref-id="5000-705080">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift</a>. Developed by Redout studio 34BigThings, this spin-off casts players as a faceless driver in a world wrecked by war, disasters, and an inconvenient zombie apocalypse triggered by megacorporations.</p><p>Zombies--called the Wasted in this universe--overwhelm humans while players clash in deadly races for power, prestige, and a chance to escape the chaos by catching a rocket off Earth. While this sounds par for the Carmageddon course, the catch here is that Rogue Shift leans heavily into roguelite gameplay. Players drive through randomly generated paths and tackle events to seize upgrade credits, and even if you crash out, permanent bonuses unlocked with beatcoins grant you an edge for your next run.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mFmSbChgC8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each run will require you to carefully plot your destination, as your ride will require repairs along the way. Difficulty also increases dynamically, but finding the right synergies between vehicles, perks, and weapons will help you build the ultimate killing machine that can be used against the Wasted hordes or other drivers roaming the streets.</p><p>34BigThings says there are 13 weapon classes and over 80 perks to choose from, and each of the 15 unlockable vehicles has unique handling characteristics related to their drivetrain, weight, center of mass, suspensions, tire friction, and pressure.</p><p>"We made Carmageddon: Rogue Shift to challenge you in a way that keeps you coming back. Our goal is to get you into that flow, firing-on-all-cylinders flow state we fondly remember from the original Carmageddon games and, more in general, the combat racing games that defined the genre," head of design Giuseppe Enrico Franchi wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/06/carmageddon-rogue-shift-new-gameplay-details-on-the-roguelike-racer/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will launch in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Arc Raiders was one of 2025's biggest success stories in gaming, and it's keeping up the momentum in 2026, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">January 4 becoming the game's biggest day ever in terms of daily users</a>. The game was originally going to be a free-to-play title, but it changed to $40 ahead of launch. Why $40? Embark Studios boss Patrick Soderlund said in an interview that the decision to switch from free to premium came after the team saw the success of Helldivers 2, which was also priced at $40.</p><p>"We basically looked at games like Helldivers and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'" he told <a href="https://youtu.be/vY3u7wOmm4w?si=NXyvhtFgKyZ2B6nb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesBeat</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-arc-raiders-cheaper-than-most-triple-a-games-thanks-to-helldivers-2-mostly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Eurogamer</a>). "We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."</p><p>The executive added that $40 was the right price for Arc Raiders also because it helped the game avoid being an "offender" for players. The game has no campaign and is 100% multiplayer.</p><p>"We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be," he explained.</p><p>Arc Raiders has now reportedly sold more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">12 million copies across all platforms</a>, driving more than $350 million in revenue.</p><p>Arc Raiders and developer Embark are owned by South Korean game giant Nexon. The studio's previous game, The Finals, was not as successful, but it "laid the foundation for Arc Raiders' explosive success," a spokesperson for Nexon told <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10620485#:~:text=Nexon%20said%20the%20game's%20rapid,in%20annual%20sales%20by%202027." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Korea Herald.</a></p><p>Another high-profile game will adopt a $40 price as well, as Bungie will charge that rate for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-release-timing-and-price-announced/1100-6536971/" data-ref-id="1100-6536971">PvPvE shooter Marathon</a> when it launches in March.</p><p>Given the immense success of Arc Raiders, it's unsurprising to learn that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-received-movie-and-tv-offers/1100-6537191/" data-ref-id="1100-6537191">Hollywood has come calling</a>, inquiring about movie or TV show deals. None have materialized as of yet, however.</p><p>Arc Raiders is a big success, but it also has its critics who took issue with the game's use of artificial intelligence systems for its voice lines. Developer Embark <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">recently defended the use of AI</a>, with Soderlund saying, "People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players."</p>

              <p>At the time of writing, just as the United States of Games Players are beginning to wake up,&nbsp;<em>ARC Raiders</em> has 159,483 people playing.&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> has 597,408. Meanwhile, the free <em>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</em> has 556. In fairness, a few hours back, that peaked at 1,070, the best numbers it’s seen since Christmas Day. For a game that only officially (re)launched on December 4, that’s…it’s not good. It’s very, very bad. But developers 1047 Games are trying to put a positive spin on things.</p> <p>The game once known as&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em> has had a self-inflicted rough time. Originally launched June last year, the sequel to 2019’s free-to-play multiplayer shooter was <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-maga-refunds-reboot-beta-season-3-servers-1851786742">then un-launched in July</a> in response to a cacophony of negative reaction, the game’s lack of basic features like leaderboards, and its <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-skin-bundle-prices-call-duty-maga-hat-1851784073">grim microtransaction prices</a>. None of this was helped by 1047’s CEO Ian Proulx <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-trump-hat-summer-game-fest-1851783949">wearing a MAGA-meme hat in a Summer Games Fest</a> set in the middle of LA’s disgraceful ICE raids, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">then trying to milk the impotent controversy for as long as possible</a>.</p>

 <p>After five months away, <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-arena-shooter-beta-1047-games-2000650903">the game was re-released early last month</a>, and you’d be forgiven for not having noticed. While&nbsp;<em>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</em> saw a half-decent 27,000 people show up on Steam soon after its original June 6 launch, that number had plummeted to under 2,000 by the time the game wriggled back into beta July 22. So its relaunch last month to a peak of 2,297 players on PC is <em>catastrophically</em> bad. And that was its peak, meaning the number of people simultaneously playing the game on Steam over the last month is failing to beat the worst of the tail-off from before the game was pulled.</p>

 <p>We must remember, Steam is but one of the ways people can play <em>Splitgate</em>, and doesn’t account for console numbers at all. Of course, an online, free-to-play multiplayer shooter would traditionally tend to find a good portion of its audience on PC, but we don’t have the data to show otherwise. As 1047 puts it in a brief, extremely defensive statement <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982">posted to its official X account</a>, Steam numbers “show one number, on one platform, at one given moment.” Which is partially true. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max">SteamDB, the source of all these PC figures</a>, show the numbers at&nbsp;<em>all</em> given moments, and maps them to a graph. Yes, they don’t show how many copies have sold, but they do tell you how many people are playing at any given point. And it’s barely any. Right now, seven times more people are playing <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4147820/charts/"><em>Your Mom</em></a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations <a href="https://t.co/ir9W0BjFHo">pic.twitter.com/ir9W0BjFHo</a></p> <p>— SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The statement begins with an unimpeachably true statement, however. “Steam Charts don’t measure fun.” There’s no denying this, and if the 1,000 people who are persisting with the game a month after its re-release are having a great time, then all power to them. We all know excellent games that unfairly failed to find an audience, and 1047 absolutely should be defending a game its proud of and boasting about its community. It also remains the case that when those games are based on a freemium model where income comes from players buying in-game items, then its long-term potential is somewhat limited.</p>

 <p>The statement is defiant, maintaining “The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of&nbsp;<em>Spligate</em> possible,” and thanking the players the game does have. It also implores people to give the game a try, arguing “the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion.” But what the post <em>doesn’t</em> do is provide any data for console sales to bolster the opening point that people only know how it’s performing on PC.</p>

 <p>It must be so awful, to have worked&nbsp;<em>so</em> hard on a game, and then to have had the enormous setback of a failed launch, only to re-emerge after months more effort and for no one to show up despite the game being free. I can’t even imagine. Yet, I really don’t know if putting out a statement responding to Redditors being rude about SteamDB numbers is the most professional look. Still, it’s working—we’re writing about the game as a consequence, and perhaps that’ll inspire a few more people to give the game a look. I kinda hope it works.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn the playercount is lower than your studio name. <a href="https://t.co/kgdyGxs4vu">pic.twitter.com/kgdyGxs4vu</a></p> <p>— DANNYonPC (@DANNYonPC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DANNYonPC/status/2008628012611158306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Oof.</p>

<p>The CEO of Embark Studios has revealed that they don’t wish to promote PvP systems, as they don’t want to foster that type of gameplay. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders is undoubtedly one of the standout titles of 2025, and it shows no signs of slowing anytime soon, having recently hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new milestone of 12 million units sold</a>. At the same time, it seems the developers aren’t looking to go all-in on PvP to keep the fire burning, since the game wasn’t designed with that as a focus.</p>

<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBeat’s</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dean Takahashi</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/arc-raiders/250358/news/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund revealed why they aren’t looking to promote PvP systems. The CEO first mentioned discussions about adding Nemesis systems; however, they don’t know where the team is at right now and are also happy that the game doesn’t have a leaderboard and “it’s not competitive.”</p>



<p>Söderlund adds that the dev team “doesn’t want to necessarily foster that type of gameplay” as “the game isn’t about shooting other players”. Of course, the game allows you to be aggressive and fight other players, “but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players.” The PvP element was added to craft tension. </p>



<p>The Embark CEO then spoke about the game being designed to be played “without other players for a long time,” and noted that this worked quite well in some instances. However, as soon as other players were added, the dev team had to resort to subtle ways of signalling, rather than telling you how many players are on the server, how many have died, etc. </p>



<p>Hence, ARC Raiders is all about players using audio and visual cues when engaging in PvP situations. Players need to hear other players shooting and see raider flares go up to see where the action is. Not providing all the information at once creates tension, forcing players to decide whether exploring the area where the action is a risk worth taking. </p>



<p>However, the CEO also said that private servers in ARC Raiders are “absolutely something we could consider,” and that could be an excellent addition for players looking for more PvP action. </p>
