              <p><i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i> was one of the earliest battle royale titles to release and is widely considered to be the one that brought the sub-genre into the mainstream. But despite being around for so many years, it’s still managing to keep its update train rollin’ to entice new and returning players to continue sneaking, looting, and blasting their way to chicken dinners.</p> <p>Whether you’re coming back from a long time away, or you’re just checking the game out for the first time, you may be wondering about whether it offers cross-platform features. Here’s what to know about crossplay and cross-progression in <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i>‘ crossplay situation isn’t cut and dry. While it does offer crossplay, it takes a much more limited approach to the feature than many similar multiplayer titles. Let me break it down in an easy-to-understand format below.</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1">Crossplay is supported between PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</li> <li aria-level="1">Crossplay is not supported between consoles and PC.</li> <li aria-level="1">Crossplay is not supported between any platforms and <i>PUBG: Mobile</i>, as it is its own separate game.</li> </ul> <p>So, as you can see, the only platforms that work together are PlayStation and Xbox. So, if you’re a console player who has friends on PC, well, no you don’t.</p> <h2>Does <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i> have cross-progression?</h2> <p>Things are more straightforward when it comes to <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i>‘ cross-progession status. But that’s mostly because <b><i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i></b><b> does not offer cross-progression at all</b>. This means that if you pick up a copy of the game on one platform and make a lot of progress, you’ll still need to start over with a whole new account when moving to another platform.</p> <p>It’s definitely a bummer not to see cross-progression supported in one of the most beloved battle royale titles in the world. But given that it was released before cross-platform features became the norm, it’s a bit more forgivable, I suppose.</p> <hr> <p><i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/discounty-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/discounty-review-%E2%80%93-not-another-life-sim-clone.1272177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When a genre reaches a certain point of popularity, it’s hard to escape its gravitational pull. Life Sims are all the rage these days, with everything from spooky graveyard-based affairs to the more run-of-the-mill wholesome farming life experiences that we’ve all seen 1000 of over the past few years. You may be shocked to hear, then, that our <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/discounty" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Discounty </em></a>review shows that this particular life sim has managed to avoid the pitfalls of being just another clone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is <em>Discounty</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-two-people-having-a-conversation-in-the-back-room-of-a-shop.jpg?itok=QqWb5H-2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-two-people-having-a-conversation-in-the-back-room-of-a-shop.jpg?itok=LjeNJNtk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are a few "broken" dialogue moments, but they're so damn rare that it's barely worth mentioning. Besides, give it a week and it'll be patched out anyway.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Discounty </em>is the debut title from Crinkle Cut Games, a small Danish studio formed back in 2021 with a small cultural grant. The game focuses on your character being invited to a small town to help your aunt run her shop. As you get to know the town and further your aunt's commercial empire, you learn more about the people you’re living with, and have to balance your desire for the business to be a success, as well as your desire not to completely destroy your new small-town home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’re thinking that things sound pretty familiar so far, then I don’t blame you. Everything from the journey to visit a distant relative who needs help with their business to the opening bus ride had me in mind of “yet another life sim game” with the same 8 or 9 tropes trotted out to give fans of the genre something new to do, or rather, a new environment to do it in.</p>

<p>However, it would be a mistake to discount (ha) <em>Discounty </em>as just another life sim game. Sure, there are a few tropes that persist, but the crux of the gameplay is pretty far removed from what is going on in most life sims.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>It’s Our Differences That Make Us The Same</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-a-person-standing-behind-the-counter-of-a-store-with-terrible-carpets-and-walls.jpg?itok=dgGaCmSl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-a-person-standing-behind-the-counter-of-a-store-with-terrible-carpets-and-walls.jpg?itok=gOgu5pYR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you can see, I am great at running a little shop. That's why my drinks, produce, household goods and processed food are all jumbled together like that.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>It’s pretty true that other life sims have struggled to move past the whole “farming” thing. Even games that are supposedly about other aspects of life have a horrible tendency to throw in a small amount of farming “just in case.” This is part of the reason why so many life sim games have a tendency to feel the same, since all of them tend to throw in the same cycle of farming/mining/socialising, and at this point, it’s all been done before so many times that even the thought of trying to count them is actually putting me to sleep.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Discounty</em> handily avoids this issue by actually being about running a shop. There are no social mechanics (at least, you can’t throw chocolate at someone until they marry you), no farming, and no mining/monster hunting. Your focus is on running and improving your shop, and that’s all you really do. You go out to complete missions to make people like you more, but that’s to get more stock from other businesses; other than that, you spend your time collecting supplies, buying new furniture, and rearranging your store so it makes you as much money as possible. That’s it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>You Should Run a Little Shop!</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-a-farm-with-a-barn-that-has-a-huge-x-scrawled-across-the-door.jpg?itok=QXACpC1t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-a-farm-with-a-barn-that-has-a-huge-x-scrawled-across-the-door.jpg?itok=5GJH_UQJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While there technically is a farm in the game, you're under no obligation to run it yourself. Thankfully.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>So, the base gameplay of <em>Discounty </em>revolved around the shop itself. Monday – Saturday, you have to arrive at the shop by 9 AM, or fear the wrath of your customers. As people move around the shop buying stuff, you have to restock everything from the back room, keep the floors clean to prevent clients from slowing down, and keep an eye on the till to make sure a huge queue isn’t forming. You also have to make sure that your shoppers are able to find everything and reach the till in a timely manner, something which heavily depends on the layout of your shop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the manager of the store, you have to arrange all of your display furniture, consisting primarily of shelves, coolers, and boosters. The shelves and coolers are for displaying regular and frozen products, respectively, while the boosters will make certain item categories more appealing. It’s not good just shoving all of your goods around the place willy-nilly. If you don’t group your items by category, your customers will struggle to find them, and this is likely to have you receiving some negative feedback come closing time. You also need to make sure that the layout of your store doesn’t get too constricting, because these guys loooove to get hung up on shelves or counters.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Bugs, Bugs, Gallons of the Stuff</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-a-very-busy-shop-filled-with-customers-and-a-shopkeeper.jpg?itok=MRkuDRoX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-a-very-busy-shop-filled-with-customers-and-a-shopkeeper.jpg?itok=nnvWJi-q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My supermarket empire thrives!!! Mwa-ha-ha!!!</figcaption></figure><p>As you could probably expect from any indie title, <em>Discounty </em>does have a few buggy moments. At least once, I had the text glitch out on my game, as well as experiencing story events slightly out of order in a way that left me a little confused. Both of these pale in comparison to the AI's tendency to get stuck in places, and then have a paddy at me for them being late with their shopping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you’re working with pathfinding AI, it can be tough to get it perfect, and it’s certainly an example of something that needs tweaking in future versions of the game. You can avoid the problem by using specific layouts, to a degree, but after your final shop expansion, you get some non-optional furniture that seems to act like a people magnet. Most of the time, I could unstick people by spamming the (A) button on them, but once or twice, I just had to wait for the shop to close.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Good, The Great, and the Beautiful</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-the-inside-of-a-small-home-with-rainbow-wallpaper-and-a-few-items-of-decoration.jpg?itok=fVmsnQ2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-the-inside-of-a-small-home-with-rainbow-wallpaper-and-a-few-items-of-decoration.jpg?itok=2hvfxjw2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My house might be small, but I swear that the music that plays here had me thinking of Super Mario Land 2 at the start of each in-game day.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>My gripes aside, <em>Discounty </em>is still coming out of this thing with a huge recommendation. The artwork is beautiful, managing to give the game its own sense of personality rather than looking like 1000 other games on the market, and the sound design is also excellent. It got to a point when I was pretty addicted to hearing my till make the scanning ‘beep’, and was genuinely excited for my Sunday off, which would give me a chance to rearrange my store layout, and both the visuals and sounds have a huge part to play in that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other key factor that makes this a success is the characters. Every person in the game, including the player character, is a distinct personality already, and your input on these people is limited. You don’t have choices to make really, beyond mostly choosing minor dialogue changes, and instead are invited to learn who these people are, why they feel the way they feel, and why most of them aren’t immediately what they appear to be upon your arrival.</p>

<p>Personally, I was hooked by these characters, and I didn’t miss any of the genre’s erstwhile mechanical tropes. Then the story came loaded with a level of nuance that I’ve not seen in games for a long time, and just blew me away.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-two-people-standing-near-a-corner-in-a-busy-super-market.jpg?itok=l8HZlIy0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-two-people-standing-near-a-corner-in-a-busy-super-market.jpg?itok=yg6PyyTh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Excuse me shopper. I know you love frozen chips but you've been standing by this chiller for 8 hours now, other customers need their fix."</figcaption></figure><p><em>Discounty </em>is a stellar example of an indie life sim that manages to avoid the traps that come from making a game in the heavily codified life <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/simulation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">simulation</a> genre. While it has its issues here and there, the characters and storyline are a strong hook, and the gameplay of running your shop is unique yet just as addictive as any other experience of a similar ilk. With stunning visuals and sound thrown into the mix, this could easily become a firm favourite of genre fans, and I know that I’m not done with it despite having rolled the credits. It's gotta beat <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-shire-review-can-you-relax-too-much" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tales from the Shire</em></a> at any rate.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The First Descendant developer/publisher Nexon has been accused of using a series of "embarrassing" AI-generated TikTok advertisements, at least one of which is alleged to have imitated a real content creator.</p>
<p>As collated by u/iHardlyTriHard on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1mrtayp/the_ai_ads_are_worse_than_you_think/">Reddit</a> by scrolling on their For You Page for just 15 minutes, they came across four ads, along with another two "low effort ads that aren't specifically AI".</p>
<p>As the OP points out, the issue isn't the use of generative AI in and of itself, but the fact that <a href="https://x.com/DeathMonkeyXL/status/1956828908617109977">at least one ad uses the likeness</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/danielthedemon">DanieltheDemon</a> – and we don't yet know if it was with their consent or not.</p>

<p><i>Overwatch 2</i> remains one of the most popular games in the multiplayer gaming arena due to its lovable roster of characters, strategic gameplay, and consistent updates that keep things feeling fresh for both new and returning players. And if you are brand new to the game or haven’t played in some time, you might be wondering what’s going on in this long-running hero shooter. So let’s get to everything you need to know about <i>Overwatch 2</i> in late summer, 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-going-on-with-the-current-season"></span>What’s going on with the current season?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Overwatch 2</i> is currently winding down on <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24216161/season-17-hits-with-a-midseason-surge">season 17</a> which saw some reworks to New Junk City and Suravasa, as well as a taste of what’s to come in season 18 with a preview of a new support hero, Wuyang. In fact, you can play as him right now, as his Hero Trial is expected to go until August 18.</p> <p>But Season 18 will arrive in full on August 26, and with it Wuyang will fully join the roster. Also, for the new season, Sojourn will get a new mythic hero skin. You can learn all about that from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBK1JI1Vjeg&amp;t=1814s">the dev livestream here</a>.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dev Livestream: Season 18 Mythic Hero Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qBK1JI1Vjeg?start=1814&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>We also know that Sojourn will be getting some new perks. The Deceleration Field, which will replace the Extended Mag, will see hit enemies slowed down by a quarter of their top speed. Sojourn’s Adhesive Siphon in favor of her new Friction Generators, which will give her as much as 50 energy while sliding. You can read more about these changes, as well as some updates to Juno in <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24226732/weekly-recall-2-perks-2-furious">this official preview of season 18</a>.</p> <h2><span id="who-are-the-best-heroes-right-now"></span>Who are the best heroes right now?<span></span></h2> <p>While season 18 is likely to change things up, right now we’re seeing Orisa and Ramattra leading the pack when it comes to tanks, Tracer and Cassidy laying claim to the best DPS, and Baptiste and Kiriko dominating the support heroes.</p> <p>Of course, given the importance of great teamwork, it’s always hard to sus out which heroes are best at any given moment. So if you’ve been out of the loop for some time, it might be worth jumping back in with a main that feels familiar to you. And if you find they’re not up to snuff anymore, try out one of the ones we just mentioned.</p>

 <h2><span id="does-overwatch-2-have-crossplay-support"></span>Does <i>Overwatch 2</i> have crossplay support?<span></span></h2> <p>If you’re wanting to join up with friends on other platforms, I’ve got some good news for you: <b><i>Overwatch 2</i></b><b> features full crossplay support</b>. This means that you can team up with your friends across any platform by adding one another’s Battle.net accounts, which is a quick and easy process.</p> <p>The exception to this crossplay rule is Competitive matches, where console and PC players are separated due to the perceived edge of mouse and keyboard players. While this may disappoint more hardcore players looking to truly test their mettle, most folks should be happy having some casual fun in Quick Play, Arcade, and Custom Matches. That’s not so bad!</p>

 <h2><span id="does-overwatch-2-have-crossprogression"></span>Does <i>Overwatch 2</i> have cross-progression?<span></span></h2> <p>The good news continues, as <b><i>Overwatch 2</i></b><b> also fully supports cross-progression</b>. With this feature, you can easily jump between different platforms while maintaining your account’s progress. So, if you’d like to play a few matches on PC before relaxing in bed with your Nintendo Switch 2, no one’s stopping you. All you need to do is ensure you’re signed into the same Battle.net account on each device, and you’re all set!</p> <hr> <p><i>Overwatch 2</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>

<h3>"monthly minimum" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Game-key cards and fans that don't earn in Pounds, Euros or Dollars.<br>
Hello Nintendolife friends! Sebastián here from Medellín, Colombia (a big fan from the Global South).<br>
I'd like to talk about why you'd think that Game-key cards are better or worse for your own gaming experience.<br>
For context, videogames are really expensive when exchanged to Colombian Pesos, up to a fifth of our monthly minimum wage.<br>
Fortunately, I earn much more than a minimum wage, but it's still a luxury. So I buy Nintendo games based on 3 options:<br>
1) Physical cartridges that I'd like to collect (or play in the future with our soon to come kid); 2) Physical cartridges that I can play and then re-sell to earn some of the investment back; 3) Digital games on sale for a really low price based on Deku Deals' price history.<br>
Considering Nintendo's tendency to introduce more games as Game-key cards, my interest in physical games is every time smaller, which takes some of the magic away.<br>
What's your take on this? How much is a game compared to your monthly minimum wage in the UK?<br>
¡Saludos desde Colombia!<strong><br>
Sebas.</strong><br>
P.S: Please be sure to share some comment in Spanish, it would be great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hola Sebastián! According to <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/national-minimum-wage/">Money Saving Expert</a>, assuming a 35-hour work week, the monthly minimum wage in the UK works out to around £1850 right now. Using DK Bananza (£66.99, physical) as a recent example, that would be just over 3.5% of our monthly wage. That's before tax, mind you.</p>
<p>For me, I went digital almost exclusively on Switch 1, and those puny Switch cards could never compete with the majesty of a chunky N64 cart anyway, so for me physical hasn't been very magical for a while. The deep eShop sales and the convenience of having my library instantly accessible made sense to me on a portable system, and I don't regret it.</p>
<p>However, though I get the attraction of being able to resell, Game-Key Cards still feel like the absolute worst of all worlds to me, designed purely to benefit publishers and pass storage costs on to consumers. No me caen bien. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"I'd go so far"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morning/afternoon/evening or whatever time you're reading this. (If you're reading this after midnight, respect to my fellow night owl).</p>
<p>Is it just me (probably not) that thinks that there are some games that are so so good that it's an absolute crime that they're not more well known? My personal example is the whole of the Blaster Master Zero trilogy. The writing is spot on, the gameplay is smooth and gets better throughout all three games, the trilogy leads up to a really satisfying and heartwarming, yet bittersweet conclusion that I'd go so far as to compare to Undertale.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>And it's a genuine shame that even after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDJSziIiD34">NovaZone's video on it on Youtube</a>, I haven't seen much more buzz about it. Best thing is, all three games together you can get for less than £30 even without a sale.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. And play Blaster Master Zero. That is all.<br>
<strong><em>Lewis Moore</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to you, Lewis, I get to trot out my semi-regular plug for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/just_shapes_and_beats">Just Shapes &amp; Beats</a>. Everyone should play that game. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"the main personalities"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>So I noticed a long standing trend of Nintendo life staff adapting other writers' reviews for the video version. I understand that maybe the main personalities on Nintendo life can’t possibly play every major game thoroughly enough to put down their review, but the other issue I see is sometimes the video reviews come across like it’s your personally experience when it really isn’t. Or a reviewer puts in personal info into the review (eg. Mario Kart World) that doesn’t really make sense out of context. So my question - why not have these other reviewers also do the video version? Is it simply they aren’t as much of a personality or video reviews aren’t their thing? Thanks for answering!<br>
<strong><em>BFahey3</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For one, we've got a three-person YouTube team who earn their beans from making videos and whose expertise in that department outstrips everyone else on staff by a very wide margin. Capture cards and mics are the least of it - it's a different skillset, and while some of our writers may have the ability, Alex, Felix, and Zion have the know-how, gear, and camera charisma to deliver the best results in the speediest time.</p>
<p>And yes, some of us are just better in writing. Ask my wife. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"entertaining but useless"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Good evening and tsufufum to you, NL,</p>
<p>Inspired by your recent nostalgic trip through the pages of NGC Magazine, I was compelled to do the same, taking about six weeks to chew my way through all 61 issues under the NGC banner. As I went through each issue, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oig6a5UFcypa8GO13yC-PHxOtb_ZO3w7U0tYzBsISGk/edit?usp=sharing">I compiled a spreadsheet of every review</a> featured so I could more easily refer back at a later date, and having now finished I am sharing this document in case it is useful to you as well.</p>
<p>Each review is listed with the issue it appears in and the score awarded, plus some feeble attempt from me to label the game with a genre. Of course, the real reason you read NGC is for their spectacular way with words, and a dry spreadsheet would be meaningless without paying heed to that, so I have also included snippets of many of the reviews in the manner of their (and your!) letters pages.</p>
<p>Also part of the document is a tab of "interesting" features. What counts as interesting obviously varies from one person to another so it's got a definite slant towards things I am interested in myself, but I've tried to highlight features that might also be of interest to the retro public at large... like the reported Pilotwings title being developed by Factor 5, and their repeated insistence that "Nintendo DS" was a temporary name. Oops!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Finally is a list of their fake games, seen as examples in features like their Directory. Often crass, they're mostly jabs at the various staff members who wrote the mag. This tab would probably be reviewed as "entertaining but useless".</p>
<p>I would encourage anyone with even a passing interest in the Gamecube-DS era to take a look into NGC. They were scrappy, chaotic and anarchic, far moreso than their contemporaries, and the magazine has a lot of personality as a result. It's also just fun to look back on old things that were new at the time and see how things have changed (and how they've stayed the same). Their speculation on what Mario's waterpumping backpack did, what Rare would do after Starfox Adventures, the inevitability of Wind Waker 2, and what Nintendo's "third pillar" would come to be, is all entertaining when read with the benefit of living in the future. At the very least, you'll learn some new words to call your friends.</p>
<p>I wonder if any NGC alumni are around and available for interview? I'd love to read some 20-years-later gossip about how things actually ran, if Greener regrets giving Melee 95% (he was right!), and if Shedwards still has his pigs. Not including that Ed guy, of course- he already works for NL.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the words, NL. You are the ship I jumped to when NGC sank, and I'm grateful that you in some manner keep that 100% Unofficial spirit alive.</p>
<p>Beebs<strong><br>
Babybahamut</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eyy, now you're speaking my language! N64 Magazine was my 'era' (and is the reason I'm here doing this today), with that talent and spirit flowing very directly into NGC, just as Super Play fed into N64. Thank you for this - and for the massive compliment.</p>
<p>Alumni-wise, I've had plans for something vaguely in this area for a long while now. It'll be a ways off, but keep the googly eyes peeled.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm off to play some Baldy's Pate. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"before the torches arrive"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, this probably won’t go well with NL readers, but we need to talk about Game Key cards. Is it necessary to complain about them every single time a new game is announced?</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I understand the issue for game collectors and game preservation, but as a business practice it’s nothing new. Also, players across all platforms purchase far more digital games than physical these days.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>For those of us that have gone digital only for several years now, the constant complaint for Game Key cards feel similar to complaining about the lack of discs when new albums are released in Spotify or something.</p>
<p>I support you in your criticism of Game Key cards and I’ll keep reading the articles and watching the videos regardless if you mention Game Key or not. It just annoys me since I don’t agree that it’s as relevant to the average Nintendo gamer as the community makes it sound.</p>
<p>Now excuse me as I find somewhere to hide before the torches arrive. Thank you!<strong><br>
RenanKJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are rubbish, though, no?</p>
<p>Sure, it's irritating when people demand two points docked from a review score because Game Key-Card, as if modern games haven't been shipping with massive required downloads for a couple of generations. But if people want to voice their displeasure in a respectful manner, let's not crack out the copium just yet. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"I expect more"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How long has Sakarai needed a break for? Everytime his name comes up, any YouTuber or Journalist or random comment poster will say "Ah give that guy a break, he's worked too much." Well guess what? He had his break. The last DLC for Super Smash Bros Ultimate was released in October 2021. So it's time we stopped cutting the guy slack, he's rested and ready and it's about time he made Kirby Air Riders and then about time he made another Smash Bros after that! He is only 55, so I expect more and I don't feel guilty saying so. So come on Sakurai, let's have some more games son!<strong><br>
YoshiTails</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You hear that, <em>Slakurai?</em> Doing your little dev tutorial vids out of your own pocket for the benefit of the wider gaming and dev community. Everyone was here, and now they're leaving because you're off on a jolly. Get back down that there Smash dungeon where you belong!...</p>
<p><sub>Just thinking about another Smash makes me age like I've drunk from the wrong grail. Get out, man. Get out while you still can!</sub> <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<p><em>"</em>I had a random idea a while back: Nintendo should start producing its own anime. Hear me out: a high school romance where a boy and girl bond over their love of the Nintendo Switch.

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>

<p>There are few games as well-known in the general population as <i>Fortnite</i>. Even your grandmother knows what it is because she’s bought your cousin $700 in V-Bucks over the past month so he can play as a hot dog or whatever. This beloved battle royale is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon, either. But maybe it’s been a little while since you’ve played or you’ve yet to jump out of your first party bus. Let’s get into what you need to know to get into <i>Fortnite</i> in 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-the-deal-with-the-current-season"></span>What’s the deal with the current season?<span></span></h2> <p>At the time of this writing, <i>Fortnite</i> is up to Chapter 6, Season 4, which went live on August 7, 2025 and it features new characters from <i>Halo</i> and <i>Power Rangers</i>. We can expect this season to take us into the Fall of this year before the new one arrives.</p> <p>The current season sees a bit of a pest-control problem on the island. Throughout the map you’ll find various gross nests, eggs, and the like. There are also three queen insects you’ll need to take down to earn yourself a mythic weapon. For full details on these pests and where on the map you can expect to find them, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/bad-bugs-bite-the-bullet-in-fortnite-battle-royale-shock-n-awesome?lang=en-US">check out the official blog post.</a></p>

The Veiled Precision SMG is arguably at the top of the pack when it comes to mowing down your opponents. That said, the Deadeye DMR is also a great pick for those who like to place their shots with more precision. And if you’re into looking weird while taking out multiple foes at once, give the Bug Blaster a shot.</p> <h2><span id="what-got-vaulted/unvaulted"></span>What got vaulted/unvaulted?<span></span></h2> <p>This season sees the following changes to the game’s arsenal, as<a href="https://x.com/osirion_gg/status/1953357145140809934"> per Osirion on X</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">BR LOOT POOL UPDATES</p> <p>unvaulted/added:<br>– Hammer Assault Rifle<br>– O.X.R.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-annual-releases/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-is-aiming-to-become-an-annual-release-within-5-6-years-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1272126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new video, industry analyst Michael Patcher claims that the General Manager of the Battlefield franchise, Byron Beede, has told him that EA wants Battlefield to be an annual title.</p>



<p>According to Patcher, he has spoken to Beede, who said that EA’s goal is to have three studios working on the Battlefield franchise on a three-year cycle, so that they can release annually.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this is identical to Call of Duty’s annual release model, but Patcher claims that the franchise is still 5-6 years away from back-to-back annual releases.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out directly to Byron Beede for comment, but as of yet has not heard a response.</p>



<p>You can watch Patcher’s claims below: </p>

<iframe title="Are PlayStation's &quot;prestige games&quot; now a poor strategy? - Pachter Factor S10E25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_WuLcrpCkkc?start=405&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Personally, though, I find this hard to believe. Battlefield 6, which has been developed by four individual studios — DICE, Motive, Ripple Effect, and Criterion — appears to be on the path to success. However, I believe that an annual Battlefield release could significantly harm the franchise and its quality.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-6-pre-order-bonuses-explained-every-tombstone-pack-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – All Battlefield 6 Pre-Order Bonuses Explained—Every Tombstone Pack Reward</a></strong></p>



<p>Could I see Battlefield releasing a new experience annually? Possibly, but not a new, fully-fledged game. Then and again, what a new experience after a Battle Royale looks like is anyone’s guess. Perhaps they’ll finally give us that dinosaur mode that everyone has talked about for years.</p>



<p>What do you think of Patcher’s claims? Do you think Battlefield should adopt an annual release cycle? Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/discounty</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-discounty-switch-chilled-out-supermarket-sim-is-a-decent-deal.1272105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158013/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>No one who has ever worked in retail would compare the experience to a cosy life management sim. I used to have nightmares about stock variance and queues of angry customers who seemed determined to ruin my day as much as they felt I had ruined theirs.</p>
<p>Yet, Danish developer Crinkle Cut Games seems to think that managing a busy supermarket is something people will enjoy doing on the couch or on the go. Thankfully, they wrapped a charming world around this premise, complete with a pixel art style and chill soundscape. Despite the hellish inspiration, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/discounty">Discounty</a> is almost good enough to be mentioned alongside genre luminaries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>, even though it doesn't do anything drastically different with the basic formula.</p>
<p>The story follows your created shopkeeper as they travel to the small town of Blomkest, where their aunt Tellar has been trying for years to get her franchise store off the ground. She believes your character, her newly arrived relative, is the key to building a thriving supermarket and tasks them with connecting trade across the community.</p>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158023/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a fledgling store manager, you will order deliveries of various sundries and keep shelves stocked and organised. Once that open sign is flipped, the checkout needs to be manned and a steady flow of customers attended to. As items roll across the conveyor, you pull up a calculator to run price totals before checking orders out and seeing whether your customer service earns you an angry grumble or a delighted smile. A belt full of items can often screw up your calculations, and it doesn't help that the till UI is a bit fiddly.</p>
<p>Early on, the Discounty Corporation will introduce bonuses and performance reviews that reward stock variety and efficiency. Completing these challenges unlocks upgrades (like a till scanner to make your shift way easier), more types of produce and, as with any capitalist venture, more cash!</p>
<p>Much like ConcernedApe’s farming sim, Discounty draws you into a focused loop of familiar tasks before gradually expanding the world and involving you in the soap opera-like lives of the townspeople. Outside of work hours, you're free to wander Blomkest, exploring and chatting with the locals. Every aspect of the town ties back to the growth of your store in some way, whether through trade deals or side quests that open up new areas.</p>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158019/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The cast is made up of mostly familiar archetypes, but there is still some amusing story content to enjoy. Early on, you will meet a crotchety fisherman with a grudge against the local cannery, who is monopolising his business. Other standouts include new age antique shop owner Solruna and little old lady Andersson. There’s also a mysterious tension between your aunt and the resident bureaucrat, Elmer. These little story vignettes are well written and often very funny.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about Discounty’s take on the cosy management sim is that it keeps the supermarket management front and centre. It’s a streamlined experience without the distractions of romance or extracurricular activities. Each customer has a series of story objectives to complete, but these usually amount to little more than finding someone and talking to them. Then it’s back to the shop floor to get (and sell) this bread.</p>
<p>For those who want to explore the generous depths of shop management with minimal distractions, this leaner format will be welcome. However, if you enjoyed the mini-games and love stories found in games like Stardew or the excellent (In my eyes, at least) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/graveyard_keeper">Graveyard Keeper</a>, you might be disappointed. The opportunity to automate a lot of the busywork is there, allowing you to spend more time exploring the town. However, there really isn’t much to do besides building up your store. It's a shame that <em>Crinkle Cut</em> chose to focus so heavily on shop management while cutting much of the side content that keeps games like this engaging over time.</p>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158014/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The town of Blomkest both looks and sounds lovely. While the aesthetic is reminiscent of genre peers, Crinkle Cut has added its own visual spin. I especially liked the sense of motion in my shopkeeper’s bobbing head. The musical themes are good enough to cope with the strain of repetition and hum along to, as well. Special mention to the visceral sound effects in the shop, which may send former or current retail workers into a spiral.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Discounty is a solid addition to the Switch’s healthy stable of cosy sims. These games feel right at home on a console you can take anywhere, with a bite-sized day cycle that works just as well for long sessions as it does for quick breaks. Growing your supermarket is a deep and satisfying experience, but getting involved in your customers lives can be a bit shallow. But, most importantly, Discounty manages the impossible task of making retail work fun and relaxing, and that's a feat in itself.</p></section>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/760244/chris-plante-post-games-podcast-old-gamers-polygon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-the-former-editor-of-polygon-is-making-a-podcast-for-old-gamers.1272102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In a recent episode of <em>Post Games</em>, host Chris Plante explores how video games can help players understand death. He’s interviewing Kaitlin Tremblay, who is working on <em>Ambrosia Sky</em>, a game about death.</p><p>“What is it about games that is so useful for exploring the topic?” Plante asks.</p><p>“I think there’s something really lovely about the way in which games invite players in,” Tremblay says. There is “something quite lovely about asking a person to cooperate and to be a part of the story, and to move through the space.”</p><p>It’s a tone, and a substance of conversation, unlike any I’ve heard on a gaming podcast before. And it underscores what’s so unique about <em>Post Games</em> — and how it might stand out from other gaming media, by acting a lot more like a slower and more cerebral NPR show.</p><p>Within weeks of leaving <em>Polygon</em>, where he was the editor-in-chief, Plante started <em>Post Games</em>, which he <a href="https://postgame.substack.com/">describes as</a> “a weekly podcast about how and why we love video games.” He’s targeting an older demographic and models <em>Post Games</em> after an NPR-like format with tightly-edited segments and weekly episodes that last for about an hour. And he’s asking fans for support via Patreon to help keep it going.</p><div><p>“Practically everything in games media targets young people”</p></div><p>Many other video game podcasts are “almost entirely for people under the age of 30 who can afford to listen to multiple shows that are four hours long this week,” Plante tells <em>The Verge</em>. “Practically everything in games media targets young people — both because it’s being produced by young people and because it’s the demographic sales teams believe they have the best shot at selling.” But players over 35, he says, have “very different interests and expectations.” There are a lot of people that fall in that category, with the Entertainment Software Association <a href="https://www.theesa.com/annual-esa-study-reveals-video-games-universal-appeal-across-generations/">reporting that</a> more than half of the 205.1 million Americans playing video games are older than 35.</p><p>“It’s really basic supply and demand shit,” he says. “And yet very few places want to meet this demand. The publications older audiences turn to for information — newspapers, magazines, and audio — have given gaming culture scraps at best, and worst, ignored it entirely.”</p><p>Before I go any further, I should make a few disclosures. Plante, until May, was the editor-in-chief of <em>Polygon</em>, formerly <em>The Verge</em>’s sister site dedicated to gaming and entertainment. He was a co-founder of <em>Polygon</em> when it launched in 2012, and he later worked at <em>The Verge</em> from September 2014 to July 2017. I never worked with him directly, but I met Plante for the first time in person earlier this year over dinner at the Game Developers Conference.</p><p>This is all to say that when Vox Media announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659575/polygon-vox-media-sold-valnet-gamerant">on May 1st</a> that it sold <em>Polygon</em> to <em>Game Rant</em> owner Valnet, and Plante said that he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26">wouldn’t be</a> part of the site moving forward, I was bummed for him. But by the end of the month, he had published the first episode of <em>Post Games</em>, and he’s posted a new episode every week since. It’s a great podcast.</p><p>Each episode is about an hour long and split into three acts. Much of the show revolves around interviews on a certain topic, and a third act features Plante discussing the news of the week. But the broader topics of the episodes don’t always align with the current big thing in gaming.</p><p>The first episode was about the history of the Independent Games Festival’s Seamus McNally Grand Prize, for example. The second was about sexy games. When the episodes do tackle topics of the moment, Plante tries to put his own spin on things; when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5"><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></a> came out, Plante scored a rare interview with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/videogamedunkey">videogamedunkey</a>, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukqZ5VOoK5s">initially hated</a> the first <em>Death Stranding</em> but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONfg5qeK_mI">revisited it two years later</a>.</p><p>The show is available for free with ads, but people who pay a $5 per month subscription <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/PostGames/home">on Patreon</a> get early access to ad-free episodes with a bonus segment and access to an exclusive video every month. While planning out what <em>Post Games</em> would be “my logic was, if I wasn’t willing to spend $5 on it, then why would anybody else?” Plante says. The show just hit 1,000 paid subscribers, and even if things flatten from there, “that would be enough to cover my family’s health insurance.” If the show gets 2,000 by the end of the year, “I’ll feel confident about this being my future.”</p><p>Game journalists who leave or were laid off from traditional gaming publications are increasingly doing their own thing, such as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23949269/aftermath-video-games-kotaku-defector">worker-owned <em>Aftermath</em> from former <em>Kotaku</em> writers</a> and Patrick Klepek’s <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/">parent-focused <em>Crossplay</em></a> Substack publication. And while publications everywhere are facing pressure from things like AI search engines and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience">Google Zero</a>, Plante argues there are a lot of audiences that are underserved by more traditional business models because of their reliance on scale.</p><p>“As somebody in the media, you hear a lot about how great independent media is because of its benefits for the people who make the media, but I think there’s a larger conversation that needs to be had about the benefits that it has for the audience, for the readers,” Plante says. “I think if you focus on the readers and the audience, you will find more business opportunities for more independent creators or more just smaller funded creators.” He also says that if mainstream publications don’t want to serve the “humongous and growing audience” of older gamers, “I’m happy to.”</p><p>Plante sees <em>Post Games</em> as his thing for the next long while. “My only dream for the future of the show is that I’m doing this in 10 years,” he says.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/760244/chris-plante-post-games-podcast-old-gamers-polygon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d89a19f59ee34/super-adventure-island-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last week, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/warioware_inc_mega_microgameusd">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$</a> for the GBA – a true classic and one of our favourites here at NL Towers. North America and Europe joined forced against Japan and, uh... Oh, poor Japan. The western design won with a whopping 91% of the vote! We quite like the Japanese design, there's definitely something to it. Though if you said it was boring, we wouldn't necessarily disagree. Hm.</p>
<p>Anyway, this week, we're going back to the SNES to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_adventure_island">Super Adventure Island</a>. Developed by Produce! and published by Hudson Soft in 1992, it boasted some really lovely, colourful visuals and the platforming gameplay was pretty decent.</p>
<p>It's a three-way brawl this week folks, so get ready to vote, vote, vote!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:16309 @ 1755445614 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/538a5c2430ae3/super-adventure-island-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so starting with North America, the artistic approach here is wildly different to that seen in Europe and Japan. After the initial whiplash, however, it's actually quite a cool image. More details become apparent the longer you look at it, like the characters in the background, the mine cart track swooping off into the distance, the 'leafy' title font... It's pretty cool.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a2a3a2c93c36/super-adventure-island-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So this one is a lot more, shall we say, 'cartoon-ish' than the North American variant. There are a handful of characters taking up the composition, including a couple of rather delightful turtles wearing shades. It's definitely a lot more colourful, although we'll have to dock a point for the rather boring title font.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8138a55c4a9c5/super-adventure-island-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Utilising the portrait orientation of the SNES packaging in Japan, this variant uses the same art style seen in Europe's design, but the added space allows for a lot more characters to be depicted. The giant skeleton thing on the right really draws the eye, and the use of colour is perhaps even more effective here.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-super-adventure-island-snes]]></content:encoded>

<p>The servers for Ninjala <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjalaTheGame/comments/1mpvum3/season_21_ends_in_12_years/">apparently won't be going away</a> anytime soon. The title even received a Switch 2 compatibility update on 19th June 2025 - fixing some "previously identified issues".</p>
<p>This bubblegum ninja game was released for free on the Switch eShop in June 2020, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/05/ninjalas_release_gets_delayed_until_june_due_to_the_coronavirus_outbreak_gungho_president_apologises">after multiple delays</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As we get ready for Gears of War: Reloaded, here’s every mainline Gears of War game ranked from worst to best. </p>



<p>First of all, considering any Gears of War game as “the worst” is slightly unfair. Every Gears game is great, just some are better than others, so when we say worst, we’re not throwing shade on any entries whatsoever. </p>



<p>However, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-gears-of-war-reloaded-free-upgrade/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> is about to come tearing onto PS5 on August 26, 2025, we thought it would be fun to rank the mainline entries of the series. Now, we won’t be including any spin-offs like Gears Tactics, as they don’t really count. But we will be ranking every game in the main series from worst to the very best. </p>



<h2 id="h-6-gears-of-war-judgement">6. Gears of War: Judgement</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears Judgement is a great prequel, but the weakest entry in the series. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gears of War: Judgement is a prequel to the original Gears of War that takes place a short time before it, but still several weeks after the dreaded “Emergence Day”. Instead of Marcus Fenix, players control the fan-favorite Damon Baird after he’s been put on trial for disobeying orders. </p>



<p>The game is infamously short and doesn’t do anything especially new; instead, it mostly just offers more of the same Gears gameplay that players had grown accustomed to. However, as Judgement sometimes feels more like a DLC than a mainline entry, this is forgivable, and the game is still considered an essential part of the Gears saga. </p>



<p>As Judgement came a couple of years after Gears of War 3, it was nice to see these characters again, and Judgement was also the most visually stunning game in the series to date when it arrived in 2013. Is Judgement the worst game in the Gears series? Yes. Should you play it before Gears of War: Reloaded? Absolutely. </p>



<h2 id="h-5-gears-of-war-4">5. Gears of War 4</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears 4 represented a new beginning. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gears of War 4 was a soft reboot of the Gears series in some ways. It was released in 2016 and marked the series’ debut on the Xbox One, making it the most technically impressive entry since Judgement. Set 25 years after the epic showdown at the end of Gears 3, characters like Marcus Fenix were now grizzled veterans, trying to guide new characters like Kait and Marcus’s son, J.D.</p>



<p>The game is great fun and was a bold new way to kick off a new era for the series, but sadly, audiences struggled to warm to J.D. and Kait like they did to Marcus and the gang. We were with them for every triumphant and agonizing moment, so moving on with a new generation just didn’t feel right. </p>



<p>The good news is that Gears 4 was mostly supposed to be an introduction to a new era of Gears games, as things would really get going again in the sequel. </p>



<h2 id="h-4-gears-5">4. Gears 5</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears 5 finally delivered on the promise of 4. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now we’re talking. Gears 5 was the first entry to come to the Xbox Series X|S, and boy, was it the main course to the appetizer that was Gears 4. After the last game’s rather shocking ending, players now took control of Kait, who finally came into her own as a compelling protagonist—and one worthy of taking the baton from Marcus Fenix.  </p>



<p>Even J.D. managed to be more interesting in this outing, and more importantly, the game got the balance right between letting the new characters shine but also celebrating the beloved characters from the original trilogy. Somehow, old man Marcus is even more fun to watch than his younger self. </p>



<p>Gears 5 also revamped the multiplayer and finally delivered an experience that mirrored the legendary moments from the early games. The more open-world approach to the campaign caused some controversy among old-school fans, but we’re of the view that they got the balance just right between exploration and high-octane shooting sections. </p>



<h2 id="h-3-gears-of-war-3">3. Gears of War 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears 3 is the perfect ending to the original trilogy. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gears of War 3 suffered from “third chapter syndrome” somewhat, especially after Gears 2 represented the series’ Empire Strikes Back moment. But that didn’t stop it from being a stellar sequel, not to mention a fitting and powerful ending to the original trilogy. Not only did it round up the Gears of War story beautifully, but it also left the door open for future sequels, which did eventually arrive.</p>



<p>The game saw Marcus and his surviving Gears finally take the fight to the entity that had caused them so much suffering and get some much-needed payback. Of course, there were a few twists to the tale, but Gears 3 delivered everything a conclusive trilogy-ender should. It also offered a bombastic campaign and the most comprehensive multiplayer experience the series had seen so far. </p>



<h2 id="h-2-gears-of-war">2. Gears of War</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears of War is where it all started. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gears of War came at a time (2006) when the Xbox 360 really needed more flagship games, and along with titles like Mass Effect, gave the console something to hang its hat on. Inspired by third-person shooters like Resident Evil 4 and fictional universes like Warhammer 40,000, Gears of War saw a planet facing an alien invasion, but from within. </p>



<p>The Locust swarm attacked humanity by crawling up from underground. While we won’t spoil what they were, just know that they were a threat to rival The Reapers, The Covenant, and monsters like the Tyrnaids. Players would take control of Marcus Fenix and his squad as they bravely took the battle to The Reapers, at great cost.</p>



<p>Gears of War quickly became one of the most celebrated games on Xbox 360, eventually spawning sequels and lots more spin-off material. The series is still going strong in 2025 with a remaster, Gears of War: Reloded, set to release in August. </p>



<h2 id="h-1-gears-of-war-2">1. Gears of War 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gears of War 2 is peak Gears. Image credit: The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>After the slightly experimental original game became a success, a sequel became inevitable and followed in 2008. Gears 2 is easily the most beloved and celebrated game in the series, as Marcus Fenix and the gang learned shocking secrets about the Locusts and the price of defeating them. </p>



<p>Gears 2 was Aliens to Gears 1’s Alien, blowing the series wide open and doing everything bigger and with more explosions, drama, and compulsive gun battles. It also introduced Horde Mode for players who had finished the epic campaign. The best thing about Gears 2 is that if the third game represents the crescendo, Gears 2 is the build-up to it, which is always the best and most thrilling part.</p>



<p>However, the biggest achievement of Gears of War 2 is its multiplayer mode, something that helped establish the Xbox 360 as the best place to game online with friends. While Sony consoles have caught Microsoft up in that regard today, this wasn’t the case in the 360 / PS3 era, and Gears of War 2 is a huge part of why that’s the case. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘I Have No Info on The Game At All’: Fairgames Has Not Been Cancelled]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fairgames-not-cancelled-confirmation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98i-have-no-info-on-the-game-at-all%E2%80%99-fairgames-has-not-been-cancelled.1272042/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, a shock tidbit of news sprang up when it was claimed that Fairgames, an upcoming third-person PlayStation shooter from Haven Studios, had been <strong>cancelled</strong>. This news came courtesy of Michael Pachter, a prolific industry analyst who was speaking during his Pachter Factor podcast.</p>



<p>However, Pachter has now come out to retract his statement and issue an apology for the confusion. As far as we know, Fairgames (stylized as ‘Fairgame$’) hasn’t been cancelled.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fairgames-still-coming-out">Is Fairgames Still Coming Out?</h2>



<p>From what we know, Fairgames is still coming out despite the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jade-raymond-leaves-haven-studios-after-founding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent departure of the studio’s founder</a>, Jade Raymond.</p>



<p>This is what led Michael Pachter to make the claim about Fairgames, jumping to a conclusion that the game must be cancelled as the studio’s founder has departed the business.</p>



<p>As Pachter’s statement spread like wildfire on social media, the analyst was contacted <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1956792553954771444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Destin Legarie</a> for clarification:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I misspoke. Said Jade was let go, and assumed it was cancelled. I have no info on the game at all. Feel free to quote this, I truly don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this year, it was claimed that Fairgames had been pushed back to 2026 as early testing phases started cropping up. The game, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fairgame-revealed-playstation/">was revealed in 2023</a>, will be Haven Studios’ first title, and it’s expected to be a typical live-service shooter under the PlayStation banner.</p>



<p>Because those have panned out <strong>so well</strong> in recent years…</p>



<p>When it was revealed, I wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s poised to offer up a fresh multiplayer gaming experience, with players having the ability to launch intense, ambitious heists with their friends while fighting to secure riches against other players in the same environment. It looks bright, it looks innovative, and it’s the first new IP from Haven Studios.</p>




</blockquote>



<p>Fairgames is still on the horizon, for now. Are you looking forward to the heist-based shooter? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grow a Garden fans are busying themselves with constructing enormous beanstalks in the Beanstalk Update, providing Jack with what he needs to generate a towering plant. This magical, limited-time event requires players to give Jack specific plant types, and in this guide, we’re kicking off by looking at Woody Plants in Grow a Garden.</p>



<p>If you’ve been hunting Grow a Garden’s Woody Plants, look no further than this guide. If you’re after something else like Prickly Plants or Tropical Plants, fear not – I’ve included those below too.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-beanstalk-update-in-grow-a-garden">What is the Beanstalk Update in Grow a Garden</h2>



<p>The Beanstalk Update in Grow a Garden is a special, magical event that requires players to help grow an enormous beanstalk. It’s a tale right out of the classic children’s book of stories, and it’s a collaborative event that requires a bit of teamwork.</p>



<p>Players will be requested to bring Jack, who is located in the centre of the map, various plant types. When he receives these plant types, be it Woody, Flower, Candy, or something else entirely, he’ll generate a hulking beanstalk that players can climb.</p>



<p>It’s simple but very entertaining.</p>



<h2 id="h-grow-a-garden-woody-plants-list">Grow a Garden Woody Plants List</h2>



<p>Here are all the Woody Plants in Grow a Garden, which represents a massive list that Jack will ask for in the Beanstalk Update:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Woody Plant Item</strong></td><td><strong>How to Find Woody Plant</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Rhubarb</td><td>Culinarian Chest</td></tr><tr><td>Pear</td><td>Summer Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Duskpuff</td><td>Sprout Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Apple</td><td>Seed Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Avocado</td><td>Summer Merchant Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Mangosteen</td><td>Sprout Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Coconut</td><td>Seed Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Kiwi</td><td>Summer Merchant Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Mango</td><td>Seed Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Peach</td><td>Normal Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Nectarine</td><td>Honey Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Moon Mango</td><td>Twilight Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Gleamroot</td><td>Sprout Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Maple Apple</td><td>Zen Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Traveler’s Fruit</td><td>Summer Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Moon Blossom</td><td>Night Seed Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Cacao</td><td>Seed Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Hive Fruit</td><td>Honey Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Feijoa</td><td>Summer Merchant Shop</td></tr><tr><td>Giant Pinecone</td><td>Seed Shop</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>These Woody Plants in Grow a Garden are listed in order of their value to the Beanstalk Update. The Giant Pinecone is worth seven points towards the beanstalk, while the Rhubarb is only worth two points.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A sliding bug in the Battlefield 6 Beta has been found to be causing many players to experience horrible aim.</p>



<p>Have you been experiencing horrible aim or bloom in the Battlefield 6 Beta without any explanation? Well, it’s down to sliding.</p>



<p>The issue was first spotted by Shroud, and subsequently investigated further by content creator Exclusive Ace, who, in his video, outlined exactly what happens and how to fix it.</p>



<p>The short version of what’s happening with the bug is that players who have their sliding animation interrupted or canceled will still have the calculations of sliding (bloom) assigned to the player. This means that regardless of what the player is doing, be that standing still or crouching, the calculations of sliding will still give the player bloom.</p>



<p>Getting out of the bug is simple: complete an uninterrupted slide, and your aim will return to normal.</p>

<p>You can watch Exclusive Ace’s full video below to get a better understanding of how exactly the bug works:</p>

<p>It’s probably too late for the developers to fix the bug by the end of the Beta at this point, but presumably, it’s an easy fix to have done by the time the game fully launches on October 20, 2025.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Beta officially ends in the early hours of Monday, August 18th.</p>

              <p><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> is the first 3D game in Nintendo’s ape-starring franchise since <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> way back in 1999, so expectations were high for the titular character’s newest outing. There’s a lot to love about this adventure, which sees Donkey Kong join up with a young Pauline as he punches, rolls, and slaps his way through open-ended levels filled with secrets and challenges. But how many hours will it take you to see everything? Let’s take a look at the length of the <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> campaign and what else there is to do beyond it.</p> <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i>?</h2> <p>If you just want to punch your way through to the end of this DK expedition, <b>you can expect to spend around 10-15 hours beating the </b><b><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i></b><b> campaign</b>. This makes it a pretty beefy experience in an age where many 3D platformers come in at half that length or less. And that’s just for the base adventure! There’s still a ton of monkeying around to do beyond that.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-amiibo-letters-ball-outfit-1851786640">Here’s What Amiibos Can Do For You In <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i></a></p> <p><i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i>‘s world is immensely dense with extra things you can find to do beyond just reaching the end of its campaign. It is a 3D platformer, after all, so it wouldn’t be complete without a treasure trove of stuff to collect—though I hope that’s not bringing back any bad memories of <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> and its thousands of collectibles.</p>

 <p>You can opt to tackle finding everything in <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> during your initial playthrough, or you can dive back in after beating the main story. However you go about it, there’s a great time to be had tracking down all the Golden Bananas, Banandium Gems, music discs, and fossils in the game.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-co-op-support-gameshare-pauline-1851787349">Don’t Sleep On <i>Donkey Kong Banana</i>’s Co-Op Mode</a></p> <p>And while they’re all fun to find, definitely don’t pass up any opportunities to get fossils, even if you’re just trying to mainline the campaign. They’re cool because you can use them to unlock new outfits for DK and Pauline, which you can then mix and match to your fashion tastes. But more importantly, they often sport helpful passive bonuses like improved swimming speed or reduced damage from poison. Any bit of help you can get for survivability is a good thing, yeah?</p> <p>Whether you’re rushing through the campaign or trying to go for 100%, you can start bashing your way through <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> right away. The game is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <p>Animal rights campaign group PETA is calling on Nintendo to remove <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s Cow's nose ring.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.peta.org/news/peta-mario-kart-world-controversy-cow-nose/">statement</a>, PETA said no real-world cow would sport Cow's "goofy grin" if they were forced to wear a ring, "a tool of cruelty that causes lasting pain and discomfort", and wrote to Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa earlier this week to explain that "nose rings are forcibly pierced through one of the most sensitive parts of a cow's body", often used to drag or control cows ans bulls "to their deaths".</p>

<p>"We know Mario Kart World is just a game – and that's exactly why Cow’s nose ring needs to go," the organisation said. "Mario Kart is supposed to be a fun escape, not a reminder of the painful tools used on cows in the meat and dairy industries. No one wants to think about animal suffering while zipping around a race track."</p><p>The dairy industry also reportedly clips "spiked nose rings on baby cows so that the comforting act of nursing from their mother causes her pain and the baby is rejected and kicked away. To control bulls, a chain might be fastened from the nose ring to the bull’s horn for even more pain-driven control".</p>
<p>"It's not a style choice," the organisation added, "It's a cruel tool used to control and hurt cows in the meat and dairy industries, which causes lasting pain and discomfort."</p>
<p>PETA has previously taken action against other games, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, which it said encouraged "abusive behaviour toward fish and insects [...] tearing wildlife out of their homes and display them in cramped cases in a museum". It's also launched campaigns against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> and Hunting Simulator 2.</p>
<p>Nintendo sold 5.82m <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of Mario Kart World, meaning the launch title had an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>

<p>After the success of <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2</i> in 2020, it was only a matter of time before more of the famous skater’s beloved games got the remake treatment. After nearly five years, <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> has finally ollied onto the scene sporting a fresh coat of paint and a wide variety of enhancements to make it the best way to experience two skating classics.</p> <p>But if you have some friends who play their games on a different platform than you, you may be left wondering whether you can get into multiplayer matches with them in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i>. You might also be curious just how long these two games will last you. Let’s dive into everything you need to know about this classic skating experience.</p> <h2><span id="does-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3-+-4-support-crossplay"></span>Does <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> support crossplay?<span></span></h2> <p>If you’re hoping you can hop online and skate with friends who game on other platforms, well, you’re in luck! <b><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i></b><b> has full crossplay support across all platforms</b>. This means you can easily hop into multiplayer games with up to seven other players across all consoles and PC, opening up plenty of opportunities for grinding rails and popping tricks together.</p>

 <h2><span id="does-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3-+-4-support-crossprogression"></span>Does <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i> support cross-progression?<span></span></h2> <p>While playing with anyone you want online is a huge win for virtual skaters everywhere, things don’t fare quite as well for cross-progression fans. <b><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i></b><b> does not support cross-progression at all</b>. As a result, any progress you make on one platform will not carry over to another, meaning you’ll need to start over entirely if you pick up the game on more than one device.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-skaters-are-in-the-games"></span>How many skaters are in the games?<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000618079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618079"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618079">© Screenshot: Iron Galaxy Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><i>THPS 3 + 4</i> will give you a total of 29 skaters to choose from, with a few hidden ones you can unlock as well.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Andrew Reynolds</li> <li aria-level="1">Aori Nishimura</li> <li aria-level="1">Aurélien Giraud</li> <li aria-level="1">Bob Burnquist</li> <li aria-level="1">Bucky Lasek</li> <li aria-level="1">Chad Muska</li> <li aria-level="1">Chloe Covell</li> <li aria-level="1">Elissa Steamer</li> <li aria-level="1">Eric Koston</li> <li aria-level="1">Geoff Rowley</li> <li aria-level="1">Jamie Foy</li> <li aria-level="1">Jamie Thomas</li> <li aria-level="1">Kareem Campbell</li> <li aria-level="1">Leo Baker</li> <li aria-level="1">Leticia Bufoni</li> <li aria-level="1">Lizzie Armanto</li> <li aria-level="1">Margielyn Didal</li> <li aria-level="1">Nora Vasconcellos</li> <li aria-level="1">Nyjah Huson</li> <li aria-level="1">Rayssa Leal</li> <li aria-level="1">Riley Hawk</li> <li aria-level="1">Rodney Mullen</li> <li aria-level="1">Rune Glifberg</li> <li aria-level="1">Shane O’Neill</li> <li aria-level="1">Steve Cabellero</li> <li aria-level="1">Tony Hawk</li> <li aria-level="1">Tyshawn Jones</li> <li aria-level="1">Yuto Horigome</li> <li aria-level="1">Zion Wright</li> </ul> <p>You can also unlock:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Andy Anderson</li> <li aria-level="1">Bam Margera</li> <li aria-level="1">Birdman</li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-thps-3-4-officer-dick-unlock-panda-plush-locations-2000614519">Constable Richard (Officer Dick)</a></li> <li aria-level="1">Michelangelo</li> </ul> <p>The Doom Slayer and Revenant from the recent <i>Doom </i>games is also available via the Digital Deluxe Edition.</p>

 <h2><span id="how-long-is-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3+4"></span>How long is <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836"><i>THPS 4 </i>doesn’t have a Career mode</a>, but you’ll still be able to complete certain goals on different parks like Foundry and Shipyard. In <i>THPS 3</i>, there are 9 parks to play on and 10 in <i>THPS 4.</i></p> <p>Each park has ten Standard goals and five Pro goals. It only takes about <b>4-5 hours</b> to complete all of the Standard goals.</p> <p>Once all the Standard goals have been completed, you’ll unlock Pro goals. Even after completing Pro goals, you’ll unlock Platinum goals. Each park has a single one and they usually involve pulling off a certain move somewhere in the park. These steps should take about another <b>5 hours.</b></p>

 <h2><span id="getting-100percent-in-tony-hawk%e2%80%99s-pro-skater-3+4"></span>Getting 100-percent in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000618080" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618080"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618080">© Screenshot: Iron Galaxy Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>After completing all the Pro goals, you’ll unlock Solo Tour, and this is where the real time sink begins. There’s one trophy/achievement called Flying Solo. This requires you to beat the Solo Tour with <b>all 35 characters</b>. Yes, you’ll have to go through this mode at least 35 times. This is easily the most time-consuming part of the journey to unlock all of the achievements.</p> <p>But it’s important to note that you do not need to achieve 100% with every skater, which includes completing things like optional challenges. You only need to complete each skater’s unique career path to count towards Flying Solo.You do NOT need 100% with each skater. Just complete their unique career path once.</p>

 <p>Fortunately, there are no missable trophies/achievements so you can tackle them in any order you wish. There are also no difficulty-related ones, so you can customize the settings to your liking without having to worry. Overall, getting all of the trophies/achievements should take you between <b>25-35 hours.</b></p> <p>However, there are certain assist mods like Perfect Rail Balance and Instant Quick Recovery that can void trophies/achievements. There are two of them, which are “Extra Ball” and “Unprecedented.” Their descriptions specifically state that you cannot have assist mods activated..</p>

 <p><b>Extra Ball: </b>“Without Assist Mods, score 1,000,000 or over in Pinball.”<br> <b>Unprecedented:</b> “Without Assist Mods, earn a score of 10,000,000 in any park in a 2-minute session or single combo.”</p> <p>It seems like these two are the only ones impacted by assist mods, so you can turn them on when going for any other trophies/achievements. Good luck, and have fun!</p> <hr> <p>If you’re ready to team up with some pals and hit some skateparks and beyond in <i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</i>, you can get started right away. The game is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>
