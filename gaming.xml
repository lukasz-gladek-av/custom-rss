In reality, it’s primarily a speaker that can connect to sources over Bluetooth, a USB cable, or an analog audio cable, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Speakers-in-the-design-of-a-gaming-PC-Edifier-New-Cyber-displays-CPU-load-via-2-8-inch-display.1134125.0.html">as spotted by <em>Notebookcheck</em></a>. The <a href="https://www.edifier.com/cn/product/product-866.html">Huazai New Cyber speaker</a> is currently available in China 1,499 yuan, or around $210 in aurora white and phantom black color options. It’s unclear if the company plans a wider global release.</p><p>The Cyber speaker pairs a 4-inch subwoofer on the with three passive radiators to further boost lower frequencies and two 52mm mid-high range drivers. Those are all hidden on the lower half of the speaker behind a fabric screen, while the upper portion features electronics like amplifiers, a power supply, braided speaker cables, and a signal processor that are arranged and mounted to look like components you’ll find inside a gaming PC such as a graphics card and memory slots.</p><p>There are five circular RGB lighting elements with animated effects that make them appear to spin, mimicking the appearance of cooling fans, while a 2.8-inch screen can be used as a decorative element displaying images, screensavers, or custom messages. But it has some practical uses, too, such as showing performance metrics like CPU, RAM, and GPU usage while the speaker is connected to an actual computer with a USB cable, or song lyrics while streaming music from a smartphone.</p><p>The Cyber speaker’s footprint is comparable to bookshelf speakers which are often used as part of desktop PC setups. But to expand its usefulness while it’s gobbling up a sizable chunk of your desktop real estate, Edifier includes an additional USB-A and USB-C port you can use to charge other devices.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/798148/edifier-huazai-new-cyber-speaker-bluetooth-gaming-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last week, a Portland protestor named Seth Todd showed up at the ICE protests in the Oregon city dressed up in an inflatable frog costume. Footage of armed soldiers backing up as the protester confidently walked toward them went viral on social media, along with a video of an agent spraying pepper spray into the costume’s air filter. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-autism-tylenol-press-conference-reaction-jokes-2000627950"><span>President Donald Trump</span></a><span> has been trying to </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/portland-oregon-trump-history"><span>paint a grim picture of the protests</span></a><span>, saying the city has become “war-ravaged,” but seeing a protestor dressed in a frog costume tells another story. Now, the frog costume has inspired dozens of other Portland citizens to dress up as animals as they continue to fight against ICE and America’s continued descent into fascism.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><i><span>The Oregonian</span></i><span>, a local outlet in Portland, interviewed several protesters last night, October 9, who came to the ICE facility dressed up as frogs in an act of solidarity.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OMG LMAO there is now a Portland Frog Brigade outside of the ICE facility <a href="https://t.co/0jCvc6SXnc">pic.twitter.com/0jCvc6SXnc</a></p> <p>— Wu Tang is for the Children (@WUTangKids) <a href="https://twitter.com/WUTangKids/status/1976497220611666134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The frog has become a symbol of what’s going on down here,” one costume-wearing protestor told </span><i><span>The Oregonian</span></i><span>. “[We’re here to protest] the insane government overreach that’s going on in this place and the fact that they’re calling Portland an ‘explosive fire-ridden warland.’ Which it’s not, because we’re here.”</span></p>   <p><span>While some protesters are showing up in frog costumes as a direct homage to the original, many Portland residents are simply dressing up in whatever inflatable costumes they can find. </span><i><span>The Oregonian</span></i><span>’s video shows people dressed as a shark, bear, peacock, and a dinosaur. The outlet reports that the armed federal officers “retreated” without interacting with the costume party outside.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Portland ICE protests have been ongoing since June, and while the Trump administration would have you believe that Portland citizens have become violent and dangerous, videos keep popping up showing that the people aren’t the ones instigating any violence. Instead, they show things like costumed protesters doing a dance battle.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The videos and photos of Seth Todd’s original appearance as the frog at a protest have spawned art, with supporters calling the character a new symbol in the fight against ICE and American fascism.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shout out to the Portland frog 🐸 <a href="https://t.co/fhkimqH3bY">pic.twitter.com/fhkimqH3bY</a></p> <p>— Not Krime (@NotKrime_1) <a href="https://twitter.com/NotKrime_1/status/1976236960575521142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">“𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐠 🐸 vs 🧊❄️”<br>I stand with frog dude…</p> <p>also, tell me why they pepper sprayed his air hole???<br>how is any of this real life???????</p> <p>Stay strong <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Portland?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Portland</a> <a href="https://t.co/EDoAmcUVaq">pic.twitter.com/EDoAmcUVaq</a></p> <p>— NIKKOLAS SMITH (@4NIKKOLAS) <a href="https://twitter.com/4NIKKOLAS/status/1975656953109225944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>       <p><span>Todd has said in follow-up interviews that the pepper spray, while “immature” and “unnecessary” on the agent’s part, only gave him a brief coughing fit and discomfort.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has officially launched worldwide. Even though it has a shiny new campaign, everyone wants to play online multiplayer. Unfortunately, the EA servers are biting back, so let’s check why you can’t play Battlefield 6 right now, and what’s happening with the server queues.</p>



<p>It was claimed by a Battlefield 6 dev that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers ‘Should be’ ready for launch day</a>. This was not the case as players were left queuing for the brand-new game. Messages don’t always spread very quickly or widely. Meaning, many of you Battlefield 6 owners have been left in the dark over the game’s servers and long queues.</p>



<p>This quick explainer should help you if you’re one of the many having trouble with BF 6 servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-get-into-battlefield-6-servers-right-now-are-they-down">Why Can’t I Get Into Battlefield 6 Servers Right Now? Are They Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a war, in more ways than one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 launch day queues are excessive because so many people are trying to play the game at once. The player base is so big that it’s overloading the EA servers, meaning players have to wait for other players to quit the game before being able to play.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re being met with a “Game Servers Full” screen when trying to play <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, this is because the game’s maximum occupancy has been reached. The servers physically can’t handle any more players. It’s not because they’re down, they’re just full.</p>



<p>Again, EA was confident the servers would be ready, but it hasn’t worked out like that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-the-battlefield-6-server-queue">How Long is The Battlefield 6 Server Queue?</h2>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 launch day queue is several hundred thousand players deep at times, meaning you could potentially be waiting a long time to play Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>Consider these queues like a random ballot: Some people got in right away, and some of you could potentially have to wait 10 minutes, all the way up to an hour or more, if you’re unlucky. The server queues will likely never be this bad again, and it’s up to EA to add more servers and allow more people into the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-right-now">How To Play Battlefield 6 Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>The only way to play Battlefield 6 online multiplayer right now is to wait in the queue until it’s your turn to get in.</strong></p>



<p>We absolutely understand this isn’t the answer you want—<em>believe us</em>. But it’s the simple reality of the situation. Battlefield 6 is one of the hottest game launches of 2025. The beta broke record numbers, and this launch was always going to be fierce.</p>



<p>Battlefield Studios did issue a warning ahead of launch, but it hasn’t spread as quickly as the company probably would’ve liked.</p>

                <p>Once Battlefield 6 players start digging into user-created Portal content, they'll find that someone already made a familiar map from Battlefield's biggest competitor.</p><p>As Portal tools were already available a day before the release of Battlefield 6 itself, creator DANNYonPC took it upon himself to recreate Call of Duty's Shipment map using the Portal editor. In a YouTube video, the creator specified that this version of Shipment is based on the iteration seen in the 2019 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot, which added some extra routes on higher ground.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZvmYdnQ_d0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FZvmYdnQ_d0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>First appearing in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Shipment has brought its simple layout and unique brand of chaos to several titles, only rivaled by Nuketown in number of reappearances.</p><p>Shipment is a sensible first project to make in a map editor, given the map's tight quarters. Its small space almost always leads to frantic and explosive encounters where it's hard to last even a full minute before being gunned down or blown up. Arguably, Shipment is the antithesis of Battlefield's gameplay, which is more focused on large-scale encounters in a wide area.</p><p>With this creator revealing the map before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-times-seemingly-revealed-and-there-is-no-early-access/1100-6535079/" data-ref-id="1100-6535079">Battlefield 6 went live</a>, there was no actual gameplay footage in this Battlefield-ized Shipment, but people were already joking about it on social media, with user <a href="https://x.com/BrokenMachine/status/1976427319356203379" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BrokenMachine</a> on X remarking: "We got Shipment in Battlefield 6 before GTA 6."</p><p>And that isn't all that happened to the game pre-launch--according to a report, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-generated-100-million-on-steam-from-pre-sales-report/1100-6535361/" data-ref-id="1100-6535361">Battlefield 6 already made $100 million</a> in revenue from pre-sales alone.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-workers-condemn-leadership%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98disrespect-and-mistreatment%E2%80%99-in-open-letter.1321966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers laid off from <em>MindsEye</em> developer Build A Rocket Boy <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have sent an open letter</a> and launched legal action against the company. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain’s Game Workers group, representing 93 current and former workers who signed the open letter, announced Friday that they're filing "legal action" against Build A Rocket Boy for the "mishandling of the redundancy process."</p><p>Shortly after the launch of <em>MindsEye</em> in June, Build A Rocket Boy announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had begun a redundancy process at the company</a>, a notice period required by law in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-heartbroken-amid-troubled-launch-as-players-report-success-with-refunds-and-sponsored-streams-are-canceled-last-minute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>MindsEye</em>'s launch went poorly</a>, and the studio began work on fixing the issues with patches. The studio, founded in 2018 and based in Scotland, was founded by Leslie Benzies, the former Rockstar North president who was heavily involved in the Grand Theft Auto games. <em>MindsEye </em>is the first project from the studio, and part of a larger project called <em>Everywhere</em>, which is intended to be both a massively multiplayer online game and a game platform.</p><p>More than 250 workers were ultimately laid off, according to the IWGB. The union wrote in a press release that these layoffs <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/everywhere/build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were preceded by an "initial round of layoffs"</a> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/build-a-rocket-boy-lands-110-million-in-funding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following $110 million in funding</a> announced in January 2024. IWGB writes in its press release that the legal actions involve “failure to carry out fair consultation ahead of redundancies as well as multiple cases of unfair dismissal.” Aftermath has reached out for more information.&nbsp;</p><p>Workers write in the open letter that Build A Rocket Boy was plagued with a "lack of transparency and communication," "unbearable levels of overtime" in which every employee was allegedly asked to work an extra eight hours per week, "disastrous handling of redundancies," and "many other issues." The workers write that Benzies and Build A Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard "repeatedly refused to listen to [their] workforce’s years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade."</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Build A Rocket Boy for comment.</p><p>“The callousness shown by management towards staff at Build A Rocket Boy is truly awful," former Build A Rocket Boy data analyst Ben Newbon wrote in a statement sent to Aftermath via email. "Even before the disastrous launch of <em>MindsEye</em>, staff had suffered months of crunch, resulting in some horrific mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the typical widespread burnout. Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game's failure and instead blamed <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/mindseye-boss-reportedly-blames-its-failure-on-saboteurs-and-says-a-re-launch-is-in-the-works-even-as-the-entire-development-studio-is-at-risk-of-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saboteurs</a>, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this. The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand.”</p><p>IWGB is asking Build A Rocket Boy leadership for “a public apology for this mistreatment of employees and proper compensation for laid-off employees;”&nbsp; for remaining employees on redundancy notices to work through that period or receive payment for the period instead; "a concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union;" and a "commitment to use official external partners to action any future redundancies and prevent unfair treatment."</p><p>"In my experience, Build A Rocket Boy has shown little regard for the wellbeing of its staff," former Build A Rocket Boy audio software engineer Isaac Hudd said in a statement. "Many fantastic, hard-working developers have felt used and discarded, while public statements of care have not matched the reality of working conditions. A pattern of poor decisions from senior management has led to a disappointing launch and ongoing challenges for both players and employees. Having supported many of my colleagues through the recent redundancy process, I have seen how damaging these practices can be. I will continue to speak out until this industry treats its people with the respect they deserve."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review"><h3>100 Meters Is A Soulful Gem About The Poetry Of Running</h3></a><p>Studio Rock’N Roll Mountain’s rotoscope take on Uoto’s track manga unearths raw truths and soulful cadence with every thunderous footfall</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chess-dungeon-crawler-yeah"><h3>Chess Dungeon Crawler, Yeah</h3></a><p>Below the Crown combines roguelike hallmarks with chess</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/mindseye-igwb-game-workers-open-letter-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’m looking forward to a weekend filled with a bunch of squad-based shooter action, with the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">Battlefield 6</a>. There’s always a bit of a disconnect between playing shooters for review, where I’m turning on streamer modes to hide user names and being a lone wolf most of the time, and then playing after release where I can join a party and voice chat.</p>
<p>But that’s not all I’ll be playing, because I’ve still got reviews of the daft walking simulator Baby Steps and the UGC dungeon crawler King of Meat to finally wrap up.</p>

<p>It’s been a big jumble of games for <strong>Gamoc</strong> this week, who’s returned to Atomfall: The Red Strain DLC, and had Dreams of Another and Rise of Industry on the go for upcoming reviews. Add some spooky fun times with Phasmophobia, wand waving in Beat Saber and some VR shooty stuff in Synapse, and he’s had a busy gaming week!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong>, meanwhile, reviewed the decidedly average <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/blood-of-mehran-review/">Blood of Mehran</a>, and swiftly went back to Ghost of Yotei to mop up the last few things he needed to grab the platinum trophy! After all that modern gaming, he needed something a bit older, with Dark Void and Spec Ops: The Line – “Dark Void is very average but had some fun ideas though the aerial combat induced some motion sickness. Spec Ops The Line holds up well with the messaging relevant as ever.”</p>


<p>Always finding new beat ’em ups to batter around, <strong>Ade</strong> played the “rogue ’em up” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/absolum-review/">Absolum</a>. It’s not perfect, but “It’s a really fun game, well worth a look, even with a few too many issues holding it back from greatness.” To make up for those weaknesses, he also played more Hades 2. And when not playing Absolum with Ade, <strong>Laura</strong> has been ” Hoovering slimes, and solving ghost crimes” in Slime Rancher 2 and Banishers.</p>
<p>With Battlefield 6 on his horizon, <strong>Jim</strong> booted up Battlefield 1 and immediately got his butt kicked. So he played Ghost of Yotei, and has thoroughly enjoyed his time with it – “I dig the freefrom structure which was interestingly a complaint I had about Assassin’s Creed Shadows.”</p>

<p>It was a bunch more Digimon Story Time Stranger for <strong>Jason</strong>, who says it’s up there as his Game of the Year. “Something I didn’t mention in the review is how good the grind is once you hit just before the end game, as you can just hop around in the story grinding and doing side quests.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Steve</strong> this week, who’s been enjoying By Sweet Carole’s Gothic Disney vibes, and revisiting Yooka-Replaylee which, aside from the poor title, promises a lot of improvements over the original version. And then, of course, there’s been a ton of Steam Next Fest demos ahead of next week, and a bunch of indie horror games for this time of year!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy's debut title, MindsEye, is likely to finish 2025 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=15">as the worst-rated game this year</a> and one of the year's biggest flops. Prior to release, there was plenty of hype around it due to former Grand Theft Auto producer and Build a Rocket Boy founder, Leslie Benzies, leading the charge at the studio alongside Mark Gerhard. But even before the game was out, signs began to appear online that things weren't going well at Build a Rocket Boy.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">Negative early previews, combined with a launch trailer that failed to impress</a>, and a lack of information on the game so close to its release, gave players waiting to grab MindsEye misgivings about the game, to say the least. Then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two chief executives at Build a Rocket Boy left the studio</a> just two weeks before MindsEye's launch, which came shortly after <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game got out into the wild early</a>, and players had begun posting clips of the severe technical issues the game had and its lacking gameplay.</p>



<p>A statement from Build a Rocket Boy claiming a day one patch would solve these issues fell on deaf ears, especially since when that day one patch came, it didn't do what Build a Rocket Boy promised, and the game was still riddled with issues. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">studio released a statement committing to fixing it</a>, saying they were "<em>heartbroken</em>" over the state of the game's launch, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation had begun giving players who purchased the game refunds if they wanted one</a>.</p>



<p>Leslie Benzies <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/">pointed at internal and external saboteurs for the poor state of the game</a> (which he had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">already done when MindsEye was getting negative previews</a>), but <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">after mass layoffs were confirmed at the studio</a> and reports that the game's flop could push IO Interactive, the game's publisher and the first game published by the Hitman devs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-disastrous-launch-io-ionteractive-publishing/">to abandon its publishing arm</a>, former and current Build a Rocket Boy developers have laid the blame for the studio's struggles where it arguably should fall: with its leaders.</p>



<p>The buck has to stop somewhere, usually with the people who have the letters 'CEO' in front of their name, and according to <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">93 former and current Build a Rocket Boy developers in an open letter</a>, that's exactly who is to blame.</p>



<p>"<em>Employees and ex-employees at Build a Rocket Boy (BARB), together with the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB), are writing to address the longstanding disrespect and mistreatment of your staff</em>," the letter, which is titled 'Open Letter to the Executive Leadership at Build a Rocket Boy', begins.</p>



<p>"<em>For years, you have expected them to adapt to your every whim, with those in disagreement being shut down or cast aside. We estimate a UK-majority of the 250-300 workers across the company have now lost their livelihoods. These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade.</em>"</p>



<p>The letter goes on to directly call out three key faults in leadership, including "<em>lack of transparency and communication,</em>" "<em>unbearable levels of overtime</em>," and "<em>disastrous handling of redundancies</em>," before continuing that these are just some of the more public faults.</p>



<p>"<em>Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into. BARB needs to change. CEOs need to take a backseat and allow the skilled people who remain at the company to forge the path ahead</em>."</p>



<p>The developers also name four demands they have of leadership:</p>



<ol>
<li>A public apology for this mistreatment of employees and proper compensation for laid-off employees</li>



<li>The option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work their notice period or take Payment in Lieu of Notice (PILON)</li>



<li>A concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union</li>



<li>A commitment to use official external partners to action any future redundancies and prevent unfair treatment</li>
</ol>



<p>The developers close off the letter by saying, "<em>Mark Gerhard and Leslie Benzies, you often refer to your employees as 'family.' But we ask you to consider; is this really how you treat your own?</em>"</p>



<p>Way before any of this happened, when Build a Rocket Boy was in its earliest days, Leslie Benzies and the studio's leadership <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-series-former-producers-build-a-rocket-boy-completes-110-million-series-d-fundraising/">secured $110 million in funding for the studio and its debut projects</a>. With Benzies name attached to the studio, and the promise of a new Grand Theft Auto-sized game, there was a lot of excitement around what Build a Rocket Boy could become.</p>



<p>Now, it seems like the only thing it'll become is another failed studio, unless something drastically changes. </p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/797879/fractal-design-scape-pc-gaming-headset</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fractal%E2%80%99s-first-gaming-headset-is-as-refreshingly-elegant-as-its-pc-cases.1321951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Not many gaming headsets have a Scandinavian minimalist aesthetic, which is why Fractal’s $199.99 Scape caught my eye. Like many of <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/">Fractal’s PC cases</a>, this headset looks more sophisticated than you might expect from gaming gear, with clean lines and simplistic color schemes that might blend in better with your furniture and desk setup.</p><p>I’ve spent the last few weeks using the Scape at work and while playing games, and it’s among the best that I’ve ever tested in this price range. The fit and finish are impressive for a first-gen device from a company with no lineage in audio hardware. Its sleek design comes in gray or black, with minimal LEDs that add a subtle glow around the bottom edge of the ear cups (these are the first LEDs in a headset I haven’t wanted to immediately switch off). It has a chunkier version of Apple’s Digital Crown on the back of its left ear cup. The knob controls volume and can be clicked to pause and resume content (double- or triple-clicking skips and reverses songs, respectively).</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Nzk3ODg4"><p><span>$<!-- -->200</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great sound</li><li>Sleek charging cradle</li><li>Web-based settings customization</li><li>Has a built-in mic for when boom mic is detached</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No ANC </li><li>Lie-flat ear cups would have been nice</li><li>Can’t do 2.4GHz and Bluetooth concurrently</li></ul></div></div></div><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>The knob is great for small volume adjustments, and to play, pause, or skip tunes.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>This headset features a button on its right ear cup that lets you toggle between three premade audio equalizer settings. It’s great to have these controls on the hardware, not just buried within a companion app. And configuring the Scape feels as elegant as using it. Everything —including customizing those EQ presets — is handled by a web tool called Adjust Pro. It also lets you tweak the mic’s sidetone, adjust the headset’s LED lighting (you can opt for one of 10 tasteful themes, including “campfire,” and “northern lights,” set it to a custom color and pattern, or turn it off), and install firmware updates when needed. You can even download a portable version of the Adjust Pro app that works without installation or an internet connection. It’s all very thoughtfully designed.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>In Adjust Pro, you can select from different lighting themes for the LEDs or turn them off.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>I like that Fractal gives you two mic options. You can use the flexible flip-to-mute boom mic for superior voice quality, or detach it to enable the Scape’s built-in microphone. Not many headsets allow for this level of flexibility, but we’re seeing it on occasion with models built to pass as over-ear headphones in public; SteelSeries’ new $600 Arctis Nova Elite wireless headset is the most recent example. The recording quality from the Scape’s boom is serviceable (the built-in mic is less good, but works in a pinch). Pressing and holding the mute button toggles microphone noise cancellation. I have an oscillating fan going in my office, and the setting mostly tuned it out. You can adjust the amount of sidetone in the web app — the higher the value, the more you’ll be able to hear your own voice (and maybe your breathing, too) through the headset, along with more background noise.</p><p>Fractal advertises over 40 hours of battery life with the RGB lights off, or around 24 hours with them on. Even with them on, the headset had no issue surviving a few full days of work, as well as a weekend full of gaming, before needing a charge. However, battery life wasn’t a concern during most of my testing because the included magnetic charging dock removes almost all of the friction usually involved in charging a headset. (You can also plug the headset in via the included USB-C cable and keep using it as it charges.) The dock also serves as a stand to keep it off your desk, and as an extender for its 2.4GHz audio transmitter.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Scape automatically shuts off once placed on the dock, turning back on upon removal.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>The dock or just its transmitter can be used with other devices; I’ve been plugging it into my Switch 2 dock after work. Or you can toggle the switch on the Scape’s left ear cup to switch on Bluetooth (it can’t pipe in audio from both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth sources simultaneously). It supports multipoint over Bluetooth, letting it connect to two devices, but it can’t play audio from both devices simultaneously.</p><p>The Scape’s connectivity isn’t nearly as versatile as some recent headsets, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776006/astro-a20x-headset-switch-ps5-xbox-price-features">$179.99 Astro A20 X</a>, which connects via 2.4GHz to a box that lets you swap between two wired sources with a button, and also has Bluetooth (it can’t mix Bluetooth and its Lightspeed wireless, though). <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/788141/steelseries-arctis-nova-elite-review">SteelSeries’ new $599.99 Nova Elite</a> sets a high bar, lettings you hear up to four wireless audio sources mixed together: three inputs plugged into its base station’s USB-C and aux ports, and one over Bluetooth, including three wireless sources, plus audio coming through its base station’s wired aux port (the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132836/steelseries-nova-pro-wireless-review-gaming-bluetooth-anc">2021 Nova Pro Wireless</a> can do three wireless sources simultaneously). I’d love to see Fractal expand the number of devices you can listen to at once in the next version of its headset.</p><p>Fractal’s headset delivers better sound quality than I was expecting for its price. Songs and games come through with warmth and a high level of detail. It’s surprisingly competitive to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on">Sony’s $349.99 InZone H9 II</a>, and it handily beats the Astro A20 X . The big difference is that the H9 II has active noise cancellation, while the Scape doesn’t. It’d be great to have ANC here, but I wouldn’t pay the extra $200 just to get ANC, especially since it’d mean giving up the Scape’s sleek design, clever charging dock, and easy customization.</p><p>The Scape stands out as a great-looking, great-sounding headset that’s nearly effortless to customize. While it lacks some features compared to its pricier competition (concurrent multi-source audio, ear cups that lie flat, and ANC would all be nice), Fractal’s first headset leaves little else to be desired at this price.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/797879/fractal-design-scape-pc-gaming-headset]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following the inauspicious launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> and subsequent layoffs at developers Build A Rocket Boy, 93 current and former staff at the studio have signed an open letter demanding an apology, while accusing Build A Rocket Boy's senior leadership of having "consistently mishandled the redundancy process" and mandating "unbearable levels of overtime" around the game's launch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">The letter</a> calls out Build A Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard and MindsEye director Leslie Benzies by name, and was organised by the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/">Independent Workers of Great Britain</a> union, who announced that the workers will also file legal claims against the studio. The current and former staff accuse the studio's leadership of "longstanding disrespect and mistreatment" and allege that an estimated 250 to 300 workers have been let go as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-director-reportedly-says-the-studio-will-relaunch-the-game-as-around-300-staff-are-at-risk-of-being-laid-off">layoffs at Build a Rocket Boy</a> so far. "These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce’s years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade," the letter reads.</p>
<p>It goes on to make specific accusations about a number of issues, including an alleged mishandling of layoffs. "We believe you have consistently mishandled the redundancy process, causing confusion and distress for all staff," the letter reads.

<p>Build a Rocket Boy's execs are also accused of having enforced eight hours of mandatory overtime per week for every employee in the four months running up to Mindseye's launch, with staff then allegedly struggling to take back time off in lieu they were granted due to requests for them to keep grinding away at "high-priority" work which continued once the game had launched. A lack of transparency and communication on the part of studio leadership is also cited in the latter.</p><p>"Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into," the current and former staff wrote. They call for Build a Rocket Boy to give a public apology, give staff on redundancy notice the option to either work their notice period or take a payment in lieu of notice, commit to using "official external partners" for any future redundancies. "A concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union," rounds out that list.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Build a Rocket Boy and Mindseye publishers IO Interactive for comment.</p>

              <p>Let’s rewind time for a moment. Remember when cell phones first passed that threshold where they stopped being a luxury and became something that just everyone had? They weren’t smart yet, they were just phones. And for those first several years, each iteration got smaller and smaller. Screens weren’t important. Customers prioritized the convenience of being able to fit your phone in any pocket. They only started trending upwards in size when we started to be able to access the internet, and watch videos. Social media became phone-first in design and manufacturers began making the screens bigger to accommodate a better experience when glued to your screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4691/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>
<p>Though, the advent of the smartphone has not eliminated the benefits of a smaller device. Some of us still would prefer to have something less intrusive. It might also help us reduce our embarrassingly high screen-times to switch over to a phone that isn’t designed to keep out attention for 24 hours a day. That’s where the NanoPhone shines. It’s on sale over at StackSocial at the moment. It’s already starting as an extremely affordable price relative to other smartphones on the market — $200 — but has come down to less than half that. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4691/">For a limited time, you can snag yourself this mini 4G smartphone for only $90.</a></p>

<h2>The Size of a Credit Card</h2>
<p>The NanoPhone is a fully functional smartphone that comes in an incredible compact form factor Its touchscreen only measures in at three inches across, but it still presents in HD. It weighs under three ounces and can be fit reasonably into your pocket without taking up the whole thing.</p>
<p>The cameras are perfectly serviceable for a phone at this price point. You’d be working with a 5MP lens on the back of the device with a 2MP selfie cameras on front for quick pics and video calls. The phone’s 2,000mAh batter will last your through the day and the phone recharges over the now standard USB-C cable.</p>



<p>This phone supports 4G LTE and data plans with most cellular providers. It’s SIM card-ready right out of the box, able to be set up with Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and all other US carriers. You can even use it with budget and no-contract service providers including Cricket, Boost, Visible, and Mint.</p>
<p>The phone is running Android 10 so you can use a whole slew of your favorite apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, X (The Everything App), YouTube, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement by ARC Raiders reveals the Expedition Project, a new way to incorporate optional progression wipes. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders is all set to release on October 30, 2025, and the developers recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> why things went silent at the studio: they had dipped into the PvP pot for the game’s future. Now, they have provided players with new details about the progression wipe system, and that it isn’t mandatory. </p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-expedition-project-makes-wipes-optional">ARC Raiders Expedition Project Makes Wipes Optional </h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy blog post</a> by ARC Raiders design director Virgil, it was revealed how the game will handle progression wipes. The developers had already stated that they do not intend to do mandatory wipes and have stuck to their words. They understand the benefits of global wipes, as they provide experienced players with a fresh game; however, it doesn’t cater to players who don’t have much time to play. </p>



<p>The game features a ‘Projects’ feature that players can access at level 20. The first major project in this section is the Expedition Project, and once players complete it, they can reset their character. After completing a reset, players can do it again by completing another one of these projects. Expedition Project will operate on a roughly 8-week cycle, during which players can make progress towards their project. </p>



<p>Once the 8 weeks are complete, players will have the option to finalize the project for an additional week. If they have fulfilled all the project’s requirements, they can finalise it. If the player’s project isn’t ready during this window, their progress will be retained, and they can continue working on it until the next finalisation window. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-be-kept-and-removed-in-arc-raiders-progression-wipes">What Will Be Kept and Removed in ARC Raiders Progression Wipes</h2>



<p>Anything that is related to the character’s progress will be wiped, including levels, skills, items/inventory, workshop, crafting capabilities, etc. Any cosmetics earned or purchased, achievements, rankings, etc., will be retained. “Anything rooted solely in the metagame or involving real money will be preserved.” After completing their Expedition Project, players will be able to skip most of the onboarding and tutorial steps, which include unlocking certain features, maps, etc. </p>



<h2 id="h-benefits-of-completing-expedition-projects">Benefits of Completing Expedition Projects</h2>



<p>Players who complete Expedition Projects in ARC Raiders will receive some benefits and rewards; these are yet to be finalised, but these are the type of rewards players can expect: Permanent account unlocks for each completed Expedition, unique cosmetic rewards for completed Expeditions, account “buffs” that are applied for the duration of the following Expedition cycle, And sequential completions of the Expedition Project increase the magnitude of these buffs, up to a limit.</p>



<p>In other news, here’s why ARC Raiders was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">censored in Black Ops 7.</a> What are your thoughts on ARC Raiders featuring optional progression wipes?

            <p>Developers on the ill-fated action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> have signed an open letter to developer Build A Rocket Boy's executive leadership, citing "longstanding disrespect and mistreatment" of staff.</p>
<p>The letter has been signed by 93 current and former employees of Build A Rocket Boy, along with the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain union.</p>
<p>Following its disastrous launch earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developer-reportedly-prepping-for-layoffs-after-botched-launch">studio confirmed the redundancy process had begun</a>. In the open letter, employees claim an estimated 250-300 workers across the company have now lost their livelihoods.</p>

<p>"These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade," the letter reads.</p>
<p>Complaints from employees include a lack of transparent communication, "unbearable" levels of overtime, and "disastrous handling of redundancies" among others.</p>
<p>"Information has been sparse and vague, with you often making radical changes to the way we worked with little or no input from those affected," the letter reads.</p>
<p>In the four months leading up to launch, a mandatory eight hours of overtime was implemented for every employee. This was given back as time in lieu at a rate of seven hours for every eight worked, but due to "continued requests for extra 'high-priority' work" many employees have not been able to claim this back.</p><p>"We believe you have consistently mishandled the redundancy process, causing confusion and distress for all staff," the letter reads. "Employees have received misinformation, been handed dismissal notices with the wrong notice periods, and been put in the wrong teams so that their performances were scored by the wrong people. These and other errors have potentially resulted in the wrongful dismissal of dozens of staff members."</p>
<p>It continues: "Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into. BARB needs to change. CEOs need to take a backseat and allow the skilled people who remain at the company to forge the path ahead."</p>
<p>The employees have made the following demands:</p>
<ul>
<li>A public apology for this mistreatment of employees and proper compensation for laid-off employees</li>
<li>The option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work their notice period or take Payment in Lieu of Notice</li>
<li>A concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union</li>
<li>A commitment to use official external partners to action any future redundancies and prevent unfair treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>The letter concludes: "Mark Gerhard and Leslie Benzies, you often refer to your employees as 'family'. But we ask you to consider: is this really how you treat your own?"</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We stand in solidarity with employees and ex-employees at Build a Rocket Boy as they file legal claims through our union and publish an open letter, condemning the way in which they’ve been mistreated and discarded by the studio’s millionaire executives. <a href="https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd">https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd</a> <a href="https://t.co/bOOHaQEakQ">pic.twitter.com/bOOHaQEakQ</a></p>— IWGB Game Workers (@IWGB_GW) <a href="https://twitter.com/IWGB_GW/status/1976622237848658253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"The treatment that workers at Build A Rocket Boy have been facing in the past 12 months has been shocking," said IWGB Game Workers chairperson Spring Mcparlin Jones. "They have been routinely belittled, cheated, and manipulated by the company they dedicated years of their lives to. Despite this, they were able to keep trust in each other and work together to fight for fair treatment."</p><p>Scott Alsworth, IWGB Game Workers PR officer, said: "What we've seen at Build A Rocket Boy is the continued normalisation of millionaire executives scapegoating workers for their own mismanagement and profiteering. The sorry financial state the studio now finds itself in is not the work of outside forces or some fifth column of angry trade unionists; it's the unequivocal result of poor leadership, high-level incompetence, and outright contempt. The blame invariably lies with those in charge."</p>
<p>Former BARB employee Isaac Hudd stated the studio has "shown little regard for the wellbeing of its staff" and the disappointing launch was due to a "pattern of poor decisions from senior management". </p>
<p>Ben Newbon, another former employee, added: "The callousness shown by management towards staff at Build A Rocket Boy is truly awful. Even before the disastrous launch of MindsEye, staff had suffered months of crunch, resulting in some horrific mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the typical widespread burnout. Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game's failure and instead blamed saboteurs, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this. The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand.".</p>
<p>Newbon's comments refer to co-CEO Mark Gerhard claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">negative reaction to the game was paid for</a> in a "concerted effort" against the studio.</p>

<p>MindsEye was the debut game from Build A Rocket Boy, meant to kickstart the studio's user-generated metaverse Everywhere.</p>
<p>However, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">plagued with technical issues</a> from its launch and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">critically panned</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Two execs left the studio</a> just one week before the game's debut.</p>
<p>Since its release, the studio promised performance improvements. Yet publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has distanced itself from the project, with CEO Hakan Abrak claiming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launch-what-we-didnt-hope-for-says-io-interactive-ceo-as-publishing-future-in-question">company's future as a publisher was now in question</a>.</p>
<p>Lead actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-actor-feared-he-may-never-work-in-games-again-following-disastrous-launch-but-admits-players-are-entitled-to-their-opinion">Alex Hernandez feared he may never work in games again</a> following the devastating reception to the game.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Build A Rocket Boy for comment on the open letter.</p>

<p>The next game in the nearly 30-year-old Age of Empires franchise is in development, and it will seemingly be using Unreal Engine. That would see the company leave the Essence Engine and Bang Engine, which had been used for Age of Empires 4 and Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition, respectively, behind. </p>



<p>According to multiple job postings on Microsoft’s website, Xbox Game Studios is “hard at work continuing the great legacy of Age of Empires”. As the work continues on the franchise, World’s Edge, the studio behind Age of Empires 4 and the definitive editions of the second and third games, is looking for two positions that specifically call out using Unreal Engine. </p>



<p>The two roles—Pricing Unreal Engineer and Senior Unreal Engineer—require those with <strong>“a background in&nbsp;all aspects of&nbsp;Unreal Engine&nbsp;game&nbsp;development&nbsp;and experience&nbsp;leading external resources.”</strong></p>



<p>No other details on what the future could look like for Age of Empires, but the direction it’s going in, at least when it comes to the tech stack, seems clear. </p>



<p>What do you hope for from the next installment in Age of Empires, seemingly Age of Empires 5?

Right now, Battlefield 6 ranks as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 1 best-selling game on Steam</a> in the US and globally.</p><p>"All signs, at least pre-launch, suggest Battlefield is back in the fight. Our estimates reflect a perfect storm of pent-up demand after years of missteps and a huge potential comeback narrative," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Glenn Israel has worked on the Halo franchise for 17 years, joining Bungie back in 2008 when the studio was known for Halo, and stayed with the series by following it to 343 Industries (now Halo Studios) where he has been since. He is no longer working on the series that he spent nearly two decades with, however, as he announced with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/">a statement on his LinkedIn</a> that he has left Halo Studios, though the statement leaves plenty of questions as to the circumstances under which he is leaving.</p>



<p>"<em>As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe</em>," Israel wrote. "<em>There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year</em>. <em>In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I know that</em> <em>the state of our industry seems dire but never forget that you are free to choose. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values - and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong. As always, I'll be here if you need to talk</em>."</p>



<p>As Israel mentions, he'll share more about the details of his departure at some point in 2026, but his statement also seems to suggest he's not leaving amicably.</p>



<p>It's no secret that 343 Industries/Halo Studios has had its struggles in the last few years, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-joe-staten-joins-netflix-343-creative-director-frank-oconnor-leaves/">key members of the team leaving</a> before Israel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-devs-blame-microsoft-343-industries/">layoffs and allegations towards parent company Microsoft for the studio's internal issues</a>, and fans turning on the studio for decisions <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-devs-blame-microsoft-343-industries/">like leaving behind couch co-op on Halo Infinite</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-microsotrancation-plans-abandoned/">almost including microtransactions in the Master Chief Collection</a>.</p>



<p>The future of the series has been unclear amidst all of this, particularly since Halo Infinite <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-team-fell-short-on-post-launch-plan-retrenched-now-booty/">didn't exactly hit its mark at launch</a>. As far as what we know is next for the series, Halo Studios has committed to sharing more at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">Halo World Championships taking place later this month on October 24</a>, which could also be where <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/">a rumoured remake of Halo Combat Evolved is first revealed</a>.</p>



<p>Whenever Israel is able to share more about his departure, it'll be interesting to see what he touches on and how the changes to the studio and its struggles impacted his decision to leave Halo behind.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-logitech-webcam-works-with-switch-2-and-is-practically-free-compared-to-nintendos-2000633370</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-logitech-webcam-works-with-switch-2-and-is-practically-free-compared-to-nintendo%E2%80%99s.1321864/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you had been hoping to snag yourself some cool new tech gadget on sale during Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days, you’re not out of luck just yet. While the event only extended from October 7 to October 8, some products are still on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/"> This Logitech webcam for example is normally listed at $40, but right now has been marked down by 36% off. That ends up saving you $14 as the price comes down to only $26 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The Logitech Brio 101 is a Full HD 1080p webcam that comes in your choice of either black or white and can be mounted easily on top of your monitor, TV, or laptop screen. The camera utilizes auto-light balance which can on the fly boost brightness and reduce shadows to allow folks you’re on the video call with to see you crystal clear, regardless of the lighting conditions of the room you’re in. Then when no longer in user, the cover slide can be closed over to ensure your privacy when you’re not on a video call.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The webcam has a built-in microphone so you can cut down on the number of peripherals needed to join and Zoom or Discord call with colleagues, friends, or family. It is also compatible with Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and a number of other video conferencing applications.</p>
<h2>Compatible with Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
<p>Nintendo’s follow-up to the immensely successful Switch saw some of the lightest changes from its predecessor. That’s not a bad thing. Many Nintendo fans just wanted more of the same, just on better performing hardware, though Nintendo can’t help themselves but to squeeze in one or two new gimmicks.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 features all new chat functionality including the ability to have video calls with friends. Some games even support integrating your video feed to the gameplay, super imposing your video onto in-game elements. Nintendo has its own proprietary USB camera and a handful of — but not all — third party cameras support the Nintendo Switch 2. Luckily, the Logitech Brio 101 is one of those that is supported on the Nintendo Switch 2, so you can enjoy gaming and chatting with your friends with a webcam at a fraction of the price Nintendo sells its for.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is listed at $55.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/"> The Logitech Brio 101 webcam is usually $40, but with the 36% discount, it comes down to just $24.</a> That’s less than half the price the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera sells for.</p>

              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>revealed at Gamescom earlier this year</span></a><span>, the trailer looked like a blocky version of the </span><i><span>Batman: Arkham </span></i><span>games, which we haven’t gotten a proper sequel to in a decade. Yeah, the name </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span> has been slapped on VR spin-offs and mobile apps, but there hasn’t been an honest-to-god open-world </span><i><span>Batman </span></i><span>action game since </span><i><span>Arkham Knight </span></i><span>in 2015. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gotham-knights-batman-batgirl-nightwing-dlc-wb-games-1850378621"><i><span>Gotham Knights</span></i></a> <span>came close, but was weighed down by loot nonsense and a miserable grind. Rocksteady, the developer of the original trilogy, pivoted to the loot shooter </span><i><span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047"><span>which didn’t go over well</span></a><span>. So there’s been a dearth of interesting </span><i><span>Batman </span></i><span>games in recent years, and while I figured it would come to an end at some point, I just expect the next to come from </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>developer TT Games.</span></p> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span>’s trailer showed the mini-figure version of the Caped Crusader grappling around Gotham, descending upon unsuspecting baddies, and investigating crime scenes just like he did in games like </span><i><span>Arkham City</span></i><span>. I played about 30 minutes of the game, and even though I hadn’t played any of the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games in a decade, my muscle memory kicked in when I was surrounded by a group of minifigure goons and the parry prompt appeared over one of their heads. People joke that </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span>’s beat-em-up combat is a rhythm game because every action, whether it be a punch, the swing of a bat, or the firing of a gun, has an equivalent QTE prompt response coded into Batman’s arsenal of moves. When you really get into the groove, Batman is practically dancing across a battlefield as he dodges, parries, and punches, and even with the more snappy </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>movement, it still feels fluid and rhythmic. It is quite literally an </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game, albeit with the slapstick </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>flair you’ve come to expect from its parodies. Batman’s finishing moves are less of the “you expect me to believe that man isn’t dead?” brutality we see Bruce Wayne dish out in </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span>, and more silly stuff like covering an enemy’s head with a trash can. Foes still break apart like any Lego character would, but I guess if you can just rebuild anything in these games, that’s not </span><i><span>technically </span></i><span>Batman breaking his no-kill rule.</span></p>

  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>comparisons don’t stop at fights, as </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>also has an open world to grapple and glide around. Though the pieced-together Gotham City might not be as atmospheric and dour as Rocksteady’s, getting around the crime-ridden Lego metropolis is just as satisfying. It’s easy to get distracted grappling to every high platform or gliding around with Batman’s wings spread over the city, but </span><i><span>Legacy </span></i><span>has enough of the random crime missions and collectibles that even a detour from your original objective is usually rewarded with something to do. You’re also able to ride around the city in the Batmobile, but I was so caught up in flying around the rooftops that I actually forgot to head to the ground level and drive around. My bad.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>clearly has a lot of </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>influence, it still has </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>foundations. The game can be played with couch co-op or by swapping between characters on the fly if you’re riding solo. The section I played, which had Batman and Commissioner Gordon infiltrating an Ace Chemicals plant, had puzzles that required both characters to solve. Batman’s gadgets can clear certain obstacles–his grappling hook, for instance, letting you pull locks off walls and crates–while Gordon has a gun that can stop up air vents or leaking pipes to clear the way for you to move forward. It’s easy enough to go back and forth between characters, but I imagine those segments will feel more rewarding when you have a second player next to you and it actually feels like a team effort. Gordon is one of several buddy characters Batman will team up with in </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>People might have an image of </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games in their minds as games with simple co-op action and a lot of referential humor, and </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>has all of that. But it’s also the closest thing to an </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game we’ve gotten in years, and what I played so far makes it feel like a competent one. We’ll see how well it holds together or breaks apart when it comes to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2 in 2026.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nearly 100 past and present employees at Mindseye developer Build a Rocket Boy have signed an open letter against the studio for its “longstanding disrespect and mistreatment” of staff.</p>



<p>Published on <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">Friday by the IWGB Game Workers</a>, this letter directly calls out several issues employees claim to have faced from management, including founder Leslie Benzies. </p>



<p>After the poorly received launch of Mindseye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-developerbegins-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Build a Rocket Boy laid off</a> what the union says was 250-300 people because of their refusal to <strong>“listen to your workforce’s years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade.”</strong></p>



<p>The letter says that there was a “lack of transparency and communication”. The employees believe that <strong>“information has been sparse and vague, with you (Benzies) often making radical changes to the way we worked with little or no input from those affected.”</strong></p>



<p>The letter also mentions the studio implementing a mandatory eight hours of overtime per week for every employee in the four months leading up to the game’s launch. Time Off In Lieu was given to the staff at seven hours per every eight worked, but, they say that many employees have yet to be able to use any of the time off because of <strong>“continued requests for extra “high-priority” work, even after launch.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding layoffs, the letter calls what has happened a “disastrous handling”. It’s alleged that employees were given wrong information, including being grouped with the wrong internal teams, and given wrong notice periods, which may have seen a number of employees wrongfully dismissed.</p>



<p>The employees, both current and former, are demanding a public apology for the mistreatment as well as <strong>“proper compensation”</strong> for those who were let go. They are also asking for a meaningful and documented effort to improve conditions within the company that includes acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union, a commitment to using external partners for future redundancies, and the option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work the rest of their time or take Payment in Lieu of Notice.</p>



<p>The letter closes with calling out Benzies and co-CEO Mark Gerhard, saying, “you often refer to your employees as ‘family’. But we ask you to consider; is this really how you treat your own?”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Build a Rocket Boy for comment on the letter. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that the open beta’s maps were intentionally smaller than the ones we get at launch. </p>



<p>With Battlefield 6 launching today, players will be going straight in to check out the maps that weren’t available during the game’s open beta weekends. Some players are so excited, they have already started recreating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a> in the game’s Portal mode. Now, the developers have revealed why they opted for smaller maps in BF6’s open beta. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-open-beta-s-smaller-maps-made-it-easier-to-test-different-aspects-of-the-game">Battlefield 6 Open Beta’s Smaller Maps Made it Easier to Test Different Aspects of the Game </h2>



<p>In a new interview in <a href="https://www.pcgamer-magazine.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer Magazine’s 415 issue</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-devs-say-the-plan-was-to-launch-with-bigger-maps-all-along-and-that-the-betas-notoriously-smaller-maps-were-intentionally-smaller-than-the-ones-we-know-are-coming-in-the-full-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>), the design director for Battlefield 6, Salim Fasahat, explained why the game’s open beta had smaller maps. Fasahat first stated, &nbsp;“They were intentionally smaller than the ones we know are coming.” He added that there were a few reasons behind this decision, including gaining a better understanding of different modes, the scale at which they can operate, which types of maps work, and more. </p>



<p>Fasahat added that the smaller BF6 maps made it “easier to test and focus on gun play.” The whole team is “super excited to have people explore all of those maps.” For those wondering, Manhattan Bridge, Saints Quarter, New Sobek City, Mirak Valley, and Operation Firestorm were not available in the Open Beta. The maps that players have already tested include Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, Liberation Peak, and Empire State. </p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Battlefield 6 have confirmed that the game will not use <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generative AI</a>. Additionally, the Portal community is already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a>.

Together with the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain, the 93 BARB employees and ex-employees have singled out studio leaders Mark Gerhard and former GTA lead developer Leslie Benzies, citing various issues.</p><p>According to the letter, BARB leadership allegedly failed to effectively communicate with workers, and staff were subjected to "unbearable" levels of overtime in the four months leading to the launch of MindsEye. The workers also claim that redundancies have been "mishandled" and have caused distress for all employees.</p><p>"These and many other issues, some of which have been made public already, have caused pain and stress for your employees," <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/" rel="nofollow ">the letter reads</a>. "Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into."</p><p>The workers are demanding a public apology, proper compensation, and several other changes to provide a fair working environment and change the company culture. "Mark Gerhard and Leslie Benzies, you often refer to your employees as 'family.'
