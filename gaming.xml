            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tiktok-ban-trump-bytedance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’ve had better things to do than follow internet drama on a Saturday night, let me catch you up: TikTok went offline Saturday evening, with parent company ByteDance praising Trump. This afternoon, it came back, with parent company ByteDance praising Trump. This is how embarrassing things are going to be for the next four years.</p><p>On Saturday, TikTok users were met with an in-app <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/herbscribner.bsky.social/post/3lg2x5nmdrc2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message</a> announcing that the app was unavailable and reading in part, “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned.” Users didn’t have to stay tuned long, or even wait for Trump to actually take office; today, the company <a href="https://x.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1881030712188346459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>,</p><blockquote><p>In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><strong>(Update 4:10pm-- </strong>Users are also seeing Trump thanked in their now-functioning app, with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/phillewis.bsky.social/post/3lg4k6ulsos2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message</a> reading "As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.! You can continue to create, share, and discover all the things you love on TikTok."<strong>)</strong></p><p>While Google and Apple did in fact remove TikTok from their stores (alongside, to many players’ surprise, mobile game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/511299/marvel-snap-down-bytedance-tiktok-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Marvel Snap</em></a>, which is published by a ByteDance subsidiary), no one seemed particularly keen on enforcing the rule, which required ByteDance to shut TikTok down in the US when it didn’t find a US buyer for the app by January 19. A White House <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-administration-trump-implement-tiktok-ban-rcna188155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> on Friday noted that “actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration.” On <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tiktok-ban-sunday-what-to-know-rcna188256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturday</a>, the White House added that “We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday;” Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-likely-give-tiktok-90-day-extension-avoid-ban-rcna188258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that day that he would likely issue a 90-day extension on the sale deadline once he took office. The initial idea to ban TikTok was actually <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-technology-foreign-policy-politics-business-1f636191b0b9e28c7041fb64fb547801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump’s idea </a>back in 2020, though some Republicans seem to be doing their best to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/numb.comfortab.ly/post/3lg4lnplmg226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory-hole</a> all that.</p><p>Basically, no one really had to do anything here, and yet a lot of things happened, or felt like they happened. It’s the perfect situation for Trump: a lot of chaos and high emotion, with lots of fingers to point and credit to claim. Regular people faced losing something that matters to them; those who haven’t been closely following the whole <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-timeline-ban-biden-india-d3219a32de913f8083612e71ecf1f428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long journey</a> to this moment might be easily convinced that it’s the cruel fault of Biden and the Democrats, who can be cast as out-of-touch elites who have been consistently letting them down. (It doesn’t help that this is, to some extent, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/188333/democrats-break-status-quo-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">true</a>.) Trump could throw around bombastic rhetoric and big promises, aided by companies <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/18/trump-washington-return-inauguration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kissing his ring</a> and parroting his talking points. Neither Trump nor ByteDance did this for the good of everyday TikTok users, but it could <em>feel</em> like a win for them; they get to go back to finding <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/19/tiktok-ban-important-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community</a> and making dance videos, while Trump gets to boost his image and ByteDance, like every other big company, gets to curry favor with his administration. Trump has even been able to tie his inauguration proceedings into TikTok’s return, writing on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113855616848696050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TruthSocial</a> that “Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations.”</p><p>The only thing more embarrassing than having to live through all this is if it actually works, if Trump comes out of this weekend having tricked even one more regular person into thinking he's on their side. I understand why some people would <em>want</em> to believe this narrative, and I understand why the last four years might make them susceptible to it. But hopefully even more people will see it as a warning for how much more bullshit is headed our way, a reminder of how clear-eyed we'll need to be to resist politicians and companies punting us around in their self-serving football game.&nbsp;</p><p>Republicans are<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-2-gop-senators-break-trump-tiktok-extension-rcna188307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> already bickering</a> over it all, with Speaker Johnson claiming he’ll uphold the ban and several Republicans praising “Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft for following the law.” Maybe we’ll at least get some funny TikToks out of whatever happens next.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review"><h3>Grand Theft Hamlet Is A Funny, Touching Take On Shakespeare</h3></a><p>‘We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elon-musk-asmongold-twitch-path-of-exile"><h3>Elon Musk Has Once Again Revealed That He’s A Fraud, This Time By Beefing With A Twitch Streamer</h3></a><p>"He needs to believe, for his own sake, that it’s possible for him to jump into the deep end of anything and excel"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-trump"><h3>What Games Journalism Can Do Now</h3></a><p>Readers, and fellow journalists, are going to need what games journalists know in the face of the upcoming administration</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A Sims fan reckons they've stumbled upon evidence of unannounced MySims games.</p>
<p>According to redditor OyeDiego, pages for the MySims Action Bundle and MySims Beacon Bay briefly popped up on the EA app over the weekend, although neither bundle has been previously confirmed by publisher EA.</p>
<p>To bolster the claim, the poster included a screen recording of what they saw.</p>

<p>"Last night, I found broken pages for MySims Action Bundle and MySims Beacon Bay in the EA app," the poster explained. "Neither had no images nor summaries, just the title, PEGI 7, and a date of 2099.</p>
<p>"It did not leave [sic] me pre-order them, so I saved them to my wish list. Today I couldn't find the games by searching for them, but they were still in my list. But Beacon Bay was causing the app to break. However, the Action Bundle was still intact.</p>
<p>"When I completely restarted the app, both games disappeared from my wishlist and I couldn't find them anymore."</p>

</span></p><p>Whilst the OP was unable to assuage all cynics that the video was genuinely taken of the EA App, one poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/1i3u3op/comment/m7q85zx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> in their defence: "I work as a developer. It would be a lot of work to create an EA app clone just to provide both unfinished pages and 500 error codes. Like, it would take a lot to mimic the UI and setup of the app just for bait.</p>
<p>"I don't see any reason as to why this wouldn’t be real - and the hypothetical response of removing the post kind of pushes people away from wanting to post here over Twitter."</p>
<p>Other fans hypothesise that the action bundle reads as though it's Agents and Skyheroes, whilst <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Beacon_Bay">Beacon Bay</a> is a throwback that only players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a> on Nintendo DS may remember, and could well be a brand-new MySims game.</p><p>Is the video real? Who knows. But with TheSims' 25th anniversary coming up, it's certainly plausible that a bundle of older and fan-favourite games could be on the way. We've reached out to EA and will let you know as and when we know more.</p>
<p>Talking of the 25th anniversary, all that kicks off on 4th February with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">"huge" free The Sims 4 update introducing over 70+ new items</a> spanning both Create a Sim and Build Buy modes. There's talk of turtlenecks and bodysuits, bike shorts, accessories, and hairdos. New furnishings, meanwhile, include "stylish" windows and doors, wood finishes for kitchen cabinets, and even a new playground pirate ship.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-boss-doesnt-rule-out-possible-frame-generation-support-for-rtx-30-series/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At CES 2025, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyxXRXDtcPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Bryan Catanzaro, VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, about the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> and&nbsp;its many improvements to Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Frame Generation.</p>
<p>Catanzaro talked about the new transformer models that are replacing CNN (convolutional neural networks) for Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. These are simply much smarter, can be trained on larger datasets and make better choices as a result, improving historic NVIDIA DLSS shortcomings like shimmering or ghosting. The new Super Resolution model, for instance, has four times more compute compared to the previous one. Catanzaro didn't provide an estimate on how much more rendering time it will cost, but he did say NVIDIA believes it's the best way to play on the new Blackwell-powered GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards that are launching later this month.</p>
<p>Frame Generation is also being overhauled, abandoning the previous model based on the Optical Flow hardware accelerator for an entirely AI-powered solution. Here's why NVIDIA is doing that:</p>
<p><em>When we built NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, we absolutely needed hardware acceleration to compute Optical Flow. We didn't have enough Tensor Cores and we didn't have an Optical Flow algorithm that was good enough. We hadn't developed a real-time Optical Flow algorithm that ran on Tensor Cores that could fit our compute budget. We had the Optical Flow accelerator, which NVIDIA had been building for years as an evolution of our video encoder technology, and it's also been a part of our automotive computer vision acceleration for self-driving cars.</em></p>
<p><em>It made sense for us to use that for NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation. But the difficult part about any sort of hardware implementation of an algorithm like Optical Flow is that it's really difficult to improve it. It is kind of what it is and the failures that arose from that hardware Optical Flow, we couldn't undo them with a smarter neural network until we decided to just replace it and go with a fully AI-based solution, so that's what we've done for Frame Generation in DLSS 4.</em></p>
<p>The new Frame Generation model is heavier on Tensor Cores, but it uses less VRAM, offers improved image quality (which Catanzaro deemed critical, especially for the new Multi Frame Generation available on the new RTX 50 GPUs), and is also more efficient as the cost has been amortized over multiple frames.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DF's Alex Battaglia asked then whether the new model could be ported to older hardware like the GeForce RTX 30 Series, and the head of NVIDIA DLSS didn't close that door.</p>
<p><em>I think this is primarily a question of optimization and also engineering and then the ultimate user experience. We're launching this Frame Generation, the best Multi Frame Generation technology, with the 50 Series, and we'll see what we're able to squeeze out of older hardware in the future.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, when NVIDIA introduced Frame Generation with the GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards, Catanzaro himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-engineer-says-dlss-3-on-older-rtx-gpus-could-theoretically-happen-teases-rtx-i-o-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that the feature was exclusive to then-new GPUs because they had a much improved Optical Flow hardware accelerator than the RTX 30 Series. Back then, he also said it was theoretically possible to port it to older hardware, although it probably wouldn't be as beneficial.</p>
<p>With the new model removing the Optical Flow hardware accelerator, it seems like the door might be open for that to happen. However, Catanzaro also said the Tensor Core requirements are higher, and obviously, the older GPU architecture has worse Tensor Core performance. We'll see if NVIDIA can really make it happen.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Bryan Catanzaro highlighted the importance of decoupling the updated flip metering from the CPU to reduce frame time variability (and, therefore, improve frame pacing) by a factor of five to ten compared to before. Last but not least, he claimed that playing a game with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflex 2</a> (which is also AI-based) feels much more 'connected' and he believes that especially latency-sensitive gamers will love it.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more NVIDIA DLSS 4 coverage on Wccftech as we get closer to the launch of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>

            <p>Team Asobi has casually dropped a never-before-seen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> speedrun stage.</p>
<p>Debuted at this weekend's PlayStation tournament, the challenge - which you can see below - saw speedrunners explore the unfamiliar level to secure the fastest clear time in a bid to win the final.</p>

<p>The two finalists were given five attempts to set the fastest time across a devilishly difficult level, using the flower umbrella and slo-mo to speed up the run as much as possible.</p>
<p>Team Circle's Rhys secured a win with an astonishing run-time of 34.51.6s, narrowly beating Team Square's equally-impressive 34.84.1s.</p>
<p>There was no word from the commentary team on whether the general public will eventually get the chance to run the gauntlet, too, but Bot fans are hopeful Team Asobi hasn't yet given up on patching in a cheeky cameo or two given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-update-teases-surprising-bonus-cameo">several games noted in the credits have yet to be discovered</a>.</p><div>

<p>"I've built my entire working life around [video games], my career dedicated to celebrating the best and highlighting the worst," Tom O wrote in his feature, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2024-astro-bot-made-the-best-play-for-nostalgia-this-year-and-i-dont-care-if-you-think-its-a-big-advert">Astro Bot made the best play for nostalgia this year, and I don't care if you think it's a big advert</a>. "As a job, it's as tiring and exhausting, sometimes exasperating, as any other, and it's easy to lose sight of why I chose this path all those years ago.</p>
<p>"Just for a moment, in the darkened early hours, a dim light from the DualSense painting the room in an ethereal glow, I was 12 again, and it was incredible. For that, I love Astro Bot, and I guess I love PlayStation too."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another 136,000 ranked play accounts have been banned for cheating across both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone.</p>
<p>In a detailed update shared on social media, developer Treyarch said it recognised cheaters "are frustrating and severely impact the experience for our community" but insisted it was addressing the issue, and will continue to do so "throughout 2025".</p>

<p>Part of these efforts include "new layers of security and protections", as well as updated detection models for behavioural systems like aim botting, and "other data points", including "account trust and hardware identifiers to target serial cheaters".</p>
<p>Players can also expect new detection and warning systems for spam reporting and enhanced cross-examination tools to reduce the time it takes to review reports.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Ahead of Season 02’s launch, we’re here to discuss what the various dev teams and studios are doing right now to address what matters to our players today:</p><p>• Cheating and bans<br>• Ability to disable cross-play on consoles in Ranked<br>• Server issues<br>• Quality of life updates<br>•… <a href="https://t.co/O6traEfwwG">https://t.co/O6traEfwwG</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1880372557221884278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>From Season 2, players can expect to see new and improved client and server-side detections and systems, too, as well as "major" kernel-level driver updates that not only improve driver security, but also reinforce the encryption process and introduce a new tampering detection system.</p><p>Treyarch stressed that "malicious reporting is against the security and enforcement policy", adding that when a user spams the report button in-game multiple times against a user – or someone uses an illegal cheat tool to spam 10,000 reports – its system "does not consider more than one single report from a player versus another (despite what cheat developers are telling players when they try to sell their illegal software)".</p>
<p>Interestingly, when a cheater is banned, the developer's system will also "detect other accounts it had regularly partied up with and raise flags for investigation to combat boosting and other cheater behaviour".</p>
<p>"We have seen community questions about detection methods, like IP-based banning," the studio explained. "We do not utilise IP-based bans for anti-cheat because they tend to take action against entire groups within a range that aren't problematic. For example, a college campus or internet café would be swept up in an IP-based ban wave when only a single machine was targeted."</p>
<p>ICYMI, as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 readies for the release of Season 2 on 28th January, developer Treyarch has shared initial details of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-next-zombies-map-is-called-the-tomb-and-plunges-players-into-ancient-catacombs">Zombies mode's next map, The Tomb</a> - which plunges players deep beneath the earth, down into ancient catacombs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-is-already-starting-to-come-back-online-in-the-us/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>TikTok has stated that their services will return online following the services ban earlier today.</p>



<p>The statement came from the official X (formerly Twitter) account of TikTok, which reads:</p>



<p>“In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.”</p>



<p>They continued, “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.”</p>



<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/us-tiktok-ban-statement-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok was forced to limit its service</a> to US residents following the United States’ decision to ban the app due to “safety and security concerns.” Other countries, including the UK have said that they would not follow the US in banning the app, despite widespread reports that US allies may impose similar bans.</p>



<p>Darren Jones, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the UK said cats and dancing videos do not “seem like a national security threat.”</p>



<p>TikTok’s ban was said to impact some 170 million users who use the social media app, with tens of thousands of content creators and small business using it as a source of revenue.</p>



<p>The ban also meant that Marvel Snap, the competitive digital collectible card game developed by Second Dinner, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also banned in the US</a>. Second Dinner, who said they had no idea about the ban, is yet to comment on when Marvel Snap will return to US residents. </p>

			<p>2025 is going to see a lot of massive releases across a multitude of genres. Narrowing it down to the sports and racing games in particular, there are a fair few games that are going to be released this year that will be major hits for petrolheads and sports fans. If you want to know what games you should be putting on your calendar this year, make sure to keep reading for Wccftech's most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a></em></p>

<h2>Assetto Corsa EVO (Out Now on PC via Steam)</h2>
<p>Assetto Corsa is a very popular racing game franchise, and the latest iteration has just been released, albeit on early access. There isn't a date set yet for when Assetto Corsa EVO is going to be on consoles just yet, so those on console will have to wait a little bit longer for this hyperrealistic racing game. What we do know is that Assetto Corsa EVO is set to have its full launch between September and December. The game will feature extensive modding support, as well as consistent updates to keep the game fresh once it has experienced its full launch, when it will include 100 cars and 15 officially licensed circuits (with 5 more tracks following afterward as free updates). Before that, KUNOS <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will add an open world map sometime this Summer</a>.</p>
<p>If you jump in right now, though, you'll already find 20 cars from several classes and 5 circuits across the continents: Laguna Seca (America), Brands Hatch and Imola (Europe), Mount Panorama (Australia), and Suzuka (Japan). When it comes to modes, the early access launch build features Practice sessions, Quick Races, the brand new Driving Academy, and the Hotstint and Test Drive special events.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>WWE 2K25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>WWE is a popular franchise that helps boost profits for both Take-Two Interactive. This game was mentioned during the earnings call, where they mentioned both the potential release of PGA Tour 2K25 and, of course, WWE 2K25. Since 2000, WWE has received a new game every year except for 2021, where there was no game released at all. Since then, it's gone back to regular scheduling, and it's likely that WWE 2K25 will be released this year. It doesn't have a set release date as of yet, but it was mentioned in the earnings call that the game will be released before March 31, 2025. This would make sense, as the past three WWE games (including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-improved WWE 2K24</a>) were all released in early March.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>iRacing NASCAR 25 (Fall 2025 - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>It's been a long time coming, but NASCAR fans are finally getting a new game in the franchise. It's been three years since the last iteration aside from NASCAR 21: Ignition, but most people don't count that as an actual game in the series. iRacing NASCAR 25 was first heard of in 2023, when iRacing purchased the NASCAR license from Motorsport Games. This game will be built in Unreal Engine alongside Monster Games and is currently planned to launch on consoles, while a PC release is still up in the air.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/maxresdefault-14-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (TBA - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>This game was first showcased at The Game Awards 2024, where Sega released a trailer for this upcoming game. The release date is currently unknown, but it is set to debut "soon." All we know is that the developers have promised a distinct racing mechanic that will 'transport Sonic racing fans into a new dimension.'</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be available across all platforms (including Nintendo's) and, like its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/team-sonic-racing-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Sonic Racing</a>, could be the perfect game to get youngsters into gaming and engage in some friendly competition.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wreckfest_2_Keyart-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Wreckfest 2 (TBA 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Throughout the whole sports and racing games genre, there isn't anything quite like Wreckfest. The spiritual successor to FlatOut <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-announced-with-new-car-customization-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returns in 2025</a> after 2018's first installment. We don't know a lot about it yet, although Finnish developer Bugbear Entertainment has promised improved destruction thanks to the more accurate physics engine and better sounds, with the latter being boasted as among the best in a racing title. So far, the main new feature is the ability to customize your vehicle. More info will undoubtedly be shared ahead of the launch.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/19/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban.1086411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/19/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>From today, mobile users in the United States of America cannot access any apps that are owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd. ByteDance Ltd has ceased operations following the upholding of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which bans any foreign adversary apps from essentially operating in the USA. The biggest app shutdown is TikTok, which was the primary target of the legislation. However, in the app US users will see that ByteDance is hoping the app will be back online, saying they hope President Trump will work with them.</p>
<p>One unexpected app shutdown is Marvel Snap, which developers Second Dinner and publisher Nuverse did not expect. Nuverse is a subsidiary of ByteDance Ltd, and falls under the ban brought in with the legislation. Ben Brode, co-founder of Second Dinner, released the following statement regarding the banning of Marvel Snap on social media, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social">BlueSky</a>.</p>


<p><em>“Unfortunately, MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable in U.S. app stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. This was a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse. We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</em></p>
<p>In a follow up post, Ben has said that US players using VPNs should be able to get around the ban and continue playing Marvel Snap. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596">Apple</a> has also created a support page regarding the Bytedance apps ban, and listed the following apps as no longer available in the US.</p>

<ul>
<li>TikTok</li>
<li>TikTok Studio</li>
<li>TikTok Shop Seller Center</li>
<li>CapCut</li>
<li>Lemon8</li>
<li>Hypic</li>
<li>Lark – Team Collaboration</li>
<li>Lark – Rooms Display</li>
<li>Lark Rooms Controller</li>
<li>Gauth: AI Study Companion</li>
<li>MARVEL SNAP</li>
</ul>
<p>It is currently unknown if the ban will remain in place, with incoming President Trump stating he is likely to give TikTok, and by extension ByteDance, a 90 day reprieve when he takes office. That would overrule the Supreme Court’s ruling of upholding the ban. This is a change in the message from Trump’s previous term in office where he publicly stated opposition to TikTok and was in support of a ban, as reported by <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-tiktok-timeline-1.7432843">CBC</a>.</p>
<p><em>Source:<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social"> BlueSky</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-tiktok-timeline-1.7432843">CBC</a>.</em></p>

This is the Switch successor I was hoping for.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/95396-severance?language=en-US"><strong><em>Severance </em>season 2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>I just rewatched the first season and loved it even more the second time. One of my favorite shows in years, and by all accounts, the second season is worth the wait. I’d put the first season up against any season of anything, so that’s high praise.</li><li><a href="https://nokiadesignarchive.aalto.fi/"><strong>The Nokia Design Archive</strong></a><strong>. </strong>A bunch of researchers spent several years putting together a massive, interconnected history of Nokia’s design work —&nbsp;from its wacky phone concepts to its biggest ideas about the future of everything.

Often, it’ll be a writer’s first day on, like, the day of the iPhone launch, or they’ll be 15 minutes out of HR orientation and Elon Musk will suddenly buy Twitter. For <a href="https://www.threads.net/@todd.haselton"><strong>Todd Haselton</strong></a>, our new deputy editor for reviews and commerce, the chaos was CES. Todd started at the beginning of this year and was immediately inundated with 90,000 stories about weird gadgets nobody’s ever heard of. Welcome to the team!</p><p>I like to ask new <em>Verge</em> staffers to share their homescreen with us to see what we can learn about them by how they use their phone. You can fake it at work, but you can’t fake your phone, you know? Here’s Todd’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max. I’ve been using the biggest iPhone for years. I also have an old Galaxy Z Fold 3 that I’ve been thinking about upgrading to another folding phone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>It’s a picture of me at my graduation from Lehigh University with my grandfather and my uncle, who also went to Lehigh. They’re my role models. It’s a reminder to myself to work hard and to be thankful for what I have. (My twin brother is cut off in this shot. Sorry, bro.)</p><p>My lockscreen background is a rotating picture of my family.</p><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Photos, Calendar, GroupMe, Xbox Cloud Gaming, ChatGPT, Gmail, The Verge, Messages, Phone, Safari, Camera.</p><p>David, are you sure you wanted me to do this? It might be the most boring homescreen you’ve ever published. It’s almost the default.</p><p><a href="https://groupme.com/"><strong>GroupMe</strong></a> is for staying in touch with my college friends and also where my town’s volunteer fire department keeps in touch. I haven’t been as active as I’d like to be since the summer. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fplay"><strong>Xbox Cloud Gaming</strong></a> is there because I always tell myself I’m going to have all this free time for gaming on the go. But I don’t.</p><p>The photo frame widget rotates pictures of trips I’ve taken and family members. This is a shot from my brother’s wedding in Santa Monica.</p><p>Just in case people think it’s rigged: the<em> Verge</em> icon was there before I started. I’ve been reading since the site was started, and I subscribed before I joined.</p><p><em>I also asked Todd to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he said:</em></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/172494/angle-of-repose-by-wallace-stegner/"><em><strong>Angle of Repose</strong></em></a><em> </em>by Wallace Stegner. I just started it so don’t ask me what it’s about. I spend most nights reading on a Kindle Paperwhite. If you’re looking for other recommendations, though, some other books I just finished and enjoyed: <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/678664/trust-pulitzer-prize-winner-by-hernan-diaz/"><em><strong>Trust</strong></em></a> by Hernan Diaz, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/191134/stoner-by-john-williams-introduction-by-john-mcgahern/"><em><strong>Stoner</strong></em></a> by John Williams, and <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/176616/the-little-friend-by-donna-tartt/"><em><strong>The Little Friend</strong></em></a> by Donna Tartt.</li><li>I mostly game on Friday nights with my college friends from about 9PM to 11PM. (We’re all dads now, so… early bedtimes.) It’s a ritual we started during the pandemic, and it’s a good and totally mindless way for us to stay in touch. Gamers are gonna hate, but right now, it’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops6/pc"><em><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</strong></em></a><em> </em>with the Nuketown map on repeat. Just a classic map.</li><li>I’ve been really into the McDonald’s two-cheeseburger meal. It’s a little restaurant nearby with good prices, and the burgers are solid. I <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.doordash.com%2Fbusiness%2Fmcdonalds-5579%2F"><strong>get it DoorDashed</strong></a>.

<p>According to developer Second Dinner, the ban was every bit as much a "surprise" to the team as it was to players, too.</p>

			<p>The extremely popular collectible card game Marvel Snap suddenly became inaccessible to United States users <a href="https://wccftech.com/tiktok-officially-banned-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the TikTok ban</a> due to the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). Here's the message that greets anyone who tries to log in (also available <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social channels</a>):</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable on U.S. stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. In a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse, MARVEL SNAP was affected by the takedown of TikTok late on Saturday, January 18th.</em></p>
<p><em>MARVEL SNAP isn't going anywhere. We're actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.</em></p>
<p>The reason is pretty straightforward: TikTok creator ByteDance owns Nuverse, the publisher of the game. All apps owned by ByteDance were banned, including Marvel Snap. However, since the game itself isn't related to TikTok at all, there may be enough wiggle room for them to restore service.</p>
<p>Developed by Second Dinner, the free-to-play game launched in October 2022 for Windows PC, Android, and iOS devices. It featured over 170 Marvel characters on release, and the roster has greatly increased over time due to weekly additions.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Marvel Snap isn't too complicated. Each player has a deck of 12 cards, each one representing a Marvel character with a cost, power level, and possibly a special ability. At the beginning of each round, players simultaneously place one or more cards face down in one of three locations. The locations are randomly assigned for each game, and each location has a unique associated effect. At the end of each round, the cards are revealed and their special abilities are triggered. Whoever has the highest power in a given location wins that location; the goal is to win two of the three locations.</p>
<p>Its relative simplicity won over many fans. Last we heard, Marvel Snap had over 22 million players and has earned more than $200 million in revenue since launch.</p>

<p>Genshin Impact’s publisher has met the long arm of the law in the courts against the Federal Trade Commission. Following a recent legal battle, the FTC has ordered Cognosphere (HoYoverse) to pay a $20 million settlement for ‘selling lootboxes to teens’. Also, the developer and publisher will be banned from selling such content to anyone under the age of 16.</p>



<p>Get the full results from this justice journey below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-genshin-impact-deceived-children">‘Genshin Impact Deceived Children’</h2>



<p>The FTC has ordered Genshin Impact’s publisher to pay a whopping $20 million in damages after a complaint was filed by the Department of Justice against the game’s lootbox mechanics.</p>



<p>In a statement issued by Samuel Levine, the Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning.</p>



<p>Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HoYoverse was never bashful about microtransactions and lootbox mechanics, making them a relatively integral part of the Genshin Impact experience. The game is inherently free-to-play, but this is how the publisher and developers make their money – by encouraging users of all ages to chase those five-star prizes.</p>



<p>In a follow-up statement, Cognosphere (HoYoverse) said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Animation-style games and shows are well-received by global audiences and players across various ages. Genshin Impact is a popular free-to-play, anime-style game designed for older teens and adults. While we believe many of the FTC’s allegations are inaccurate, we agreed to this settlement because we value the trust of our community and share a commitment to transparency for our players. </p>



<p>Under the agreement, we will introduce new age-gate and parental consent protections for children and young teens and increase our in-game disclosures around virtual currency and rewards for players in the U.S. in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to the dubious lootbox activities, HoYoverse was hit with COPPA violations after failing to comply with some of the key rules. For instance, the requirement for online services ‘directed to children under 13’ to notify their parents about the personal information they collect was flouted by the developer and publisher.</p>



<p>Going forward, the terms set out by the FTC are that Cognosphere is:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Prohibited from allowing children under 16 to purchase loot boxes in their video games without a parent’s affirmative express consent;</li>



<li>Prohibited from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option for consumers to purchase them directly with real money;</li>



<li>Prohibited from misrepresenting loot box odds, prices and features;</li>



<li>Required to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency;</li>



<li>Required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 unless they obtain parental consent to retain such data; and</li>



<li>Required to comply with COPPA including its notice and consent requirements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, which is one of the biggest mobile games in the world, is one of several games banned in the United States following the TikTok takedown that hit ByteDance. ByeDance boasts ownership over the likes of Nuverse and MOONTON Games, which impacts ML:BB, Marvel Snap, and Land of Empires, among others.</p>



<p>This ban impacts the esports industry, as ML:BB is one of the key drivers of the mobile competitive gaming market. In data from Esports Charts, it’s revealed that ML:BB is one of the most-viewed games in history, boasting a peak concurrent viewer count of more than <strong>five million users</strong>, secured during 2023’s M5 World Championship.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-hit">Another Hit</h2>



<p>The TikTok ban is live now in the United States, and when you try to access the application from the region, you’ll be met with a prompt saying that… Well, that you <strong>can’t</strong>.</p>



<p>The ByteDance ban has impacted a few games, too – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/">including Marvel Snap</a>, which is published by Nuverse, a ByteDance-owned brand.</p>



<p>Many esports fans are concerned about the ban that has impacted Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, arguably the most popular mobile esports game in the world, alongside the likes of PUBG Mobile. </p>



<p>This action has also hit Mobile Legends: Adventure. When you try to access that game, you’ll be met with a message that reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mobile Legends: Adventure is currently unavailable.</p>



<p>Due to circumstances beyond our control, Mobile Legends: Adventure is currently unavailable to players in the US.</p>



<p>We deeply value our vibrant player community and are actively exploring possibilities to bring the game back in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Trying to access ML:BB and TikTok will reward you with similar message prompts.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://escharts.com/top-games?order=peak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to Esports Charts</a>, ML:BB was the eighth most valuable esports game in 2024, awarding players almost $8 million across 163 tournaments. It closely beat PUBG and trailed just behind VALORANT. Behind League of Legends, ML:BB was the most-viewed esports game of the year, beating Counter-Strike, Dota 2, and Fortnite.</p>



<p>While North America isn’t the most populous region where ML:BB is concerned, this is still a blow.</p>

<p>Marvel Snap, the competitive digital collectable card game developed by Second Dinner, is currently unavailable in the United States. This is due to the U.S. government’s ban on Chinese social media application TikTok, as the company that developed the app also owns Marvel Snap publisher Nuverse.</p>



<p>The sudden downing of the popular card game without warning from the developer has left players based in the United States baffled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-oh-snap">Oh Snap</h2>



<p>On the evening of January 18, 2025, TikTok officially went dark in the United States due to the enactment of a law banning the social media application. As a consequence of this ban, the availability of apps from ByteDance, the company that developed TikTok, has been restricted on mobile app stores. This unfortunately includes Marvel Snap.</p>



<p>Players in the U.S. who attempt to sign in to the game are greeted with a message very similar to the one TikTok users are seeing:</p>



<figure></figure>







<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, Marvel Snap isn’t available right now. A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now. Rest assured, we’re working to restore our service in the U.S. Please stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Players who attempt to sign in either on mobile or PC are either greeted with the above message or are unable to sign in entirely. The game’s website is also unavailable to access in the U.S.</p>



<p>The game does not appear in a search of the Google Play store, and a notification there states that downloads for ByteDance applications are “paused due to current U.S. legal requirements.”</p>



<p>Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner has stated that both it and publisher ByteDance were surprised by the TikTok ban affecting their game. “Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere,” the developer <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> on X. “We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</p>



<p>What other impacts will the TikTok ban have on gaming? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

For players on PC, the game is still listed in Steam at the moment, but <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1997040/discussions/0/510696076432380503/">many players</a> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1i4pmgy/comment/m7xogf3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reporting</a> they were signed out and can’t sign back in.</p><p>An in-game message now tells players:</p><div><blockquote><p>Sorry, Marvel Snap isn’t available right now</p><p>A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now. Rest assured, we’re working to restore our service in the U.S. Please stay tuned!</p></blockquote></div><p>Oddly, unlike TikTok, it doesn’t appear that players were given much warning about the law’s effect, and many people may not have realized it was even connected to ByteDance, including people who were still spending money on in-game items expecting to be able to keep playing it. </p><p>Other ByDance apps quickly disappeared from app stores along with TikTok, including Lemon8 and CapCut. The effect on other ByteDance-linked apps is mixed; however, it may take time to remove them. The <a href="https://www.larksuite.com/">Lark app</a> that offers a Slack-like collaboration platform was available initially but has now been removed, while other Nuverse-published games, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9-%E3%83%AA%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB-%E5%9C%B0%E4%B8%AD%E6%B7%B1%E3%81%8F%E3%81%B8/id1665908849"><em>Earth: Revival - Deep Underground</em></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/ragnarok-x-3rd-anniversary/id1545808948?mt=8"><em>Ragnarok X: 3rd Anniversary</em></a><em>,</em> are still available in the App Store as of this writing, just after midnight ET on the 19th.</p><p><em><strong>Update, January 19th: </strong>Noted reports that Marvel Snap PC players can’t log in and added </em><a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821"><em>a statement</em></a><em> from game developer Second Dinner.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
