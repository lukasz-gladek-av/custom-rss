            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-remastered-announced-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microids has announced&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered</em>, a modernized remaster-slash-remake of the original point-and-click classic with revamped gameplay and improved visuals.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Syberia/status/1924150647177306347" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, Microids promises that the remaster will feature a "stunning visual overhaul", as well as "redesigned gameplay". It will, however, tell the "same unforgettable story" as the original, so don't worry; the plot details haven't been changed.</p>

<p>The remaster will see protagonist Kate Walker and her automaton companion Oscar exploring "carefully rebuilt" environments which use an art style that "stays true" to original creator Benoît Sokal's vision while also utilizing "beautifully enhanced 3D", according to Microids.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microids-syberia-remastered-train.jpg?itok=-7uZ5USf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microids-syberia-remastered-train.jpg?itok=4vGZpUCT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>​​​​​​brings gameplay and visual improvements to the 2002 adventure classic later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not that means the new game will feature pre-rendered environments in a similar way to the original isn't clear, but it does sound like Microids is overhauling the visual style completely, so perhaps you'll be able to explore a fully rendered version of Sokal's world this time around.</p>

<p>In keeping with modern design trends,&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>will offer "a fresh take" on the original's puzzles, which have been "redesigned to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience".</p>

<p>Additionally, the remaster will feature a reworked UI, as well as "improved 3D navigation", so it should be a little easier to move Kate around her environment now; the slightly clunky movement of the original sounds as though it's been addressed, which is nice.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it's still the same tale of Kate's "legal assignment" that transforms into "a profound journey of self-discovery". If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Syberia</em>, it sounds very much like this is the remaster you've been waiting for.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/syberia-remastered-town.jpg?itok=YyeEGrOu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/syberia-remastered-town.jpg?itok=Z--j6_qQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Syberia</em>'s environments have been redesigned in full 3D, by the looks of things.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Syberia&nbsp;</em>series began all the way back in 1999 with first-person adventure&nbsp;<em>Amerzone</em>, so&nbsp;<em>Syberia&nbsp;</em>is technically the second game in the series, although it's the first to bear what would become the franchise's name.</p>

<p>A sequel followed in 2004, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-3-gets-release-date-and-revealing-trailer" rel="nofollow">another thirteen years later</a>. The latest game in the series,&nbsp;<em>Syberia: The World Before</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-world-before-release-date-set-for-march-2022" rel="nofollow">released in 2022</a>, and is the first to launch following Sokal's death in 2021 from a long-term illness.</p>

<p>With regards to the future of the series, it's not just&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>you've got to look forward to; an animated series based on the franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-animated-series-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">is also in development</a>, although we don't know when it's arriving yet.</p>

<p><em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>launches sometime later this year for PC. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660220/Syberia__Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it right now via Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-wz-ladra-attachments-1851781095<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most interesting additions joining the fray in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 Reloaded </em>(what a mouthful!) is the Ladra submachine gun. It’s a fast-firing SMG reminiscent of the Tec-9. But with such a high rate of fire comes a lack of control, which we’ll aim to resolve with the right attachments. While I’m not the best player, I can hold my own, and I know how to build a loadout to suit my purposes, especially in CQB. As proof, I offer you a sweet Ladra loadout in <em>Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Warzone </em>that saw me achieve nearly 500 kills fast!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195618,195752" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><hr><h2 id="h1629485"><a id="1"></a>Best attachment choices for the Ladra</h2><figure id="" data-id="a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-recommend-id="image://a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-recommend-id="image://a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>For the Ladra, which already features a high Mobility and Handling rating, we’re focusing on increasing its Firepower and Accuracy</strong>. The latter is nothing to scoff at on the base weapon, but the goal here is to create a laser beam that’s capable for short- and mid-range engagements.</p><p>As such, I chose the following attachments:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Remuda Mini Reflex</li><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Muzzle Brake</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Precision Foregrip</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Heavy Stock</li><li><strong>Laser</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs </li></ul><p>You can swap the Heavy Stock for the Combat Stock at will, and, as always, your choice of Optic. I chose the Mini Reflex for its accurate sight picture and small profile, allowing for easier target acquisition in and out of ADS.</p><h2 id="h1629486"><a id="2"></a>Best perks for the Ladra</h2><figure id="" data-id="32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-recommend-id="image://32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-recommend-id="image://32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With your attachments squared away, let’s focus on the rest of the build. The right equipment and perks for the Ladra can really turn the tide of a round. In this case, we’re opting for flash-and-awe tactics with the fast-firing and highly mobile SMG. With the Flashbang, you can blind an entire room and sweep and clear with a mag or two.</p><p><strong>As for the perks, we’re opting for abilities that allow us to move quickly and quietly across the map</strong>, while uncovering enemy whereabouts to get the drop on everyone.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Flashbang</li><li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li><li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: War Cry </li><li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ninja</li><li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Tracker</li><li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Vigilance</li><li><strong>Specialty</strong>: Recon</li><li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li></ul><p>You’ll note I chose War Cry instead of the Assault Pack. Typically, for this type of weapon, I’d say the Assault Pack proves most useful to replace all of that rapidly depleting ammunition. But here, speed and momentum become paramount, and War Cry’s movement buff is key!</p><hr><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>’s Season 3 Reloaded is available right now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and the Chelsea Flower Show might not be the most obvious crossover you can think of, but thanks to Xbox, Bethesda, and "leading bespoke firepit designers" The Firepit Company, it's becoming a reality tomorrow.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the medieval FPS will be getting a firepit display at the Chelsea Flower Show from May 20th to May 24th, thus "seamlessly blending the game's take on medieval stylings with cutting-edge craftsmanship".</p>

<p>The display will see several elaborately-designed firepit globes set among lush greenery, with the central firepit being built around the Doom Slayer himself and a number of other globes featuring designs of "intricate demons and elaborate adversaries" from&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show-display.jpg?itok=ud_h9JOL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show-display.jpg?itok=J-kYh9RF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is getting, of all things, a Chelsea Flower Show display.</figcaption></figure><p>The centerpiece features not only the Doom Slayer, but also a number of "dark flowers", including dark variants of the likes of Zantedeschia, petunia, and Centaurea cyanus. You'll also find a pedestal with the Slayer's symbol carved into it.</p>

<p>Bethesda communications director Steve Merrett says it's "amazing" to see how&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>has been "adapted into a centerpiece worthy of any outdoor area", while The Firepit Company's Jason Andre describes the display as "iconic" and a "pleasure" to work on.</p>

<p>If you want to see the displays, you'll be able to do so in London <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">between May 20th and 24th</a>, although tickets <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/ticket-options" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">aren't cheap</a>&nbsp;and are limited in availability at time of writing.</p>




<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>franchise, and the third game in the reboot series, which began with 2016's straightforwardly-titled&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>.</p>

<p>A prequel to that game,&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>sees the Doom Slayer battling back the forces of Hell in order to save humanity. It introduces a number of new weapons and combat mechanics to the series, including parrying, a throwable shield that can also be used to block projectiles, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3017860/DOOM_The_Dark_Ages/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/doom-the-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-new-ultra-plus-mod-allows-users-to-push-graphics-settings-further-introduces-4k-resolution-cutscenes.1192785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ultra-plus-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod now available online introduces plenty of visual improvements to the game developed by Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<p>The new Ultra Plus mod, which was developed by Lazorr and can be downloaded from Nexus Mods, introduces plenty of visual improvements by fixing some visual issues as well as visual settings that can be pushed past those available in the vanilla game. Besides the improvements to Global Illumination, Shadows, Reflections, Shading, View Distance, and Texture Quality, the mod also introduces upscaled 4K resolution prerendered cutscenes, which look amazing. Unfortunately, the modder has released no comparison screenshots, though <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM3">some</a> shared by Nexus Mods users <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM4">show</a> how the mod can bring <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM5">considerable</a> visual <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODQw">improvements.</a></p>
<p>Even in its vanilla state, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a role-playing game that is more than worth experiencing for all fans of the genre. With its unique twists to classic turn-based combat, a beautiful and unique world, a compelling cast, and a moving, thought-provoking story, the game developed by Sandfall Interactive is undoubtedly one of the best RPGs of the current generation, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, the game is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

<p>The most recent episode of The Last of Us season two just aired, and in the opening moments viewers are soon introduced to a character not seen in the games: Joel's father.</p>
<p>Played by Tony Dalton, whose name you may recognise from his portrayal of Lalo Salamanca in Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul, Javier Miller is a police officer in Austin during the 80s. He is revealed to have violent tendencies towards his two sons, Joel and Tommy, having previously also been beaten by his own father.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-tony-dalton-joel-dad-javier-miller-11737057">EW</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-six-recaptures-some-much-needed-levity-but-with-only-one-episode-left-have-the-showrunners-bitten-off-more-than-they-can-chew">the sixth episode's debut this morning</a>, The Last of Us creator and series showrunner Neil Druckmann said Dalton was his "first choice" to play Joel's father, jokingly adding the actor was "the most charming, threatening man" he had ever seen on television. Druckmann specifically highlighted his performance in Better Call Saul.</p>
<p>Thankfully for Druckmann, it was not a case of 'don't meet your heroes' with Dalton, and the Naughty Dog head was so pleased with the actor's work on The Last of Us TV series he went on to cast him in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>
<p>"He immediately came to mind," Druckmann told the publication of Dalton's unspecified role in the upcoming game. "I just offered it to him on the spot."</p> <div>

<p>Along with Dalton, actress <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Tati Gabrielle will also star in Naughty Dog's upcoming sci-fi project for PlayStation 5</a>.

<p>Last week, Gabrielle revealed she had received preparation for her role in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"What morbid force is calling you deeper into the heart of the caves?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3004390/The_Cave_Diver/">asks the Steam page for The Cave Diver</a>. It ain't calling me, developer Ovsko. I read the opening words of your description and immediately started running away from my laptop. I'm still running, in fact. This article is being breathlessly dictated to Oisin over the phone. I'm somewhere in the vicinity of Luton, now, and hope to make it all the way to Scotland by the weekend.</p>
<p>After that, there'll be the problem of securing naval travel as I continue my headlong flight. Then I'll have to worry about frostbite as I gallop past the North Pole and begin my long traversal of the Pacific. At some point I will reach New Zealand, which - according to this handy <a href="https://www.antipodesmap.com/">antipodal mapping site</a> - is approximately as far away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-cave-diver">The Cave Diver</a> Steam page currently loaded on my laptop as I can get without venturing into outer space. I do not rule out venturing into outer space, which is notable for its complete and categorical deficit of caves.</p><!--more-->
<p>Perhaps you think I'm being hysterical. Friend, The Cave Diver is about perishing repeatedly in crawlspaces a few inches wide, deep below the surface. It's a game based on <a href="https://x.com/LostMemeArchive/status/1896898262399168898">that awful cutaway image</a> you've doubtless seen and flinched away from on social media. And also, beloved lunchbreak physics diversion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/qwop">QWOP</a>. What kind of vile intellect turns QWOP into... <em>this</em>? I guess there's nothing for it but to roll the trailer.</p>

<p>The premise here is that you're trying to find a possibly-mythical subterranean flower that has the ability to cure your paraplegia. You move using your hands and arms and, where called for, the element of momentum. You can also scrawl signs on the rock to navigate by during your next attempt, in the quite likely event that you die. The threat of being crushed or trapped aside, the depths harbour some kind of ancient, ravenous evil. Going by the logo art, The Oesophagus Diver would have been an acceptable alternative title.</p>
<p>It's out later this year. With any luck, I'll have reached New Zealand by then and reinvented myself as a travelling hairdryer salesman who still dreams of being an astronaut. It wouldn't be the first time. If you have a grotesque fascination with caves - which to be honest, I sort of do, as long as I can stand up in them - you might also enjoy free 20-minute spookelunker <a href="https://sole-rift.itch.io/crawl">Crawl</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Flayed Man could not be more laser targeted at me if I designed it myself. I’m a huge fan of Clive Barker’s work, with the body horror delights of Hellraiser being a seminal title for me. This appears to be a clear influence for The Flayed Man as there is a similar narrative of guilt, judgement and temptation at play here. You begin as the titular flayed man with no idea of who you are and how you got to be where you are. During the short 30 minute adventure, you’ll explore the handful of rooms in the house and find objects to solve puzzles. Fairly standard fare, but the quality of the design and the wonderful pixel art goes a long way to make it feel fresh. Oh, and this costs less than a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Flayed Man Final Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSUI6xmV83Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike many point and click games, there is little dialogue to go through – indeed, at the beginning of the game you have no tongue or even an inner monologue to assist you. As the game progresses you regain these faculties and this means that you have to revisit rooms afterwards to learn more about your surroundings. The puzzles here are well designed and include traditional inventory management and even a timing based one.</p>


<p>The star of the show, aside from the creepiness of the setting, is the pixel art here. Everything in the game is positively dripping in gore and the feeling of playing is uncannily close to an immersive Clive Barker story. Just as Barker’s best work is his short stories, The Flayed Man benefits from being such a compact adventure as it doesn’t get lost in the main problems of larger point and click games where you end up aimlessly wandering around multiple screens looking for the next interactive object or combining every item together to try and find the solution to a problem that makes no sense outside of the game’s internal logic.</p>


<p>The difficulty for The Flayed Man, and for countless other games that are released onto Steam each day, is getting lost in the shuffle. Developer Snoring Dog Games took a novel approach of initially releasing the game for free and having a small optional paid DLC to support them and pay the artists that brought this vision to pixellated life. As of the end of last week, the game is now paid, though still only at £2.99 (currently 25% off at £2.24), and the £3.99 Supporters Pack now has a CC BY-NC 4.0 license for using the assets in non-commercial works.</p>
<p>Even with this, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3471670/view/516335345719051904">the stated goal by Snoring Dog</a> is simply to cover costs of an accountant, paying the game’s artists, and hopefully raise enough funds to allow them to make another game. Having played through the game multiple times to unlock all the endings and achievements I can highly recommend that you check it out and, if you like it, throw a few more notes the dev’s way through the DLC.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Flayed Man is a fantastic little point and click with a grotesque setting and wonderful atmosphere that deserves to reach a wider audience. Check it out and support the devs, as this taste shows that they have a massive amount of potential. The story and the aesthetics will stay with me longer than many higher priced games and it’d be a crying shame if their ambitions end here.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/injustice-3-teased-by-multiversus-dataminer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Injustice 3 might be on the way, as teased by MultiVersus dataminer MultiVerSusie. In a not-too-cryptic X post, they <a href="https://x.com/multiversusie/status/1923533288137724173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1923533288137724173%7Ctwgr%5Ecad582adc9b8e13dcbc918ed0b0eb1a538f4db0b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Finjustice-3-is-rumored-to-be-in-development-1545223%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>multiversus shutting down is an injustice, then doing it all again is another injustice</em></p>
<p><em>leaving me without any leaks is yet again another injustice</em></p>
<p>And then, just to make it even clearer:</p>
<p><em>3</em></p>
<p>Of course, it's worth taking this rumor with a big grain of salt. Still, it doesn't seem far-fetched at all. The previous Injustice games were big successes for developer NetherRealm Studios and Warner Bros. Games, selling a lot of copies and garnering widespread critical and fan acclaim. By far their most appreciated feature was the story, which featured a gritty, unique take on the DC Universe where Superman falls into darkness after being tricked by the Joker into killing his beloved Lois Lane and destroying Metropolis. Batman leads the resistance against his totalitarian regime.</p>
<p>There's no question that the Injustice games raised the bar for story and presentation in fighting games, but they were also no slouch in the gameplay department. The second game also added new features like the RPG-inspired Gear System that extended its longevity, particularly in the multiplayer modes. Injustice 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/injustice-2-justified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8.4/10 here on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>All in all, Injustice 2 is surprisingly fantastic. Combat feels very weighty and satisfying, the graphics look incredible, characters look fascinatingly detailed and even the bass-heavy sound design is top notch. DC and fighter fans should definitely be giving Injustice 2 time.</em></p>
<p>It's been eight years, though, and fans have only had the mediocre animated 2021 film since. NetherRealm has released two consecutive Mortal Kombat games, so it could well be time to switch back to the DC-branded fighting game, especially since Warner Bros. has mandated a greater emphasis on its DC franchises.</p>
<p>In fact, James Gunn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head of the new interconnected DC Universe</a>) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> earlier this year to have met with both NetherRealm and Rocksteady about new DC games. It might be a while before Injustice 3 is announced, though, based on the DC heads' statements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rumored-to-be-testing-steam-integration-within-microsoft-store-potentially-for-next-gen-xbox-too/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to insider eXtas1s, Microsoft has internally begun testing Steam integration within the Microsoft Store environment, intending to bring that to the next-generation Xbox console eventually. Here's the relevant quote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZfAx5-EJRs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the latest YouTube podcast</a>:</p>
<p><em>Xbox + Steam are heading into the next generation, but steps are already being taken as Microsoft has just added the Steam application to the support software for its devices, appearing under the name of Steam Developer Beta. This, of course, is currently only available to certain employees and people who collaborate with Microsoft to provide support or develop certain things.</em></p>
<p><em>This is more than just a detail, because it logically reflects Microsoft's intention to facilitate coexistence and cooperation between its Xbox ecosystem and the gigantic PC platform that is Steam today. This integration will allow users to run Steam more smoothly and directly from Windows environments and, in the future, Xbox environments. I've been telling you that the next generation of Xbox is going to be more like a PC than a console. Everything is going to be developed around PC environments. Those logically need Steam integration and you'll have that in your Microsoft Store when you turn on your next generation Xbox console. This will allow you to have Steam on your Xbox console and on any Windows device without the need for complex configurations, which is a key step for the experience of the future console.</em></p>
<p>eXtas1s is not the first insider to talk about this eventuality. Windows Central's Jez Corden predicted the same a while ago, although in this case, eXtas1s claims to have sources indicating that testing for the Steam integration has already begun. As a reminder, the latest rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reportedly-consists-of-traditional-console-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> that the next-generation console strategy includes a successor to the Xbox Series X paired with a handheld device. Both should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in 2027, with Microsoft attempting to launch ahead of Sony's PlayStation 6 after skipping the mid-generation console refresh that Sony released with the PS5 Pro.</p>

            <p>Pro tip: if you send RPS an email of your game with the hook "I know you like goofy stuff…" then, yes, there's a decent chance I'll take the bait, mirth-parched wanderer in the endless dessert left by a goofphagic modernity as I am. Titanic Re-Christened: Maiden Vengeance is almost unplayable in my browser - it can't seem to decide whether I'm clicking on the game on the itch.io page itself - but I'm writing about it anyway because it made my morning coffee a couple of mild chuckles better than it would have been otherwise.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You play a strapped, bipedal Titanic out to get revenge on the icebergs that sunk it, with a large selection of guns, including a sniper rifle named 'Molly's Greetings' and an Uzi named 'The White Star Special'. When you kill sunglass-wearing iceberg minions, the Titanic will spout one-liners like "I'm back and full of steam" and "your assault on me was glacially motivated". It is awful and I believe the world is a better place for its existence.</p>
<p>Here's the lore:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Titanic has sat motionless on the Atlantic Ocean floor for over 100 years...until now.</p>
<p>A cursed wine bottle dropped in the ocean by a ship passing overhead sinks to the depths and smashes open against the skeletal hull of the ghost ship, re-christening it, and bringing it back to life. Gaining sentience for the first time, the Titanic realizes it has an insatiable thirst for one thing: revenge.</p>
<p>Guide the unsinkable ship through the iceberg stronghold and gather the four smokestacks in order to summon your old nemesis, the iceberg that put you 12,500 feet deep in the freezing ocean in April 1912.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can, ostensibly, play it for free in your <a href="https://andymetoo.itch.io/titanic-re-christened-maiden-vengeance">browser via itch.io here.</a> Me? I've been doing this so long I no longer have to play games to know if they're good or not. This one isn't, by the way, but it is <em>art</em>. Actually, it's not really that either. But it is <em>stupid</em>. And there is no better encapsulation of man's eternal hubris than that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
