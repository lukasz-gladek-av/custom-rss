If you're hankering for some freebie action to see you into the weekend, you might want to point yourself toward the Epic Games Store, where you can procure a helping of arcade management and grid-based, turn-based deck building for the sum of zero pee.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, from 11th July (that's today, unless you're reading it in the future, in which case apologies for the confusion) until next Thursday, 18th July, the following titles are free to download and keep via the Epic Games Store:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Paradise</li>
<li>Floppy Knights</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arcade-paradise">Arcade Paradise</a>, from Nosebleed Interactive, challenges players to turn their family's run-down laundrette into a thriving arcade, one shiny new cabinet at a time. As such, your time is split between keeping the laundrette running - manually collecting trash, washing and folding clothes, unclogging the toilet, and so on - in order to scrape together the cash needed to expand your arcade empire. And all 35 of the available base game cabinets are playable. Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcade-paradise-review-wash-clothes-and-play-games-in-this-feat-of-grime-caked-memory">liked Arcade Paradise a lot</a>!
</p>
<p>
As for <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/floppy-knights-6a735a">Floppy Knights</a>, from Rose City Games, it casts player as Pheobe, a brilliant young inventor with a robotic arm for a best friend, who's trying to save up enough to leave home. It's a goal that, for reasons, involves smashing through armies of monsters using the titular tangible projections summoned from floppy disks. It mixes tactical turn-based battles with deck building. "Everything about it feels light and approachable, Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/floppy-knights-is-an-irresistible-mix-of-advance-wars-and-deckbuilding-1">said</a> back in 2022, "[it] oozes fun, plain and simple."

So if either of those take your fancy, you've got until next Thursday to add them to your Epic Games Store library. After that, a fresh set of freebies is due to take their place, with Welsh folklore-inspired first-person horror game Maid of Sker currently confirmed by Epic.

			<p>Concord, the hero shooter developed by Firewalk Studios, will soon launch its Early Access beta. At first, the beta was only available to those who pre-ordered the game on PlayStation 5 and PC. However, the developers have changed their minds, and the beta will now be available for all PS+ members.</p>
<p>If you've been sat on the fence about the game and were unsure whether you wanted to purchase it, getting stuck into the beta available for PlayStation 5 users is the perfect way to find out if this is a game for you.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/11/concord-beta-early-access-preload-and-server-times-pc-specs-and-more-detailed/">Concord developers</a> have announced the release times for the Early Access Beta. For those eager to get stuck in, you only have to wait one more day at the time of writing. The early access beta begins on July 12 through to July 14, with the full Open Beta taking place on July 18 through to July 21.</p>
<p>Players who have bought or pre-ordered any edition of Concord will immediately have access to the Early Access Beta and be given four extra codes to give to their friends should they have people they are eager to team up with in battle. The extra codes will be for the platform you have pre-ordered the game on, so make sure that whoever you're asking is planning on playing the game on the same platform.</p>
<p>The Early Access weekend has four maps, three game modes, and all 16 characters available for trial, so make sure to experiment as much as possible when you're playing Concord. When the Open Beta is released, a new mode and a new map for players to explore will be added.</p>
<p>For those who have access to the Early Access Beta, the following times are when you can expect to be able to get stuck into the Beta.</p>
<p>On July 12, the Concord Early Access Beta will be available from 10 AM PDT / 1 PM EDT / 2 PM BRT / 6 PM BST / 7 PM CEST. Additionally, for those on a later timezone, the game will be available on July 13 at 2 AM JST / 2 AM KST / 3 AM AEST. For players who will be playing this game on PlayStation 5, preloading for the Early Access Beta for Concord starts today at 10 AM PDT.</p>
<p>If you didn't pre-order Concord, the Open Beta will be available for everyone to get stuck into from July 18 through July 21, beginning at 10 AM PDT. For those on PlayStation 5, you can preload the Open Beta for Concord beginning on July 17 at 10 AM PDT.</p>
<p>If you participate in both Betas, your progress will continue from the first to the second. However, your progress during the betas will not continue until the full game is released on release day.</p>
<p>Firewalk Studios has also released the <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-sonys-upcoming-hero-shooter-gets-pc-specs/">PC specifications</a> that you will need to meet to run this game. Luckily, they are not as intensive as those of other modern games.</p>

<p>The marketing plans for Microsoft regarding its Xbox consoles could be changing in a major way. In the latest edition of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196361/microsoft-xbox-no-console-required-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom Warren’s “The Notepad”</a> newsletter, the push to sell Xbox consoles in Europe and other regions could be going the way of the dodo bird. </p>



<p>According to a “tip” Warren received, Microsoft will reportedly stop marketing the Xbox console itself in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Instead, the company will focus solely on Xbox Game Pass, cloud gaming, PC, and Xbox controllers.</p>



<p>“Microsoft has been struggling to sell Xbox Series S / X consoles in many countries across EMEA, and the tipster believes Microsoft will now allocate less console stock to Europe as a result,” he says.</p>



<p>Warren adds that he hasn’t been able to fully verify the information from the tipster, and is still looking for more information. </p>



<p>Overall, the sales of the Xbox Series consoles have been struggling since their release in November 2020. According to the latest sales data, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-continues-to-outpace-ps4-in-sales-while-xbox-series-behind-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series consoles are 13% behind</a> that of the Xbox One through the same time on the market. They are also being the Xbox 360 over the same time, though no specific gap was given. </p>

<p>Splash Damage is the next studio to be facing layoffs in the gaming industry. The news of potential layoffs came as social media posts on the matter began to appear. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It's my 7 year anniversary at <a href="https://twitter.com/splashdamage?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@splashdamage</a> today!</p><p>As a thank you, I've been told my role is at risk of redundancy and I'll be entering into a consultation period.</p></div>— Max Downton 🔜 Develop (@mubly) <a href="https://twitter.com/mubly/status/1811339212412624926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As far as the number of people being let go, the studio told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/small-number-of-roles-face-potential-redundancies-at-splash-damage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that it is limited to “a small number of roles”. What it’s meant by a small number remains to be seen.</p>



<p>“Following a recent business review, we have reached a point where we must adapt our structure to better suit the needs of our current and future games,” the statement to GI Biz reads. “Despite every effort to avoid it, this unfortunately means that a small number of roles across the studio are potentially at risk of redundancy.</p>



<p>“These roles are predominantly on the operations side of the business, with our development teams remaining largely unaffected. All games—both announced and unannounced—remain in development.”</p>



<p>Splash Damage is currently working on Transformers: Reactivate. The studio worked on the multiplayer aspects of Gears of War 4 and Gears 5 as well as the PC version of Halo: The Master Chief Collection.</p>



<p>As of publishing, nearly <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11,000 people have lost their jobs</a> in the gaming industry that we know of.</p>

<p>Some of the best Arm processors come from companies like Apple and Qualcomm, which license Arm's processor instruction set but create their own custom or semi-custom CPU designs. But Arm continues to plug away on its own CPU and GPU architectures and related technologies, and the company has announced that it's <a href="https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/graphics-gaming-and-vr-blog/posts/introducing-arm-accuracy-super-resolution?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social-organic&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mk04_client_na">getting into the crowded field of graphics upscaling technology</a>.</p>
<p>Arm's Accuracy Super Resolution (ASR) is a temporal upscaler that is based on AMD's open source FidelityFX Super Resolution 2, which Arm says allows developers to "benefit from the familiar API and configuration options." (This <a href="https://gpuopen.com/gdc-presentations/2023/GDC-2023-Temporal-Upscaling.pdf">AMD presentation from GDC 2023</a> gets into some of the differences between different kinds of upscalers.)</p>
<p>AMD's FSR and Nvidia's DLSS on gaming PCs are mostly sold as a way to boost graphical fidelity—increasing frame rates beyond 60 fps or rendering "4K" images on graphics cards that are too slow to do those things natively, for example. But since Arm devices are still (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943">mostly</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/surface-pro-11-and-laptop-7-review-an-apple-silicon-moment-for-windows/">for now</a>) phones and tablets, Arm is leaning into the potential power savings that are possible with lower GPU use. A less-busy GPU also runs cooler, reducing the likelihood of thermal throttling; Arm mentions reduced throttling as a benefit of ASR, though it doesn't say how much of ASR's performance advantage over FSR is attributable to reduced throttling.</p>
<p>"Using [ASR] rendered high-quality results at a stable, low temperature," writes Arm Director for Ecosystem Strategy Peter Hodges. "Rendering at a native resolution inevitably led to undesirable thermal throttling, which in games can ruin the user experience and shorten engagement."</p>
<p>Why not just use FSR2 without modification? Arm claims that the ASR upscaling tech has been tuned to reduce GPU usage and to run well on devices without a ton of memory bandwidth—think low-power mobile GPUs with integrated graphics rather than desktop-class graphics cards. ASR's GPU use is as little as one-third of FSR2's&nbsp;at the same target resolutions and scaling factors. Arm also claims that ASR delivers roughly 20 to 40 percent better frame rates than FSR2 on Arm devices, depending on the settings you're using.</p>

<p>Arm says it used "a commercial mobile device that features an Arm Immortalis-G720 GPU" for its&nbsp;performance testing and that it worked with MediaTek to corroborate its power consumption numbers "using a Dimensity 9300 handset."</p>
<p>When the ASR spec is released, it will be up to OS makers and game developers to implement it. Apple will likely stick with its own MetalFX upscaling technology—also derived from AMD's FSR, for what that's worth. Microsoft is pushing "Automatic Super Resolution" on Arm devices while also attempting to develop a vendor-agnostic upscaling API in "DirectSR." Qualcomm announced <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2023/04/introducing-snapdragon-game-super-resolution">Snapdragon Game Super Resolution</a> a little over a year ago.</p>
<p>Arm's upscaler has the benefit of being hardware-agnostic and also open-source (Arm says it "want[s] to share [ASR] with the developer community under an MIT open-source license") so that other upscalers can benefit from its improvements. Qualcomm's upscaler is also a simpler spatial upscaler a la AMD's first-generation FSR algorithm, so Arm's upscaler could also end up producing superior image quality on the same GPUs.</p>
<p>We're undeniably getting into <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">that one xkcd comic about the proliferation of standards</a> territory here, but it's at least interesting to see different companies using graphics upscaling technology to solve problems other than "make games look nicer."</p>

			<p>I had never considered what it would be like if someone made a version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/03/10/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number-review/">Hotline Miami</a> where you play as a sneakerhead who only knows how to kick, but part of the beauty of indie games is that I didn’t have to cook that wild concept up at all. The fine freaks at Free Lives and Devolver Digital were more than happy to bring it to life, anyway. In a sea of recent frantic time trial FPS indie games like Ultrakill and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/22/neon-white-review/">Neon White</a>, Anger Foot doesn’t falter for a second under the pressure. It brings unparalleled and unabashed vibes to the table and leaves no room for doubt – this filth-person-shooter is classic Devolver Digital, and one of the finest games the publisher has ever shepherded to release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anger Foot | Kicking Down Doors July 11" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XbW4873OPZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When I compare Anger Foot to iconic indie gem Hotline Miami, it isn’t just because of the twitch-precision, one-hit-kill, room-clearing adrenaline-maxing gameplay. It’s also because this game is nasty. You play a voiceless, green-skinned sneaker fanatic living in Shit City – a run-down, barely-functioning metropolis where everyone’s in a gang and the only rule is to “Do Crime.” You aren’t part of a gang, though; you just like collecting dope sneakers and storing them in your sneaker-room at home. When the leader of the Violence Gang rips the wall off your apartment and steals the priceless pairs of sneakers displayed on it, you’ve gotta fight through every decrepit inch of the city to get back what’s yours. It’s a bit like the plot of John Wick, when you think about it.</p>


<p>Of course, the way you exact vengeance is with your foot. Your tool set in Anger Foot is simple: one button kicks, another button shoots if you’ve picked up an enemy’s gun, and a third button throws that gun away once it’s empty. With those functions, a handy jump button, and a timer on your screen, you’re thrust into a bunch of bite-sized levels where your only goal is to get to the exit alive. There’s practically no tutorial to speak of in the game, and at first I thought that lack of guidance was a little weird.</p>


<p>With the timer ticking away on each level and a few of them proposing bonus challenges for me to finish in a certain time, I went into each encounter like it was a time trial. Eventually, I realised racing the clock wasn’t always worth prioritising. Some levels didn’t reward me for finishing in a certain time at all, and variables started popping up that made it clear I had way more options at my disposal than just speed.</p>
<p>Every 5 stars earned from beating levels or challenges gets you a new pair of sneakers, and each one comes with a unique ability that can enable completely different ways of play. When I unlocked the Detonators and saw that they make every door I kick blow up, I thought my speed-focused runs were about to get even faster. After a dozen deaths caused by me running face-first into an exploding door, I realised that the Detonators rewarded a stop-start style of play I hadn’t even considered up to that point. With new shoes, new enemies, and new challenge-types constantly coming at you, I was always enticed to mix up my play-style and even approach the same level multiple times in different ways to clear each challenge.</p>

<p>What I also appreciate about Anger Foot is that it gives you so much time to live and breath in this weird, gross, crime-fueled world it’s created. You aren’t just running, kicking, shooting, and kicking some more through each of the four main gangs territories. Every few levels, you get a chance to wander around a lively back alley or an unfinished apartment building half-filled with sewage. In those moments you can talk to NPCs hanging around and just see what bizarre, crime-loving shenanigans they’re up to. It’s a weirdly wholesome vibe, where someone will proudly tell you how they got mugged last week in the very stairwell they’re standing in, and right next to them is the person who mugged them. Even in the run-and-gun levels themselves, each room tells a story. It helps breathe so much life into the dozens of encounters you kick your way through, and made them feel like much more than just time-trials.</p>
<p>There’s so much more to love about Anger Foot. The hard, grungy bass-heavy music blasting in your ears at all times kicks every encounter up to 11. I fought a three-phase boss and it’s final phase was just a busted 1997 Lucida car. There’s weird, wonderful charm in every inch of this game – and heart-pounding combat that kept me sweating on my keyboard until the credits rolled. Anger Foot is gross, loud, and weird, and I love it.</p>

            <p>In a talk at Brighton's Develop conference this week, former Larian writer Baudelaire Welch declared the bear romance scene in Baldur's Gate 3 "a watershed moment in game history".  They said it was an unprecedented example of a developer recognising and validating the fanfiction community surrounding a game by realising something they wanted in it.</p>
<p>Welch was responsible for overseeing the companion romances in the game, and wrote the Dark Urge storyline, but didn't join the team until partway through development. The game had already come out in early access at that point, in autumn 2020, which meant considerable work had already been done - companion romances included. But there was still a lot of work to do, and some characters weren't yet romanceable - Halsin in particular.</p>
<p>"I don't think there were specific plans for him to be a love interest," Welch told me in a follow-up interview after their talk. However, the fanfiction community surrounding the game was clear about what they wanted, and what they wanted was "daddy Halsin". Welch knew this because they themselves were a part of that community. They'd written Astarion fanfiction before applying to work at the studio, and were partially hired for their embedded knowledge about what that community wanted (they also have a game design background alongside this). </p>
<p>So Larian acknowledged the desire for Halsin to be a romance and started to pursue it. "This is a character that everyone likes and sees as a possible love interest," Welch said, summarising, "let's try it out and see how it works."</p>

<p>"The specifically turning into a bear thing," Welch continued: "It was originally meant to be a gag that took place off screen in another scene that I pitched, because I didn't think that it would ever go anywhere, but then Swen [Vincke] and John [Corcoran], who's writing Halsin - as they were writing more major love scenes - were like, 'Oh, let's bring this idea forward and let's escalate it and make it a main thing for this character.'</p>
<p>"I have to admire that something I thought was just a gag - there's this off-stage sex scene where he turns into a bear as part of it - was taken as, 'Oh, that's really cool or funny, let's run with that.' That was a great attitude that was always there at Larian. Sometimes I would think something was too ridiculous to be done or too much of a joke, especially because so many people have to work on something in a game with cinematics and motion capture and scripting, but something that feels like 'oh this is a ridiculous little idea' did have the space to grow."</p>
<p>The upshot of this was an idea surfaced by the fanfiction community after the game was released in early access was now in Baldur's Gate 3.</p>

<p>"Why did it make such an impact on people?" Welch went on to say in their talk. "This is what it meant to me when I was involved in Baldur's Gate 3. This scene feels like a watershed moment in game history where the fanfiction community feels like they're not a subculture but are the majority audience being catered to in a scene and in the game as a whole.</p>
<p>"In order to reach out to that part of the community, Larian gave them an incredibly silly sequence that takes an identity moniker from the gay community - literally the gay bear becomes the bear (if no one has actually made the connection before) - and that is giving players something that feels like it's from the tradition of fanfic, or just something from your Discord shit-posting hole, and presenting it as a mainstream feature. And that feels like all the time you spent joking with your friends is validated. And how many games of this kind of scale have made you feel that way before?"</p>
<p>Welch's Develop presentation talked a lot about the importance of fanfiction for games. "Romance is one of the longest-tail parts of a fandom you can create," Welch said. "People will write about a good romance in fanfiction for years to come." It's the sort of discussion that sustains a game's community for a very long time - far longer than the main storylines themselves. The fanfiction community also appeals to female and LGBTQIA+ players in particular, Welch said - the sort of community that's propelled the collective love-in around Baldur's Gate 3 since it launched nearly a year ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/game-pass-users-should-expect-more-price-bumps-in-the-future-says-analyst/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The biggest news of the week in gaming so far has undoubtedly been the substantial rise in Game Pass pricing <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by Microsoft. Game Pass for console is being removed as an option for new users; Core's annual price has been increased from $59.99 to $74.99; PC Game Pass's monthly fee has risen from $9.99 to $11.99; and Ultimate is now going to cost $19.99, up from $16.99. Additionally, a new 'Standard' tier has been introduced at $14.99, featuring just online multiplayer and around 25 games from the back catalog.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been a bit ambiguous about Game Pass pricing changes. In court, while fighting the Federal Trade Commission on the Activision Blizzard merger, lawyers said last June that there wouldn't be any increase following the closing. In September, though, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-price-increase-is-inevitable-says-spencer-more-unannounced-japanese-games-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> a hike would be inevitable at some point in the future.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that most fans were expecting a price increase following the addition of Call of Duty, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be imminent. Is this the right move from Microsoft, though, and should we expect any more changes in the foreseeable future?</p>
<p>We asked MIDiA Research games analyst <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/bigger-is-not-always-better-premium-gamings-aa-opportunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhys Elliott</a> to share his opinion with Wccftech on the subject. Here's what he told us:</p>
<p><em>Xbox has largely maximized its subscriber base on console, so it's looking to maximize average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) and onboard new subscribers with the higher pricing precedent. Call of Duty is about to bring more subscribers, so the timing makes sense. Expect more price increases in the future. The PC price increase suggests growth is starting to saturate there, too. Peeling PC players away from Steam is nigh on impossible...</em></p>
<p><em>GP Console doesn't grant day-one online access to non-F2P games like CoD (Ultimate does), so the OG tier is basically a confusing legacy tier that doesn't fit the new direction. Xbox has been hiding GP Console on its store lately, so the writing has been on the wall for a while.</em></p>
<p><em>A replacement for Game Pass Console, Standard is basically Game Pass Core with a bigger games library (and no first-party day one). This tier is Xbox's half-step from core to Ultimate. Removing the day-one stuff also retrains some Ultimate holdouts to buy new premium games again, again increasing ARPPU. Cannibalized premium revenues have been a massive opportunity cost for Xbox (slightly offset by paid early access).</em></p>
<p><em>At the end of the day, these changes reflect Xbox's recent strategy: upselling fans to Ultimate and increasing ARPPU ahead of the company's huge off-platform mobile/cloud push. PC and console will remain important, but those markets are reaching saturation, and Xbox needs growth (it's a public company in the time of big-tech efficiency and cuts). Xbox's big platform-agnostic play continues.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Elliott is right to point to the mobile push. Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-to-launch-mobile-store-via-web-in-july-microsoft-sees-tremendous-growth-in-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it will launch its Xbox mobile store via the Web at some point this month, and that's where it'll try to vastly expand the total addressable market for its games.</p>
<p>On the upside, more games than just Call of Duty are <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly coming soon</a> from Activision Blizzard to Game Pass, including Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2. Is that worth the higher price, though? Tell us in the comments and throw your vote in the poll below.</p>

It’s not exactly shocking to see the <em>X-Men</em> get a restart, but after the game-changing Krakoan era of the past five years, returning to the “status quo” feels more tiring than ever. Even with some loving nods to the <em>X-Men</em>’s long past, it’s hard to get excited about what is, for all intents and purposes, a good but overly familiar <em>X-Men</em> comic based on its first issue.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For the X-Men, the status quo is being hated by humans because of their identity as mutants, the superpowered next stage of evolution.

The first issue begins with Beast guiding the local police chief through their new home in hopes of easing the worries of the nearby town. Meanwhile Cyclops, the team leader, is out on a mission to rescue Wolverine. The two threads of the debut issue work in tandem to establish the series’ status quo, deploying a familiar and reliable format for<em> X-Men</em> stories. The fluidity of penciler Ryan Stegman’s art is enhanced by Marte Gracia’s color, all of which helps punctuate both the humor and the more serious moments of MacKay’s writing. </p><p>Another important piece of the puzzle that the issue establishes is the new team. Any<em> X-Men</em> book relies heavily on having a good team and I have to say I’m pretty interested in the mutants MacKay has rounded up. While Cyclops, Beast, and Magneto feel like safe choices, the trio is supported by a more eclectic and loveable cast. Magik, Quentin Quire, Tempest, Psylocke, and Juggernaut fill out the team with their unique personalities that, so far, make for great action and comedy scenes. It’s always good to see a team roster combine old and new characters, while also making room for some of the less famous mutants. </p><figure id="" data-id="7b6bb78b8f531abc5f4bb8d0d9111dd7" data-recommend-id="image://7b6bb78b8f531abc5f4bb8d0d9111dd7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1221" data-height="686" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik and Juggernaut play rock paper scissors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magik and Juggernaut play rock paper scissors" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b6bb78b8f531abc5f4bb8d0d9111dd7" data-recommend-id="image://7b6bb78b8f531abc5f4bb8d0d9111dd7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1221" data-height="686" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik and Juggernaut play rock paper scissors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For longtime readers, one of the most interesting parts of any new <em>X-Men </em>comic is figuring out what the new creative team’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472">favorite<em> X-Men</em> comics</a></span> are, which typically comes across in the characters, setting, and stakes they establish. For MacKay, it’s pretty clear he has an affinity for Grant Morrison’s iconic and incredible <em>New X-Men</em> run, and it’s nice to see Morrison’s characters like Quire and Xorn show up and heavily reference events from that run.<br></p><p>The Morrison connections extend to the first issue’s main villain, a group called Fourth School. In the first issue, we get a lore dump that ties the new group directly to Morrison’s big bad, John Sublime and his U-Men. Beyond Morrison, the new series also has flavors of the 2010s Aaron and Bendis <em>X-Men</em> comics. The reveal that the<em> X-Men</em>’s new home is an abandoned sentinel factory feels like a homage to the time the team lived in the old Weapon X facility, while the entire opening tour from Beast feels ripped right out of Aaron’s first issue of <em>Wolverine and the X-Men</em>. However. One era of<em> X-Men</em> feels conspicuously absent as an influence on the new series: the one that directly preceded it.</p><p>Started in 2019 by Jonathan Hickman in the dual series event<em> Houses of X/ Powers of X</em>, the Krakoan era was a complete shattering of the decades-long<em> X-Men </em>status quo. The characters who have long been stand-ins for marginalized communities across the world, a group who have always had to play nice with their oppressors and murderers, finally decided to do something different. In the first year of the Krakoan era, Hickman established that mutants were now effectively immortal and had founded the mutant nation of Krakoa,) a place that would serve as a haven for mutants across the world and a place to create a unique mutant culture and society. </p><figure id="" data-id="797ff37109689597b35bbc81ef5d4bc1" data-recommend-id="image://797ff37109689597b35bbc81ef5d4bc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto discusses the island nation of Krakoa with a government agent" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto discusses the island nation of Krakoa with a government agent" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="797ff37109689597b35bbc81ef5d4bc1" data-recommend-id="image://797ff37109689597b35bbc81ef5d4bc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto discusses the island nation of Krakoa with a government agent" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Over the course of the era, mutants showed the world they would no longer be oppressed and that humanity only lived because mutants allowed it. At one point mutants even terraform and claim Mars as part of their domain. It was a wild ride that felt truly groundbreaking. It also meant a lot for the mutant metaphor, showing that persecuted communities could in fact escape from under the heel of oppressors. Then, because of real-world creative and business decisions, Krakoa came to an end this year. The years-long story was by no means perfect but it proved that the<em> X-Men </em>could be more than they have always been. The end of Krakoa raised the question, where do we go from here?<br></p><p>That question is answered in <em>X-Men #1</em> and it seems to be that we just go back to the old status quo and ignore Krakoa as much as possible. Yes, characters still reference events from the Krakoan era but none of the meteoric shifts that Hickman and his collaborators made have lasted. They can’t, not if the<em> X-Men</em> are to be what Marvel wants them to be for money-making purposes. Instead, the mutant population has dwindled tremendously and the X-Men have to keep on fighting the good fight against humans trying to kill them, while pretending that they have some moral high ground because they like to play nice with their oppressors. I know this has always been the way <em>X-Men</em> stories work but after Krakoa it just feels exceedingly bereft of meaning or purpose. It’s a shame because as far as status quo <em>X-Men </em>books go, MacKay’s is shaping up to be a good one based on the first issue. </p><p>It’s surprising how heavily <em>X-Men #1 </em>draws on Morrison’s work, considering all the similarities it has with the Krakoan era. Both were bold reinventions of the <em>X-Men</em> that broke the status quo but ultimately were ended unceremoniously and immediately had the majority of their impact on the larger canon retconned. Hell, Xorn in Morrison’s run was secretly Magneto! Now Xorn is just some guy because Marvel retconned it. Yet here we are, two decades removed from Morrison’s ugly exit from the series and the latest <em>X-Men</em> book is using his era as a major influence. At the same time, Krakoa is being ignored in all the ways that matter, but I can’t help but wonder about the <em>X-Men</em> writer two decades from now who brings it all back. It’s all a cycle comics readers know well, but because of Krakoa, I can’t help but be disappointed at how laid bare that cycle is.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A PC mod for Persona 4 Golden has been released that makes its graphics look like how they looked like on the original PS2 game. It's currently 40% complete and only covers the game's dungeons so far.</p><p>Gamebanana user BrawlerAce created the <a href="https://gamebanana.com/wips/86080" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fog Restoration mode</a> in order to allow players to experience the visuals of the original Persona 4 through Persona 4 Golden. The latter is much more accessible due to it being on all platforms, where as the original is only available on PS2.</p><p>Right now, the mod focuses on the visuals of the game's dungeons and other fields in the TV World, as well as both normal battles and boss battles. It doesn't make any changes to the overworld yet, but the end goal is to eventually restore the entire game.</p><p>BrawlerAce also acknowledged that the areas that were exclusive to Persona 4 Golden, such as Shichiri Beach and Okina City, are going to be harder to work on since there's no reference for them in the original game. The plan is to adapt them as close as they can to the original's general look.</p><p>Persona 4 was first released in 2008 for PS2, and got the enhanced Golden re-release with new content in 2012 for PS Vita. Golden was ported to PC in 2020 and then to PS4, Switch, and Xbox One in 2023.

<p>In a flagrant travestying of the whole sequel concept, Greedfall 2 actually begins three years <em>before</em> the first game's events, and casts you as a grizzled native of the island of Teer Fradee, who has been uprooted and taken to the continent of Gacane. In this rotten imperial heartland ravaged by plague, war and factional disputes, you'll fight, talk and scheme your way to freedom while trying to head off some arsehole who wants to conquer the universe. </p>
<p>"Experience the unique world of GreedFall again by exploring the old continent!" expounds Monsieur Press Release. "Travel across new landscapes, from Olima - the city of stars of the Bridge Alliance - to the shores of Uxantis, and uncover the secrets of these ancient lands." New cities aside, there are fresh companion characters to accessorise, befriend, seduce, turn into rivals, and play as during combat. We can also expect "an even deeper RPG experience" with story paths ranging from being diplomatic to being manipulative to being a sneaky mass-murderer.</p>
<p>I didn't play much of the original Greedfall - I think I got as far as boarding a ship for Teer Fradee and being sat on by a very unreasonable tree. RPS reviewer Astrid Johnson (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greedfall-review">likened it to BioWare's creations</a>, especially Dragon Age and Mass Effect, but found that it wasn't on par with either. She was moderately tickled by the game's real-time-with-tactical-pausing combat, and confessed herself a fan of the outfits, too, despite the "unforgivable crime" of not being able to pop a feather in her tricorn hat.</p>
<p>Asrid was much less sold on the setting, however, commenting that "it's either standard historical fantasy, or it's so bogged down in cultural stereotypes that it all just feels a bit overdone." Khee Hoon Chan had more to say on the subject in <a href="https://www.vg247.com/greedfalls-rpg-framework-exacerbates-colonialist-impulses">a piece for VG247</a>, observing that Spiders are trying to have their cake and eat it by critiquing European colonialism at the level of the writing, while nonetheless inviting you to make the entire island your oyster. (An oyster cake, yes.) I'm cautiously interested to learn how Spiders might address that by recasting you as a Teer Fradee native, hollowing out the imperial centre. I suspect the same old contradictions are in play, but let's see.</p>

			<p>The Outlast Trials is a great game to experience horror full of blood, scares, and survival horror elements with friends. Whether you play it alone, with friends, or with other people waiting in the lobby is up to you. This game has been incredibly popular in the horror scene since its release, and there is now a brand new killer on the loose to keep the game fresh.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outlast-trials-the-rich-mans-lethal-company/">This game</a> is already home to some truly iconic killers that are sure to haunt your dreams, but the latest killer to be teased for The Outlast Trials is said to be "the most depraved killer yet."</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eADhlVfwAg4">the trailer</a> released by Red Barrels doesn't seem to show off too much, it does show that Franco "Il Bambino" Barbi is a heavily infantilized killer who has a deep fascination with everything to do with childbirth and the miracle of life.</p>
<p>Franco "Il Bambino" Barbi is a deeply perverse, gun-wielding man-child who is the outcast of a Mafia don. The trailer was announced on July 10, and the YouTube video description promises that more content will be released today.</p>
<p>Before Il Bambino's release, the game's killers predominantly used melee weapons to catch their victims. Aside from the latest killer to join the sadistic family, the only other killer to use some ranged weaponry is The Pusher. They utilize a gas that turns the victim insane and requires an antidote to resolve the issue. Additionally, The Screamer disorients the player by screaming loudly when anyone comes near them, which alerts other enemies to your presence.</p>
<p>This brand-new map takes you to the docks, where Franco has a giant drug manufacturing domain full of trickery and difficult puzzles to bypass. This domain is where this freakish new killer takes all of his victims and infantilizes them until they are down to his level.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outlast Trials - Franco &quot;Il Bambino&quot; Barbi | New Villain Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eADhlVfwAg4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Franco Barbi's intense fascination for doing experiments on pregnant women, it takes The Outlast Trials to a brand new horrifying low with this new killer. Players will experience a new level of madness and disgust as they become far too well acquainted with this killer.</p>
<p>This new update brings a lot of new content to The Outlast Trials. The new killer and new map are part of a huge update titled "Project Lupara," which will be released on July 16. Alongside the killer and map that are being introduced into the game, we get to see a new game mode being added to The Outlast Trials.</p>
<p>The game mode is called "Escalation Therapy," and players can participate in a rogue-lite game mode in which they have to go through several randomized trials with various variations until they eventually succumb to a Permadeath.&nbsp; Like any rogue-lite, the longer you survive, the bigger the reward!</p>
<p>The developers are calling it a huge overhaul to make the game more fun and exciting, with more thrills around every corner. From new cosmetics being introduced to new daily and weekly tasks that allow you to get rewards for completion and the introduction of difficulty settings for players who are new and masterful, The Outlast Trials is changing for the better.</p>

All of the content featured in the mod is based off of a leaked demo of <em>Van Buren</em>, as well as extensive design documents for the game that eventually came to light. The mod has been playable as a work-in-progress for Patreon backers, but a massive new update to <em>Fallout Yesterday </em>has now prompted a full release on Nexus Mods. The update introduces countless features, including more than 100 new items and weapons and numerous quests, which take place in environments like the Hoover Dam, a prominent locale in the much-more-official installment in the series, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-things-never-say-fan-bethesda-xbox-1851467599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-things-never-say-fan-bethesda-xbox-1851467599"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a></span>.While it is only as finished as a canceled game <em>can </em>be, <em>Fallout Yesterday </em>now appears to be essentially content complete.</p><p>That’s because <em>New Vegas</em>, developed at now-Microsoft-owned Obsidian Entertainment, was led by Josh Sawyer, an RPG developer who worked on <em>Van Buren </em>during his time at Black Isle Studios. <em>Van Buren </em>would’ve followed a prisoner who managed to escape in the American Southwest, and whose journey included interactions with Caesar’s Legion, a notable faction featured in <em>New Vegas</em>. Despite borrowing some elements from the canceled game, <em>New Vegas </em>is mostly its own thing and features original characters and storylines developed by Sawyer and his team.<br></p><p>Though <em>Van Buren </em>never officially saw the light of day, it’s clearly haunted the series ever since its cancellation in 2003. We don’t often learn much about canceled games due to the industry’s penchant for secrecy, but <em>Van Buren </em>flies in the face of that standard. It’s great to see how much the <em>Fallout </em>fan base clearly cares for this game if they’ve gone so far as to unofficially resurrect a game that’s been dead for decades.</p><p>More <em>Fallout </em>can’t possibly be a bad thing at this point in time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-metal-slug-awakening-evolves-the-franchises-iconic-formula/1100-6524771/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                                        <p dir="ltr">Few side-scrolling shooters have withstood the test of time quite like SNK's Metal Slug series. From soaking up coins on arcade screens to bringing that same frantic arcade experience to home consoles, Metal Slug has kept the genre alive and well with its unmistakable cartoonish charm wrapped around fast and frantic run-and-gun action.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, Metal Slug is heading to our mobile and PC screens with the release of Metal Slug: Awakening. Awakening isn't just set to be the most portable Metal Slug experience yet, it's also evolving the classic formula by revamping everything from the iconic visuals to the gameplay mechanics, multiplayer options, and more--all while retaining the core run-and-gun philosophy that has kept the franchise so popular over the last 28 years.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329909-metalslug6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329909" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329909-metalslug6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329909"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329909-metalslug6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Metal Slug: Now in 2.5D!</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Metal Slug: Awakening is the latest chapter in the franchise's story, following the iconic heroes Marco, Eri, Tarma, and Fio as they battle to thwart the plans of evil dictators, supernatural monsters, and ancient deities. With the move to 2.5D, Marco and his squad now have full 3D models, with more fluid movement to complement the dynamic action and breathe even more personality into each hero.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not just the heroes either; everything from the weapons and vehicles to the enemies and levels has been rebuilt with 3D models, allowing for a crisper look that adds new depth to the side-scrolling shooter gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Revamped Single-Player And Multiplayer Modes</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Awakening features an immersive single-player 'World Adventure' mode, where you face a series of increasingly difficult missions split across ever-expanding seasons. These missions follow the traditional arcade-style run-and-gun gameplay and include a mix of new and returning levels and bosses.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to World Adventure, there are new game modes that introduce unexpected challenges. 'Arcade Carnival' presents objective-based missions such as defending areas from waves of enemies, while 'Hot Pursuit' adds a roguelike twist to the action by rewarding players with randomized upgrades after each mission is cleared. These are just two of the fresh and challenging modes that flip traditional gameplay on its head, requiring players to rethink their approach to combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Co-op also makes a return with 'Joint Operation,' where up to three players can battle through missions to take on specialized bosses. Alternatively, pit your trio against another team of three in high-stakes, chaotic PvP action in 'Prime Showdown.'</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>New Controls for Classic Gameplay</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to creating great side-scrolling action titles, simplicity and accessibility in gameplay are key. It's this approach that helped Metal Slug retain its fanbase and introduce new gamers to a classic game genre. Metal Slug: Awakening embraces this concept, with simple controls and a focus on speed as you run, shoot, and jump your way through enemies and obstacles, but also adds just enough new elements for a fresh take on the formula.</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, in Awakening, players can choose between two different control schemes: auto-aim and manual aim. Manual aim follows the traditional Metal Slug controls, allowing for free aiming to deliver precision shots to target enemy weak points, while auto-aim targets the nearest enemy on-screen, ensuring that gameplay remains fast-paced on mobile devices.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329910-metalslug6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329910" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329910-metalslug6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329910"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329910-metalslug6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock and Customize Powerful Heroes</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Alongside finding the right control scheme, choosing the right character has never been more vital, as all playable heroes have unique skills and abilities, such as Marco's ‘Bullet Time' which slows down time, making it easier to dodge enemy fire. Each hero's skills and abilities not only add powerful options for players but also reference the character's history and personality, providing new insight into Metal Slug lore.</p><p dir="ltr">At the start, you'll have only Marco available, with five other classic Metal Slug characters to unlock. As you unlock more heroes, you'll also unlock new gear to change their appearance, as well as new accessories that add new skills and buffs, like the ability to throw three grenades at once instead of just one.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Guns, Gear, and More Guns!</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Metal Slug's vast array of weapons featured across its many titles is arguably just as iconic as its playable characters. Whether it's the decimating flame shot, the overwhelmingly heavy machine gun, or the powerful rocket launcher (or rock-it-lawn chair, if you're a Metal Slug veteran), Metal Slug has always featured larger-than-life, bombastic weapons that are practically a requirement for making it through levels intact.</p><p dir="ltr">Awakening includes most of the classic weapon archetypes alongside unique, never-before-seen weapons such as sniper rifles, saw launchers, and a boxing gun (a literal spring-loaded punching glove attached to a firearm). All weapons also have variants, some of which can inflict different status effects such as freezing or burning enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">Weapons can also be upgraded with special items to increase firepower and unlock stronger abilities. This level of customization for character gear and weapons adds a new layer of strategy, opening the door for new playstyles and mechanics not seen before in run-and-gun-style games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329911-metalslug5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329911" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329911-metalslug5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329911"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4329911-metalslug5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>A Slug for Every Occasion</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it wouldn't be called Metal Slug without featuring the signature metal behemoths known as Slugs. Slugs add a new element to the gameplay, giving players access to powerful vehicles capable of receiving and dishing out tons of damage. In Awakening, players can unlock Slugs from past games as well as a few new ones.</p><p dir="ltr">Once unlocked, Slugs can be summoned onto the battlefield, giving players a massive advantage with each Slug's unique set of skills and weapons: the classic SV-001 tank can launch nine devastating ballistic missiles, while the unassuming twin Gatling gun-mounted camel, SV-Camel, can summon a powerful lightning storm. Slugs can be further upgraded, enhancing armour, firepower, and abilities.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Metal Slug: Awakening lands on Android, iOS and PC on July 17!

                <p>After hosting several smaller events earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/" data-ref-id="5000-505577">The Outlast Trials</a> is getting its first major post-launch update. Project Lupara is a free update coming on July 16 that adds a new roguelite mode, as well as a new map, missions, abilities, cosmetics, and another villain at the center of it all, who is likely to become as haunting as Mother Gooseberry and Sergeant Coyle. Several quality-of-life changes are coming with the patch, too. Here's everything you need to know about The Outlast Trials' Project Lupara.</p><h2>New villain, map, and missions</h2><p>The centerpiece of the update is Franco "Il Bambino" Barbi, the son of a New Orleans mob boss, with proclivities as disquieting and deranged as this series has become known for. Red Barrels studio has gone and given the "infantilized" Il Bambino a shotgun, which makes for a unique threat that the other melee-focused Big Bads of the game don't have.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Outlast Trials - Project Lupara Update Full Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Tying into the mobster via the game's story, the new Docks map will host a new Trial (main mission), as well as several MK-Challenges (shorter side missions). The game's final mission has also been given a makeover. It remains a solo experience, but now escalates in difficulty as you continue to release Reagents (player characters) into the world--essentially Prestiging your character. A new ending can be seen when you manage to escape, too.</p><p>A fifth cooldown ability, collectively called Rigs, is also being introduced to the game in the form of The Barricade. This is a denial-of-entry maneuver that blocks off pursuers and forces them to bash down the blockade, giving Reagents some precious time to perform a task or widen the gap between their shoulders and a killer's reach.</p><h2>New roguelite game mode - Escalation Therapy</h2><p>Alongside all of this comes a brand-new game mode, Escalation Therapy, which acts like a rougelite endless mode that gets increasingly more difficult as players progress through its twisted Trials. Each mission includes different variables, such as increased damage or more traps littered around the map, so no two playthroughs are ever the same.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330966-tot_projectlupara_ss_franco.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330966" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330966-tot_projectlupara_ss_franco.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330966"></a><figcaption>A look at the new Docks map and its starring villain</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330966-tot_projectlupara_ss_franco.png"></figure><p>Players are tasked with surviving as many as Trials as they can, with permadeath eventually resetting them back to the beginning of a new run. Loadouts will also be empty to start a run, demanding players create something like a sensible build as they progress through the Trials and obtain buffs.</p><h2>New live-service metagame</h2><p>The Outlast Trials is designed as a living game, and with Project Lupara, it's getting more telltale signs of that intent in the form of daily and weekly challenges, as well as new Catalogs, which act as the game's battle pass-like cosmetic rewards path.</p><p>Two new Catalogs will be there to kick off the update. The Standard Catalog, "A New You," offers a collection of previously available cosmetics as well as some new ones, while a paid Deluxe Catalog offers a host of even more new cosmetics. Players progress through Catalogs by obtaining Stamps, and new daily and weekly challenge systems are designed to tie into this new metagame. The Catalogs also never expire, so players won't need to complete them in a set amount of time.</p><h2>Difficulty options and more</h2><p>On the quality-of-life front, The Outlast Trials is getting difficulty options for the first time. Four difficulties--Introductory, Standard, Intense, and Psychosurgery--will be available for players to choose from. This should help ease some players into the game's intense missions, while giving veterans of the Murkoff Facility a more brutal challenge if they're into that.</p><p>The Programs menu has also been revamped and matchmaking will now group players based on their difficulty settings. Loadouts can be altered in the shuttle before heading into any mission, too, and if players fail a mission, they can opt to restart it right away rather than needing to head back to the lobby first. Lastly, the max player level has been bumped up to 70.</p><p>The shared social space in the facility is also adding a new attraction to go with chess and arm wrestling. The Stroop Effect Test, based on the real-life delayed reaction people have when viewing conflicting stimuli, will challenge players to correctly select the color of a word when the word itself spells a different color. It's another low-stakes way to pass the time while you wait to form your group and load into a mission.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330965-outlasttrials_exoticapack.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330965" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330965-outlasttrials_exoticapack.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330965"></a><figcaption>The Exotica Pack</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330965-outlasttrials_exoticapack.png"></figure><p>A new DLC pack is coming to the store, too. The Exotica Pack adds four new skins, several new profile icons, and a range of personal items for players' private cells for $20.</p><p>For players deeply invested in the lore, another free comic book is coming to the studio's website. You'll <a href="https://redbarrelsgames.com/comic-books/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">find it here starting on July 12</a>. It tells the backstory of the latest Big Bad.</p><h2>Limited-Time Bambino event</h2><p>To introduce the new villain and other features coming with Project Lupara, The Outlast Trials will kick off the update with another limited-time cosmetic event. For four weeks, Il Bambino will appear in various Trials when players are loading into the event from the mission selection screen. Depending on the mission, he will be there not in place of but <em>alongside</em> Mother Gooseberry or Sergeant Coyle.</p><p>At the midway point of the event, the Trials featuring the game's latest enemy will be updated, so players who have experienced a lot of the event in the first two weeks will get a fresh take in the back half.</p><p>The Outlast Trials Project Lupara update arrives on July 16 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
