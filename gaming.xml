            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-the-shire-delayed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division have announced a&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>delay, with the cozy hobbit game now set to launch sometime early next year.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1834336184639820240" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the two studios say that the game needs a little extra time to cook, and so it's being pushed back to early 2025. It was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-gameplay-announce-pc-consoles">originally due to arrive sometime this year</a>.</p>
<p>Wētā and Private Division's reasoning is pretty standard stuff in video game delay terms;&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>needs to be "everything you're hoping for", and the extra time is to ensure the developers can "deliver that vision" of a cozy hobbit life sim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-watering.jpg?itok=Y0q_PrLN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-watering.jpg?itok=VUqu4e6c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry, hobbit fans, but&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is going to take a bit longer than you thought.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not all bad news, though. A new&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>release date will be announced during the Hobbit Day Showcase, which will be held on September 22nd and which will also contain new info about the game.</p>
<p>If you're not sure exactly what <i>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</i>is, it's a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>game in which you <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cozy-hobbit-game-tales-of-shire-announed">take control of a hobbit</a> and build a life for yourself in the small hobbit village of Bywater.</p>
<p>You'll be able to do all the stuff you'd expect from a life sim; create your own hobbit, interact with the locals and get to know them, and grow crops and plants in your garden. You'll also be able to fish, forage for fruit, and trade with other hobbits around town.</p>
<p>Unlike many other&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>games out there right now,&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>isn't really interested in giving you a grand adventure; it's more about letting you live a chilled-out life in a cozy corner of Middle-earth.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pick up&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010195" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game/9pkkjbvpp4gw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> sometime next year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-mulls-going-free-to-play-live-service-or-sticking-with-pay-to-play-as-ps5-tgs-rumors-swirl<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The developer of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> has revealed a conundrum it faces as it looks to the future: take the game free-to-play and live service, or stick with its current pay-to-play model.</p><p>Palworld is the phenomenally successful multiplayer survival crafting game that's been dubbed ‘Pokemon with guns’ for its inclusion of creatures called Pals. It launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Japanese developer Pocketpair has said the game was so popular, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle">it couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-addresses-dead-game-debate-who-cares-if-theres-only-five-people-playing">While player numbers have declined somewhat since Palworld’s explosive launch</a>, it remains one of the most-played games on Steam (Microsoft does not make Windows PC and Xbox player numbers public), sitting comfortably in the top 100. But for Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe, thoughts are now turning to the future, and whether to make Palworld free-to-play and embrace the live service model so many other games have adopted.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p>In an interview with <a href="https://ascii.jp/elem/000/004/220/4220741/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASCII Japan</a>, translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-faces-the-difficult-choice-of-whether-to-become-a-live-service-game-or-stay-buy-to-play-pocketpairs-ceo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, Mizobe said Pocketpair needs to make a decision between the two business models.</p><p>“When you think about it from a business perspective, making (Palworld) a live-service game would extend its lifespan and make it more stable in terms of profitability,” Mizobe said. “However, the game was not initially designed with that approach in mind, so there would be many challenges involved in taking it down the live-service path.”</p><p>One of those challenges would be turning Palworld from a pay-to-play game into a free-to-play game, which would in turn crank up the monetization. “It is common for live-service games to be F2P with paid elements such as skins and battle passes, but Palworld is a B2P game, so it’s difficult to turn it into a live-service game from the ground up,” Mizobe explained.</p><p>While there are examples of games that have successfully made the switch from premium to free (Fall Guys and PUBG are two), doing so requires a great deal of effort and much risk. “Both (games) took several years to make the shift," Mizobe added. "While I understand that the live-service model is good for business, it’s not that easy.”</p><p>It sounds like a decision has yet to be made, and Pocketpair is keenly aware of a potential backlash from players who have already paid $30 to play Palworld. But it’s worth keeping in mind that Palworld launched in early access form just over half a year ago, so it’s early days yet.</p><p>Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip">signing a deal with Sony</a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p>This is not a publishing deal for Palworld the video game, or an acquisition by Sony, rather an attempt to make the most of the game’s huge popularity with non-video game products, such as merchandise and music. The newly formed business, headed up by Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe, is responsible for global licensing and merchandising activities associated with Palworld.</p><p>Speaking of Sony, Palworld is heavily rumored to be set for a PlayStation launch announcement at this month’s Tokyo Game Show, after the game popped up on a schedule. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-palworld-is-coming-to-playstation">Pocketpair had teased a PlayStation release back in June</a>, so this would come as little surprise. TGS runs from September 26 to 29.</p><p>While Palworld is one of the biggest game launches ever, it’s also one of the most controversial. Pocketpair has said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-says-they-have-received-death-threats-amid-pokmon-rip-off-claims"><u>its staff has received death threats amid Pokémon "rip-off" claims</u></a>, which it has denied. Soon after launch, Nintendo moved quickly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/modder-who-put-pokmon-into-palword-says-nintendo-has-come-for-me"><u>to remove an eye-catching Pokémon mod</u></a>, then <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-makes-an-official-statement-on-palworld-we-intend-to-investigate"><u>The Pokemon Company issued a statement</u></a>, saying: "We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to Pokémon." <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-palworld-blows-up-could-nintendo-successfully-sue-the-controversial-pokemon-with-guns-game"><u>IGN asked lawyers whether Nintendo could successfully sue</u></a>.</p><p>If you're playing, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/maps/palworld/palpagos-islands"><u>IGN's interactive Palworld map</u></a>, or how you can create a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-palworld-server-hosting"><u>dedicated Palworld server with your friends</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    <p><span>Traverse the barren Outer Ring with the Sons of Calydon.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.2 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Tour de Inferno,” will launch on September 25, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [173 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-914326"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Proxies will expand their journey in New Eridu to the desolate outskirts known as the Outer Ring while hopping on a passionate motorcycle ride with Caesar, Burnice and other members from the Sons of Calydon. Meanwhile, the brand-new <a title="Genres > Arcade [61 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade game</a> “Bizarre Brigade” at Godfinger and various events including “Overlord’s Feast” will offer players more entertaining ways to enjoy the game. With optimizations for the TV mode, squad preset, time and stamina systems being implemented in this version update, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is aiming to keep providing its players with a better gaming experience.</p><p>Serving as the main stage for the upcoming chapter of the story, Outer Ring is an undeveloped and barren area located out of downtown, New Eridu. Despite the desolation, the area is affluent in fuel resources which sometimes leads to simmering tensions and competition among different groups. In Version 1.2, Proxies will work with Caesar, Burnice, and other members from the Sons of Calydon for a showdown with their rival, The Vanquishers, and Overlord Pompey. Players will also be able to explore New Eridu as Caesar and Burnice in the new version.</p><p>As a faction active in the Outer Ring, the Sons of Calydon operates a logistics company known as “Leaps and Bounds” and transports resources through Hollows. Caesar, the leader of the Sons of Calydon, is an S-Rank Physical Defense Agent. Besides providing allies with a shield buff, she can also deal massive damage with her shield and debuff enemies once Perfect Block or Defensive Assist is triggered. The other new character, Burnice, is an S-Rank Fire Anomaly Agent who can deal an impressive amount of Fire damage and quickly accumulate Anomaly Buildup to Burn enemies with two flamethrowers. In the meantime, the Sons of Calydon’s S-Rank Bangboo Red Moccus is also eager to join the combat with a customized Bangboo motorcycle.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_914325"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Additionally, a time-limited <a title="Genres > Survival [319 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> shooting arcade game called “Bizarre Brigade” will be available at Godfinger. By advancing through this <a title="Genres > Roguelike [252 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike game</a>, players can unlock different characters and use them to complete challenges. Players will also get an opportunity to practice their combat skills with characters from different factions for free, level up their Agents faster, and obtain rewards via a new gameplay called Investigator Training Course at HIA.</p><p>Beyond content updates, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> will optimize several in-game mechanics and features to offer Proxies a better and more seamless game experience. Starting from Version 1.2, players can automatically acquire all Observation Data and rewards on the TV board with the help of FAIRY once finishing exploring the board for the first time. The presentation of the TV board including certain animations will also be improved and accelerated while players will enjoy the story and combat more directly and consistently in the new Chapter 4. Moreover, players will be able to preset their lineups for the combat and switch the time freely, and a Backup Battery Charge will be provided to offer players more stamina in the game.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,917 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,213 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a></p><p>Watch the version 1.2 trailer and special program below.

There’s something about the juxtaposition between their tiny innocence and their menacing actions that is very unsettling—whether they are possessed by something supernatural or just born that way. </p><p>There are many well-known little devils in the classic horror canon, like Damien from <em>The Omen</em> and Regan in <em>The Exorcist</em>, but to kick off spooky season this year, we thought we’d turn our eye to more contemporary horror and select some of the creepiest children in modern cinema. These kiddos rightfully earn their place amongst the other horror movie legends whose sweet, youthful demeanors mask sinister intentions. But be warned, the kids are not alright.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="21aa95334b99bb2971ccb66385944c38" data-recommend-id="image://21aa95334b99bb2971ccb66385944c38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Samuel holds a toy.

His scariness lies in how challenging it is to take care of him, especially as a single parent, which his mother, Amelia, is. He has a very big and rambunctious personality and creative imagination, which result in ear-splitting tantrums, violent outbursts, and the hyperactive creation of homemade weapons. Since <em>The Babadook</em> puts us in the mindset of a mother who is dealing with grief, every little thing about Samuel makes the viewer want to explode in anger or frustration. The prospect of raising a child like him is terrifying; no matter how much love you might have for him, the way he constantly bounces off the wall would be a never-ending nightmare.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="874f5fc1c5cd23ea082b0874a1a30b9d" data-recommend-id="image://874f5fc1c5cd23ea082b0874a1a30b9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charlie stands in front of a tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie stands in front of a tree." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->A24</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="874f5fc1c5cd23ea082b0874a1a30b9d" data-recommend-id="image://874f5fc1c5cd23ea082b0874a1a30b9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charlie stands in front of a tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Charlie from <em>Hereditary </em>is a misunderstood girl who keeps to herself, wears oversized sweatshirts, and always has a dazed and confused look on her face. She enjoys drawing, cutting the head off a pigeon, creating dolls out of twigs and branches, and making peculiar clucking noises. She seems bizarre yet harmless, but the bleak revelations at the end of the film make us see Charlie in a more ominous light. </p><p>It turns out that her body is not truly hers but is inhabited by the soul of King Paimon–-an all-powerful ruler of hell–- who is scared and out-of-place in a female form (LOL). Charlie emphasizes what makes <em>Hereditary </em>such a devastating horror film: The characters are powerless, their destinies already decided by the malevolent cult. Charlie’s unsettling behavior is a reflection of her true self trapped, screaming on the inside, completely overtaken by a demon and stripped of her autonomy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ec63b8afcb696753623091a0a939660" data-recommend-id="image://8ec63b8afcb696753623091a0a939660" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Megan looks into the camera.

Her well-mannered behavior and painting talents make her an immediate choice to be adopted by an American family. She exhibits strange behaviors—such as observing her adopted parents in intimate moments or pushing her sibling off a playground.

She returns home with bandages around her face and odd behaviors that make the boys question her identity and convince themselves that they must torment her to make her confess who she really is. </p><p>What makes the twins so frightening how effortlessly they come up with the sadistic ways to inflict pain upon their mother. They tie her to the bed, Super Glue her lips shut, put cockroaches on her, and even set fire to the lavish family home. <em>Goodnight Mommy</em> delivers twice the evil to show how deep sibling bonds can run, often causing them to influence one another in the worst ways. A child’s boundless imagination can be used for bad ideas just as much as good. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cbf3be669dcaad7c2eb97c9654198638" data-recommend-id="image://cbf3be669dcaad7c2eb97c9654198638" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Brandon stands wearing a ski mask." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Brandon stands wearing a ski mask." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cbf3be669dcaad7c2eb97c9654198638" data-recommend-id="image://cbf3be669dcaad7c2eb97c9654198638" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Brandon stands wearing a ski mask." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Brightburn </em>has a bold concept: What if a child with Superman-like powers wanted to use those powers for evil?

He kills without any remorse or concern. Brandon’s outfit—a threadbare ski mask tied with a shoelace, a ratty cape, and a striped t-shirt—blends the everyday look of a child with a makeshift superhero costume. <em>Brightburn </em>mixes elements of sci-fi, comic book mythology, and horror to create one of the scariest kids ever. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="220e8a0d0515b456a2f5a9d2398ca3ca" data-recommend-id="image://220e8a0d0515b456a2f5a9d2398ca3ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Samara walks out of a well.

It took me years to stop having nightmares about her, and she still gives me chills to this day.

Eventually her mother, Anna, abandons her in a well where Samara manages to live for seven days. </p><p>Everything about the way Samara looks is nightmare fuel: her long, stringy black hair covers her decaying, angry face and her plain, ragged dress is drenched in dirty well-water, and she seemingly can’t be escaped. In her quest for vengeance, she spreads a haunted VHS tape filled with her nihilistic visions across the world and literally breaks through the television to kill you. She murders her victims in a gruesome way that makes them understand the torment she experienced at the bottom of the well. They are left with faces twisted and frozen in a permanent scream, horrifying images that burn into your brain forever. <br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Epic Games, Electronic Arts, Roblox, Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, Mojang Studios, Supercell, and Ubisoft are the target of a new mobile-gaming consumer complaint filed by The European Consumer Organization (BEUC) with the European Commission and the European Network of Consumer Authorities. In short, BEUC is accusing the companies of tricking players into spending money on in-app purchases with misleading marketing tactics.</p><p>As part of the complaint, BEUC released <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-061_Monetising_play_Regulating_in_game_and_in_app_premium_currencies.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a 36-page report</a> detailing its allegations. The report accuses the video game companies of using "harmful commercial practices" including loot boxes, deceptive designs, in-game premium currency, and aggressive marketing to fool players--especially children-- into making in-app purchases.</p><p>"BEUC's members have identified numerous cases where gamers are misled into spending money," said BEUC Director General Agustin Reyna in a statement. "Regulators must act, making it clear that even though the gaming world is virtual, it still needs to abide by real-world rules. Today, premium in-game currencies are purposefully tricking consumers and take a big toll on children. Companies are well aware of children's vulnerability and use tricks to lure younger consumers into spending more."</p><p>Via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/12/bad-credits-consumer-group-files-eu-suit-over-manipulative-payments-in-games-like-fortnite-and-minecraft-calls-for-a-ban/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TechCrunch</a>, Video Games Europe--which represents many of the video game companies in the EU--blasted the complaint in its own statement. The coalition also noted that the mobile games can be played without spending money.</p><p>"The purchase of in-game currencies is a well-established practice, and well understood by players. Our members always respect European consumer laws in how they offer these purchases... Video Games Europe and its members support and promote fair and transparent principles for purchases of in-game content, including for in-game currency."</p><p>BEUC is a consumer group, and thus can't make any rules for its member states. But its report does suggest potential legal remedies, including a ban on in-game and in-app purchases made by underage players as well as a ban on in-game premium currencies. Whether the European Network of Consumer Authorities will follow any of these recommendations remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>The proposed sales of Metro studio 4A Games, as well as that of Pinball developer Zen Studios, has been cancelled, Embracer announced today.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">March of this year</a>, Embracer announced the sale of more of its assets, including large portions of Saber Interactive, for the price of $247m. At this time, <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1768216189661024581">Saber's new CEO Matt Karch</a> stated the company had decided to take 4A and Zen with it, despite initial messaging from Embracer suggesting the Swedish conglomerate may retain the two studios.</p>
<p>Now, however, the potential sale of both studios has been cancelled, and 4A and Zen will remain within Embracer.</p>

<p>"We are satisfied with the conclusion of this transaction and very glad to see the great teams and assets of 4A Games and Zen Studios remain within Embracer. They will be important building blocks in our continued journey," Lars Wingefors, co-founder and CEO of Embracer, said in a <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Embracer-Group-receives-early-payment-for-sale-of-Saber-assets.-4A-Games-and-Zen-Studios-will-remain-within-Embracer-Group-240913.pdf">press release</a> accompanying today's news.</p>
<p>The exec added 4A currently has "two AAA titles under development", which the company is looking forward to announcing.</p>
<p>"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Matthew Karch for his contributions over the years, and at the same time congratulate the Saber team on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">successful release of the iconic Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, that will make a great start in their new structure," Wingefors closed.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Karch told Bloomberg's Jason Schreier "it was always [Saber's] intention to exercise on 4A" but the company "thought it would be better for all parties" the studio stays with Embracer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-leaked-benchmark-increased-resolution-max-settings/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A PlayStation 5 Pro leaked benchmark shared online a few hours ago provides a good overview of how games will be improved when running on the soon-to-be-released new console.</p>
<p>An unspecified developer that was consulted on previous leaks sent Moore's Law is Dead early testing footage of one of their games that compares it running on base and Pro models side-by-side, complete with displayed framerates. According to the footage, this game uses a 1080p-1600p dynamic resolution range with a mix of medium and high settings and runs between 45 and 60 FPS on the base model. The same game, on PlayStation 5 Pro, uses a higher dynamic resolution range, 1600p-2160p, with no PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, maximum settings, and runs at locked 60 frames per second without any drop. The developer is looking into trying 4K resolution and 120 Hz modes in the future.</p>
<p>Besides providing the early test footage, the unnamed developer also provided some additional information on the PlayStation 5 Pro. The console adds an option for 8K, which has only been confirmed to be available for Gran Turismo 7 as of now, and has access to an extra 1.2 GB of RAM due to a Memory System Efficiency system. According to the documentation provided by Sony, the console, in practice, exceeds a 28% bandwidth increase as well. High CPU Frequency Mode will also offer 10% more CPU performance for just lower than 1.5% GPU performance, providing developers with more options as required.</p>
<p>Things seem to be looking up for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler as well. The PlayStation 5 Pro AI-driven upscaler was recently updated to version 9.4, which improves the image quality over version 9.0 and uses only 250MB of RAM. The available memory doesn't seem to be an issue for the system as well, as Sony added just enough usable RAM, according to this developer.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Benchmark Leak, AMD Zen 5 Sales Update, RADEON UDNA, Intel Arrow Lake | August Loose Ends" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nhZJ1RTTsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While definitely exciting, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/">PlayStation 5 Pro technical presentation</a> did not go as in-depth as this leaked benchmark does. Hopefully, Sony will provide better information on how the console will improve games in the near future, as the shared footage doesn't look <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-early-comparison-minimal-improvements/">too impressive</a>. The console's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">high price</a> will still be unjustified for most players, but more may be willing to make the jump to the system with better information that properly highlights what the console's increased specs and PSSR upscaler can do.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide on November 7th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-layoffs-hit-call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-which-didnt-hit-as-big-as-hoped<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft’s shock gaming layoffs have reportedly hit the Activision Blizzard teams behind mobile games <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warcraft-rumble">Warcraft Rumble</a>.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Xbox boss Phil Spencer sent a memo to staff</a>, verified by IGN, that outlined a further 650 layoffs at Microsoft’s gaming business. These layoffs follow the 1,900 made earlier this year, and bring the total up to an eye-watering 2,550 since Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year.</p><p>While Spencer insisted no games were canceled or studios closed this time, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File</a> reports that Activision Blizzard’s development teams for Call of Duty Warzone Mobile and Warcraft Rumble were hit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Call of Duty Warzone Mobile launched in March on iOS and Android as a Warzone-specific Call of Duty mobile experience that offers battle royale for up to 120 players, as well as cross-progression with the PC and console Warzone, Modern Warfare 2 and 3, and the upcoming Black Ops 6. IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-review">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile includes all the best elements of Warzone, while speeding up and streamlining matches and using cross-progression to make this a meaningful extension of the traditional experience."</p><p>Activision’s hope was that Warzone Mobile would make a splash in the competitive mobile shooter market, where the hugely successful Call of Duty Mobile, developed by Tencent-owned TiMi Studio Group, is already established. With Call of Duty Mobile, which has seen 650 million downloads since launch, revenue is shared between Activision and Tencent. Call of Duty Warzone Mobile, on the other hand, is developed entirely in-house at Activision, and so the company gets a bigger slice of the money pie every time a player drops cash on a battle pass or a cosmetic.</p><p>It sounds like Call of Duty Warzone Mobile hasn’t met Activision’s expectations, however. <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1834348582498963532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File’s Stephen Totilo said</a> that Warzone Mobile “didn't hit as big as hoped,” and that while it will remain online, its team “is being scaled down.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>Spencer referenced Warzone Mobile’s struggle in his memo, without namechecking the game itself: “Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games.”</p><p>Similarly, Blizzard’s Warcraft Rumble team is affected by the layoffs. Warcraft Rumble launched as a free-to-play mobile tower defense game in 2023 across iOS and Android and while it started strong, interest appears to have tailed off. Warcraft Rumble is now moving from launch to post-launch live ops, but will remain online.</p><p>Activision Blizzard’s recent mobile struggles call into question Microsoft’s acquisition of the company itself, given Spencer has made no secret that the decision to buy the company was in part motivated by Xbox’s lofty mobile ambitions (Activision Blizzard owns King, the maker of phenomenally popular mobile game Candy Crush). Indeed, Microsoft plans to launch an app store of its own, taking on Apple and Google in the lucrative mobile game space.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales"><u>Xbox hardware sales were way down again in Microsoft's Q4</u></a>, the latest financial quarter we have figures for, while gaming content sales skyrocketed again thanks to Activision Blizzard. Gaming revenue overall appears to be doing more than fine in terms of year-on-year comparisons, even setting quarterly records, but this was largely due to the boost offered by Activision Blizzard (it wasn't there to make money for the company last year, now it is, so the numbers have gone up).</p><p>Gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, but with 48 points of net impact from the acquisition, which indicates that Xbox's not-Activision Blizzard-related business isn't doing as well as it was last year. Xbox content and services revenue fared better, up 61% year-over-year, with 58 points of net impact from the acquisition.</p><p>Overall, Microsoft's More Personal Computing division (which includes Xbox as well as other segments such as Windows) brought in $15.9 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year, during Q4.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games.</p></div><p>Speaking in August, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5"><u>Spencer said that Xbox’s controversial multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business</u></a> — with the pressure now on to deliver following Microsoft’s acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p>“And we run a business,” Spencer said. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p>“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p>Microsoft is set to launch Activision's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</u></a> in October as the first mainline Call of Duty game to hit its Game Pass subscription service day-one.

<p>It appears a link to a rom containing the entire game has started making its way online.  Nintendo-focused YouTuber Nintendo Prime said they "have confirmed" it is real.</p>
<p>In a separate YouTube video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaoF0C0YsC8">Nintendo Prime</a> stated they checked the link they had been sent, and it was "the rom for Echoes of Wisdom". The YouTuber - who has not shared any of the leaked footage, stating they are <a href="https://x.com/NintyPrime/status/1834312441838121190">not distributing</a> the rom as it's "illegal and career ending to do so" - said Echoes of Wisdom is now playable on emulators.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, Warhorse Studios finally satisfied the many fans of its debut title with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The Czech developer had been quiet for a very long time but came out of the shadows promising a 2024 launch and a bigger, better game in every respect.</p>
<p>The release had to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> a little beyond the original plan to February 11, 2025, but the rest of the promises remain intact, as testified by Chris's recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a>. At Gamescom 2024, I also got my hands on the game, although the session was much shorter than the one available at the dedicated press event.</p>
<p>A game like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 doesn't lend itself well to a quick 45-minute demonstration. The combat system is similar to that in the first game and remains highly unique, taking a bit of time to get used to after all these years (I finished Kingdom Come Deliverance at launch, so over six years ago).&nbsp; Even so, some of the improvements were obvious from the get-go, such as better movement animations and facial animations. It was also great to experiment with the 'chat system' that allows Henry to seamlessly interact with passersby NPCs without entering the classic dialogue window, in a fashion that reminded me of Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>The visuals looked amazing, too, and the game already ran smoothly, which is very promising for the full game's optimization. After the demo, I interviewed Warhorse Executive Producer Martin Klima to dive deeper into what we can expect from Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 when it launches in less than five months.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Official Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VP6bjlger8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you start working on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2? Was it immediately after the launch of the base game, or did you wait until the release of the final DLC?</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to say, as developing a game is a complex process. I think we gradually shifted from supporting Kingdom Come Deliverance, and I would say that only after the release of the last DLC and the last update were we able to focus on the sequel.</p>
<p><strong>I know that you've kept the CryENGINE. Did you consider any other engine early on?</strong></p>
<p>When we finished KCD, we took a look at the technology we were using and were considering our options, but we decided that keeping CryENGINE made the most sense for us because we spent a lot of time customizing it for our needs and I think we are very happy. I'm quite proud of the performance we have now.</p>
<p><strong>Did you get the latest version from Crytek or are you still using your own from the first installment?</strong></p>
<p>We have access to the latest version of the engine. Of course, we also wanted to keep our customization. In the end, although the engine that we have is not quite the same engine that Crytek uses for Hunt: Showdown, it is very close.</p>
<p><strong>Do you support hardware ray tracing and/or multiple upscalers in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</strong></p>
<p>We support upscaling tech, both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR. We are not using hardware ray tracing; CryENGINE has very good software ray tracing. <strong><em>[After the interview, I learned from Warhorse that the game actually uses Sparse Voxel Octree Global Illumination, or SVOGI. It was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-gets-svogi-onoff-comparison-performance-hit-is-minimal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> in the first game, although it has since been improved]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>I know the game is a lot bigger than the first one. What was the main challenge?</strong></p>
<p>It was a challenge in terms of production. We had to increase the team to deliver the content, not to mention the amount of effort that was required to improve certain aspects, such as facial animation and dialogue animation. We had those in the first as well, but we wanted them to be much better. In terms of performance, the larger size is not much of an issue when you have a good streaming engine. We put a lot of effort into improving the performance since that can influence the perception of the game, and we wanted to have a smoother experience.</p>
<p><strong>I remember the first Kingdom Come Deliverance to be quite heavy on PCs.</strong></p>
<p>It was. There were a lot of things that we were doing just by brute force, and I think this additional time we had in the development for this sequel allowed us to optimize a lot, parallelize, and utilize CPUs better. Of course, hardware is faster now, and the consoles have more memory and better performance.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game run at 60 FPS on consoles?</strong></p>
<p>60FPS is something that's not out of reach for us.</p>
<p><strong>I know that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has two maps. Can you move from one to the other at any point in the story, or is it gated by certain events?</strong></p>
<p>It's gated by the story. You will start in a certain situation, which gives you a limited amount of possibilities. At a certain point, you will travel to the second map, and from that point onward, you can move freely.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Travel between maps is initially gated by the story. You will start in a certain situation, which gives you a limited amount of possibilities. At a certain point, you will travel to the second map, and from that point onward, you can move freely.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>During the presentation, we were told that you strived to make combat more accessible. How did you achieve this?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's a confluence of several decisions that we made. We wanted to streamline the way you control combat. Previously, we used three buttons: one for slashing, one for stabbing, and one for blocking. It felt too cumbersome, so we streamlined that, and now we have just one button for attacking and another for blocking.</p>
<p>The attack zone determines whether you are stabbing or slashing (provided you have a weapon capable of doing so, as blunt weapons cannot). Currently, we have four attack zones. Because we limited the number of attack zones, we were also able to limit the number of guards, leading to a much smoother transition between attacks and blocks. Combat looks much clearer and more natural than before.</p>
<p>We were also able to hire more people to guide us through the true medieval fencing techniques and we employed more people for motion capture. Each weapon has a more distinct style to it. Also, enemies won't repeat the same animation like in a synchronized swimming competition, making combat look more realistic.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We are introducing polearms and firearms, which obviously is the biggest change. We are also adding crossbows. Bows have a higher rate of fire and are more difficult to aim, and usually, they deal lower damage, though not necessarily. Crossbows take a lot of time to load but are much easier to aim and can deal high damage. Firearms are also really difficult to load and can be inaccurate, but they are really powerful, so if you happen to hit something, the damage will be substantial.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I know you are introducing new weapons in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Can you talk about them?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We are introducing polearms and firearms, which obviously is the biggest change. We are also adding crossbows, which is something that's typical of the time period. Polearms were actually there in the first game, but they were too cumbersome and you couldn't put them in your inventory, so they were kinda useless.</p>
<p><strong>I guess they have very different use cases.</strong></p>
<p>Definitely. Bows have a higher rate of fire and are more difficult to aim, and usually, they deal lower damage, though not necessarily. Crossbows take a lot of time to load but are much easier to aim and can deal high damage. Firearms are also really difficult to load and can be inaccurate, but they are really powerful, so if you happen to hit something, the damage will be substantial.</p>
<p><strong>Can it malfunction?</strong></p>
<p>I won't comment on this.</p>
<p><strong>Can you craft your own bullets for the firearms?</strong></p>
<p>No, not really. But we have introduced a certain level of crafting to the game, so you can create your own weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to craft armor as well?</strong></p>
<p>No, only weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. Talking about character progression, did you make any notable changes in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</strong></p>
<p>The skill tree is, I would say, not completely different but quite different from what you know, even like the basic skills, but the core principle that you improve by doing stuff stays the same. So, if you ride a horse, you will get better at horse riding; if you fight a lot, you will improve at using weapons, and so on.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It was always our ambition to create a living world where NPCs have their routines rather than just standing there and waiting for the player to go talk to them. I think we improved on this a lot in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. We were able to create a world that I think behaves more believably and reacts to player actions in a more nuanced way.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>I know one of the big changes with the sequel is also the lively world enabled by more dynamic NPCs. Can you talk about those improvements?</strong></p>
<p>It was always our ambition to create a living world where NPCs have their routines rather than just standing there and waiting for the player to go talk to them. I think we improved on this a lot in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. We were able to create a world that I think behaves more believably and reacts to player actions in a more nuanced way.</p>
<p>To give you an example, we have been recording <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-more-dialogue-than-baldurs-gate-3-half-of-all-wheel-of-time-books-combined/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a huge number of dialogue lines</a>, and almost half of that is not related to the game story at all. They are NPC reactions to the player's actions, such as when you steal something, when you enter an area where you shouldn't be, when an NPC finds a body, or when they open their chest and realize it's been emptied. It is very nuanced; even depending on what was stolen, you might get different reactions.</p>
<p><strong>You also have a reputation system in place.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. That was in the first game as well, but it underwent a certain evolution. It's a little bit more fine-grained here.</p>
<p><strong>I noticed that you can also briefly interact with the passing NPCs in a way I've only ever seen before in Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2. Was that the inspiration?</strong></p>
<p>It is a new feature we added to the game. In Kingdom Come Deliverance, you could only talk to NPCs through the dialogue system, which also switched the camera and stopped whatever the NPC was doing. It's really good for those story-based moments dialogues so that you get this movie-like experience of different camera angles and custom animation created for that dialogue. But we also wanted a more lightweight method for interacting with NPCs where you don't switch to another camera angle, and the animation just keeps doing what they are doing.</p>
<p><strong>It's more seamless that way.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, and this is what we call the chat system. It was originally developed for those moments in the story where you just need to tell somebody something, or somebody asks you something, and you answer just yes or no, without launching the whole heavy dialogue system. Once we had it, we realized that we could do a lot more with that. Greeting passersby was the natural expansion of this system. I don't think it was a conscious reaction to Red Dead Redemption 2. Of course, we are gamers, all of us play other people's games. I am sure some 70 percent of the team probably played Red Dead Redemption 2 so it would be silly to deny that it might have been even subconsciously influenced by them, but then, we are influenced by every game we play.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. It's just that when I first saw it in that game, I thought many games would borrow the system, as it added a lot to the interactivity, but actually they didn't. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is the first game I've played since that really has something similar.</strong></p>
<p>True. Again, though, I don't think it was a conscious decision.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 now supports AMD FSR 3.0 officially, which brings performance improvements with frame generation but still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of image quality.</p>
<p>New comparison videos based on the game's latest version shared online highlight how implementing an outdated version of AMD's upscaler wasn't the best of choices, as visual quality is outright bad on multiple system configurations and at different resolutions, essentially negating the performance improvements brought by frame generation, which cannot be used with any other upscaler in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 Official FSR 3 Update - DLSS 3.7 vs FSR 3 Frame Generation Comparison | RTX 3080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9tMoPwblkvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Besides introducing AMD FSR 3.0 support, the new Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50818/patch-2-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.13 patch</a>, which was only released for PC, also brings Intel XeSS 1.3 support, enables the usage of both DLAA and DLSS Ray Reconstruction at the same time, and introduces some other unspecified stability and visual fixes. Hopefully, this won't be the last patch CDPR puts out for the game, as introducing support for the much better AMD FSR 3.1 would be rather welcome.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. The Phantom Liberty expansion, released last year, is only available on PC and current generation consoles. You can learn more about it and the big 3.0 patch which introduces important gameplay and progression changes in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Bungie has "resolved" a plagiarism accusation after an artist accused the studio of lifting their alternative design of an "iconic" <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> weapon.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Bungie <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1833596360840376515">revealed</a> a physical Nerf LMTD blaster based upon Cayde-6's hand cannon, Ace of Spades.</p>
<p>Shortly after the blaster was revealed, artist Tofu_Rabbit called out the developer on Twitter/X, stating the Nerf design was not merely "similar" to a design they did back in 2015, but essentially a carbon copy, down to the "same brush strokes and scratches/smudges".</p>

<p>Bungie dropped a statement shortly thereafter, saying it was "currently investigating internally and with our partner. We are in contact with the artist and will share more on what next steps we are taking once we have gathered more information".</p>
<p>Whilst there's been nothing further from Bungie about the issue, earlier today (13th September), Tofu_Rabbit updated their thread to confirm that the issue has now been resolved, although they stopped short of confirming any of the details or if compensation was offered.</p>
<p>"Just wanted to give one last final update, the situation with Bungie is resolved!" they announced.</p>

<p>A month after Bungie acknowledged player "uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny" following mass layoffs at the studio, the developer has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year">"major changes for the future" of its live-service shooter</a>, which will now receive multiple paid expansions a year.</p>
<p>More specifically, Destiny 2's overhauled release model, announced to coincide with the series' tenth anniversary, will see two "medium-sized" paid expansions release annually, alongside four "major" free content updates. All this will form a "new multi-year saga" (the first since Destiny 2's Light and Darkness saga concluded with its The Final Shape expansion earlier this year) promising new characters, factions, twists, and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Humanity’s last bastion, The City of Numbers, has been destroyed. Not just a little bit destroyed either, we’re talking overrun by evil creatures and corrupted by decay. Without a home, the human race sought sanctuary in the Belfry, an immense tower, but the spread of evil attempted to follow them. Humanity needs protectors – known as Aces – warriors tasked with protecting the last inhabitants. This is where you come in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towerborne Dev Diary #3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcZ3l5-ZETM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Towerborne is a scrolling beat em’up – or is that sword ‘em up? – where you and your friends can come together and face off against the denizens of the wilderness who seem set on getting rid of every last human. While it’s a complete change of pace from their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/the-banner-saga-3-review/">The Banner Saga trilogy</a>, Stoic’s pedigree is clear and it’s a gorgeous-looking game. It might also only just be entering into Early Access, but there’s already a lot for budding Aces to get their sword into.</p>


<p>Towerborne’s character creation tool is excellent, which is all the more impressive when you’re likely to have a helmet on that stops you seeing your character’s face most of the time. The Facial Features setting is particularly expansive, offering a batch of freckles, birthmarks, pigmentations and other details, just about stopping short of being able to place specific moles. There’s a vast array of hairstyles, noses and ears too, meaning you’ll be able to make a character that’s absolutely your own.</p>


<p>Combat starts out as you’d expect, with light and heavy attacks, launchers, and then special skills called Focus Attacks. However, each class has its own Class Mechanic that uses your Weapon Meter. You build Weapon Meter by dishing out damage or taking it. In the case of the shield-toting Sentinel, your Class Mechanic allows you to block and parry enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Once through the tutorial you encounter the other available classes, from the explosive Warclub-wielding Pyroclast to the dual-blade toting Shadowstriker. You can change your class at any time, with each levelling up individually alongside an overarching character level, meaning you’re not tied into your earlier choices, and can concoct a blend of playstyles when buddying up with other players. That goes for your appearance too, so you can change things up whenever you feel the need.</p>
<p>You also gain an Umbra, an entity from the spirit realm that accompanies you in battle. They have their own special abilites and attacks that further add to your loadout, letting you customise your character that bit further, and being a cute reward for certain milestones in the world.</p>
<p>You can effectively combo attacks into one another and it all flows together really effectively. There’s obvious overtones of classic sword ‘em ups like Golden Axe and Guardian Heroes, but there’s much more depth to the combat system, giving you a variety of options and ways to tackle the gruesome creatures in front of you.</p>

<p>Grotesque they may be, but Towerborne is still a lovely-looking game, brimming with Ghibli-esque charm. The Belfry in particular, looks like something straight out of Howl’s Moving Castle, and it carries that sense of excitement and wonder that a social hub needs, playing host to blacksmiths, mission givers and training areas to continue to improve your skills.</p>
<p>This is where you set off on missions, and selecting the world map sees the Belfry at the centre, with a hexagonal grid overlayed across it. You expand your area of influence by completing missions in adjacent tiles, and as you move further across the map you come across boss characters which stand as a major challenge to overcome. There’s danger levels that will block you from going too far before you’re powerful enough – you have to beat a solo challenge to progress – but if you want, you can ramp up the difficulty of missions closer to the Belfry to keep the challenge up.</p>

<p>Towerborne is surprisingly tough. You have to be very aware of being overwhelmed by groups of enemies, learning to split them apart or tackle them as a group. You absolutely need to use all of your skills and abilities, dodging in particular proving immensely useful throughout. It feels more like Monster Hunter than I was expecting, and button-mashing just won’t be rewarded at all. There’s enough options available to you that it never feels one-note, and while its fundamentally an old-school framed adventure, it has the trappings of a modern RPG/multiplayer game with class progression, new skills and plenty of loot to deck your character out with.</p>
<p>Towerborne comes into its own when you play with others, with co-op for up to four players in both online and couch co-op. Thankfully, there’s a good bit of leeway and flexibility with how the overworld is structured, so that you can join and be carried along by higher-levelled players – helpful if you want to buff up a little used character class, as there’s no background uplift for any you’re not playing as – and any progress you make on the map together is fed back into each individual player’s progression. Given how you might all have set off in opposite directions on the map, this can reveal little puddles of tiles that might lure you to clear the fog of war in a new region.</p>

<p>Right now the online matchmaking doesn’t seem to draw anyone in that you aren’t friends with. I’m sure there’ll be the option soon though, and this is one of the few clear signs that the game is in Early Access, as you wistfully watch other players disappear off on missions from the Belfry that you’d have liked to join them for. Still, it’s great as a single player experience too, and slaying goblins soon cheers you up.</p>
<p>Towerborne is a lovely old-school treat, with gorgeous art, an interesting and exciting world, and chunky, enjoyable combat. Stoic has ambitious plans for this as an evolving game, with Seasons that will continue the story, add new regions to discover and enemies to battle, new abilities and more. I can’t wait to play more through Early Access and see how it grows from here.</p>

            <p>I could have described the multiplayer racing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a> a lot of ways. It is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> meets Snowboard Kids. It is Diddy Kong Racing but all the courses are water slides. It's Cool Runnings but there are 40 penguins instead of four Jamaicans. Okay, that last one is a bit of a stretch. But basically, yes, this brightly coloured free-to-play knockout racer feels like that one Super Mario 64 level where you <a href="https://youtu.be/S858wXaD2pk?feature=shared&amp;t=23">race the big penguin down a slide</a>, only this time there are a ton of other players trying to beat you to the secret shortcut. It's coming out next week.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmPXJc7EuBs">squabbling ruthlessness</a> of real world penguins, players are encouraged to attack each other. By bouncing off your opponent's rubbery body you'll be launched into the air, gaining the height needed to reach some handy shortcuts. You'll also be able to activate a paraglider at some point (hello Mario Kart) and ride an Orca for a violent boost. "The outcome of the race remains uncertain until the very end!" say developers Historia. </p>
<p>You can play as a party of four, and there's crossplay with other platforms. I make the comparison to mass obstacle course knockout game Fall Guys mostly because these cartoonish flightless birds seem to have the same dinky, enthusiastic glee to them. That, and you can dress up your penguin in a bunch of different costumes, plus unlock emotes, which I'm guessing is the way this free-to-play racer aims to make money. </p>
<p>It comes out September 19th. "New courses and costumes will be added each season," say the developers, though it's not clear how long those seasons will last. They also add one last proviso: "An Epic Games account is required to play the game." An instant annoyance for some, I bet. But not a dealbreaker for me, I love penguins, and would never do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnOjolF0E3k">anything to harm them</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last night, the industry was shocked to learn the entire staff at indie video game publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> had resigned. This exodus followed after negotiations with Annapurna owner Megan Ellison met an impass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">As Matt reported last night</a>, these departures caused "chaos" among Annapurna Interactive's game developer partners. An Annapurna spokesperson confirmed all existing games and projects will remain with the company, while new president Hector Sanchez reportedly told developers all contracts will be honoured and that all Annapurna Interactive staff will be replaced.</p>
<p>In the time since, many developers have taken to social media to assure their communities of the status of various projects tied to the publisher.</p>

<p>"Nothing's gonna stop us from getting Wanderstop out the door very soon."</p>
<p>Wanderstop studio Ivy Road affirmed Wreden's post. Calling the resignations at Annapurna a "bump in the road" it hadn't anticipated, it wanted to make sure the community knew "the tea is still brewing, and we're still working hard on Wanderstop!"</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Wanderstop</a> is described as a "a narrative-centric cosy game about change and tea", and is set to release "soon".</p>

<p>Matt Newell's Lushfoil Photography Sim also looks to be ok, with the team stating it can "assume at this stage" the publisher's change in circumstances will not impact the game's release.</p>
<p>"But this news is definitely a loss," Lushfoil Photography Sim's social media account posted. "The Annapurna Interactive team were great to work with and gave the project a lot of love."</p>
<p>We got a look at Lushfoil Photography Sim last year, during Annapurna Interactive's showcase. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blade-runner-2033-and-everything-else-from-annapurnas-latest-showcase">As Matt wrote at the time</a>, the upcoming release lives up to its name, arming players with a camera then setting them loose across stunning landscapes, from snowy mountaintops and misty glades to craggy beaches and rainy streets.</p>

<p>Thomas Puha from Control and Alan Wake's Remedy equally assured his followers that the recent change will not affect the studio's partnership with Annapurna, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">this deal was with the 'Pictures' arm of the company</a>.</p>
<p>"Many of you are reaching out about the news around Annapurna (sorry to see what is going on to all involved ) Interactive. Thank you for your care," Puha wrote. He furthered Remedy is self-publishing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.</p>

<p>Beethoven and Dinosaur's Mixtape - one of Annapurna Interactive's most high-profile games - is also ok. "Appreciate all those who reached out," the team wrote, before adding:  "Mixtape continues."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-artful-escape-developers-next-is-teen-drama-mixtape">Mixtape was revealed earlier this year</a>, introducing us to a coming-of-age action adventure game with a soundtrack featuring DEVO, Roxy Music, Lush, The Smashing Pumpkins, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and more.</p>
<p>It is set to release in 2025.</p>

<p>Also still on Annapurna Interacitve's upcoming roster of games is No Code's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>. However, the developer is yet to make a comment on last night's news.</p>
<p>In a statement last night, Annapurna owner Megan Ellison said the company's "top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition".</p>
<p>Said Ellison: "We're committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theatre."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We're having a bit of an indie freebie morning, it seems. My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.</p><!--more-->
<p>Whomst amongst us has not known the surpassing irritation, the abiding frenzy of not <em>quite</em> cutting an item exactly in half in a video game? I have terrible memories of playing Metal Gear Revengeance and trying to bisect a guard and argh argh argh, NOT RIGHT NOT RIGHT. Sorry Desperado soldiers, let's take this from the top.</p>
<p>It's not your fault. Few video game control schemes and interfaces are precise enough for such feats of delicacy, which is why many games with object-slicing mechanics only pretend you've performed a perfect 50/50 cut (it also saves computational resources versus actually simulating an object's division). But even as the signpost or tree trunk or whatever parts under your blade you know, in your heart of hearts, that you have failed. The game isn't helping you, it's mocking you. I see you laughing at me, <a href="https://playfruitninja.com/">Fruit Ninja</a>.</p>
<p>Find <a href="https://theshelfman.itch.io/fiftyfifty">50/50 on Itch.io</a>. Little tip: you don't have to draw a line in one go while playing 50/50 - you can fill in the cut square by square. Thanks to <a href="https://warpdoor.com/2024/09/11/50-50/">Warpdoor</a> for passing this on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That's how Sony is pitching the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-playstation-5-pro-has-finally-been-unveiled">PlayStation 5 Pro</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a mid-cycle upgrade that will cost a staggering $700 and as evidenced during a tonally odd technical presentation, will largely enable owners to gawp at upscaled versions of titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gran Turismo 7</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's been a few days since the console was unveiled by PlayStation lead architect Mark Cerny, who was given less than 10 minutes to convince consumers to part ways with an eye-watering wad of cash. After spending a good chunk of that time explaining why the base PlayStation 5 is still rather brilliant (see, there's no need to be jealous if you can't afford the upgrade), Cerny waxed lyrical about the Pro's prestige features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A turbocharged CPU with 45 percent faster rendering for FPS-drenched gameplay. Advanced ray tracing that apparently makes reflections and refractions look bloody marvelous. AI-driven upscaling that sharpens images by adding detail you wouldn't believe. Appealing? That depends on your disposition. Rampant technophiles who crave the best of the best won't need convincing, but for everyone else this is an all too familiar pitch—and that begs the question: who </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>actually</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cares?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Who cares about seemingly imperceptible marginal gains when Sony hasn't even delivered on the promise of the original PlayStation 5? Where is the software? Where are the raft of PlayStation 5 exclusives that go hell for leather and absolutely floor it? It's concerning that Sony is still relying on PlayStation 4 compatible releases to showcase its shiny new box. Especially when that box doesn't even feature a disc drive (backwards compatibility be damned). This isn't innovation. It's stagnation. If new hardware is a statement, this is Sony proclaiming it has run out of ideas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Debuting the "most powerful console ever" (Cerny's words, not mine) is only a win if you have the software to showcase its ultimate potential. The PlayStation 5 is only four years old but sales have already started to slide away. The PlayStation 5 Pro feels like a wishful attempt to give the console a second wind before it has even begun to soar. During Gamescom, I spoke with a few execs who said the industry has a concerning tendency to look to the past for inspiration rather than attempt something fresh.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The PS5 Pro is precisely that. Sony is circling back to the last console generation and asking for a do-over, but without any real justification. The company just laid off over 1,100 workers at major studios like Naughty Dog, Insomniac, Guerrilla Games, and Bungie. Recent first-party release, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, crashed and burned in the space of two weeks. But hey, I'm sure you'll eventually get a solid return if you slap down $700 on a PS5 Pro.</span></p><p>Can the PlayStation 5 Pro unearth riches for Sony? // Image via Team Asobi | Captured by Game Developer</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I nabbed a PlayStation 5 at launch in 2020. Since then, I've only played two first-party titles that feel genuinely fresh. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro's Playroom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The former is a truly wonderful DualSense controller showcase transposed onto a bitesized 3D platformer. The latter is that vision fully-realized. A joyous, whimsical experience from Team Asobi that proves Sony has the nous to compete with the very best in the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but in championing mechanical tomfoolery and tactile silliness above all else, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> starts to feel incredibly unique by sheer virtue of putting player experience first. It's like jumping into a ball pit as a kid. It's really not that deep, but that doesn't mean it isn't absolutely superb.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The irony here, is that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is also depressingly reliant on nostalgia. In-game, you rescue a variety of bots, many of which come dressed as your favorite PlayStation characters from yesteryear. There's Jak &amp; Daxter. PaRappa the Rapper. Those pesky primates from Ape Escape. The gang is all here, but in pushing those beloved characters front and centre, Sony is also begging players to ask: what happened?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why have so many of them been consigned to fleeting cameos in what's basically a $60 advert for PlayStation (albeit, a very good one)? Why have the studios who birthed those beloved mascots been wrecked by layoffs or shuttered completely? There's no doubting PlayStation has a rich history of innovation. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makes that abundantly clear. It also shows there's still room for growth. Not only room, but a desperate, feverish need.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can only rely on nostalgia for so long. Eventually, you have to take risks and dare to imagine what comes next. Safe is diminishing returns, dying franchises, and spending billions in a desperate attempt to follow trends instead of defining them. The game industry needs its biggest players to take bold leaps.

		<p>The entire staff of video game publishing label Annapurna Interactive is reported to have resigned following a dispute with the owner of the Annapurna business, Megan Ellison.</p>
<p>The executive team had been negotiating to spin the video game division off from parent company Annapurna Pictures, but when Ellison withdrew from the negotiations, Annapurna Interactive President Nathan Gray and other executives resigned – co-heads Deborah Mars and Nathan Vella were named – per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/annapurna-president-nathan-gary-exits-1235993653/">Hollywood Reporter</a>. Fortune has gone further in their reporting, with sources telling them that effectively the entire video games team at Annapurna has quit, with “around two dozen” staffers leaving in solidarity.</p>


<p>Ellison has named Hector Sanchez as the new president, Sanchez recently returning to the company after a stint at Epic Games, and having helped launch Annapurna Interactive in 2016. They will now integrate gaming in with the rest of Annapurna’s divisions, which include film, TV and theatre productions.</p>
<p>A spokesperson confirmed to Fortune that it had been exploring a spinoff, and that the lack of an agreement had led to the resignations, as well as stating that all existing games and projects will remain under Annapurna, though this is absolutely a chaotic moment for the company and will lead to plenty of upheaval for partners.</p>

<p>The company had become increasingly ambitious in the last couple years going from publishing indie titles like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/17/sayonara-wild-hearts-review/">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/20/wattam-review-ps4-pc/">Wattam</a> to more lavish feeling productions like the cat adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/18/stray-review-ps5-ps4-pc/">Stray</a>. Indie games and niche interests have continued to be a big part of their line up, but the company recently penned <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">a deal to provide 50% of the funding for Control 2</a>, while also working together to bring Control and Alan Wake to film and television. That deal is still very much going to hold, but it’s likely that a lot of the names and faces that Remedy were familiar with are now totally different.</p>

            <p>Haha. Hoho. Yes. Hehe. <em>Yes</em>. This rules. This rules so hard. Portal To The Cosmobeat is a rhythm dance battler where you copy the moves of your opponents by controlling each of your limbs, and your head, with a separate key. If you look down at your keyboard right now, you’ll notice your W, A, D, Z and X form a five pointed star - with the W key a bit off, granted. That’s you, that is. You hold down the limbs you want to wiggle, then control them with your mouse. It’s simple, silly, and very fun. Here’s a tray-tray:</p>

<p>A game with no features? Sounds bad. Luckily, Portal To The Cosmobeat has several:</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, developer Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1834336184639820240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Tales of the Shire will be delayed from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-is-a-cozy-hobbit-life-sim-out-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original 2024 release window</a> to early 2025. The news came from a brief message posted on social media:</p>
<p><em>All of us here at Weta Workshop are excited to have you join us in the Shire, a peaceful corner of J.R.R. Tolkien's world. When a new Hobbit steps into Bywater for the very first time, we want that moment to be everything you're hoping for. To ensure we deliver that vision, Tales of the Shire will now be launching early 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your patience and continued support. Be sure to tune in to our A Hobbit Day Showcase on September 22nd to learn more about Tales of the Shire and our new release date.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Tales of the Shire was unveiled around a year ago as a cozy single-player game set in Tolkien's beloved Hobbit land from The Lord of the Rings. Players can customize their Hobbit's appearance and attire and decorate their Hobbit home with grid-free placement to position furniture and home décor to their liking.</p>
<p>Any fan of The Lord of the Rings is well aware of the Hobbits' love for food. In Tales of the Shire, players will have to forage, fish, and tend to their gardens to stock up, harvesting seasonal crops and flowers as time passes in their homestead. Wētā Workshop also promised a fair amount of exploration, with players able to explore Bywater and discover lost treasures in the secret glades of the Shire.</p>
<p>The dynamic weather will influence daily routines, and there will even be seasonal surprises based on the time of year. Throughout the game's storyline, players will encounter iconic characters with which to trade, and completing club missions will further the goal of gaining official village status in Bywater.</p>
<p>Tales of the Shire will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. More information, including the actual release date, will be shared next week as part of the Hobbit Day Showcase.</p>

            <p>Annapurna Interactive - the publisher behind games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cocoon">Cocoon</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray">Stray</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neon-white">Neon White</a> - have seen their entire staff resign after an internal dispute this month, via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>The resignations came in the wake of a dispute between Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and Annapurna studio head Megan Ellison. As Bloomberg report, negotiations were taking place to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity." After failing to reach an agreement, Ellison pulled out of the negotiations, resulting in the resignation of Gary and “other executives.” Further resignations followed, with a reported two dozen other staff leaving the company.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's an extract from the Bloomberg piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>“All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team collectively resigned," Gary and the group said in a joint statement. "This was one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make and we did not take this action lightly."</p>
<p>"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition," Ellison said in a statement to Bloomberg News. "We’re committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theater."</p></blockquote>
<p>New president Hector Sanchez - one of Annapurna Interactive’s co-founders - has reportedly told developers that “the company will honor existing contracts and replace staff who have left.”</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control">Control</a> studio Remedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">announced they were</a> "as thrilled as Finnish people can be" to partner with Annapurna to fund Control 2, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> television and film adaptations.</p>
<p>A few Annapurna-published devs have responded to the news on social media. "Just for the folks asking, we are 100% okay," tweeted Ivy Road's <a href="https://x.com/HelloCakebread/status/1834371275168653465">Davey Wreden</a>, director of tea-brewing sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wanderstop">Wanderstop</a>. "Nothing's gonna stop us from getting Wanderstop out the door very soon."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Campfire Cozy Friends is an interesting new cozy RPG announced yesterday by the namesake independent developer Campfire. The team, composed of just five people, has designed the game around its <a href="https://sprites.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sprites toolkit</a>, which they say is an 'All-in-one AI Engine for Games and Entertainment Apps.'</p>
<p>Thanks to this AI Engine, Campfire Cozy Friends will feature unrestricted dialogues that mirror real-world conversations, allowing players to shape the story and make real connections. According to the studio, this will result in&nbsp;a satisfying social sandbox filled with memorable personal moments.</p>
<p>Siamak Freydoonnejad, Co-Founder of&nbsp;<span>Campfire, said in a statement:</span></p>
<p><em>It all started with an idea from a game jam: what if players could form genuine friendships with NPCs, go completely off-script, and rely on their actual personality to drive gameplay? <span>Campfire</span> Cozy Friends and our Sprites toolset represent this vision – ethical AI applications that deliver richer immersive simulations for players and amplify human creativity for developers rather than replace jobs.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Campfire Cozy Friends - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdWBfDHFS28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the game, which has been described as Animal Crossing with AI NPCs, players step into the shoes of a concierge with the goal of transforming the tropical Camp Island into a five-star tourist destination. They will repair and restore the island alongside a cast of friendly animal residents who weave the fabric of island life. Make friends with the locals, spark open-ended conversations, and engage in many other charming interactions.</p>
<p>It's also possible to build houses, wear flower crowns, and wear colorful clothes alongside an ensemble of adorable animals, such as Angelina Arcadia, Fred Flyfish, or Mayor Thompson alongside 26 unlockable characters. Thanks to the AI Engine, you can engage in unlimited conversations with the villagers as you explore every topic imaginable - from their backstories to their daily lives to the far reaches of your imagination. The developers have planned a wealth of new content featuring additional main storylines, side quests, themes, and more. Moreover, online multiplayer is supported.</p>
<p>Campfire Cozy Friends will be a free-to-play game when it launches on PC (including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2976140/Campfire_Cozy_Friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), Mac, iOS, and Android. However, those who wish to play right away can invest in a Founder's Pack.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP Still Features THAT Achievement]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-i-swear-achievement/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-still-features-that-achievement.979962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-i-swear-achievement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP was released on September 12 after months of teasers and updates from the developer. It arrives more than a decade after it first dropped, and while it hasn’t launched in a perfect state, players are happy with how faithful it has remained to the original.</p>



<p>That notion runs deep – aside from a few missing music tracks, it’s the same game but better. The more eagle-eyed fans among us have also noticed that <strong>the controversial achievement </strong>is still present.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-see-you">We See You</h2>



<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP hasn’t been censored, that’s for sure. It was a concern of fans worldwide, especially with how sensitive the global gaming community can be these days.</p>



<p>I am of course referring to the achievement in Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP titled ‘<strong>I Swear! I Did It By Mistake!’</strong></p>



<p>To unlock this achievement, you’ll need to take a peek under the protagonist’s skirt – it’s one of the first achievements many gamers will ‘accidentally’ unlock.</p>



<p>I can’t believe I’m about to write this:</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-i-swear-i-did-it-by-mistake">How to Unlock I Swear! I Did It By Mistake!</h3>



<p>From the moment you assume control of Juliet, you can unlock this achievement. When you’re standing still, simply pivot the camera to look at the sky. Juliet will attempt to cover her skirt, but if you hold the position long enough, the achievement will pop.</p>



<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP might be a welcome re-release, but it’s not without a few issues. In the earliest reviews of the game, some technical issues have been reported, such as failing QTEs. It also looks like the game isn’t optimised so well on PC, and the developer has neglected to provide any graphics options beyond resolution.</p>



<p>It’s also priced a bit high, many feel. It has a relatively premium price point despite being a remake of a short game that came out more than a decade ago.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

It depicts a year in the life of a Human who was chosen as a candidate to become a god, living among the Seven Lucky Gods, who do not seem to open up much to her. You—as the Human—can explore the treasure ship and make choices to change the storyline. All twenty-two endings are true endings, and only you, the player, will be able to find what the real story hidden behind all of them is.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>You wake up in an unfamiliar storeroom where you can hear nothing but the sound of waves. As you are trying to figure out why you are here, your reflection in a mirror speaks to you. The reflection tells you to lie, then disappears.</p><p>When you leave the storeroom, you meet people who call themselves the Seven Lucky Gods. According to one of them, Daikoku, you are a Human who was chosen to become a god. Most of them do not seem to welcome your sudden arrival.</p><p>Once the treasure ship returns to the human world in a year, will you become a god and join the others on the ship? Will you return to your original world as a human? Or will you…?</p><p>Your bittersweet year with the Seven Lucky Gods begins.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Move around the treasure ship, setting off trigers by talking to the gods and examining objects on the ship.

That wasn’t necessarily true on YouTube. </p><p>But I don’t want you to take my word for it. I want you to download the lossless PNG screenshots I just captured so you can peep pixels with me and decide for yourself!</p><p><strong>Important note: </strong><em>Do not right-click</em> to download the images you see below. Do not even left-click them — they’re just visual aids so you know which image you’ll get. <strong>Left-click the link in each caption<em> </em></strong>to load the pictures, then download them; each should have a file size well over 4MB. Optimally, you should then display them on a big 4K screen, like the one you might use with the PlayStation.</p><p>The above examples are the PS5 Pro compared to the original PS5’s “Performance” mode with a faster frame rate, and they’re designed to show how you don’t have to sacrifice graphics for smooth 60fps speeds. But if you’re willing to tolerate the lower frame rates of “Fidelity” mode, the advantage isn’t as clear-cut:</p><p>Sony didn’t offer comparison images for every title, but here are pictures from other games it used to represent the PS5 Pro’s graphics, too: </p><p>If you’re <em>really</em> dedicated, I suppose you could even try to find the same moment in the same game on your own PS5, grab your own screenshot, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784404/nvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics">use Nvidia’s ICAT tool</a> to peep pixels like a pro.</p><p>Is it ridiculous that we’ve come to this? Maybe! But I don’t want you to think there’s no difference between PS5 and PS5 Pro graphics at 60fps: </p><p>There’s absolutely a difference — just perhaps not one that’s worth $700 to you. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
