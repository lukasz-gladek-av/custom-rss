            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a United States government agency tasked with ensuring that people are treated fairly by banks and financial institutions, proposed a new rule that targets, among other things, video games. In short, the Bureau is hoping to ensure that companies operating games with robust in-game currency marketplaces – think <em>Roblox </em>– actually help players struggling with unintended transactions, hacks, theft, and scams.&nbsp;</p><p>The CFPB explained its rationale in a post that it shared with Aftermath, noting that over time, some games have grown to function <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/issue-spotlight-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more and more like banking and payment systems</a>.</p><p>“Gamers – or in some cases their parents and guardians – have reported issues such as trouble when converting dollars to in-game currency, unauthorized transactions, account hacks and takeovers, theft, scams, and loss of assets,” the agency wrote. “They have also described receiving limited to no help from gaming companies and the banks or digital wallets involved. Refunds are often denied, people are finding their gaming accounts suspended by the video game company after a player tries to get a refund from their financial institution, or people are left caught in doom loops with AI-powered customer service representatives while they’re just trying to get straight answers.”</p><p>To help mitigate these issues, the CFPB is proposing an interpretive rule, meaning one that draws on preexisting laws rather than drawing up new ones. In this case, it aims to clarify that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Fund_Transfer_Act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Electronic Fund Transfer Act</a> – signed into law by Jimmy Carter in 1978 – extends to video game companies, as well as virtual currency wallets and credit card rewards points accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>“The proposed interpretive rule clarifies that gaming companies that are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act could violate federal consumer financial law if they fail to address problems gamers have with their accounts,” wrote the CFPB.&nbsp;</p><p>The proposed interpretive rule, viewed by Aftermath, further specifies that it’s taking aim at accounts with features that include but are not limited to “paying for goods or services from multiple merchants, [the] ability to withdraw funds or obtain cash, or conducting person-to-person transfers.” This would seem to imply that games like <em>Roblox </em>and <em>Second Life </em>are covered, but a game like <em>Fortnite </em>– which does not allow any of the above – might not be. <em>Fortnite </em>in particular, it’s worth noting, used to do exactly what the CFPB is describing and ban accounts associated with chargebacks under the assumption of fraud, even if, say, the account holder purposefully initiated a chargeback to counteract an unwanted purchase (for example: a kid got their hands on a parent’s credit card and bought a bunch of V-Bucks). Epic has since <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/chargebacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amended its policy</a>.</p><p>The CFPB is seeking to bolster its proposal by collecting “experiences with gaming assets that are stored on their accounts and used for all sorts of transactions within these worlds, including the purchases of goods and services, converting dollars to in-game currency and back, and P2P transfers” as well as anecdotes about “the things that have gone wrong and how [players] have been affected when trying to get help.” So get in there and tell them about that time a person fraudulently obtained your credit card info and <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-vbucks-fraud-credit-card-bank-chargeback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used it to buy $100 worth of <em>Fortnite </em>items</a> (or whatever has happened to you).&nbsp;</p><p>The comment period runs until the end of March. Ideally, the CFPB will still be around to do something with those comments when the time comes, but it's far from guaranteed. Elon Musk, who incoming president Donald Trump selected to co-lead the newly-created and stupidly-named Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-calls-abolishing-consumer-finance-watchdog-targeted-by-republicans-2024-11-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested that the CFPB should be eliminated</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/california-wildfires-ces-generative-ai-nvidia-google"><h3>What Are We Even Doing Here?</h3></a><p>Wildfires rage in California while, one state over, tech giants brag about adding AI to everything</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/locator-demo-geoguessr"><h3>Yay But Also Oh No, A Map Game</h3></a><p>Locator calls itself a "Geoguessr-inspired" puzzle game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post"><h3>The Myth Of The Star Reporter</h3></a><p>Good journalism isn't created in a vacuum</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will be among the Xbox games that will launch on other platforms in the near future, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during a recent podcast, well-known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateDrake</a> talked about the Xbox games that will launch this year on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2. Beyond the obvious, the insider confirmed he heard that Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will launch on the other systems this year. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">yet-to-be-announced Oblivion remake/remaster</a> will be another game launching on consoles other than Xbox systems, although this is more speculation than an actual rumor based on the fact that there is no reason for the game not to be a multiplatform release. At the same time, the "loss" of two exclusives will be compensated with the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, which will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively, not only on Xbox consoles but also on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox 2025 Predictions: Gears E-Day in 2025, FF7 Remake, BIG Switch 2 &amp; PS5 Games, Oblivion &amp; More" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIhoTirZxlk?start=3220&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch 2 probably won't have much trouble running the Halo: The Master Chief Collection, it will be very interesting to see how the much more demanding Flight Simulator will run on the next Nintendo system. If recent rumors are any indication, these ports may be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/">scaled-down versions of the Xbox Series S versions</a>, which would make sense considering the system is currently the less powerful current generation console.</p>
<p>The launch of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 would be a landmark moment for Microsoft, further highlighting the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-xbox-fans-are-being-redefined-into-enjoying-games-on-all-their-devices-i-feel-very-good-about-the-gaming-division/">shift in strategy. </a>Hopefully, it won't take much longer to know if PlayStation 5 and future Nintendo Switch 2 owners will be able to experience the first few entries in the series on their platform of choice.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-support-confirmed-for-post-launch-update.1079094/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Keen Software House has announced that&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will, in fact, be using Steam Workshop as its main user-generated content platform.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133870/view/527583567913419118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Keen Software House CEO Marek Rosa says that the decision to switch to Steam Workshop came from "listening to our community, particularly our content creators, who have expressed a strong preference" for the platform.</p>

<p>The original plan, according to Rosa, was to use Mod.io, which Rosa says was "driven by the goal of providing a unified backend" for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s PC and console versions. However, user feedback subsequently "made it clear" that Steam Workshop was the preferred direction.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-astronauts.jpg?itok=p7SAGgLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-astronauts.jpg?itok=xTKQW9up 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s user-generated content will primarily use Steam Workshop, it's been announced.</figcaption></figure><p>Rosa goes on to say that Steam Workshop support will be added for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s user-generated content in the game's first major post-launch patch, which will arrive after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">planned Early Access launch on January 27th</a>.</p>

<p>As for console players, Rosa says he and Keen Software House are currently "evaluating the best approach" when it comes to console-based user-generated content, and that the studio will "share more details as we progress".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://2.spaceengineersgame.com/roadmap-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> has also been updated to reflect the Steam Workshop decision, with Vertical Slice 1.1 now connecting the in-game workshop to Steam Workshop rather than Mod.io.</p>

<p>Future Vertical Slices for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will bring the likes of improved gameplay mechanics, support for modding via the VRAGE Editor, and the opportunity to explore individual planets, plus lots more.</p>




<p>As you can probably guess,&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>. It expands the original's sandbox gameplay with new blueprint tools, new gameplay systems, and plenty more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 27th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Instead of a mostly single-player campaign like its predecessor, the spin-off focuses on co-op play between three players (or you can play solo) as they take on successive waves of tough enemies and bosses through a day-and-night cycle, while exploring a randomized version of the original game’s open-world map. </p><p>It’s going to be a $40 release and feels a bit like FromSoftware drew inspiration from various PC mods that turned <em>Elden Ring</em> more into a survival roguelite than a traditional action-RPG. The combat shown in the initial trailers also looks like it will be faster, flashier, and more dynamic than the version in <em>Elden Ring</em> proper. Some lucky players will find out soon enough when they go hands-on with the game in next month’s network tests. And while those are only for current-gen consoles, the full game will be on PC as well as PS4 and Xbox One. </p><p>.﻿<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, an ever-changing environment, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night’s Tide.</blockquote><blockquote>At the end of each night, players will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate in the third night when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat. Unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</blockquote><blockquote>Elden Ring Nightreign is unlike any experience created before by FromSoftware, Inc. In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards, and Limveld itself are ever-shifting and evolving with each new session. Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards. Finding Sites of Grace gives each hero a chance to level up and gain crucial power. With each session-based adventure being akin to playing through an open-air dungeon, every journey provides an opportunity to grow lasting stat bonuses. Successful runs against the night bring players ever closer to defeating the Nightlord and unraveling the story behind each Nightfarer in this parallel world.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year IGN had the opportunity to visit FromSoftware and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it"><u>go hands-on with an early build of Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>.

<p>For the uninitiated, House of Dead 2 is, funnily enough, the sequel to Sega's prolific 90s rail-shooter zombie series. In this instalment, you take on the lone role of secret agent James - either alone or in co-op mode alongside fellow agent Gary - with one single mission: to neutralise the dangerous denizens standing in your way.</p>
<p>As well as the features listed above, there will also be a boss mode in which you'll have to speedrun killing all of the game's bosses, and a training mode is available to help you hone your skills.</p>
<p>This is the second of Sega's zombie games to get the remake treatment. However, as Matt summarised for us this time last year, reception to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-remake-heading-to-playstation-5-this-week">first House of the Dead: Remake's reception was pretty mixed</a>. With complaints highlighting control scheme issues and performance on last-gen consoles, so it'll be interesting to see how the second remake will be received.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">Sega's The House of the Dead is also set for the big screen, with Paul WS Anderson</a> on board to write and direct.</p>
<p>Anderson will also serve as a producer, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. The duo have also worked on adaptations for the likes of Mortal Kombat (1995) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> (2020), as well as multiple Resident Evil films.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For me, skateboarding has always been about getting into a flow state. Much like playing <em>Tetris</em>, I’m at my best when I’m skating almost subconsciously, not thinking and acting in the moment. It’s not an easy zone to get into, and music has always been my shortcut. So the greatest compliment I can give to <em>Skate City: New York</em> is that I’ve spent the past week fine-tuning the perfect playlist, all so that I can also perfect my runs in the game.</p><p><em>New York </em>is a sequel to the original <em>Skate City</em>; both are available through Apple Arcade, though the first game was eventually ported to consoles as well. It comes from Snowman, the studio behind the <em>Alto </em>series, and the shift to New York is a lot like the move from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8064545/altos-adventure-iphone-ipad-snowboarding-game"><em>Alto’s Adventure</em></a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035830/altos-odyssey-sequel-iphone-game-ios-adventure-snowboarding"><em>Alto’s Odyssey</em></a>. It’s not an entirely new experience but, rather, one that changes the setting and adds some seemingly small — but very impactful — tweaks.</p><p>What makes the series so well suited to mobile is the way it balances approachability and depth. <em>Skate City</em> is extremely easy to pick up. It’s a side-scrolling game, so you’re always moving left to right, and all of the various tricks and moves are performed either by a swipe, tap, or hold. It all feels very natural. For example, each side of the touchscreen represents a side of your board, and even complex individual moves only require one input to pull off. So even if you don’t know what you’re doing, you can mash your way to some cool tricks. But what really makes it work is how, once you get the hang of things, you can chain together tricks in very satisfying ways.</p><p>This was all true of the original, and the core is the same in <em>New York</em>. The biggest change (aside from the location) is that levels all have multiple paths, so that if you time a jump or grind <em>just</em> right, you can make it to a new area with new possibilities. Given how much you’ll be grinding through the same streets, this extra layer adds some necessary variety. There are also a handful of new tricks, like being able to wall ride, that give you new tools to play with. On their own, these additions seem small. But together, they add just enough to make <em>New York</em> have its own feel.</p><p>Seemingly the most disappointing thing about the new game is that it’s restricted to a single city. The original <em>Skate City</em> was appropriately global; after a series of updates, it now has levels in Tokyo, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Venice, Miami, and Oslo. But even though <em>New York</em> only has, well, New York, there’s a decent amount of variety (and presumably more coming in the future).</p><p>At launch, there are three areas — Central Park, Brooklyn, and Manhattan — and each has its own distinct vibe, both in terms of how they look and the makeup of the levels. And once again, there are three modes to play through: one that teaches you the game through a series of tutorials; another that lets you put those skills to the test in pro challenges; and a free skate mode where you have time and space to be creative.</p><p>It’s this last mode that has had me, for the past week, huddled over my phone, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/style/fashion/a61736444/yuto-horigome-winning-skateboarding-gold-wearing-airpods-is-our-olympic-highlight/">headphones in</a>, approaching the same rails and staircases over and over trying to nail the exact line I’ve envisioned in my head. Just like skating in real life, it can be tedious and frustrating at times. But the satisfaction of pulling it off is worth it — and that playlist has helped pull me through.</p><p><small>Skate City: New York<em> is available now on Apple Arcade.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/return-tow-rk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The holidays are over, which means we're back at our desks.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://remapradio.com/video/lets-build-a-3d-model-of-patricks-new-office/" rel="noreferrer">the <em>Remap</em> crew helped Patrick work through ideas for a new office</a>, and over Thanksgiving and Christmas, Patrick finally made good them. Doing so, it turned out, proved to be a shockingly emotional experience beyond building desks and buying endless accessories.</p><p>Then again, how spaces define us has been a huge part of <em>Remap</em>, and what ultimately lead to the creation of the HOA podcast. We're all older, and while not necessarily wiser, we certainly find ourselves thinking about these topics a lot, and it's got us in our feelings.</p><p>Prepare for some Sad Dad thoughts, folks.</p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Back in the fall, inspired by the work Janet had done to make her work space more functional, I decided enough was enough with my own space, as well. I have written in the past about how my life as a reporter—where I’ve often written while huddled around half-broken laptops, cold coffee, and terrible seating—has made me complacent. Hell, one of my “offices” in a tiny San Francisco apartment was literally inside of a closet, because it’s all the space we had.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob, <em>I wrote in a closet for the better part of a year</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds ridiculous, but it’s part of a larger personality quirk/feature: I can get used to things. Think about all the times we’ve hung out with one another. How often have I expressed all that much interest in where we eat or drink? I pretty much never chime in beyond realizing that people are not picking something that is in a reasonable walking distance, and even then, I once let you guide us through a rain storm towards a place that, to your credit, had some terrific food.&nbsp;</p><p>But…I’m older now. I turn 40, despite what my face might tell you, next month. I find myself in a position where, despite being semi-recently laid off, I am in a good final position! (In no small thanks to the continued stability of my wife’s job while the weirdness of mine worked itself out.)</p><p>To that point, last month I asked our financial advisor, aka the guy who scares the shit out of me about how much I need to keep putting aside each month to prevent my daughters from being saddled with debt for the rest of their lives, to drum up a life insurance policy for my wife and I. There is a whole other story to tell about that process about how I was denied good coverage from a bunch of places because I had the good fortune of my dad dying of a heart attack, but we can get into that another day. The point is that I’m now paying for the kind of life insurance coverage that’s supposed to make my life easier, or my wife’s life easier, if great tragedy strikes.</p><p>I’m almost 40. My dad died when he was 56 years old—and I was 27. 13 years. In another 13, which feels simultaneously like an eternity and no time at all, I’ll be on the doorstep of that same age. I now forget which birthday it was, but there was one in his early 50s where he said “hey, I made it past the point where my dad passed away.” He didn’t make it much longer, though.</p><p>When I was in high school, my dad finally bought what he’d wanted his entire life: a small lake house in southern Wisconsin, where he spent his formative years. What do we spend all this time working and toiling, if not to finally, at some point, try and make ourselves happier? That what we’ve grown complacent with isn’t enough, that it’s okay to have a meaningful treat?</p><p>I did not expect the introduction to this back-and-forth to be so somber, but in unpacking and dismantling my old desk, I found the original print out of the eulogy I wrote for my father. In moving on from that desk, it felt like I was moving on from a different era in my life, too. I am not in a position where I expect to move homes anytime soon, so when you reinvent a room, it has many of the same emotional arcs as moving to, say, a new apartment. I wasn’t expecting that.</p><p>I’m writing this from my new L-shaped standing desk. Yes, Rob, I bought the biggest one, even though half the desk is empty. This morning, I answered emails and did other busy work while standing. A few hours later, I tapped a button, watched the desk lower, and sat in my new Aeron chair to begin typing this out. In a few hours, I’ll put this computer into sleep mode, walk over to my production suite, and stream with Cado. I’ve only spent 36 hours in this setup, and beyond the newness, it’s making me credibly happy. No, it was not cheap—but man, worth every penny.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m hoping to bring that mentality to other parts of my life, too.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@carlheyerdahl?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Carl Heyerdahl</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>One of the joys and frustrations as you age is that it’s easier to identify things that are worth prioritizing, and if you’re reasonably lucky you also have more resources to invest in those priorities. It’s joyful because you have all these moments where you realize how much you are being paid-back in experience for the money and time you invested in something for yourself. It’s frustrating because you realize you could have done some of this sooner and made life easier. Maybe not to the exact same degree, I have more money now than I did as a freelancer who had just moved to Boston with his grad student girlfriend. But often it’s the self-knowledge that is the real difference between then and now. There are things I could have benefited from back then, even if I would have had to do them on a shoestring, that I didn’t realize I needed until much later. You rejoice in solving a longstanding problem or removing a recurring irritation, but you also rue the years you spent “putting up” with something that in retrospect you didn’t need to.</p><p>MK had a moment like that when she realized we needed a stick vacuum. Simple thing, made a world of difference. We have a very <em>nice </em>stick vacuum and those have gotten better in ten years, but ultimately we would have benefited from one of those far more than the other stuff we’ve used over the years. It just didn’t click for her until this year that what she hated wasn’t vacuuming, it was dragging a vacuum around a house and wrestling with a long power cord. Small thing, no stakes at all really, but an example of what I mean.</p><p>When I got my Uplift desk, one of the extras I got with it was an anti-fatigue mat. I didn’t really need it in my office and I kind of forgot about it for a while, but a couple months ago I tossed it in front of my kitchen sink and realized that I was suddenly <em>comfortable </em>standing there doing dishes and chopping vegetables. I’d gotten used to how hard my kitchen floor was, and if you’d asked me I wouldn’t have said working in the kitchen caused me any discomfort much less pain, but really I’d just gotten habituated to enduring and ignoring a constant, mild level of irritation. I’d also, not coincidentally, lost a bit of interest in cooking and baking, subconsciously avoiding working in the kitchen without acknowledging that it had become physically unpleasant.</p><p>Again, these are small examples of what I’m talking about. Low-stakes stuff. But I think some of the same dynamics apply to higher-stakes stuff around family, work, and even how we conceive of ourselves and our vision of a good life. A lot of us are taught early that if we can avoid bothering other people with a need or a discomfort by enduring our adjusting our own expectations, then that’s what we should try to do. But if you’re really good at doing that, if you have a lot of resilience, endurance, or both, then you can end up being the proverbial frog being slowly boiled in a pot of water. It becomes habit to ignore a problem instead of checking for straightforward solutions.</p><p>A few years ago, my wife and I were on a walk and we spotted a group of turtles sunning themselves on a log in a river. She said she loved seeing turtles in the wild, not because of a particular love for the various species, but because the presence of healthy turtle populations is often a visible indicator of broader ecosystem health. For whatever reason that concept stuck in my head: that if you want to gauge the health of a system, sometimes it’s less about looking for problems than it is about looking for indicators of active well-being. Problems can be sneaky and hard to diagnose, and sometimes it’s easier to find signs that things are in a good place.</p><p>Since then, “is this good for turtles?” has become a shorthand in our house for a whole range of subtler questions. </p>

<p>It has been announced that there will be a network test for Elden Ring Nightreign from February 14 to February 17.</p>



<p>Announced on X (formerly Twitter), the network test will be available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X, and applicants can register to gain access by January 20. To apply for registration to the Elden Ring Nightreign test, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-join-the-elden-ring-nightreign-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a brand new co-op action-adventure game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced during The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>



<p>However, despite being a co-op game, the game will not be playable as a duo, as the developers announced that the game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed to be played either solo or trio</a>. </p>



<p>The developers have already said that the network test is a “preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests,” the test description reads.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how much of the actual game content will be available to players, but anyone with a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S|X can sign up.</p>



<p>First released in 2022, Elden Ring has sold 28.6 million units by September 2024, making it one of the best-selling games of all time, and the fastest-selling game published by Bandai Namco. Shadow of the Erdtree, a DLC for Elden Ring, sold five million copies in its first three days of release.</p>



<p>Will you be signing up for the Elden Ring Nightreign network test? And what do you think of it being solo or trio only? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-update-beta-none-glitch" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for the medieval city-builder have brought the likes of bug fixes and gameplay improvements, but as the name implies, Update 4 is a bigger patch that introduces some major new features.</p>

<p>First up, you're getting two new maps, High Peaks and Winding River. No prizes for which one of those includes "a huge river", as Hooded Horse and Slavic Magic say. Naturally, that river leads on to the new bridge-building mechanic, which is also included in Update 4.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-update-4-town.jpg?itok=ZE_PPcfh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-update-4-town.jpg?itok=nYPQSCuR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords</em>' latest update brings tons of new features with it.</figcaption></figure><p>That's right: you can now use&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>' Road tool to build yourself bridges, which can be used to cross things like the aforementioned "huge river" included in the Winding River map.</p>

<p>Additionally, Update 4 brings with it new gameplay tweaks like an Overstock setting for taverns and marketplaces, an upgrade to the Stone Well, and a level 2 Tavern upgrade, as well as a new visual for the Tavern's first level.</p>

<p>All of this is in addition to an absolute onslaught of bug fixes, gameplay improvements, and other changes. You can check out the full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>Update 4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/534338967351329253" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>, but you might want to grab a coffee before you do, as it's pretty long.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>, it's a medieval city-builder-slash-strategy game that emphasizes realism in its simulation. You'll build and maintain a village, see to the needs of its citizens, and even grow your empire through conquest of neighboring lands.</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count" rel="nofollow">released back in April</a>, attracting over 100,000 players on Steam within just a few hours of its launch (which is particularly impressive given that it's also available on Game Pass).</p>

<p>In just a few days,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count" rel="nofollow">broke a million</a>. They would go on to hit&nbsp;two million in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">under three weeks</a>. It's safe to say Hooded Horse has a hit on its hands with this one.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/manor-lords-game-preview/9p5f966564fs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. It's also available as part of Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-2-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2 come at a pivotal moment. CoD remains absolute and steadfast in its consistency, but its popularity is waning. Season 2 is a chance to rekindle the FPS fire, and we’re here to run through the latest info.</p>



<p>When former Call of Duty World Champion legend Seth “Scump” Abner describes CoD as “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scump-on-call-of-duty-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kind of depressing</a>,” it’s deeply concerning. Many are switching over for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Season One Eternal Night Falls Update</a>. Player counts are dropping big time and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> isn’t as hot as it was, despite fun variations in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-squid-game-event-release-date-details-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squid Game event</a>. Warzone isn’t doing so hot either, and Season 2 is paramount to CoD’s coming weeks.</p>



<p>Warzone and Black Ops 6 Season 2 needs to be special and must hit harder than an Archangel Launcher.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-amp-warzone-season-2-release-date">Black Ops &amp; Warzone Season 2 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s see if CoD can restore some faith. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2’s release date is January 28 and it was confirmed by Activision through patch notes.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">January 9 patch notes blog</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 discussed stability fixes. It goes into greater detail, and ends up saying, “<strong>Look for both of those fixes when Season 02 launches on Jan. 28.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s quite uncommon for a date to be revealed this way, but we’re not complaining. We already imagined this to be the date due to the Battle Pass end date, but it’s now official. You only don’t have long left to complete your Season 1 Battle Pass and secure limited-time unlocks.</p>



<h2 id="h-possible-warzone-amp-black-ops-6-season-2-content">Possible Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 2 Content</h2>



<p>There have been no leaks or suggestions as to what content is coming in Season 2. But it’s safe to assume Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone are getting the usual slew of content: <strong>New Maps, Guns, Perks, limited-time modes, Operator Bundles, and a new Battle Pass</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s funny, sometimes we know of at least something fresh by now, but we don’t—and no one does. Season 2 is being kept under wraps, and fingers crossed it’s because it’s a big one. </p>



<p>Black Ops 6 players want a Ranked game mode without hackers, the Warzone community wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> back now, and Zombies is unlikely to get major content after the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sword-upgrades-in-citadelle-des-morts-bo6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle del Morts</a>—an LTM could be fun given the novelty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-win-dead-light-green-light-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Light Green Light</a>.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we’re going to update this guide once we learn any news or rumors about Season 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-bo6-amp-warzone-season-2-battle-pass">BO6 &amp; Warzone Season 2 Battle Pass</h2>



<p>Again, it’s not officially revealed, <strong>but a Season 2 Battle Pass is inevitable for Black Ops 6 and Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>An even bigger question is if Activision is going to continue with additional Battle Passes. The Squid Game event didn’t just bring new game modes and special skins, but also a <strong>controversial Event Pass</strong>. It had a free version, along with a Premium Tier. This didn’t go down well with the player base, so we’ll see if this is addressed once Season 2 is announced.</p>



<hr>



<p>Call of Duty is a huge talking point at present. What do you like and dislike about it? Is Black Ops 6 dying? Does Warzone need a content injection? Let us know your thoughts below.</p>

<section><p>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap created a new kind of magical fantasy by showing us an unseen side of Hyrule at microscopic scale.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, January 10, 2025. Below, we look back at how the team came up with a playful sense of scale as its central hook.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The Legend of Zelda series is filled with dynamics that stretch and alter the world of Hyrule. Whether it be going back in time or into a realm of darkness, these add a new element of exploration that you wouldn't see in a peaceful Hyrule. The goal with many of these design choices was to inspire wonder--to give players a reason to explore familiar areas they've seen several times before. The Minish Cap's shrinking feature is one of the best examples of The Legend of Zelda designers achieving that goal.</p><p dir="ltr">Recent games like Tinykin, It Takes Two, and Grounded have explored what it's like to explore the world while tiny, but few have created the dichotomy that The Minish Cap had with its shrinking feature. It encouraged fascination with the mundane--anything and everything could be hiding Link's next discovery.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we started thinking about what that gimmick could be for Minish Cap, first, we knew it couldn't be that far-removed or out-there from the world of Zelda," said The Minish Cap director Hidemaro Fujibayashi in a <a href="https://shmuplations.com/minishcap2/" rel="nofollow ">2004 interview</a> in Nintendo Dream magazine. "I started thinking, what feature[s] of these game worlds could we possibly expand on, what dimension could we explore? "Front and Reverse, Past and Future, Light and Darkness… we'd done all these before, but could some other pairing remain? I racked my brain until I realized--ah hah, if we make Link small, that would be like entering a whole 'nother world within his own."</p><p dir="ltr">The Minish Cap's hallmark shrinking feature led to an overworld that was absolutely packed with puzzles to solve. Its clever use throughout the game make it one of the best examples of The Legend of Zelda designers inspiring wonder, and it's an aspect of the game that still stands out 20 years later.</p><p dir="ltr">While individual dungeons and the overworld are packed with fascinating content to explore, the mere idea that an entire village could be hidden inside a tree or rock inspires a Breath of the Wild-like sense of wonder that was somehow accomplished with 2004 technology.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfEMNbjLd3Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UfEMNbjLd3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In Capcom's The Legend of Zelda adventure, the world of Hyrule has tiny beings called the Minish packed into stumps, under rocks, and in dozens of other places across the kingdom. These Minish are everywhere, even under the snoozing nose of a shoemaker. Link and the rest of Hyrule have never heard of these creatures, making further discovery of how they live a wonderful story thread to pull on.</p><p dir="ltr">The Minish Cap lets you yank on that thread early on in your adventure, shortly after peril comes to Hyrule. Soon after the villain of the entry, Vaati, unleashes a horde of monsters across Hyrule, Link travels to The Minish Woods to find the Minish, retrieve four elemental stones, restore the sword of legend, and restore Hyrule and a Zelda, the latter of whom has been turned to stone.</p><p dir="ltr">Much of this is standard Zelda flare, although the leadup to discovering the Minish for the first time establishes the larger-than-life level design that will fill the rest of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Link's new sidekick, Ezlo, shrinks him down using a portal found in The Minish Woods, eventually leading him through logs, over drifting pondweed, and around life-size sticks and acorns to find the miniature race of people who would kick off the rest of his adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back, this moment doesn't seem incredibly impressive on its own, but its ingenuity is found in how it sets up the rest of the game. Navigating the small platforming section and keeping an eye out for areas that can only be explored while small is what, as Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said, turns the entire overworld into something just as challenging as the series' trademark dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">"Dungeons have a certain limited format to them, right? Find keys, advance further, defeat the boss," Aonuma said. "In contrast, the outside world, the field map, can offer more multifaceted gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Kinstone fragments scattered across the overworld feel like standard collectibles at first, but they amount to more by unlocking other areas of the map. Find two of the same type, fuse them, and the classic Zelda discovery jingle will play--meaning a new path opens up, a chest is revealed, or something similar happens.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these Kinstones are found within puzzles that require you to shrink down and climb a bookcase, run across bakery shelves, or even dodge gigantic raindrops: simple acts that give you an entirely new angle through which to view Hyrule.</p><p dir="ltr">"Collecting the fragments opens up areas far from your current location," Aonuma said. "In a sense, this makes the overworld map itself act like one big dungeon."</p><p dir="ltr">This sense of wonder came from Capcom's goal to shift away from their design approach on Oracle of Ages, Oracle of Seasons, and Four Swords. While they ended up building off of the Gnat Hat--an item that shrunk Link down in Four Swords--they wanted to replicate Nintendo's approach to Zelda by focusing on worldbuilding. In doing so, they just happened to create an amazing world that came from posing a simple question: What's hidden beneath and within all the familiar workings of Lake Hylia and Lon Lon Ranch?</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to make a 'mainline' traditional 2D Zelda game. Traversing overworld maps, exploring dungeons. The essence of Zelda," Fujibayashi said. "I see it as following in the steps of the Famicom Zelda and A Link to the Past, but a more powered-up version for today's hardware."</p><p dir="ltr">Exploring cracks in rocks and tiny holes in the side of cottages in 2004 is the equivalent of scaling the side of the mountain in Breath of the Wild in 2017. The biggest contrast is the technology, as Capcom worked within the parameters of Game Boy Advance hardware in order to instill a magic that could be felt through a 2.9-inch screen. That tiny, mystical world hidden amongst fantastic combat and puzzles makes The Minish Cap one of the most memorable Zelda games today,</p>

                <p>Nintendo's next console, the apparent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, is the talk of the town in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show this week due in part to the peripheral company Genki claiming to know what Nintendo is cooking up. Now, for the first time, Nintendo has broken its silence and commented on the leaks.</p><p>A spokesperson told Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Sankei Shimbun</a> (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-revealed-during-ces-2025-is-unofficial-and-was-not-provided-by-us-nintendo-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">translated by Automaton</a>) that the images and videos from CES are "not official." A spokesperson told <a href="https://japan.cnet.com/article/35228142/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNET Japan</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-revealed-during-ces-2025-is-unofficial-and-was-not-provided-by-us-nintendo-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), "The gaming hardware that Genki claims to be Nintendo hardware at CES is official and was not provided to the company by Nintendo."</p><p>At CES, Genki created a mockup of the Switch 2 that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">claimed was based on a real Switch 2 console that it saw</a>, going on to say the company was surprised by the media attention. Later, however, Genki told <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> that its mockup was in fact based only on leaks, not from seeing the system first hand, and that it doesn't actually know what Nintendo is planning.</p><p>Genki also said at CES that it expects the Switch 2 to launch in April 2025. In addition to the leaks that stem from Genki, other reports claim to reveal the first details on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-switch-2-renders-grant-a-360-degree-look-at-the-console/1100-6528727/" data-ref-id="1100-6528727">Switch 2's new Joy-Cons, which could include a new feature and a more ergonomic design. </a></p><p>Nintendo has confirmed it will announce its next console by the end of March 2025, so a reveal could happen very soon. Many are expecting the console to then launch later in the year.</p><p>The Switch 2, or whatever the system may be called, has enormous shoes to fill, as the original Switch sold more than 146 million systems and 1.3 billion games.</p>

She's a Fire Attack Agent who can unleash a Chain Attack by herself, so she's a pretty powerful addition to your lineup.</p>

<p>In addition to the above two characters, you can also expect reruns of Ellen and Qingyi in Version 1.5's banners, as well as a new S-rank Banbgoo in the form of Snap, which comes complete with a camera.</p>

<p>Version 1.5 also brings with it new minigames, including a new parkour-based arcade game by the name of Mach 25, which allows you to "race with various vehicles". Plenty of other new gameplay changes and features are coming in Version 1.5 too, so make sure you add January 22nd to your calendar.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, it's part of HoYoverse's live-service gacha RPG lineup, alongside&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>(and also&nbsp;<em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em>).</p>

<p>The game is more overtly action-oriented than its stablemates, and it's less fantasy-inspired too, taking place in an urban setting reminiscent of the likes of&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 1.5 lands on January 22nd.</p>

"Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The phrasing is a little confusing, as it makes it sound as though Claws of Awaji will only be available to those who pre-purchase the game, similar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-day-one-missions-only-available-through-season-pass-or-by-preordering">the previously announced "bonus mission" Thrown to the Dogs</a>. This would be unusual, however, as major expansions such as this are usually reserved for Season Passes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-price-drops-50-amid-cancelled-season-pass-and-early-access">Ubisoft is ditching the Season Pass model for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> following major  practice shake-ups <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed">in the wake of Star Wars Outlaws underperforming</a>. Alongside scrapping the Season Pass, which would typically let players access two larger expansions for an additional $30 or so, Ubisoft is cancelling plans to charge players more to play on launch day. It is therefore assumed DLC expansions such as Claws of Awaji will be made free for all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though details are restricted to the brief paragraph published to Steam, the name Claws of Awaji does shed some light on what players will find in the DLC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/assassins-creed-shadows-official-collectors-edition-trailer-ubisoft-forward-2024">Ubisoft quietly revealed Assassin's Creed Shadows' world map in the Collector's Edition trailer</a>, which showed nine detailed regions plus one small island left blank.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/10/untitled-1736512942490.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows' world map, per the Collector's Edition trailer.

Awaji Island is perhaps most famous for its prominence in the Japanese religion of Shinto, where it is said to be the first island created in the world through the legend of Izanagi and Izanami.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Assassin's Creed has delved further and further into mythology and not just history with recent releases, especially in the role-playing game series which Shadows belongs to, fans will perhaps get to delve into Japanese legends with the addition of the Claws of Awaji.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be longer than expected before this is possible, of course, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month">Ubisoft has delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows once again</a>, this time to March 20. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">It was first pushed to February 14</a> from its November 12 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot rests on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows as not only the long-awaited Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</a> following recent flops and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes">investor frustration</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however, with the development team having to apologize on separate occasions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">inaccuracies in Assassin's Creed Shadows' depictions of Japan</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">using a historical recreation group's flag without permission</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design, and combined with the two delays, fans are growing increasingly impatient as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-200k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragami Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>sales have passed a new milestone almost four months after the remaster's initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1877626459386212769" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), Dragami confirms that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has sold over 200,000 copies worldwide since its release on September 12th.</p>

<p>While it's true those aren't exactly sales on the level of triple-A hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;</em>or indie smashes like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>is a remastered version of an already-niche action game from 2012, so 200,000 isn't a bad figure at all to reach.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-combat.jpg?itok=0zu3GJbv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-combat.jpg?itok=Lku5SkXH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has hit the 200,000 sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>remaster was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs" rel="nofollow">announced as a remake</a> back in 2022, with producer Yoshimi Yasuda assuring fans at that point that the game would remain "as close as possible" to the original.</p>

<p>It was officially named&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-delayed-to-2024" rel="nofollow">the following year</a>, at which point its release was also pushed back to 2024. Following that, Yasuda proved himself true to his word when it turned out that&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">serve as a remaster</a> rather than a full remake.</p>

<p>Back in June, the remaster's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date was set for September</a>. It's one of two 2012 action-adventure games involving auteur Goichi Suda, otherwise known as Suda51, to get itself a remaster this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-release-date" rel="nofollow">the other being&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>is a remastered version of the 2012 action game, which was originally developed by Suda51's company Grasshopper Manufacture.</p>

<p>Maintaining the original game's story and atmosphere,&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>features upgraded visuals, "faster action", and plenty of other quality-of-life improvements to bring cheerleader Juliet Starling's zombie-slaying adventure into the modern era.</p>

<p>You can check out <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9NTPB0C2028V/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. Here's hoping all this renewed interest in 2012 action games leads to some kind of remaster for&nbsp;<em>Binary Domain</em>. Come on, Sega.</p>

Whether it was the shifting alliances and weaponized duplicity of <em>Shōgun</em>, Gambit’s shocking death in <em>X-Men ‘97</em>, or <em>Baby Reindeer</em>’s penchant for delving to unseen depths of abuse and psychosis, 2024's best shows were mindfucks. And it’s looking like 2025 will be no different.</p><p>To prepare you and your precious brain for the onslaught of twists, cliffhangers, and alien explosions, we have a quick guide to six shows we can’t wait to have fuck up our minds in the best ways possible.  <em>&nbsp;</em><br></p></div></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>February 6</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/invincible-presents-atom-eve/gallery&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/invincible-presents-atom-eve/gallery"><em>Invincible</em></a></span><em> </em>has pulverized our senses with superhero collective slaughtering, humans imprisoned in murderous cyborg bodies, and an orgy full of clones, and they aren’t pulling their punches in the third season. After Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun), aka Invincible, crosses a moral boundary by killing Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) in a multiversal melee for the ages, we may finally be in for his full power to be put on display in <em>Invincible</em>’s typical bloody manner. By the looks of the trailer, which shows Invincible mangling a humanoid cyborg and his angrily retaliating against his “boss” Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins), we’re likely in for feats of superhuman brutality only achievable in animation crafted by some severely disturbed writers.  </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>January 17</p><p>Boredom has never been more suspenseful than it is in the blindingly white halls of Lumon on Apple TV+’s standout series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-podcast-news-1851734616&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-podcast-news-1851734616"><em>Severance</em></a></span>. We all spent an entire season trying to reprogram our brains to understand a world where humans can sever their consciousness between work and personal life. Then, we spent the next two years trying to figure out why a company that severs people’s minds is herding goats, what happens to severed workers when they’re “fired,” and what the hell these people are actually doing for work. We previewed the second season, and there will be no shortage of tantalizing oddities (and goats) as the the severed workers plot a revolt against Lumon after being awakened in the real world at the end of Season 1. Just as we get answers to questions about the aftermath of the Innies’ awakenings and the complicated four-way relationship between Innie and Outie Mark (Adam Scott) with Innie Helly (Britt Lower) and Outie Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman), we get bombarded with more questions about the perils of reintegration and why there is a child working on the severed floor. </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>April 2025</p><p>Watching deadly mutated humans hunt survivors down using the quietest of sounds is terrifying enough before you remember that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-ces-2025-abby-ellie-dina-1851734101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-ces-2025-abby-ellie-dina-1851734101"><em>The Last Of Us</em></a></span> is based on a video game series and that the acclaimed HBO show hasn’t touched the saddest parts of yet. At the end of the first season, Joel (Pedro Pascal) saves Ellie (Bella Ramsey) from the Fireflies, a resistance group who was going to kill her in the hopes of devising a cure for the plague that has ravaged humanity.

The trailer for season two hints at the infected evolving into weather-resistant monstrosities looking to invade Joel and Ellie’s safe haven of Jackson, and posing an existential threat that will surely break our hearts and minds.</p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: N/A</strong></p><p>First off, rest in peace to Chance Perdomo, the late actor who played Andre Anderson in <em>Gen V, </em>and who passed away from a motorcycle accident four months after the first season ended. While we won’t get to see the full, violent extent of his metal manipulation, the show has plenty of mind-bending absurdism to go around. The show that had a superhuman explode someone’s penis by redirecting all of the blood in his body to his groin has a lot more of <em>The Boys</em> universe to show, with no element more intriguing than the virus developed in <em>Gen V</em> with the demonstrable power to mutilate and kill superpowered folks, or “supes.” The last season ended with a school-wide massacre at Godolkin University between supes and normal humans, and the aftermath will likely expose us to the full scope of supe miscreants from that school. </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>March 4</p><p>Charlie Cox, who plays Matt Murdock (aka Daredevil) in the <em>Daredevil </em>franchise, has said the Disney+ series <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>will be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cbr.com/daredevil-actor-born-again-darker-netflix-show/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cbr.com/daredevil-actor-born-again-darker-netflix-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">darker</a></span> than much of the original Netflix series. Remember, the Netflix series had Daredevil famously beating up droves of bad guys in a dark corridor in what is still one of the most iconic moments in any Marvel TV series or film. To get darker than that would really require them to up the ante, and Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) asking Murdock if all that’s left of him “the devil of Hell’s Kitchen” in the trailer makes me believe that the show will be delving deep into the character’s dark side. Plus, we still need to know what happened to him after Thanos snapped away half of the planet, which will surely have us trying to rearrange the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637">MCU timeline</a></span> in our heads. </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>N/A</p><p>In Rian Johnson’s remarkable mystery-of-the-week Peacock show, Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne) is a former casino worker on the run from her criminal ex-bosses after she uncovers murder and corruption at the casino. One caveat: She has an uncanny ability to detect when someone is lying, a skill that has her solving crimes while on her escape route. What really messes with viewers’ minds is not only trying to figure out how certain crimes were committed, but how seemingly disparate characters and plot points will be meshed together in her big reveal near the end of each episode. She once solved an elderly man’s murder in a retirement facility by detecting the bullshit in two unassuming old ladies who had been plotting this murder because the elderly man got them both arrested during their younger, militant days as anti-government revolutionaries who plotted bombings and assassinations. We may not know exactly when the second season comes, but we sure as hell know that it’ll be full of mysteries the smartest viewer can’t crack. (That won’t stop us from trying, though.) </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
