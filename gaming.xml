            <p>Good news, shooter fans - Deadlock finally officially exists.</p>
<p>Even though Valve's hero shooter amassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">a concurrent player peak of over 16,000</a> earlier in the month, Valve <em>still</em> wouldn't admit it existed. Overnight, however, it's <em>finally</em> been added to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Steam page gives away very little. The release date only says the launch is "to be announced" and the game is merely described as "a multiplayer game in early development".</p>
<p>There is precisely one asset - a 22-second trailer that does a little worldbuilding but details none of the gameplay - and no screenshots at all.</p>
<p>"Deadlock is in early development with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay. Access is currently limited to friend invite via our playtesters," the Steam page explains.</p> <div>

<p>"Yoshi" confirmed on the official Discord studio that the development team was "lifting the rules for public conversation about Deadlock to allow for things like Streaming, community websites, and discussions.</p>
<p>"Nothing else is changing with our state of development," the mascot added. "We are remaining invite-only and continue to be in an early development stage with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay."</p>

		<p>Deadlock has been officially announced by Valve, and it is the developer’s brand new mutiplayer game. The thing is, Deadlock has been a bit of an open secret for a little while now, as people were receiving invites to the closed playtest through Steam for a little while. As it has become more known about, it seems Valve has decided to be a bit more open about Deadlock’s development. You can watch a very basic teaser for Deadlock below.</p>
<!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
	
	
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">Deadlock is on Steam</a> now and you can add it to your wishlist too. However, there is no release date yet as the game is still in early development. In fact, the description for the game is very basic, saying, <em>“Deadlock is still in early development stages with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay. Access to Deadlock is currently limited to friend invites via our playtesters.”</em></p>


<p>Valve has been very active with development especially recently. In the last few years, we have seen the release of Half Life: Alyx and Counter-Strike 2. Deadlock could be a big disruptor in the MOBA/shooter space, and may be dominant like Team Fortress 2 has in the multiplayer FPS space. We will have to wait for more details about Deadlock, but it will definitely be one to watch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/interview-tymon-smektala-techland-dying-light-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/interview-techland%E2%80%99s-tymon-smekta%C5%82a-on-supporting-dying-light-2-until-2027.962730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/interview-tymon-smektala-techland-dying-light-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Techland had one of the most successful reveals during Gamescom, debuting the first trailer for Dying Light: The Beast during the Opening Night Live showcase. I then followed up with Techland twice, once to check out an exclusive extended gameplay demo and again to catch up with Tymon Smektała, the franchise director working on the Dying Light series.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast is an all-new, standalone adventure that started life as the second paid DLC for 2022’s Dying Light 2. I had the opportunity to ask Tymon a few questions about the expansion and the future of Dying Light 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-this-the-end">Is This The End?</h2>



<p>Dying Light 2 fans have been awaiting news regarding the second DLC for the game for quite some time. This isn’t what they expected, but in so many ways, it’s much better. Dying Light: The Beast brings back <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/">Roger Craig Smith as Kyle Crane</a>, offering players an 18-hour story that explains the lengthy gap between the first two games in the series.</p>



<p>I was curious to learn about Techland’s plans for Dying Light 2 now that the second (and assumedly final) DLC has become a standalone project:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We had to slow down things a little for the crucial preparation of The Beast for Gamescom, but even on the day of the announcement we released an update to Dying Light 2. We promised five years of support and we’re sticking to that promise. Expect new content updates, also coming this year.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As we looked back at the success of the series, Tymon admitted that Dying Light’s (2015) major expansion, The Following, could also have been a standalone title, but ‘this time around it’s different’. </p>



<p>He advised that The Beast will answer a lot of lingering questions that firm up the series’ lore – along with making the newest entry in the Dying Light series much more accessible to all players. As Tymon stressed, you can now play The Beast without having to ‘convert’ to Dying Light 2.</p>



<p>Speaking retrospectively, Tymon admitted that if they could do Dying Light 2 all over again, they’d let the game ‘mature’ first before announcing it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At some point in 2021, we started feeling pressure to get it out of the gate, especially as we announced it really early. If I could change naything I’d do just that, allow the game to mature a little internally, allowing us to focus and polish the details that make a good game and an exceptional one. A lesson learned, I guess.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We then looked forward, and Tymon revealed his desire to make Dying Light <strong>the </strong>zombie experience. He hopes that one day when someone asks what the best zombie game is, the first title on everyone’s mind will be ‘Dying Light’.</p>



<p>I say it’s already there.</p>



<p>I couldn’t have ended the interview without asking about ‘Dying Light 3’, and while Tymon stressed that there are ‘many possible ideas’ for the game, he couldn’t divulge any information.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valve-deadlock-announce/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-finally-lists-deadlock-on-steam-but-you-still-can%E2%80%99t-get-easy-access.962727/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valve-deadlock-announce/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For weeks, tens of thousands of players have been finding their way into Deadlock, an all-new competitive shooter developed by Valve. Despite that fact, the tech titan hadn’t ever acknowledged the existence of the game and was operating under a policy of blanket silence. Now, the company has connected itself to Deadlock in a remarkably minor way – by publishing a Steam listing that links Valve to the hero shooter as both the developer and publisher.</p>



<p>Not only that but the official Discord server for the game received a message from an admin updating the state of play for streamers and those neck-deep in the closed playtest.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kept-you-waiting-huh">Kept You Waiting, Huh?</h2>



<p>Valve has published a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing on Steam for Deadlock</a>, a brand-new competitive shooter with hero mechanics and a lot of hype. In the last few weeks, the game has pulled in tens of thousands of players, with the peak concurrent count hitting more than 40,000 users – which is higher than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concords-launch-is-worse-than-expected/">some recently released shooters</a>…</p>



<p>Aside from a brief animated teaser, there’s not much to take away from the Steam page for Deadlock. There’s almost nothing in the way of technical specifications or product patter, and all-in-all, it’s a very ‘underwhelming’ announcement from Valve.</p>



<p>Here’s the message that was posted by the Discord server’s admins to reflect this step up from Valve:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are lifting the rules for public conversation about Deadlock to allow for things like streaming, community websites, and discussions. Nothing else is changing with our state of development. We are remaining invite-only and contineu to be in an early development stage with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, while a Steam listing now exists for Deadlock, you can’t access the game unless you’re invited by someone <strong>already testing </strong>the game. Perhaps this will change in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>While Sony's blockchain <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202408/24-029E/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Development of Blockchain &quot;Soneium&quot;">announcement </a>is not exclusively aimed at gaming, a segment of the announcement mentions what they are looking at in the gaming region potentially with their new Soneium blockchain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End users will be able to access Soneium through applications that are compatible with Soneium's network, and will be able to interact with Web3 games and NFT marketplaces provided by each app, as well as entertainment-related services.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/go-mainstream-soneium.jpg?itok=8ClXt75w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/go-mainstream-soneium.jpg?itok=hBbwGbrn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The cringe inducing hashtage effort to "#GMwithSoneium" - or Go Mainstream which every other NFT project has failed at, perhaps due to solving problems that don't exist.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony is launching its own support for NFTs with the Soneium blockchain that they announced. NFTs have been unpopular with <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamedeveloper.com%2Fgame-platforms%2Fgamers-hate-nfts-here-s-why-that-s-good-for-the-game-industry" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Gamers hate NFTs—here's why that's good for the game industry">gamers since about two seconds after they were revealed,</a> and Sony launching this in 2024 shows how the company is sometimes slow to adapt to trends, as it is now years after other companies have entered, and exited the field of NFTs. Sony's Jun Watanabe, the head of their 'advanced business search department' and chairman of Sony Block Solutions, shared the following thoughts on the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the development of a comprehensive Web3 solution based on blockchain is very significant to the Sony Group, which has developed a wide variety of businesses under its purpose of "Fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology." We will work to create diverse businesses and new use cases with the aim of delivering customer value that can only be enjoyed through Web3 technology to as many users as possible and making people's lives richer and more colorful.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this doesn't mean that Sony is necessarily planning to make play-to-earn games itself, or implementing NFTs in its upcoming games, but it definitely opens the door to it. It also opens the path to play-to-earn games being on PlayStation for other developers, while Sony still collects its tithe as platform, and presumably now blockchain, czar.</p>
<h2>What is the history of NFTs in Gaming?</h2>
<p>There's been a lot of noise about gaming and NFTs over the past few years. During that time we have seen Ubisoft <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-ends-its-nft-experiment-in-ghost-recon-breakpoint-but-promises-theyre-coming-to-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ubisoft ends its NFT experiment in Ghost Recon Breakpoint but promises they're 'coming to other games'">experiment with NFTs lightly in Ghost Recon Wildlands</a>, as well as other companies dabble in the space (like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-is-going-all-in-on-nfts" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Stalker 2 is Going All-In on NFTs"><em>Stalker </em>developer GSC World</a>), before meeting backlash and often retreating from it (though <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-nft-and-blockchain-plans-laid-out-in-annual-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Square Enix NFT And Blockchain Plans Laid Out In Annual Report">Square Enix continues in the space</a> as well). Reasons for dislike of NFTs vary among gamers but they can be briefly summed up in a few points:</p>
<ul><li>They are <a href="https://earth.org/nfts-environmental-impact/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Explainer: What Are NFTs, And What is Their Environmental Impact?">ecologically damaging</a>,</li>
<li>Rampant speculation <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/855453ac-7011-448a-90b1-b0d7fedd43ac" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="What NFT mania can tell us about market bubbles">drives the entire market</a>,</li>
<li>They don't actually do anything, being essentially JPGs (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="NFTs Weren’t Supposed to End Like This">It's worse, it's links to JPEGs</a>),</li>
<li>There's an abundance of scammers and grifters in the market (See: <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Web3 is Going Just Greant">Web3 is going great</a>).</li>
</ul><p>Regardless of the individual reason, players pushed back against NFTs a lot. While mention of interoperability of NFTs was mentioned a lot by those pitching them, it's either not feasible as developer <a href="https://x.com/tha_rami/status/1480404407187656705" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Rami Ismail on Twitter/X">Rami Ismail explained</a>, or you can do it perfectly fine without them. The easiest way to view most NFTs is that imagine its a blockchain version of the Steam Marketplace, as they are like <em>Team Fortress 2 </em>Hats and <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> skins with all the issues those markets have dialed up to 11, and massive amounts of power usage.</p>

These games were all about earning NFTs, and you could sell them to make money (or crypto currency to be more exact). To return to our Steam Marketplace analogy, these are the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/banana-steam-popular" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Why Is a Picture of a Banana So Popular on Steam?">Banana game</a> and similar titles that exist just to create inventory items that spark speculative bubbles and are full of bots. The most famous of these was Axie Infinity, which garnered attention for Philippines and other lower-wage countries having people earn money playing the game to get resources for others who paid them… before it all <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/8/23015468/axie-infinity-blockchain-nft-play-to-earn-game-economics-hack" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Axie Infinity’s financial mess started long before its $600 million hack">came screeching to a halt</a> even before the game suffered a massive hack.</p>
<p>The issues with the sector have led to actions being taken like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-bans-cryptocurrency-games-on-steam" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Valve Bans Cryptocurrency Games on Steam">Valve banning them on Steam</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-to-ban-nfts-on-game-servers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Minecraft To Ban NFTs on Game Servers">Minecraft banning NFTs</a> as well. Developers like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-dev-claims-gaming-nfts-are-harmful-to-game-design-environment" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Bungie Dev Claims Gaming NFTs Are Harmful to Game Design, Environment">Bungie's Max Nicols</a>, and organizations like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/igda-calls-for-halt-in-unnecessary-gaming-nfts" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" IGDA Calls For Halt In Unnecessary Gaming NFTs">IGDA have spoken out against them as well</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for what more Sony will do with the blockchain, and NFTs we'll have to just wait and see.</p>

We're talking anywhere from 10 to 20 or more additional buttons. These extra inputs usually sit on the side of the mouse for easy access with your thumb. The buttons can be mapped to the various skills and abilities you use in-game, making it easier to stay consistent with your combat rotations, pop a weave ability at the opportune moment, or even just navigate menus faster than dragging your mouse around and clicking on-screen icons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4356484-mcie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356484" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4356484-mcie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356484"></a><figcaption>Logitech G502 Hero and UtechSmart Venus Pro gaming mice</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4356484-mcie.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If that sounds like something you'd want from a new mouse, you're in luck.

As a result, it quietly amassed thousands of players, reaching <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valves-new-hero-shooter-is-quietly-amassing-thousands-of-playtesters">over 18,000 concurrent players mid-August</a> and climbing to a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peak of over 44,000 players</a> earlier this week.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/23/deadlock-image-1724453496539.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A short video plays on the official Steam page for Deadlock. Image source: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p>However, despite the game being generally available to anyone who knew anyone else playing it, a splash screen at the start of the game asked players to "not share anything about the game with anyone." Many players, naturally, ignored the relatively gentle and not-legally-binding warning, resulting in a number of videos popping up on YouTube showcasing gameplay and at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one media write-up in The Verge</a>.</p><p>As a result, we've known for weeks now that Deadlock is a 6v6 third-person hero shooter with a bit of a MOBA twist, in that iot takes place across four lanes with aggressively respawning waves of troopers. It's still in "early development," Valve warns, "with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay." However, Valve has now officially lifted its request not to share information about the game and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed its official store page.</a></p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Valve Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p>Deadlock is still invite-only for now, but with it out in the open at last, it seems likely we'll start seeing Valve actively discussing what Deadlock is, alongside critics and content creators, as well as a potential surge in new players.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kamala-harris%E2%80%99-first-twitch-stream-peaked-at-under-1-000-viewers-some-of-whom-spammed-palestinian-flags.962598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kamala-harris-twitch-stream-dnc-palestine<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kamala Harris, current United States vice president and the Democratic Party’s candidate for president, now <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kamalaharris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has a Twitch channel</a>. Yesterday evening, her team broadcasted from it for the first time, allowing Twitch viewers to tune into a couple hours of speeches from the final night of the DNC, including Harris’ big coronation. The stream peaked at 933 concurrent viewers, well below the Twitch debuts of other presidential aspirants like Bernie Sanders (7,233) and Donald Trump (12,826).</p><p>During the broadcast, chat was largely in emote-only mode, with many seemingly intended to express enthusiasm (hearts, raised hands, signs that read ‘yea,’ etc). These were sporadically broken up by floods of Palestinian flags, as well as images of letters that spelled out “Free Palestine.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Twitch</figcaption></figure><p>This followed a week of thousands-strong pro-Palestinian protests outside the DNC, as well as demonstrations from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/21/meet-the-uncommitted-how-gaza-hangs-over-democratic-national-convention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Uncommitted Movement</a>, a group led by delegates representing hundreds of thousands of people who voted “uncommitted” in the Democratic primaries as a result of Biden's seemingly bottomless well – and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-approves-20-billion-weapons-sales-israel-hamas-backs-out-cease-fire-talks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warchest</a> –&nbsp; of support for Israel. The Uncommitted Movement attempted to negotiate with the Democratic Party to get a Palestinian American speaker, whose <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/08/dnc-speech-uncommitted-movement-harris-walz-ruwan-romman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brief speech</a> would have been vetted, on stage at the DNC, only to be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uncommitted-palestinian-convention-harris-918812eb0e19b9669f8b9b9cd88c6360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned away Wednesday night</a>. The day before, the DNC handed the mic over to parents of an Israeli American hostage held by Hamas, prompting demands from the left and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/22/g-s1-19169/palestinian-protests-dnc-united-autoworkers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powerful unions like United Auto Workers</a> for someone of Palestinian descent to be granted the same privilege.</p><p>During her own speech, Harris disappointed those who hoped she might deviate from Biden’s bloody path, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a> that she “will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself” and “will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.” However, she also acknowledged the “heartbreaking” scale of suffering in Gaza and said that she and Biden continue to push for a ceasefire deal so that "Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self determination." Granted, Biden has been saying things like this for the past ten months, and it has done absolutely nothing to change the material reality of the situation – which is continuous, pointless slaughter of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/8/gaza-toll-could-exceed-186000-lancet-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(at least) tens of thousands of innocent people</a>.</p><p>Harris’ poor performance on Twitch does not indicate a lack of interest in her campaign, even on the platform. At the same time as Harris’ channel, Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, the biggest political commentator on Twitch, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2231129523?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streamed Harris’ speech</a> to an audience that maxed out at nearly 60,000 concurrent viewers. Other, smaller politically-focused channels simultaneously broadcast her speech to thousands more.&nbsp;</p><p>Harris also does not have novelty on her side; when Sanders and Trump joined Twitch, it was nearly unheard of for politicians to do such a thing. Now many have tried to varying degrees of success, from Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with her <a href="https://kotaku.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-streams-on-twitch-with-hasan-p-1845431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">430,000-viewer <em>Among Us</em> stream in 2020</a> (which included Piker, among many other big-name content creators) to Republican Representative Matt Gaetz’s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/matt-gaetz-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comically sad six-viewer showing in 2022</a>. More recently, Trump has <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cameoed in content from somehow-popular bottom feeders</a> like Kick streamer Adin Ross to the tune of hundreds of thousands of viewers. The DNC, meanwhile, just allowed content creators to attend for the first time, granting special access to 200 and <a href="https://archive.is/AaXVb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even special-er access to a select handful</a>. The RNC ran a similar, albeit more limited, playbook, opening its doors to around 70 content creators in July.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Sanders and Trump’s Twitch channels no longer post numbers even remotely as impressive as they used to back in 2020. These days, Sanders is lucky to break 1,000, while Trump tends to hover between 2,000 and 5,000, with one recent spike that went beyond 10,000. Granted, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24203801/donald-trump-twitch-channel-unbanned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until July</a>, Trump was banned from Twitch following the January 6, 2021 insurrection, and nothing boosts numbers on livestreaming platforms like a long-awaited return.&nbsp;</p><p>What these channels and Harris’ have in common is that, so far, they’ve largely been content to broadcast speeches, rallies, and other events rather than directly interact with Twitch streamers or viewers. On Twitch, scanning and responding to chat is the bare minimum, and if you want your channel to grow, the meta these days is to form relationships with well-known streamers with whom you share values and a general vibe. No politician has successfully pulled this off, and the reason why is simple: It’s a full-time job. Politicians – at least, if they’re halfway decent – already have one of those.</p><p>That said, Harris’ team has proven impressively social-media savvy, <a href="https://aftermath.site/charli-brat-kamala-vibes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embracing the summer’s inescapable brat meme</a> and <a href="https://www.avclub.com/harris-walz-campaign-uses-dril-tweet-in-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invoking Weird Twitter legend Dril</a> in a campaign email (although you could argue that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/dril-kamala-harris-trump-post-1235084267/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that second one ended up backfiring</a>). Perhaps, then, this is just the beginning for Harris’ humble little Twitch channel. Who knows? Maybe Tim Walz will go live tomorrow and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vp-candidate-tim-walz-was-a-big-dreamcast-fan-and-we-think-weve-found-his-favorite-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play some <em>Crazy Taxi</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Riley MacLeod.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Popular Tekken 8 competitors, Ulsan and Atif went up against each other today in the Tekken 8 Esports World Cup Grand Final. Though, both fought hard, only one player was to walk out as the Tekken 8 Esports World Cup Champion. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ulsan-wins-the-tekken-8-esports-world-cup">Ulsan Wins The Tekken 8 Esports World Cup</h2>



<p>The two competitors took the battlefield in a first-to-five competition. Atif, began the tournament with quite a bit of momentum, as the player won the first two rounds of Game 1. Ulsan, though, was not allowing for a sweep, coming back and winning the game 3-2. </p>



<p>Both players played as the infamous Dragonuv.</p>



<p>Going into Game 2, Ulsan did not drag behind from his momentum during Game 1, winning the game 3-1 and putting himself ahead 2-0. Atif, though, desperately wanted a comeback, winning the first two rounds of Game 3. Still, Ulsan proved why he does the best under pressure, coming back and winning the game 3-2.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Game 4 was no different for Ulsan, as the competitor won 3-1, putting himself in a 4-0 lead, with only one more win needed to grab that Esports World Cup victory.</p>



<p>While some fans were probably hoping for a historic comeback from Atif, it sadly did not happen, as Ulsan swept the player with a 5-0 win, certifying himself as the Tekken 8 Esports World Cup Champion and walking out with a whopping $300,000.</p>



<hr>

<p>Now, playing for KWANGDONG FREECS, Ulsan continues to push the Tekken esports scene to a new level.</p>

Both models are eligible for the current Amazon deal. Along with superb active noise cancellation and up to 12 hours of battery life (24 with the charging case), PC users can use the Inzone Hub software to fully customize their performance. Those settings, including one of up to 256 sound profiles, can be synced to the earbuds and used on PS5 and other devices. The PS5's audio features, such as Tempest 3D Audio and Dolby Atmos, are fully compatible with the Inzone Buds.</p><p>Like most wireless earbuds, the Inzone Buds have tap/touch controls that work well. You can use the controls to turn ANC on or off, adjust the volume, tinker with the sound mix, and more. Tap controls can be programmed to different functions. If you worry about latency with wireless headsets, the 2.4GHz connection has only 30ms of latency, which helps create a seamless and reliable listening experience. An AI-assisted microphone enhances your voice to help your words ring out clearly to your teammates.</p><p>The gaming earbud space isn't loaded with anywhere close to as many competitors as the established gaming headset market, but Inzone Buds are the best we've used so far. Sony's experience manufacturing high-end earbuds certainly helped when designing the Inzone Buds.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/23/playstation-plus-classics-update-could-fix-major-timesplitters-issue/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In case you missed it, earlier this week <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> updated its <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> Classics lineup with a slew of new arrivals. Among them were TimeSplitters and its two sequels, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/timesplitters">TimeSplitters</a> 2, and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect, making the trilogy fully playable on PS4 and PS5 consoles.</p>
<p><iframe title="TIME SPLITTERS: FUTURE PERFECT - Trailer" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViC2gbGcJhM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>However, it didn’t take PlayStation gamers long to realise something was missing. When Sony first added PS2 games to its growing PlayStation Plus Classics library, each of them (Tomb Raider: Legend, Sly Raccoon, and Star Wars: The Clone Wars) came with full <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-trophies">trophy</a> support. Subsequent PS2 titles including Ghosthunter and Summoner also touted this feature. For some reason, the TimeSplitters games don’t have any virtual silverware for retro FPS fans to collect.</p>
<p>Clearly disappointed, one PSN user (<a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/timesplitters-ps2-trophy-patch">via TrueTrophies</a>) reached out to TimeSplitters IP holder and publisher <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/deep-silver">Deep Silver</a> asking about trophy support. Their response was that “trophies are considered and should be available in a future patch” though “currently we do not have an official release date.”</p>
<p>Many trophy hunters will no doubt wait to pull the trigger on the TimeSplitters trilogy until then. Still, the temptation to blast through these time-hopping classics may prove irresistible. While they might pave the way for a welcome trip down memory lane, the trilogy’s return to PlayStation is also a painful reminder of the cancelled TimeSplitters projects that will never come to light.</p>

<p>For those who remember, developer Free Radical had been working on a TimeSplitters 4 though the studio was almost shut down following the PS3 exclusives flop that was Haze. The team was snapped up by Crysis and Hunt: Showdown publisher, Crytek, before later being bought by Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Sadly, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/11/free-radical-design-shutdown-timesplitters-cancelled/">Free Radical closed its doors for good earlier this year</a> amidst a wave of devastating layoffs and closures that swept the industry far and wide. A project titled TimeSplitters Next was cancelled as a result – a modernised, trend-chasing take on the series that later pivoted towards being an expanded TimeSplitters 2 remake before the axe finally fell.</p>
<p>Let’s hope that TimeSplitters isn’t gone for good and that another studio can take a swing at restoring it to its former glory.</p>

<p>The struggle of hero-shooter Concord continues as the game is officially out, and no one seems to care. In its first few hours available worldwide, Concord has yet to surpass even 1,000 players on Steam since launch.</p>



<p>As of writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">less than 700 players</a> are actively playing the online PvP title.</p>



<p>To be honest, this shouldn’t be too surprising based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-concord-open-beta-bombed-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor open beta numbers</a> when no one had to pay to access the game. Now that you have to spend the full $40 to play, it’s hard to see it becoming a hit out of nowhere.</p>



<p>Obviously the numbers should go up over the weekend as more people have time to play the game. But it’s unlikely we’ll see them go up to a point where both Sony and Firewalk Studios are happy with the numbers. As far as PlayStation 5 player numbers, that information isn’t publicly available. It could be assumed, however, that numbers on the console would be higher than PC. How much higher, though, is unclear.</p>



<p>With all that said, Firewalk seems set to support Concord — a game that has been <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122649963245882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in development for eight years</a> — at least through the winter. The game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-post-launch-roadmap-outlines-new-characters-maps-and-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two seasons</a> have already been announced as coming in October and January. There’s also a tease for a third season in April. But beyond that, questions are going to continue about the viability of the game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-hit-with-overly-negative-response-after-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans seemed to be turned off by</a> right from the start.</p>
