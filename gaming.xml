            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>When we reviewed the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> for Switch 2 just a little while back, we came away as impressed as ever with IO Interactive's incredible world-building and gameplay. However, we were also a little bit disappointed with the game's performance at launch.</p>
<p>For a title we really love on other platforms, it was unfortunate to have to mark it down to a relatively disappointing 7/10 as a result of some fairly constant choppiness in both docked and handheld modes. And so we are delighted to discover that those boffins over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ6Mkwkvyxs">Digital Foundry</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hitman-world-of-assassination-seems-to-have-an-undocumented-performance-mode">cheers, Eurogamer</a>) seem to have found an unannounced 'performance mode' of sorts that we can all benefit from. Hooray for boffins!</p>
<p>According to DF's Richard Leadbetter, he received an email which notified him that a player had gone into the console system settings to have a muck about due to the fluctuating framerate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I went into the system settings and changed the TV output res from 4K to 720p, went back into the game and found it vastly improves performance. The Hawkes Bay Mission ran at... a very solid and stable frame-rate."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter then proceeded to put this to the test, capturing various scenes from the game's whistle-stop tour of the globe at 4K, 1080p and 720p. Choosing areas that push the GPU and CPU, and give us lots of crowd density, the results, he comments, are very interesting.</p>
<p>In the game's Whittleton Creek level, as an example, a setting of 4K output manages an average framerate of 46.88fps - which then rises to 59.95fps at 720p. A 62.5% improvement!</p>
<p>At 1080p, things get more interesting still:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...the game actually seems to be rendering at a slightly higher resolution, with pixel counts suggesting 1152p to 1188p. Meanwhile, with Switch 2 set to 4K, performance drops but pixel counts are still in the same 1152p/1188p window. The performance drop may be down to upscaling to a higher resolution with an approximate cost of around 2.4ms compared to what we assume is the same content without any upscaling."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter continues, unsure whether Hitman is using DLSS to upscale, "as there are rounded edges where we'd expect to see aliasing." DF has reached out to IO interactive for confirmation.</p>
<p>The team has also checked out the game's super cool Berlin level, reporting that things jump up by some 61% when knocked down to 720p, whilst 1080p is 9% faster.</p>

<p>Moving on to CPU-intensive crowded areas, and as expected the frame rate jumps aren't quite so sensational once you factor in a ton of NPCs. However, you are looking at a jump, according to DF, from around 35fps in the Paris fashion show stage, to in and around the 45fps mark, which is still rather tasty.</p>
<p>So, whilst this isn't an actual performance mode, hence why it hasn't been mentioned officially by the devs, you <em>can</em> pick up some nice frame boosts <em>if</em> you're willing to drop your resolution down a little. More interestingly, the disparity in these numbers should, says Leadbetter, enable DF to get a better handle on the computational costs of Nintendo's DLSS implementation on the new console going forward. Something that's been a bit of a mystery up until this point!</p>
<p>IO Interactive has also recently announced that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/hitman-developer-is-working-on-switch-2-performance-issues-right-now">working hard on Switch 2 performance issues</a>, so hopefully we won't have to sacrifice picture clarity for too long.</p>
<p><em>Have you been playing Hitman: World of Assassination? Tempted to drop the resolution down for some extra frames? Let us know!</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-is-getting-third-person-view-and-new-game-on-its-3rd-anniversary.1248924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Ubisoft Massive announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> will receive a major update on December 5, its third anniversary. The date has also been chosen because it is exactly two weeks before the theatrical release of Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third movie in the franchise. </p>



<p>The update's main highlight is the addition of a full-fledged third-person camera. As you might recall, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was first-person only, which certainly turned at least a few gamers away for various reasons (motion sickness being one of the most obvious). </p>



<p>With third-person mode, players will be able to experience Pandora from a whole new perspective at the push of a button. Whether they're exploring, fighting, or simply taking in the view, the third-person mode brings a new sense of scale, freedom, and immersion. Ubisoft Massive reworked the animations, controls, audio, and camera systems to make the experience seamless and intuitive.</p>



<p>The upcoming update will also add another highly requested feature, New Game+, which allows players to replay the story while keeping their inventory and skills. They will face tougher enemies and unlock a brand-new skill tree and more powerful gear. It's a fresh challenge for seasoned players looking to delve deeper into the world of Pandora.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Omar Bouali, Creative Director at Massive, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’ve always envisioned Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora as a living world that evolves with our players. This update is a celebration of our community’s passion and we’re thankful to our players for their support—it means the world to our team.</em></p>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is also having a limited-time sale on various platforms. For example, on Steam, you can get any version of the game at 70% off through July 31. The Gold and Ultimate Edition provide access to the two story DLC packs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-story-pack-is-out-on-july-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sky Breaker</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secrets of the Spires</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-to-add-new-game-plus-and-more-in-december.1248921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced a new update for&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, and the studio has promised to add two of the features most requested by the game's community.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/AvatarFrontiers/status/1947325865982914631" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a>, the update, which is due to arrive on December 5th, will add a New Game Plus mode to the first-person shooter, so you'll be able to tackle its story again with all of your equipment and skills intact.</p>

<p>New Game Plus will, however, also bring tougher enemies and a higher level of overall challenge, so you'll need to take advantage of the stronger gear and new skill tree offered by the mode in order to prevail.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus-mech.jpg?itok=MGTm52Cw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus-mech.jpg?itok=6VlH0YTK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>is getting a big new update in December.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the New Game Plus mode, you're also getting a third-person view option, allowing you to see your character as you explore the lush environments of Pandora. Honestly, I'm surprised there was no third-person view mode to start with, but better late than never, I guess.</p>

<p>According to Massive Entertainment, various gameplay systems in <i>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</i>have been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-brings-third-person-and-new-game-plus-modes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reworked</a> in order to ensure a "seamless and intuitive" experience while playing in third-person, so it shouldn't just feel like a tacked-on extra.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why it's going to take so long for the update to arrive, it's probably because Ubisoft wants to time the release as close to the launch of the upcoming third&nbsp;<em>Avatar&nbsp;</em>movie as possible.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-gameplay-debut-and-december-7-release-date" rel="nofollow">released on December 7th back in 2023</a>, so while this update won't land exactly on the game's second anniversary, it'll be close enough to be considered a celebration anyway.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840770/Avatar_Frontiers_of_Pandora/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/9N9QJG4S82B5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and its New Game Plus update arrives on December 5th.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While those attempts to censor through manufactured controversy failed, Collective Shout may be having more success directly targeting payment processing companies which have been cracking down on pornography across the the broader web on creator platforms like OnlyFans. Earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/fansly-ban-furries-new-rules/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/fansly-ban-furries-new-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fansly banned any sexualized “anthropomorphic content”</a></span> in an apparent bid to censor bestiality on the platform, despite that being condemned within the furry community as well. Instead of nuanced moderation, some platforms appear to be making more drastic shifts to appease payment companies.</p><p>That’s the concern around the recent purge of sex games on Steam. In addition to bans on games that use crypto currencies or feature “sexually explicit images of real people,” Valve added the much more ambiguous restriction against “Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.”</p><p>The new guideline coincided with Vavle removing games from Steam with titles like <em>Incest Tales: Webcam Daughter</em> and <em>Reincarnation in another world going to rape All NPCs VR.</em> But others with genre tags that still mentioned things like incest were left untouched, spreading confusion about where exactly Valve was drawing the line. It was also unclear why Valve was only taking action now despite this type of porn-slop, including some truly vile sounding games, have routinely crept onto the storefront. Instead of Valve banning a sexual assault sim called <em>No Mercy</em> earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725">it was voluntarily withdrawn</a></span> from Steam by its creators.</p><figure id="" data-id="70e31955596f463b5ce3ab176f0a5ea1" data-recommend-id="image://70e31955596f463b5ce3ab176f0a5ea1" data-format="png" data-width="1533" data-height="818" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an explicit game bundle on Steam.

Does it review games for infringing content first? Does it ban things based on how they look or sound and then wait for the creators to appeal later? And is it working off of clear guidelines from payment companies? It’s that type of moderation mess that risks censoring various game-based works of art simply because someone in a position of power might go “ick,” or, even worse, they saw someone making noise about it on social media and didn’t want to get caught up in the drama.</p><p>That’s certainly the approach that the owners of <em>Vice</em>, which originally broke the story on Collective Shout’s relationship to the changes, appears to have taken. Savage Ventures, which invested in Vice after it went bankrupt, was accused by Valens of being behind the removal of two of her articles about the topic. “Vice’s owner Savage Ventures has requested the removal of my Collective Shout articles,” she posted on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky over the weekend</a></span>. “This is due to concerns about the controversial subject matter—not journalistic complaints.”</p><p>In the meantime, Collective Shout cofounder Melinda Tankard Reist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946147654616104963&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946147654616104963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is calling</a></span> those critical of Valve’s decision “porn sick brain rotted pedo gamer fetishists.” While the organization’s initial letter accused Steam of hosting hundreds of games that would “breach Australian classification laws,” Collective Shout has so far declined to name any specific examples. “Most of the content found within the games, including the graphics and the developers descriptions, are too distressing for us to make public,” it wrote. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-sex-censorship-hentai-gta-5-collective-shout-1851786636]]></content:encoded>

Donkey Kong Bananza stars the fan-favorite Kong naturally, but it also features a young Pauline, who first reappeared in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a> back in 2017. Together, the two aim to smash their way to the center of the planet, where wishes are supposedly granted. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza Is Out Now!</h2><div catalogid="c98403e2-b486-4735-a4e3-b129ab1054cb" id="225410"><p data-cy="paragraph">As you hunt for the hundreds of Banandium Gems scattered throughout each layer of the world, you'll need to open up the terrain using Donkey Kong's abilities. Donkey Kong Bananza completely reinvents the Donkey Kong formula, allowing the titular Kong to smash, break, and crash his way through any terrain. You can choose to smash through an entire wall, take a piece of the wall and throw it, or even surf on a slab of rock.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Bananza would not have been possible without the power of Nintendo Switch 2. The game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-mario-kart-world-donkey-kong-bananza-was-originally-a-switch-1-game-nintendo-confirms">initially began development on the Nintendo Switch</a>, but the team quickly realized that the limited hardware would prevent the game from reaching its potential. This is the best showcase of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Nintendo_Switch_2_vs_Nintendo_Switch_Comparison_Chart">Switch 2's hardware</a> yet, especially with the Voxel technology used throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is available now for Nintendo Switch 2, with the full game available on the cartridge. If you've yet to pick up the game, now is the perfect time to do so at <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62pyl?object_uuid=432e0149-f0b2-4091-b02d-3bb18f8825c0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

That's a 28% reduction if you're looking for market price, but still over $28 more than the standard $50 MSRP.</p><div catalogid="cc0b3227-d28a-42b7-bd75-cd5e876cb02f" id="225543"><div id="225543" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG Scarlet &amp; Violet Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like with recent restocks for Destined Rivals, the main retailers listing Black Bolt &amp; White Flare ETBs at above retail are Walmart and Amazon. <a href="https://zdcs.link/985d5q?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Walmart</u></a> continues to list both at around $99, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJg4gD?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon still lists the White Flare ETB</u></a> for roughly $105, but Black Bolt's price cut is an unexpected bargain in contrast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this is still way above what these would normally be priced at. The best-priced among big stores listing Black Bolt &amp; White Flare at their actual value is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8r8Z?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Best Buy</u></a>, at $49.99 for each ETB, but both are sold out at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the same case for the<a href="https://zdcs.link/aXWMWm?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> Pokemon Center</u></a>, which was listed both for a slightly more expensive $59.00.  Whichever retailer you buy from, though, each Black Bolt &amp; White Flare ETB contains:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nine respective booster packs</li><li>Full-art promo card — Thundurus with Black Bolt, Tornadus with White Flare<ul data-cy="list"><li>The Pokémon Center version also comes with an extra full-art promo with the website’s logo</li></ul></li><li>65 sleeves for your cards</li><li>45 Energy Cards</li><li>A player’s expansion guide</li><li>Damage counter dice, coin flip-die, and condition markers</li><li>Collectable box with dividers</li><li>Pokémon Trading Card Game Live code card</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The assumed reason for these inflated prices is to both scare off scalpers and bots, since these automatically reduce reseller profit margins, whilst still making the money from those who are still willing to pay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon UK had implemented its own fairer way of controlling the stock shortage of Pokémon cards by implementing the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-etbs-are-back-in-stock-at-amazon-uk-for-prime-day-but-theres-a-catch"><u>invite-only system</u></a>, allowing any with an invitation to buy ETBs at their RRP value. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, the US equivalent doesn’t seem to want to follow suit. Still, Amazon and Walmart have technically followed the market value of Pokémon card products like these, even if they are still going a fair amount higher. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On dedicated selling platform TCG Player, for instance, the market price for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDEDJ?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Black Bolt ETB</u></a> is around $91 whilst <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxExG?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>White Flare’s</u></a> is almost $92 at the time of writing. eBay also have listings that are a little bit cheaper, showing <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7E4w?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Black Bolt ETBs going for at least $86</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpE7M?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>White Flare for $85</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even going by the most expensive cards from the Japanese version of the set, Black Bolt and White Flare have plenty of valuable potential pulls to make the higher investment worth it, but we know it’s still a major sting knowing you’re paying well above what you should be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whichever way, though, paying around 50% mark-up at minimum for an ETB appears to just be the name of the game in the Pokemon TCG market these days. If you want to get any of these new cards at the best price available, grab this Amazon deal whilst you can before you have to pay at least $10 more from an eBay seller. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

                <p>Out of nowhere, developer RageSquid and publisher No More Robots shadow-released the extreme sports game Descenders Next today, July 21, and it's included with Xbox Game Pass. The game was originally scheduled to launch in April before being quietly delayed at the last minute.</p><p>Alternatively, you can buy Descenders Next outright on Steam and Xbox for $30 USD.

No More Robots says the game aims to be "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need, slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time."</p><p>After the original Descenders reached 35 million players, Descenders Next builds upon that foundation but extends the series to sports beyond just downhill biking.</p><p>Descenders Next features online multiplayer, large biomes to explore, and progression-based unlockable content. "The parks in particular provide fresh new challenges, while also acting as Next's playgrounds of fun. Sometimes you'll be required to dash down the mountain with your friends as quickly as possible, while other times you'll be aiming to focus on your tricks and perfect landings. Scavenger hunts will see players exploring every inch of the mountain, and unlocking special rewards for those who venture the deepest," reads a line from the game's description.</p><p>The music in Descenders Next was done by Monstercat.

<p>Sloclap released its football game Rematch earlier this year, to plenty of praise. However, it wasn't what many expected the studio to come up with following its previous release, the kung-fu roguelike, Sifu.</p>

<p>"Some Sifu fans were disappointed when the game was revealed and we're sorry to say that," Sloclap creative director Pierre Tarno admitted to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/rematch-dev-is-sorry-that-players-wanted-more-sifu-but-for-the-moment-it-was-better-to-let-it-rest/">GamesRadar+</a>, before adding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">marketing could have perhaps been a bit better on Rematch's reveal</a>.</p>
<p>"Because the reveal trailer had a cold open, like 'from the team behind Sifu', they were like 'alright, Sifu 2 incoming'," Tarno continued. "I'm sorry about that misunderstanding because I think we should have probably, early on, let the Sifu community know that we were about to announce a title and that it would not be Sifu 2, and they shouldn't be expecting it, just so they didn't have this disappointment."</p>
<p>The developer added Sifu was never intended to become the studio's identity, and it was time for something new. "We did a year and a half of post-launch support for Sifu," he said. "We felt that we'd really provided and kind of given everything we had on Sifu." But, at least for the time being, "it was better to let [Sifu] rest". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifus-last-ever-content-update-is-coming-in-september">Sifu ultimately got its last content update in September</a> 2023.</p>
<p>Continuing, Tarno said some players often expect "studios to be doing the exact same genre over and over again", but that is not the way Sloclap approaches things.</p>
<p>"We have a huge opportunity to pursue the creative projects that we are passionate about, and not many developers have that chance. It's really very rare for developers to be able to do that," Tarno elaborated. "And then I think players and also media realised that although it was not exactly the same, [the games are] both third-person action games. Both grounded, credible, still epic, with bodies and movement, it's physicality."</p>
<p>Tarno said "there is a lineage between the titles", from Sloclap's Absolver to Sifu to Rematch. "Our experience making the two previous games is what allowed us to make this one," the developer closed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">Rematch surpassed 1m sales in its first week on the market</a>, with three million "unique" players also joining the pitch thanks to its inclusion on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Xbox's Game Pass subscription service</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom was one of those three million Rematch players, and had rather a good old time with it. "I feel like I've finally found a competitive online game that I enjoy and can't stop thinking about," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Eurogamer's Rematch feature</a>. "I love it. In fact I love it despite the fact that a large portion of the player base is the absolute worst kind of person: a ball hog."</p>
<p>For more, our Connor recently spoke to Tarno about the introduction of crossplay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-crossplay-top-priority-future-updates">which remains the "top priority" for Rematch and Sloclap</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-developer-sorry-to-disappointed-fans-wanting-more-sifu-but-it-had-given-everything-we-had-already]]></content:encoded>

		<p>No More Robots and RageSquid have announced that Descenders Next is out… now! The sequel to the downhill biking of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/descenders">Descenders</a> is available right now for PC and Xbox, and on<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">&nbsp;Game Pass</a> for both systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="Descenders Next is OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fE11hzKkErQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Where the original game was all about bikes, Descenders Next focuses in on snowboarding and mountainboarding. You’ll start by drifting through the white stuff, before getting onto the brown stuff, mastering snowboards first before having wheels attached to that plank of wood and relearning how this will handle.</p>
<p>Descenders Next already boasts as much content as the original Descenders, with full online multiplayer, multiple huge biomes, and tons of tricks and grinds to learn how to pull off. There’s still a blend of procedural generation and hand-crafted levels, but these now chain from one into the other, and the goal can be a to race to the finish line, pull of tricks and perfect landings, or go on scavenger hunts to explore the whole mountain.</p>
<p>Rounding out the experience is a drum and bass soundtrack from Monstercat.</p>

<p>Descenders was a huge hit for No More Robots and RageSquid, first launching for PC and Xbox One in 2019, before spreading to PS4 and Switch in 2020. With outright sales alongside stints in subscription services, there’s been over 35 million players of this game, and they’ll no doubt be hoping to capture that lightning in a bottle for a second time.</p>
<p>Originally announced last August, the team planned to roll from a demo back in February of this year to have their early access launch in April, but chose to postpone this after seeing tens of thousands of players try out the game and gathering a ton of valuable feedback and info. A few months on, and Descenders Next will hopefully be much better prepared to handle everything that players want from the game.</p>

			<p>Developer RageSquid and publisher No More Robots have shadowdropped Descenders Next on Steam in Early Access, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and it's available through Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>Announced in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2375530/view/4362384060822219438?l=english">August 2024</a>, Descenders Next is RageSquid's follow-up to Descenders, which launched in early access a little more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/most-anticipated-sports-racing-2019/">seven years ago</a>, and reached more than 35 million players across consoles and PC. Descenders Next moves the series beyond extreme mountainbiking, with snowboarding and mountainboarding as the next frontier for players to conquer. </p>

<p>RageSquid boasts that Descenders Next "<em>already features as much content as the original Descenders, with full online multiplayer action, tons of tricks and grinds to pull off, and multiple huge biomes to explore."</em> If you're not playing it on Xbox Game Pass, then you can grab Descenders Next for $29.99 / £24.99 / 28.99 euros on Steam and Xbox. </p>

<p>The studio also says that the game will feature "<em>a more natural experience</em>," with procedurally-generated "<em>off-piste</em>" mountains that will be tied together by parks made by the development team, rather than having procedurally generated tracks or hand-crafted ones, as was the case in Descenders.</p>



<p>RageSquid is also determined to make Descenders Next the last word in extreme sports games, "<em>slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time."</em> What those sports will be and when they'll be added remains to be seen.</p>



<p>No More Robots and RageSquid did not provide an update as to when Descenders Next will arrive on PlayStation or Nintendo consoles, though <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/descenders-next-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc">when it was announced last August</a>, the studio did say that it was "<em>likely</em>" to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2, and that it would be coming to PlayStation "<em>at a later date</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-of-the-colossus-director-fumito-ueda-is-convinced-%E2%80%9Cthe-age-of-game-mechanics-is-over%E2%80%9D.1248855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Game mechanics are the things players are usually talking about when they talk about the gameplay in a video game. Finding fluidity to the mechanics, even introducing new ones, can make a game stand out among the hundreds of games released each year. However, for iconic game director Fumito Ueda, the director behind games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-still-on-the-way-though-financing-isnt-secured-yet/">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, Ico, and The Last Guardian, game mechanics, or new ones, at least, are part of a bygone era of video games.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-age-of-game-mechanics-is-over-claims-shadow-of-the-colossus-director-ueda/">VGC</a>, in an interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250717a">DefamicoGamer</a>, Ueda made the comment while talking about Katamari creator Keita Takahashi's latest game, To a T. "<em>I don’t remember exactly why I replied with a ‘like’ at the time, but I was probably thinking, ‘the era of game mechanics is over. I wonder if we are no longer in the era where we need to provide new devices or new game mechanics every single game."</em> Per VGC, Takahashi claims that Ueda has been spreading this particular gospel for years, specifically since Thatgamecompany's Journey released in 2012.</p>



<p>Ueda added, "<em>Even if the mechanics are not new, you can focus on the feel and art. Whether you like it or not, it’s better to sharpen the existing mechanics."</em> </p>



<p>What qualifies as a 'new' game mechanic is ultimately going to be subjective for players and game developers, but it's difficult not to see Ueda's point when you consider how difficult it can be to introduce something truly new to modern players. Art style, game feel, game narrative, and how fluidly all those elements are woven together are what can make games feel new, even if nothing about the individual parts is new. </p>



<p>Lies of P, for example, is a game that borrows plenty from other games. Customizing weapons isn't a new game mechanic, but how its weapon customization weaves into the rest of the game, in terms of its art, combat, and narrative, all help make the way Lies of P does weapon customization feel new for players.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most significant element of this insight into Ueda's view of modern video games and game making is the fact that we know he's working on a new project. Announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-ico-director-fumito-ueda-new-unnamed-project-revealed-with-a-new-trailer/">The Game Awards</a> last year with an intriguing trailer, this unnamed project already felt like a callback to Shadow of the Colossus, and it'll be interesting to see where else those similarities lie, and how Ueda chooses to sharpen game mechanics in his next game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher No More Robots and developer RageSquid have revealed the release date for upcoming extreme sports game&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>, and, well, it turns out the game isn't so "upcoming" anymore.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is out now for PC and Xbox, and it's also on Game Pass. That's right; the game has been shadowdropped, and you can check it out right now at no extra cost if you're a Game Pass subscriber.</p>

<p>If you're not, the game will set you back $24.99 or your regional equivalent. It's in Early Access right now, which means you're getting just two sports: snowboarding and mountainboarding. Additional sports will, however, be added over time;&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s goal is to become "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need".</p>

Surprise!</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed back when the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/descenders-next-2025-pc" rel="nofollow">was announced last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s first two sports will handle differently from one another as well, so you won't just be getting carbon copies of the same activity at launch (i.e. now).</p>

<p>No More Robots and RageSquid say the goal with&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>was to "deliver the same feel, the same sense of speed [as the original <em>Descenders</em>], but expand beyond mountain biking". As such, the studios emphasized a philosophy of "perfecting the fluidity of numerous sports" for&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>.</p>

<p>According to the two studios,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>already has the same amount of content that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/descenders" rel="nofollow">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Descenders&nbsp;</em>does, and it'll offer a "more natural experience" than the original game's mixture of procedurally-generated stages and hand-crafted levels thanks to its "procedural off-piste mountains that chain together into tight, winding parks and vistas".</p>




<p><em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is out right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/descenders-next-game-preview/9N66JJQFX3RX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> (including Xbox One), and if you're a Game Pass member, you can play it right now at no additional cost as well, although you will need to be on the Ultimate or PC tiers to check it out.</p>

            <p>
I recently took on a garden allotment tenancy for what I now consider the tellingly low rent of £60 a year. Arming myself with some shiny new shears, I visited my little slice of heaven and found it to be a resentful thicket of Guinness cans, sacks of worrying discarded clothing, nettles sturdier than barbed wire, and insects of a kind I have never seen before and never care to again. 
</p>
<p>
At one point I got my foot stuck in a long-abandoned bucket and, while running around in a panic, put my other foot through a red ant nest. It was a lot like playing the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cleanfall">Cleanfall</a>, except that I can't build an airship out of flying jellyfish and flamethrowers and blast this stupid allotment into submission. Mind you, Cleanfall is evidence that an airship made of flying jellyfish and flame throwers will only get you so far.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I wrote up the release of the demo last year, summarising the game SEOishly as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> with a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/carrion">Carrion</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>". I have now played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2769780/view/543361383085903981?l=english">another, updated demo</a>, following the announcement that Cleanfall will enter early access on 8th August, and my summary has narrowed to "side-scrolling Scavenger's Reign".</p>
<p>In Cleanfall, you are a robot who is trying to tunnel to the core of a planet full of wriggly things. Some of the wriggly things are docile, at least before they're provoked. In the opening jungle layer, for example, there are frogs that belch and bobble about in search of edible greenery. How cute! You can even stand on them without pissing them off. But then comes night, and with night comes a sea of glowing red eyes, pouring into the layout from all sides.

<p>
The thing about the red-eyed nightfiends is that at least you know they're hostile. A lot of the organisms in Cleanfall are hard to categorise without risking a confrontation. I've spent a lot of the demo listening to unseen critter calls with a furrowed brow, trying to work out whether "squibleeyahckckckc" means "stay the hell away from my nest" or "where my edible greenery at". The consumable items can be similarly mysterious. What does a "nanite egg" do? Oh, it instantly decomposes the entire cave I'm standing in. I should have kept that one in reserve, probably.
</p>
<p>
The one surety is that you need covering fire, because threats come from all directions. Usefully, the chasms teem with vending machines where you can trade lumps of ore and dead insect for turrets, which secure themselves springily to the terrain when placed. Each night, you hole up somewhere behind a bunch of these automated guns, hoping like hell you've placed enough.
</p>
<p>
Even better, you seek refuge in the skies. See that veiny purple dirigible that idly spits out twirling explosive seedlings? Attach a platform here and some Gatlings there and a rocket thruster here and presto, you have yourself a flying fortress.</p>
<p>The first time I built a flying fortress in Cleanfall, I fell clean out of it. The fortress carried on blasting at creatures on the upper levels, deluging me in crafting materials as I sought a way back up. It made for an efficient farming operation, I guess, but that was before sundown. As the shadows drew close, I consulted my inventory. Hmm, I don't think this "fart bulb" is going to help me much, or at least, not for long enough. I sure could go for a nanite egg right now.
</p>

<p>
Things I haven't mentioned: the newly updated demo has overhauled UI elements and jetpacks for certain character classes. You get three lives, with the ability to ghost around a bit before you respawn: once you've used them all up, you're transported back to the surface by a phantom train. The surface is home to a tall man with a very long nose and a top hat, who professes to be your friend. I'm sure he's nothing to worry about.

Cleanfall is scruffy and unwilling and volatile, all the key components of a good video game in the year of our Lord 2025. I get the sense that, unlike my mutinous and possibly haunted allotment, this one will be a keeper. Let me know if you have any thoughts on the demo and also, if you have any advice about humane ant relocation strategies.

<section><p>With its vast, freeform overworld and thrilling sense of discovery, Link's high-seas adventure offers a preview of the direction Zelda games would eventually take.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Despite its slim lineup so far, Nintendo Switch 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/" data-ref-id="2900-6400">GameCube library</a> already offers some great titles, but the obvious highlight is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/" data-ref-id="5000-3301">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>. Link's seafaring adventure was a daring and imaginative entry at the time of its original release, and while it eventually would be touched up and brought to the Wii U, this marks the first time Nintendo has reissued the game in its original form in over 20 years. What's most stunning when revisiting the game now, however, is its sense of boundless freedom, which offers a glimpse of the freeform direction the Zelda series would eventually embrace with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Though now widely regarded as a classic, The Wind Waker was hotly divisive when it arrived back in 2003. Its sunny, cartoonish visuals in particular stirred up quite a bit of controversy for deviating so dramatically from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1MrzjeR2NY">2000 Zelda tech demo</a>, but the final game was not the radical departure it initially appeared to be. Beneath its unconventional surface, The Wind Waker remains firmly rooted in series traditions. The framework underpinning the adventure is mostly untouched, following the same formula pioneered by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/" data-ref-id="5000-4617">A Link to the Past</a> and later codified by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/" data-ref-id="5000-1272">Ocarina of Time</a>. But despite this, the game manages to carve out some notable changes within this template to completely recolor the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The boldest is the shift in setting. The Wind Waker trades the rolling fields and misty forests of Hyrule for the endless blue waves and sun-bleached islands of the Great Sea. Your journey still follows the familiar contours of previous games; you'll scour the far edges of the world collecting three magical relics, obtaining the Master Sword, and plumbing another handful of dungeons before ultimately confronting the evil Ganon. But the alluring, high-seas backdrop evokes a sense of mystique and adventure that no other Zelda title up to that point could elicit.</p><p dir="ltr">It's out in this vast seascape that we can glean early traces of the open-world direction the series would eventually take. Past Zelda overworlds were similarly expansive and arguably even more varied, but they all felt deliberately curated to an extent. The Hyrule of Ocarina of Time, as awe-inspiring as it was in 1998, was not so much a world as it was a manicured garden, nudging Link along a methodically laid path through interconnected but discrete environments. The game afforded you enough agency to poke around the world for treasure chests and other optional rewards, but it dictated your progress through the main quest by gating access to certain areas of Hyrule until you reached a specific point in the story or acquired a particular item.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4534584-img_6818.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534584" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4534584-img_6818.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534584"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4534584-img_6818.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Great Sea has no such barriers hemming players in. Although the first leg of your journey is deliberately paced, with your progression from island to island guided rather strictly by the demands of the plot, the game opens up considerably by the time you retrieve the Master Sword. There is still a firm narrative thread leading you to your climactic confrontation with Ganon, and many of the islands you come across en route to the final battle can't be thoroughly explored until you've returned with the proper tool. But you're given ample freedom to rove about as you please. Once you've fully acclimated to the rhythms of sea travel--plot a course, conduct the wind, raise your sail, and set off--the game turns you loose, allowing you to indulge your curiosity and explore the Great Sea at your leisure.</p><p dir="ltr">It's much more open-ended than other Zelda games at the time, and the designers take full advantage of this looser structure, encouraging you to venture off the proverbial beaten path with a myriad of enticing diversions. Outside of the main story, your journey is largely guided by whispers and rumors you overhear amid your travels--of an invaluable treasure hidden within a frozen island, or a peculiar traveling merchant who was spotted off of a remote islet, or a cursed ship that stalks the seas when the moon is in a particular phase.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather than explicitly directing you to these points of interest, The Wind Waker piques your curiosity with vague tidbits and hearsay, much in the way Breath of the Wild would eventually present its side quests--not as a series of missions to check off, but as small mysteries waiting to be investigated. Many of these threads ultimately end up being vital to completing the game, but you never get the sense you're being ushered along a predetermined course by the developers; you seek them out because you're intrigued, and you feel a genuine sense of discovery when you follow a breadcrumb trail of rumors to its source.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to this unbound freedom, every trip across the Great Sea evokes a sense of wonder and adventure, especially in the early going. Save for a small handful of premarked islands, your sea chart is completely empty at the start of your journey, and you must gradually fill it in, square by square, as you travel between destinations. Rather than being busywork, however, the act of mapping out the sea further accentuates the feeling of being an explorer. Setting off into uncharted waters and discovering what unusual sights lay beyond the horizon is one of the most thrilling aspects of the game, and the hints and tidbits you hear from the unsettling fish-men who dwell beneath the waves add further color to the world.</p><p dir="ltr">The same holds true for the many islands scattered about the sea. Each square of the map contains some sort of landmass to visit, from small reefs to bustling settlements. Though some of these amount to little more than scenery, many house some kind of treasure or self-contained challenge to overcome, be it a small puzzle to untangle or a gauntlet of enemies to defeat. That you can never quite anticipate what you'll encounter when you set sail makes each island you happen upon feel like a discovery unto itself, and they're an obvious inspiration for the floating sky islands of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/" data-ref-id="5000-43621">Skyward Sword</a> and especially Tears of the Kingdom, which likewise beckon players with enticing challenges to complete or treasures to discover.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4534586-img_6829.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534586" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4534586-img_6829.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534586"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4534586-img_6829.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's in these broad strokes that Wind Waker's influence on future titles is most clearly felt, but the game also presages Breath of the Wild in a number of subtler ways. While its exaggerated cartoon aesthetic would only be revisited by a few handheld entries and spin-offs, cel-shading would become a part of the series' visual identity moving forward, allowing for an even greater degree of expressiveness--particularly in enemy interactions.</p><p dir="ltr">Until this point in the series, the monsters you encountered in Zelda all behaved in fairly rudimentary ways, patrolling set paths and pursuing Link single-mindedly. In crafting The Wind Waker, the designers harnessed GameCube's extra power to make foes not only more intelligent, but more expressive as well. Enemies here behave in surprising and often humorous ways, which in turn makes them feel more alive. The moment of panic that flashes across a Moblin’s face when it drops its weapon in the middle of a fight and quickly scrambles to find another one remains a delight, and Nintendo would further build upon this dynamism with the expressive and resourceful monsters that roam the fields in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">For all of its bold ideas, The Wind Waker does not always match up to its ambitions. As alluring as the Great Sea often is, it can also be sparse and repetitive, the sense of adventure occasionally diminished by too many moments of empty downtime. Nintendo would eventually bring the series back to the familiar, verdant confines of Hyrule, making the Great Sea an outlier among Zelda settings, only revisited in the DS sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-phantom-hourglass/" data-ref-id="5000-26424">Phantom Hourglass</a>. But its freeform spirit survives in the sprawling, open-ended design of Breath of the Wild's Hyrule, which channels the same sense of wonder and discovery that made Link's high-seas adventure such a memorable experience.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> is set to receive a new update on 5th December, adding a third-person mode and New Game+ mode.</p>
<p>The free update will arrive on the third anniversary of the game's launch - and, conveniently, just ahead of the third Avatar film Fire and Ash that's due on 19th December.</p>
<p>The third-person mode will finally allow players to see their Na'vi protagonist, with reworked animations, controls and camera systems, all at the click of a button. The new trailer below shows it in action.</p>

<p>The New Game+ mode will allow players to replay the game with their existing inventory and skills against tougher enemies. A new skill tree and stronger gear will be added to assist.</p>

<p>Other quality of life additions since release include an improved Hunters Guide and a 40fps mode for consoles.</p>

            <p>We've not had the chance to play every <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> game in-depth owing to the sheer volume of them and regrettably, one of the titles we've not been able to look at in depth is Io Interactive's classic Hitman: World of Assassination. That's a bit of a shame as it has a fascinating characteristic - its rendering resolution and performance changes according to how the Switch 2's front-end menus are set, leading to anything up to a 62.5 percent performance increase based on our testing. There's no in-game mention of this and certainly no in-game performance mode and yet there it is.</p>
<p>The story begins with an email I received last month from Harry Mingham: "Hitman: World of Assassination on Switch 2 runs around 30-45 fps around 90 percent of the time. Out of curiosity, I went into the system settings and changed the TV output res from 4K to 720p, went back into the game and found it vastly improves performance. The Hawkes Bay Mission ran at... a very solid and stable frame-rate". In fact, depending on the content, Hitman: World of Assassination can run at up to 60 frames per second with the console set to 720p, dropping into the mid 40s on more demanding scenes.</p>
<p>In putting this to the test, I chose to capture scenes from Paris, Mumbai, Berlin and Whittleton Creek at 720p, 1080p and 4K resolution - as dictated by the Switch front-end. Based on prior testing on other systems, I've found Berlin and Whittleton Creek to be GPU-intensive, while the proliferation of NPCs in Paris and Mumbai may help us to identify areas where Switch 2 may be CPU-limited. The results are intriguing.</p>

<figcaption>Freshly clipped from DF Direct Weekly #223, check out Hitman: World of Assassination compared across various resolutions.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ6Mkwkvyxs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Focusing on Whittleton Creek gives us our biggest frame-rate differentials. 4K averages 46.88fps, rising to 40.45fps with Switch 2 set to 1080p, rising again to 59.93fps at 720p. So, performance increases by 9.7 percent dropping from 4K to 1080p (which sounds a little low), while 720p is 62.5 percent ahead of 4K and 48.2 percent faster than 1080p. So, what's going on? Well, setting the system to 720p seems to be producing a straight 720p image, allowing for a much higher frame-rate.</p>
<p>Things get more interesting at 1080p, however, as the game actually seems to be rendering at a slightly higher resolution, with pixel counts suggesting 1152p to 1188p. Meanwhile, with Switch 2 set to 4K, performance drops but pixel counts are still in the same 1152p/1188p window. The performance drop may be down to upscaling to a higher resolution with an approximate cost of around 2.4ms compared to what we assume is the same content without any upscaling. Maybe the game is using DLSS to upscale, as there are rounded edges where we'd expect to see aliasing. We're looking into this in a little more depth and have also asked Io Interactive for comment.</p>
<p>Moving on to our other test scenes, Berlin delivered similar differences between resolutions - 720p system output resolution is 61 percent faster than 4K, while "1080p" is seven points clear of 4K. This is a slightly more demanding scene than Whittleton Creek with 720p averaging 55.1fps, 1080p at 36.7fps and 4K at 34.26fps.</p>

</div>
<p>In the stages chosen for CPU testing, there's expected behaviour - in scenes crammed with NPCs, the performance differentials between the three graphics modes close up significantly. Certain areas of the Paris stage can still see some wide gaps but as soon as Agent 47 takes his place in the packed fashion show, frame-rates converge somewhat - 42fps at 720p plays 39fps at "1080p" and 35fps at "4K". 720p should be higher but the bottleneck shifts from a GPU limitation to the CPU instead. Frame-rates also close up in Mumbai for similar reasons.</p>
<p>For the end user then, there are a couple of takeaways here: firstly, you can effectively max out frame-rates by dropping to 720p - the main problem being that the very noticeably lower resolution is not exactly a good look for the game. For 4K display owners, you can increase frame rate by around nine percent simply by changing the system menu to 1080p - though it does appear to be at the expense of upscaling. From the Digital Foundry perspective though, the "4K" mode is worth further investigation - since pixel counts seem much the same as the "1080p" mode, we might finally be able to get a grip on the computational cost of DLSS on the Nintendo hybrid.</p>
<p>There is the sense that these resolution/frame-rate shifts are not intended behaviour, however, as what is an effective "performance mode" would be something you'd expect the developer to have as an option in the menus. Game modes being tied to system settings isn't new - PS4 Pro was notorious for different 1080p and 4K modes - but seeing those changes kick in dynamically during gameplay as opposed to just when the game boots is something new for a home console. One of our backers on the DF Supporter Program pointed out that Switch and Switch 2 do this all the time "switching" between docked and portable play, so maybe that's part of the explanation here.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll get some clarification from Io Interactive soon.</p>

<p>BitSummit has once again come and gone, and unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/10-switch-games-weve-played-at-bitsummit-2024-heres-what-we-thought">last year</a> where it was a bit difficult to find indie developers committing to a Nintendo Switch release well before the Switch 2 was announced, we found a renewed enthusiasm for Nintendo as we pursued the two floors BitSummit took over in Kyoto’s Miyako Messe convention center.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitsummit.org/en/">BitSummit</a> is a yearly gaming convention dedicated to not only Japanese indie developers but those from around the world. 2025 marked the 13th iteration which grows larger every year; this time around, they even had <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> composer Nobuo Uematsu make an appearance to perform some of his famous, genre-defining music on the second day.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xlykjo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>But you’re here to read about the games of tomorrow, right? While many indie developers commit only to a Steam release well before even thinking about Nintendo's handheld hybrids, we once again did our due diligence to track down 10 games that you will <em>eventually</em> get to play on a Nintendo Switch.</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="bitsummit-2025-every-switch-1-andamp-2-game-we-played">BitSummit 2025 - Every Switch 1 &amp; 2 Game We Played</h2>
<h3 id="hades-2-2025-switch-1-andamp-2">Hades 2 - 2025 (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</h3>
<figure><a title="Hades 2 Erebus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf20c6a46d531/hades-2-erebus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Supergiant Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay – let’s get the big boy out of the way. At the Nintendo Indie World booth we were intrigued to see three games available to play, the most prominent of them being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii"><strong>Hades 2</strong></a>. We all already know the sequel to one of the best action roguelikes ever made is going to be a great game, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-hades-2-is-a-hell-of-a-time-even-in-early-access">you might have already played it in early access on PC</a>, but you’re likely curious how well it runs on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While we only got our hands on the handheld mode, we’re happy to report it runs at a crisp 60 frames-per-second at what looked like standard 1080p resolution. More importantly, the ghosting effect of the Switch 2’s LCD screen didn’t seem to have much of an impact on the frenetic action.</p>
<p>Our experience playing through the entire Erebus region right up until just before the boss encounter against Headmistress Hecate was smooth as butter, and we can’t wait to play more of it when Hades 2 comes to the Switch 2 at the same time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/hades-2-full-release-is-getting-close-as-development-enters-final-phase">it leaves early access</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pico-park-2-plus-mouse-stage-out-now-mouse-mode-coming-soon-switch-2">Pico Park 2 + Mouse Stage - Out Now / Mouse Mode coming soon (Switch 2)</h3>
<figure><a title="Pico Park 2 Mouse Level" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/90b4a906bd5f3/pico-park-2-mouse-level.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: TECOPARK</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another game at the Indie World booth was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pico_park_2"><strong>Pico Park 2</strong></a>, the sequel to the 2019 cooperative puzzle-action game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pico_park"><strong>Pico Park</strong></a>, and while it’s out already, we got to play four unreleased levels exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 that utilized the Joy-Con 2’s mouse mode. We’re not being hyperbolic when we say it was the most delightfully chaotic fun we had at BitSummit and perhaps the best use of the mouse mode we’ve seen yet.</p>
<p>You see, of the three other teammates we had to solve these puzzles with, two of them only spoke Japanese. We had to press down on the R Bumper and move the Joy-Con in order to aim our different colored Pico’s distance and trajectory. Once we released the R Bumper, our Picos would go flying across the stage; as this was our only method of movement, hilarity ensued as we timed pressing switches and flying into obstacles that matched our individual Picos’ color without knocking each other into pits.</p>
<p>Language barriers aside, we managed to clear three of the four difficult stages, and came away thoroughly interested in trying out more exclusive Pico Park 2 levels with the mouse controls.</p>
<h3 id="obakeidoro-2-summer-2025-switch-2">Obakeidoro 2 - Summer 2025 (Switch 2)</h3>
<figure><a title="Obakeidoro 2 Capture" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/46565d8dd5ba2/obakeidoro-2-capture.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Freestyle Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Obakeidoro 2</strong> was also at the Nintendo Indie World booth, we sat down with the developers and seven other players to get the full experience of this asymmetrical party game where you take control of either monster ghost girls or the chibi humans they’re trying to capture.</p>
<p>Each match lasts only three minutes as the six chibi humans dash about a haunted mansion, stunning the monsters with their lanterns and avoiding pitfalls and other obstacles as they try not to get captured. The two chibi monsters – ours was riding a little toilet – can phase through walls, grabbing humans and throwing them into a little jail in the middle of the map.</p>
<p>The uncaptured humans, however, can hit several locks hidden throughout the map to free their friends. We played as the monsters first and despite our best efforts, the humans freed their friends several times, though we managed to eke out a heart-pounding victory in the dying seconds.</p>
<p>We then played as the humans and got captured several times; however, by utilizing team up moves one of our allies was able to throw our chibi schoolgirl across a gap in order to reach a final lock to free our friends, giving an easy win and a taste at some hidden depth to this anime-inspired party game.</p>
<h3 id="ratatan-tba-switch-1">Ratatan - TBA (Switch 1)</h3>
<figure><a title="Ratatan Stage" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e1c35a7ae08a5/ratatan-stage.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ratata Arts</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, we got our hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ratatan"><strong>Ratatan</strong></a>, the spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay"><strong>Patapon</strong></a>, which was actually announced during BitSummit 2023 and took home this year’s Vermilion Gate Award, which is awarded to the title that delighted with innovation and intuitive design more than any other.</p>
<p>And we don’t disagree with the BitSummit judges one bit for choosing Ratatan. Fans of Patapon will feel right at home with the rhythm-based gameplay of Ratatan, as you control one of several music-loving gremlin creatures called – wouldn’t you know it – Ratatans that, in turn, use music to motivate their little armies of Cobuns to attack and defend with charming beats.</p>
<p>This time around, Patapon and Ratatan creator Hiroyuki Kotani has seamlessly weaved in roguelike elements after each stage that greatly change how you play against opposing armies and massive boss monsters. We chose the guitar-wielding hedgehog Harigittan and played through the tutorial. While it took us a few minutes to get the hang of playing to a beat, before-long we were taking down castles full of adorable little foes while bobbing our head along to the catchy beats.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to seeing more of Ratatan and the roguelike elements as it launches on Steam Early Access on <strong>25th July</strong>, though there’s no sign of a Switch release date yet.</p>

<h3 id="bashful-adoration-2027-consoles-tbc">Bashful Adoration - 2027 (Consoles TBC)</h3>
<figure><a title="Bashful Adoration Payload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9e6d0805b19dc/bashful-adoration-payload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: KittyWumpas</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of party games, we also sat down with KittyWumpas, an up-and-coming studio out of New Zealand, and their witch-themed 3D platformer packed full of multiplayer party modes titled <strong>Bashful Adoration</strong>.</p>
<p>The game stars four witches that are absolutely enamored with a boy named Merlin. They bicker for his affection in cute little scenes played out between 3D platforming stages filled with collectibles and baddies to whack with brooms, hearkening back similar games you might’ve played on a Nintendo 64 or something more modern like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/a_hat_in_time"><strong>A Hat In Time</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It also features more multiplayer party modes that we could keep track of, including one inspired by <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a></strong> and a deathmatch-type mode with <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Super Smash Bros.</a></strong>-like percentage build up. These percentages were also seen in the one multiplayer mode we did play: a payload tug-of-war where the payload was none other than Merlin himself.</p>
<p>Taking control of your favorite of the four witches, standing near the love-potioned Merlin will have him slowly float toward your base; however, your rival witches can fly on by and whack you away. The higher your percentage, the farther you’ll fly and bounce around the map.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to seeing more of Bashful Adoration leading up to its expected 2027 release.</p>
<h3 id="lovish-2025-consoles-tbc">Lovish - 2025 (Consoles TBC)</h3>
<figure><a title="Lovish Level" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14da1e8af4084/lovish-level.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: LABS Works</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Back in 2021, we reviewed a charming retro-inspired Metroidvania titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/astalon_tears_of_the_earth"><strong>Astalon: Tears of the Earth</strong></a> by developer LABS Works. At BitSummit they showcased another title called <strong>Lovish</strong>, though this time around it’s a 2D action platformer that takes place in bite-sized rooms with over 150 random events that can occur and greatly change each playthrough.</p>
<p>You take control of the cute little Sir Solomon on his quest to save Princess Tsuna from the Devil Lord. He originally started his quest with some companions but worried Princess Tsuna might fancy them instead of him after being rescued; as a result, he ditched them and set off to rescue her on his own.</p>
<p>We played through about a dozen levels and defeated one boss, greatly enjoying the great retro soundtrack and tight platforming while hunting for Secret Crowns hidden in each. After each level, increasingly absurd events occurred: we unlocked a shop to purchase upgrades like a double jump that allowed us to re-explore past levels, but later found a cryptic message that told us to avoid collecting coins in stage 4-2 in order to summon a space wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Lovish</strong> is all the right levels of absurd and perfect for some handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switches.</p>

<h3 id="sacrifire-2026-switch-1-andamp-2">SacriFire - 2026 (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</h3>
<figure><a title="SacriFire Random Battle" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51537464324bb/sacrifire-random-battle.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Pixelated Milk</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polish developer Pixelated Milk pitched <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sacrifire">SacriFire</a></strong> to us as <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/vagrant_story">Vagrant Story</a></strong> meets <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/superhot"><strong>Superhot</strong></a>, and while that didn’t make any sense to us at first, it did after playing the lengthy demo. We gave them the benefit of the doubt as we reviewed their previous title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/regalia_of_men_and_monarchs_-_royal_edition"><strong>Regalia: Of Men and Monarchs - Royal Edition Review</strong></a> well.</p>
<p>In SacriFire, you take control of a newly appointed Bishop named Ezekiel. On the day he becomes one, some thieves attack their chapel and steal a box that contains within it all evil. Ezekiel and the other Bishops give chase through simple platforming levels packed full of enemies.</p>
<p>When we ran into an enemy, we warped to a battle screen where an action gauge filled to allow us to attack and cast spells; however, the true genius of SacriFire’s combat system comes from how if we stopped moving, our enemies and their attacks – including projectiles – stopped as well, just like in Superhot, giving us time to strategize how to take them down.</p>
<p>We’re very keen to see more of SacriFire and this unique battle system when it comes to the Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.</p>

<h3 id="neverway-tba-consoles-tbc">Neverway - TBA (Consoles TBC)</h3>
<figure><a title="Neverway Crafting" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1b1e05d2adf9/neverway-crafting.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Coldblood Inc</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While not officially announced for either Switch console yet, we’re giving <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318330/Neverway/">Neverway</a></strong> a slight pass because the development team behind it – Coldblood Inc. – assured us that a Switch release is the eventual goal, and we think their darker take on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley"><strong>Stardew Valley</strong></a>-like farm sim would be absolutely perfect to play on either handheld hybrid.</p>
<p>We sat down with the developer to play through two different demos: a story-focused snippet and a short combat tutorial.</p>
<p>For the former, we took control of Fiona as her life spirals out of control: she loses her job, her boyfriend breaks up with her, and she can hardly get out of bed. As a helpful little status icon indicated to us, she begins to disassociate on the way home from picking up her work belongings; during, a girl on the train says she can make Fiona’s problems fade away before some creepy spidery creature threatens to pull Fiona into an abyss.</p>
<p>Jumping to an island Fiona moves to in order to get away from it all, she heads to her new home and unpack her stuff, passing by the houses of named residents that she will get to date while you presumably help her farm her way out of her depression – or become the immortal herald of a dead god? We’re not quite sure yet. The combat tutorial highlighted a healthy dash of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past"><strong>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</strong></a> inspiration as we looted a hookshot to cross gaps and swung a sword to take out waves of floating skull monsters.</p>
<p>We’re excited to see more Neverway – and to eventually learn of an official Switch release date.</p>
<h3 id="earth-atlantis-2-tba-consoles-tbc"><strong>Earth Atlantis 2 - TBA (Consoles TBC)</strong></h3>
<figure><a title="Earth Atlantis 2 Boss Fight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fbb962df74aa1/earth-atlantis-2-boss-fight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Pixel Perfex</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We had a lot of great things to say about the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earth_atlantis#overview"><strong>Earth Atlantis</strong></a>, a unique, underwater take on a shoot ‘em up with a striking sepia color palette. Developer Pixel Perfex returned to BitSummit to showcase <strong>Earth Atlantis 2</strong>, which plays like a more realized version of the original with a gorgeous submerged world full of color and powerful underwater monsters to take on.</p>
<p>During our time with the demo, we explored what looked like an underwater Egypt in our little yellow submarine, shooting various aquatic monsters to loot power-ups that gave us the extra missiles or bombs you’d see in any number of schmups inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/gradius"><strong>Gradius</strong></a><strong>.</strong> However, Earth Atlantis 2 takes a much more as you can explore at your leisure as you seek out fair-but-difficult bosses.</p>
<p>The boss we took on was an ancient megalodon with a rocky layer of armor that, when we shot it enough, broke off to reveal a weak point. Even then, the developer helped us out by granting us extra health to get us through the difficult encounter that typically would take several tries to overcome. Once defeated, a new part of the map was revealed and we could continue onward.</p>
<p>Pixel Perfex promised more than 20 unique bosses to take on and more gorgeous underwater environments that we’re looking forward to exploring.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:72023 @ 1753113706 -->
<h3 id="earthion-september-2025-switch-1">Earthion - September 2025 (Switch 1)</h3>
<figure><a title="Earthion Boss Fight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f596fc0461a0e/earthion-boss-fight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ancient</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There was another shoot ‘em up that caught our attention, and it was a much more traditional one. <strong>Earthion</strong>, you see, is not only being developed by Ancient Corp – a studio founded by renowned composer Yuzo Koshiro – it’s being developed on 16 bit hardware so it truly looks and sounds the part.</p>
<p>That said, from the slick way the starship you control flips into battle at the start of each stage, to how the story presents the starship pilot Azusa Takanashi from a lower angle like she’s in a <strong>Gundam</strong> anime, Earthion feels like it takes 16-bit presentation to the next level, which has us interested in seeing more than that of the small sliver of the first level that we played at BitSummit.</p>
<p>As a classic horizontal-moving shmup, fans of the genre will be right at home here; while the demo we played wasn’t <em>too</em> difficult, we saw the potential for white-knuckle bullet-hell in the later stages along with a promised challenge mode that will undoubtedly cause some thrown controllers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait a bit longer to play <strong>Earthion</strong> on Switch; it comes to PC on 31st July, though it's been pushed back to September for consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 OLED model may have already been prototyped, as the alleged mid-frame of this system is available for purchase on a Chinese marketplace.</p>



<p>As spotted on the Gaming Leaks subreddit, a user on Xianyu, China's largest second hadn marketplace, is selling the <a href="https://www.goofish.com/item?id=949354611120&amp;spm=widle.12011849.copy.detail&amp;ut_sk=1.Z%2FH%2FPLIumhgDABcsA9HPUVaQ_21407387_1753096684884.copy.detail.949354611120.2219551622872">midframes</a> of an<a href="https://www.goofish.com/item?id=949406620126&amp;spm=widle.12011849.copy.detail&amp;ut_sk=1.Z%2FH%2FPLIumhgDABcsA9HPUVaQ_21407387_1753096684884.copy.detail.949406620126.2219551622872"> alleged Nintendo Switch 2 OLED model</a>, which have been <a href="https://www.goofish.com/item?id=949005279175&amp;spm=widle.12011849.copy.detail&amp;ut_sk=1.Z%2FH%2FPLIumhgDABcsA9HPUVaQ_21407387_1753096684884.copy.detail.949005279175.2219551622872">produced in 2024 </a>as a production sample, and are identical to that of the launch model with the exception of lettering on the side and the silver and white color of two of the midframes on sale. While there's nothing that indicates if these are really a production sample for a future Nintendo Switch 2 OLED model, the user has a lot of items on sale that are likely sourced from production factories, such as blank PlayStation 5 PCBs, spare original Switch and Switch 2 parts and more, so there's the chance that these shells are still legit, even if they are not meant for an OLED model. At the very least, they could indicate that more color variants for the new generation Nintendo system are being prototyped and could be coming at a later date.</p>



<p>Although an OLED display would bring some issues, especially for VRR, the Nintendo Switch 2 would greatly benefit from a better display, as the one featured in the launch model leaves much to be desired. Shortly after launch, it became evident that the display's quality is below average, has disappointing HDR support, and is worse than its predecessor's display in terms of motion quality. As Nintendo is likely aware of these issues, seeing a new model with a better display launch only a few years after the original model wouldn't be surprising.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update 2.3 dropped last week, delivering a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">bunch of new ways</a> to spice up your dystopian drives and more additions to possibly the most in-depth photo mode a game's ever had. CD Projekt also added in the ability for you to dismiss the freeroam ridealong Johnny Silverhand they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-now-scan-and-steal-paint-jobs-from-any-car-in-cyberpunk-2077-plus-more-customisation-with-the-22-update">added in previously</a>.</p>
<p>As someone who finds cyberKeanu a bit more grating at times than is socially acceptable, I was pleased. However, over the weekend a modder's released something that might tempt me into bringing him back, if only so V can respond to being told off for crashing by sarkily calling ol'Reevsey mum.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22694?tab=description">Responsive V</a>, and it's the work of MisterChedda. They've dug into V's voicelines, both used and unused, to give you a bunch of extra animated reactions to incidents that often happen when you're freely roaming around Night City. You know, the likes of bumping into a pedestrian, which now might cause V to wheel around, give them the finger and also say the rude word the finger means, just to add insult to injury.</p>
<p>These reactions vary in intensity, and apply to everything from nicking cars, to having MaxTac or Newatch rock up, and your vehicle ending up either exploded or in the sea. I assume that last one makes you go 'Aw shucks, what am I like?', while every nearby NPC says 'Who else but V?'.</p>

<p>By far the most important reaction the mod adds is the ability to quick clap back at Silverhand if he's spawned in your passenger seat, and you happen to drive in a fashion that triggers one of his six or so lines telling you to not drive so badly. All you can do in the base game is suffer in silence if the man dishes out one of these critiques, and while patch 2.3 does now let you employ the nuclear option of banishing him back into your skull for a couple of days, having a quick back-and-forth as the mod allows is a far superior solution.</p>
<p>It's not a full conversation, so you don't have to worry about being further distracted from your wheelwork by Silverhand getting into a rant about the deep philosophy involved in remembering to brake when you take a corner. It's just a nice little jab exchange that'll make Johnny feel a bit more like a proper passenger, rather than a moody Woody doll whose pull string gets yanked when you wreck your Aerondight.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the mod a go and having V respond 'All right, mom' next time they hit a tree, you'll need to make sure you've got the Phantom Liberty DLC, plus these requirements: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">redscript</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4885">Mod Settings</a>. The latter allows Responsive V to have its own in-game menu where you can tweak what'll solicit one of these extra reactions to your liking.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-23-lets-you-ditch-ridealong-keanu-reeves-but-i-raise-you-responding-to-his-driving-critiques-via-this-mod]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After reliving some old-school rivalries with last year's Intellivision-themed DLC, Atari 50 is welcoming another classic contemporary through its interactive museum doors. Namco's legendary line-up of retro titles (or a few of them at least) are arriving in new DLC soon.
</p>
<p>
Atari 50's Namco Legendary Pack introduces an all-new interactive timeline focusing on the Japanese publisher's classic output, exploring the history of its games on Atari hardware through video interviews, archival materials, documents, and photos from the era.
</p>
<p>
And you'd better be a Pac-Man fan! Atari 50's Namco Legendary Pack includes three versions of the classic ball-gobbler - Pac-Man 2600, 5200, and Atari 8-bit, specifically - marking "the first ever re-release of these games for consoles."

<p>
On top of that, you've got US arcade versions of Dig Dug and Xevious ("developed by Namco in Japan and originally released by Atari, re-released in this form for the first time ever"), plus home console versions of Galaga, Xevious, Galaxian, and Dig Dug.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release date for all this yet, but it's coming to Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch "soon". And if you've yet to sample Atari 50's retro delights, last year saw the release of a standalone Expanded Edition, combining the already hugely generous base game and its Wider World of Atari DLC into a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-all-19-retro-games-coming-in-atari-50s-paid-the-first-console-war-dlc">single bundle featuring 150+ titles</a>.
