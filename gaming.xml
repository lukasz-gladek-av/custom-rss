			<p>In December 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/"><strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> announced it had voted for wall-to-wall union representation</a> under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/"><strong>CWA Canada</strong>,</a> with <strong>61</strong> of the studio's <strong>71</strong> employees joining <strong>Local 30111 </strong>alongside <strong><a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">Bethesda Game Studios Montreal</a></strong>. Not even three weeks later, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/"><strong>shutting down the studio and laying off all 71 workers</strong></a>, denying that the shutdown had anything to do with the majority of its staff unionizing.</p>



<p>In response, the CWA Canada said it would "<em></em><em>pursue every legal recourse to ensure that the rights of these workers are respected and not infringed in any way</em>." That process has seemingly begun, as the media union has <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2026/01/13/union-files-labour-board-complaint-over-ubisoft-halifax-shutdown/">filed an official complaint with the <strong>Nova Scotia Labour Board</strong></a> over the closure, and today, the union expressed further outrage after learning that Ubisoft was given <strong>nearly $1 billion CAD in tax credit subsidies</strong> in the last five years alone while operating in Nova Scotia.</p>



<p>Provincial and state governments will often offer companies tax breaks as incentives to establish a base of operations in their state or province, and in the case of Ubisoft, the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> company has quite the history of taking advantage of these breaks to establish what have become some of its most important offices. </p>



<p><strong>Ubisoft Montreal</strong>, for example, was first set up due to Quebec having attractive tax incentives. If not for those incentives driving Ubisoft to open a studio in Montreal, the city may not have grown into the incredible hub of game development it is today, with scores of talented developers calling Montreal their home.</p>



<p>While Halifax hasn't grown as a game development hub in the same way that Montreal did, as CWA Canada president Carmel Smyth pointed out when the union filed its complaint, "<em>Ubisoft took $12 million in taxpayer money from the government of Nova Scotia to nurture a generation of talent, and to build a tech industry. Now it’s walking away without so much as an apology</em>."</p>



<p>Once the union dug through French Senate documents to see just how much of a tax break the company was receiving, it not only found that Ubisoft had received more tax breaks from Canada than any other country, but also that in the last five years, it had received hundreds of millions in tax credits.</p>



<p>"<em>According to the documents, Ubisoft got 605.6 million Euros (about C$980 million at today’s exchange rates) in tax credits from Canadian governments from 2020 through 2024</em>," CWA Canada writes in a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s outrageous that a company can take hundreds of millions in tax breaks – public money – and then shut down an operation and lay off workers</em>," added Smyth. "<em>And it’s shocking that governments allow it to happen</em>. <em>We need immediate changes to hold companies to account. The rules must make it clear that if you close or significantly downsize a business, you must pay back any government subsidies.</em>"</p>



<p>CWA Canada is also holding to its accusation that Ubisoft shut down the Halifax studio "<em>to keep out the union</em>." While Ubisoft denies that the shutdown had anything to do with the studio unionizing, CWA Canada notes that if the shutdown had been planned as Ubisoft claims, it wouldn't have caught the staff entirely by surprise as it did, and that Ubisoft has yet to provide evidence proving the shutdown was a decision made through "<em>financial necessity</em>."</p>



<p>Since the shutdown was announced, legal and public pressure from the CWA Canada has already pushed Ubisoft to <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2026/01/12/ubisoft-agrees-to-reconsider-compensation-for-laid-off-halifax-workers-amid-union-public-pressure/">consider raising the severance offered to the 71 workers laid off from the Halifax studio</a>. While that may be all the union is able to get out of this, the pressure applied here, specifically regarding how Canada and its provincial governments approach tax incentives, could create significant change down the line.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-reading-5-at-a-time">Patrick Recommends: Reading 5% at a Time</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jingdachen?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Jingda Chen</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>I read a lot. I also do not read very often. It depends on your definition of "reading." Because while I spend much of my day on the internet and, inevitably, countless hours reading words, that's not what I'd really call "reading," you know?</p><p>What's the last book I read? A short story collection by Stephen King. The last book before that? Stephen King's <em>Revival</em>, which I have to say was a real banger. But reading does not come in fits and starts for me, it's just been altogether dead once I moved to San Francisco in my early 20s and my career started taking off. Playing video games for a living has consumed all the time I'd used for reading.</p><p>Well, 20ish years later, I'm trying to change that. In a Rob-coded fashion, I tried to kickstart things by buying a new device. In this case, it's just a boring Kindle. Maybe a different E Ink reader will make sense once I've become a regular reader, but it seemed to make the most sense to just get my goddamn foot in the door. And while the charm of a new device was enough to boost me through half of the first book I nabbed, <em>Wake Up and Open Your Eyes </em>by Clay McLeod Chapman, the Kindle entered a dormant start of slowly losing a charge on my side of the couch.</p><p>Reading, like anything, can become a habit. To become a habit, though, requires work. You need to make it part of a routine, so that it feels weird <em>not</em> to do it. (My body genuinely feels <em>off</em>, for example, when I don't work out after two days.) The method came up with, ultimately, was one born out of a little bit of annoyance.</p><p>While reading, I hated seeing the page number, percentage number, or "hours left to read" taunting me at the bottom. I realize that turning a page in a physical book is, <em>obviously</em>, going to reveal how close you are to to the end, but I found it distracting to watch that number click up while I was reading. (I feel a similar anxiety while running on a treadmill—always checking the numbers. Similarly, how I checked the clock at work when I was a teenager.) I found a way to flip this off (you just have to click it a few times), but then it dawned on me: maybe this was the way to turn this into a habit. What if I decided to read a set amount each night?</p><p>I set an arbitrary number: five-percent every night. At five-percent, you drop stop once you've finished the chapter. It adds up to a few chapters during every session.</p><p>Folks, I love this. I still turn off the percentage <em>while</em> I'm reading, but every 15 minutes or so I'll check in and see how close I am to the end. Not because I'm excited to stop reading, mind you, but because I'm excited to see if I can bust through the goal before I need to be asleep. It's exhilarating to have a night where I hit 10-percent, which is now happening pretty regularly when I fire up the Kindle.</p><p>This helped me blast though the second half of <em>Wake Up and Open Your Eyes</em>, despite loathing the book. I'm having a way better time with <em>The Ruins</em> by Scott Smith, a recommendation from my colleague and friend Kirk Hamilton. Between some combination of <em>The Ruins </em>being a far superior book and a few weeks of doing my five-percent rule, it's clear I'm already going to move past my soft goal of reading one book per month in 2026. I'll become a reader yet, one percent at time.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-brent-hull-snarky-woodworker-builder">Rob Recommends: Brent Hull, Snarky Woodworker / Builder</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@heyquilia?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Kenny Eliason</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>MK and I watch increasing amounts of architecture and home design stuff and find our tastes getting further and further into the weeds as home improvement becomes a more practical hobby. Yet how-to videos are generally kind of boring, so we still like a fair bit of criticism or theory to accompany practical advice or demonstration. Enter Brent Hull, who came to our attention via this bit of absolute catnip.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvHCvwwc8xw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Why Brent hates McMansions. There are at least 3 things missing."></iframe></figure><p>McMansions are easy targets, but what striking here is the fact that this guy is a builder in greater Dallas area and he is absolutely shit-talking a peer who has built McMansions to this one particular template that he finds aesthetically, intellectually, and morally repulsive. You can tell this is the product of twenty or thirty years of stewing over a hack's ugly incompetence.</p><p>His channel isn't always this acerbic. In fact, for the most part, his channel is dedicated to really educational analysis of homebuilding techniques for things like windows and cabinetry and how those have evolved in the building trade over the years. Along the way, he's also justifying what is doubtless the extremely expensive service that he provides to clients, and explaining why his way is the right way despite the sticker shock that comes with it.</p><p>But as someone who will never be working with him or able to afford services like his, it's still neat to see someone who knows what they are talking about put words and illustrations to feelings a lot of us have. We all know there are certain tics that you find again and again in places built in the 2000s that make them feel poorly-made, but it's hard to put you finger on if you don't work in the trades. What reads as solid and durable versus cheap and temporary? What is good as opposed to what is merely expensive? This is a channel that sheds light on a lot of that stuff in ways that will help the kind of person who suddenly finds themselves with the need replace their windows, or to know what they can expect if they start getting into the bones of an older home.</p><hr><h3 id="chia-recommends-the-chair-company">Chia Recommends: <em>The Chair Company</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Photograph by Sarah Shatz/HBO</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tim Robinson’s comedy is polarizing, I feel like everyone I know either loves his work or hates it with very little in between. I personally really enjoyed <em>I Think You Should Leave</em>, so seeing his face pop up on HBO Max one night while my family was considering what to watch next was a pleasant surprise. My previous experience with his work could have never prepared me for what we were about to watch that fateful night.</p><p><em>The Chair Company </em>sees Tim Robinson’s particularly cringe-inducing comedy applied to a workplace drama, and it’s fully unlike anything I have watched before. I don’t particularly think I can get into too many other specifics of the show because it’s so delightfully <em>weird</em> that I think any attempted description of its plot points would do a disservice to the work.Just know that Tim Robinson plays the main character Ron, who becomes obsessed with a chair’s manufacturer after one of their chairs falls apart under him during a work presentation. I fully spent half of the show’s eight episode runtime unsure what, if anything, was <em>real</em> within the diegetic space of the show, and I loved every second of it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photograph by Sarah Shatz/HBO</span></figcaption></figure><p>My partner did not particularly like <em>I Think You Should Leave</em>, and was only really convinced to come along on this journey because she had heard the buzz around the show. And while at first blush it might seem like the show is just an extended <em>ITYSL </em>skit, and that<em> </em>Tim is playing the same character that he always does in his shows, it becomes pretty quickly apparent that the context that character is being put in this time is very different. The friction there is where the real sauce of the show exists, and why I think that if you, like my partner, have initially dismissed <em>The Chair Company</em> because you didn’t like <em>ITYSL</em>, you should give it a shot. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Plenty of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>fans and engineers have created working Pokédexes complete with image recognition to let you scan toys and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolution-art-characters-raichu-2000659297"><span>art to identify your favorite monsters</span></a><span>. BigRig Creates and Mr. Volt have taken this a step further, creating what they’re calling the “World’s Smartest” Pokédex, capable of not only recognizing Pokémon, but giving you data about them from the games, acting as a voice assistant, and much more.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrVolt"><span>Mr. Volt</span></a><span> is planning to release a video about the hardware side of things at some point in the future, but BigRig Creates has already put out a 13-minute rundown of how he accomplished all the image recognition and data dumps, and recreated a voice that sounds similar to the original anime’s Pokédex.</span></p>

  <p><span>Much of the coding under the hood draws from the </span><a href="https://pokemondb.net/"><span>Pokémon Database</span></a><span>, which includes lengthy Pokédex entries for all 1025 monsters, complete with stats, learnable attacks, locations in each game, and more. So now, the World’s Smartest dex can tell you pretty much anything you need to know about a Pokémon just by scanning an image of it. The device uses a reverse Google image search to name whatever monster you’re pointing it at, and it can identify anything from plushies to fan art.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The voice, however, needed some tweaking, so BigRig Creates used his own voice to create an AI text-to-speech voice model that sounded closer to the original but didn’t rip the lines from the show. He says this was in an effort to use the tech to make something “ethical” and “homegrown” rather than training it on the performances of actors Nick Stellate and Eric Stuart from the anime.</span></p>

 <p><span>Seeing the completed dex in action is pretty impressive. It correctly identifies several Pokémon, including a Ditto disguised as a Poipole, from toys, plushes, and some hastily drawn Remoraid fan art. It couldn’t quite wrap its head around a Spinda Labubu, though. No tech is perfect, I suppose.</span></p>

<p>The situation surrounding the recent closure of Ubisoft Halifax continues to get messier. Just one day after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/union-files-legal-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-studio-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing a legal complaint</a> with the Nova Scotia Labor Board, CWA Canada, the union representing 61 of the 71 employees let go by Ubisoft, revealed that they met with the company on Wednesday.</p>



<p>However, the meeting, they say, resulted in no progress.</p>







<h2 id="h-cwa-says-ubisoft-came-without-documents">CWA Says Ubisoft Came Without Documents</h2>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, CWA President Carmel Smyth said that the meeting on Wednesday morning was “disappointing”</p>



<p><strong>“Ubisoft came to the table with nothing,”</strong> she said. <strong>“No documentation proving financial distress, and no plan to find work at other Ubisoft operations or&nbsp;increase severance.”</strong></p>



<p>She added that they brought up the concern of those being out on parental leave being told that they wouldn’t qualify for the proposed two-month severance pay. But, instead of any progress towards a solution, Ubisoft reportedly told the union they will send their ideas on Friday.</p>







<p><strong>“It was frustrating,”</strong> Smyth said. <strong>“Their lack of preparation along with the fact that they gave no advance notice of the closure, makes us question their intentions and their commitment to treating people fairly.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We continue demanding real information, and to get the answers and the compensation you deserve after 10 years with this company.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the statements on the meeting, the union sent a release claiming that Ubisoft received nearly $1 billion (C$980 million) in government tax credit subsidies from 2020 through 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment on where things stand and its view on the meeting. As of writing, multiple requests have gone unanswered. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

And a year and a half later, I get a call: 'Hey, you remember Fallout?' 'No.' ‘Well, there's a second one.' I go, 'Why?' 'Because the first one went through the f***ing roof.' I go, 'Really? Cool.' Do the second one, and then a year later the third, fourth, and now it's like a whole brand. I didn't see that coming."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Perlman is the narrator of Fallout, he’s never actually played a Fallout character before. At least, that's what he says. "I've never been in the game,” he insisted. “I just did a couple lines and, you know, got my $40 and my sandwich and went home." Did he forget he voiced Butch Harris, Far Go Traders caravan leader, in Fallout 1 as well as the intro?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tim Cain, one of the chief creators of the original Fallout, has spoken about Perlman’s role in the games before. Posting on <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/71191-i-have-some-questions-for-tim-cain/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Obsidian forums</a> back in 2015, Cain said he wrote the intro to Fallout, including the “war never changes” line, and described Perlman as “a great narrator,” adding: “He managed to sound decisive and sad at the same time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">$40 and a sandwich in hand, Perlman went on to play roles in a number of video games, including Lord Hood in Halo 2 and Halo 3. And the same year Fallout 1 came out, Alien Resurrection, in which he played mercenary Johner, hit theaters, helping Perlman reach new heights. Perhaps his most iconic film role, however, is the much-loved Hellboy, which came out in 2004.</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Steve Granitz/FilmMagic.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But Switch 2 owners will still have to wait for their upgrade.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Good morning, everyone! If you, like me, popped open Animal Crossing: New Horizons before work today for a stroll around your island, you were greeted with a pleasant surprise: the 3.0 update just dropped a day early, and the Hotel is officially open for business, along with a number of other new features.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094155-01keyjjhxjycpqjsqms7yw51wd-1768413480987.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The meat of Animal Crossing: New Horizon 3.0 is a hotel that will set up on your island at the end of your pier, wherever that's located for you. Just download the update (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/How_to_Update_Your_Game_Manually_(And_Access_3.0_Update_Early!)">make sure you actually download it</a> - there was a system update this morning as well for me and I almost missed it!) and it should be there waiting for you if you're a returning player who put some time into your island already. It seems likely there is at least one other requirement for the hotel to show up that prevents it from being there for new players, but we're still working out just what that is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hotel works a lot like the Happy Home DLC: you'll be asked to decorate different rooms in it based on themes you're given from Leilani. However, unlike the DLC, the catalog is the limit on what all you can put in these rooms. Though you're given a list of recommended items if you need help, apart from that, any item you've ever collected (via DIY, purchase, gift, or whatever) is available for use in the hotel, as many times as you want.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094158-01keyjk03cyqky0ghkjr25m58t-1768413494594.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Whenever you finish a room, it will become available for guests to stay in. This is a great way to meet other villagers you don't have living on your island at the moment, as they'll come stay and share cute and unique dialogue. You'll also be given Hotel Tickets, which you can spend at the souvenir shop for unique decor newly added to the game that you can use in your own house or elsewhere on the island.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094200-01keyjkq7z95ztxng8btr3mfwh-1768413506058.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, outside the hotel, Tom Nook will invite you to use a box outside the hotel where you'll be asked to craft certain DIY items to help promote your island elsewhere. Completing these requests will get you more Hotel Tickets to spend on more items. And, by the way, DIY crafting is easier than ever now that bulk crafting and crafting using ingredients from storage has been enabled with the new update.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094202-01keyjm2a1htprtb650pcpnwfr-1768413518148.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to all this, there are several other new additions: There's tons of new furniture available both via the Souvenir Shop and the Nook Shopping app, including a bunch of LEGO items and classic game systems that you can use to activate games using Nintendo Switch Online from within Animal Crossing. Dream Worlds are now active, and let you build and decorate up to three Dream Islands either alone or with friends. And the new Zelda and Splatoon-themed amiibo villagers and themed items are available if you scan their amiibo.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094216-01keyjmwxmkzmjc2etw8zwdp33-1768413534295.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, as of 1/14/2026, there are still a few new features you'll have to wait for. Because while the 3.0 content update is now live, the Nintendo Switch 2 paid update feature isn't available until tomorrow. So everything that comes with that update: improved graphics, 12-person multiplayer, the Megaphone item, and so forth, that's not in the game just yet. But it will be soon, just hang in there one more day!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got a comprehensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">guide to the 3.0 update</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/Kappns_Family_Hotel_-_How_to_Unlock_and_Guide">how to unlock everything</a> and what's included, as a part of our Animal Crossing: New Horizons Wiki guide.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Cory in the House. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cory-in-the-house">Disney Cory in the House</a>, a 2008 tie-in game for Nintendo DS, looks set to be crowned the best game of all time on Metacritic in the near future — by user ratings, at least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obscure adventure title already boasts a 9.3 user score average, enough to lift it higher than The Last of Us, Half-Life 2, Baldur's Gate 3, and Resident Evil 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Across all 5,984 games tracked by Metacritic, the title now ranks in joint second, level with The Witcher 3. Only last year's beloved role-player <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> (which boasts a user score average of 9.6) stands above it. So, what is going on — and is Disney Corey in the House really that good?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/51fsalnnol-ac-uf10001000-ql80-1768412403914.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"This game changed me forever" - a Metacritic user. Image credit: Metacritic/Disney.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, no, Disney Cory in the House is of course a very bad game — at least according to the two professional reviews tracked by Metacritic. One of these was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/04/25/cory-in-the-house-review">written by IGN</a>, which scored it as an "awful" 3/10 and reported the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has some of the clunkiest controls we've seen, the presentation is insultingly stupid, the minigames are hardly games at all, and on top of everything it's really short." With a summary like that, 3/10 almost feels generous — but perhaps the fact it was all over quickly was an advantage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compare this to the flood of 10/10 scores pouring in from Metacritic's users, and the difference is stark. "This game ultimately changed my perspective on life and made me a better person," wrote one user, DinoDino316, in a review posted today. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game has changed me forever," wrote Moguel, in another review posted within the past 24 hours. "Each day after the sun rises and before it sets I thank God wholeheartedly for the conception of Cory in the House."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why are users suddenly falling in love with an almost 20-year-old game based on a short-lived spin-off from Disney series That's So Raven? Well, they're not — but the game and the show it's based on has long been an internet meme. Users on notorious internet imageboard 4chan previously fuelled periodic surges in interest for the game on GameFAQs and Amazon going back over a decade. Even Metacritic has been targeted by a similar campaign before, with the game reaching a 9.7 user rating back in 2013. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all nothing new, then, though it will be interesting to see if Metacritic itself takes any action to normalize Disney Cory on the House's rankings this time around. IGN has contacted the company for comment. In the meantime, this is another example of how Metacritic's user rating scores can easily be manipulated by an online crowd — even if, this time around, it's not to review bomb something it doesn't like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Metacritic/Disney.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p><em>Civilization VII</em> launched to mixed reception in early 2025. We liked it when we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/civilization-vii-review-a-major-overhaul-solves-civs-oldest-problems/">reviewed</a> it at Ars, despite some notable shortcomings in terms of polish and user interface, and it has a decent community of dedicated players. However, it makes enormous changes to the classic series’ formula, drawing ideas from competitors like <em>Humankind</em>. Many players feel it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/civilization-vii-one-month-later-the-community-and-developers-chime-in/">strayed too far</a>, and there are still some frustrations with the user interface not showing enough information to players.</p>
<p>It has gotten a steady stream of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/civilization-vii-patch-lets-you-turn-off-some-controversial-new-features/">updates</a> since launch, though, and 2K seems committed to continuing to release content and patches.</p>
<p>This version of <em>Civilization VII</em> is expected to launch on February 5, and it will run on iPhone, Mac, and iPad. There’s no mention of Apple TV, and the App Store page specifically notes that Intel Macs aren’t supported, so you’ll need an M1 or later Mac.</p>
<p>Apple also announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/popular-pc-franchise-civilization-comes-to-apple-arcade-on-february-5/">a few other Arcade releases</a> coming on February 5, including <em>Felicity’s Door</em> and <em>I Love Hue Too+</em>. There will also be Retrocade, a digital arcade that includes <em>Asteroids</em>, <em>Bubble Bobble</em>, <em>Centipede</em>, <em>Galaga</em>, and others. Notably, Retrocade will get a Vision Pro release that will let players play on simulated cabinets in a 3D virtual arcade space.</p>

                <p>Just as the NFL playoffs heat up, Nintendo has announced that Madden NFL 26 will be available to try for free from January 15 through January 21 for Nintendo Switch Online members.</p><p>It's the full game, not a limited slice of it, that Switch 2 owners can play for the duration of the free period. All save data will carry forward if players buy the full game. Additionally, Madden NFL 26 is 60% off through January 25, bringing the price down from $70 to $28.</p><h2><strong>Madden NFL 26 free on Switch 2 times</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Starts:</strong> January 15 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET</li><li><strong>Ends:</strong> January 21 at 11:59 PM PT / 2:59 AM ET (January 22)</li></ul><p>Madden NFL 26 launched in August 2025 and has sold very well.

The latter series isn't released on Switch or Switch 2, however.</p><p>The Divisional round of the NFL playoffs begins this Saturday and run through Sunday, before the Conference Championships the following weekend. There will be a week off, and then Super Bowl LX takes place on Sunday, February 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.</p>

            <p>
Right at the end of last year, Cyberpunk and Witcher developer CD Projekt Red sold off its game distribution company to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński (who is also the co-founder of CD Projekt itself, so, go figure). With this sort of new owner, the plan is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">generally to stick to what it knows best</a>, i.e. sprucing up old games and making sure any game on the platform is DRM-free. But in a new interview, Kiciński also shared his interest in the platform doing some publishing.
</p>
<p>
Kiciński shared as such with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">Eurogamer</a>, explaining that he is also "co-owner of an indie game publishing company called Retrovibe. So one of the directions which were not that much possible in the past is evolving GOG more into publishing business, and that's something we will certainly discuss." One thing he did stress is that a formal decision on such a thing hasn't been made yet, but "this opens a whole new area of activities for GOG which was not that much possible together with CD Projekt Red as one group, because at CD Projekt Red, all publishing activities were connected with their own games, and they didn't want to spread attention into some other topics."
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that such a future is far off, as Kiciński only technically officially started his role as sole head of the company on January 8th, noting that the current priority is that GOG improves on what it currently does. "We also discussed that there is no need for any pivots or changes in philosophy or something like that," he said. "GOG has a very special place on the market, very unique values, very loyal customers, and we appreciate that, and we want to build up on that, not changing too much."
</p>
<p>
I am not personally sure that this feels like a good way forward. I can envision a world where a game GOG publishes gets priority treatment on the homepage over one that doesn't and that is an icky future if you ask me. Luckily, as Kiciński says, no decisions have been made, so hopefully a lot of thought gets put into this first.

            <guid>1406170</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>‘s</em> Season One Reloaded update hit the game on all platforms and added a lot of <em>Fallout</em>-themed content as well as some new multiplayer maps. One of these, Meltdown, is now at the center of some online shouting as some fans find the cleaner, more realistic version of the map in&nbsp;<em>7</em> inferior to the OG one first seen in <em>Black Ops 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On January 9, <em>BLOPS7</em>‘s big new update added a lot to the online shooter. For <em>Fallout</em> fans, there’s a lot of content ripped right from the TV show on Amazon, including cosmetic skins based on the Ghoul and other characters. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2026/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-season-01-reloaded#Maps">You can read the full blog post here</a> to see the impressive amount of new stuff that Activision has shoved into<em> Black Ops 7.</em></p>

 <p>But what has a lot of people online talking is the new map, Meltdown. This map, set inside a nuclear power plant facility, was extremely popular in the original <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em> back in 2012 on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC, where I spent many hours playing it. So naturally, I was excited for its return in <em>BLOPS7</em>. But, well, this ain’t exactly the same Meltdown from 14 years ago.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Made a full yt video about the Meltdown graphics downgrade thing I've been seeing everyone talk about.<a href="https://t.co/aTe4jPQjmZ">https://t.co/aTe4jPQjmZ</a></p> <p>But TL;DW — I'm mostly fine with the lighting/color changes. I think it just looks too clean. <a href="https://t.co/ZalIsAvQjS">pic.twitter.com/ZalIsAvQjS</a></p> <p>— Replay Mode (@ReplayModeYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReplayModeYT/status/2011190255412457838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This new remastered version of Meltdown features “updated visuals” and “dynamic lighting,” according to Activision. But, as seen in a comparison video posted online by YouTuber Replay Mode, the updated visuals seem to be cleaner and less grungy, with textures and props that are missing many of the old details like puddles, signs, exposed wiring, chainlink fencing, and warning decals.</p>

 <p>Replay Mode wasn’t the only person to notice this. <a href="https://www.threads.com/@dexerto/post/DTb11ZFDP1-/a-call-of-duty-fan-compared-how-meltdown-looks-in-black-ops-and-black-ops-via">If you look online</a>, <a href="https://x.com/itsHunterTV/status/2010914954690641981">you can spot</a> many people posting comparisons on social media of <em>Black Ops 7′</em>s version of Meltdown and the older original version of the map.</p> <p>In the comments, there are plenty of people arguing that the older map looks better, pointing out the fancier sky box and messier aesthetic. Meanwhile, other players say the new map looks better and provides better visibility.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Black ops 7 vs Black ops 2 .. <a href="https://t.co/MBsiDXWeJu">pic.twitter.com/MBsiDXWeJu</a></p> <p>— 1S Ghofy (@Ghofys) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghofys/status/2010553685479207178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“How do you take a nuclear power plant and somehow make it look even more drab and lifeless?” asked one player.</p> <p>“Incredible how they’ve just completely sucked all the vibe and life out of the current <em>Call Of Duty</em> games. At least Zombies in <em>BO7</em> has some personality,” posted a person on Twitter.</p>

 <p>“The time of day makes the BO2 version look better, even though BO7 is most likely pushing far greater tech,” commented a player on Threads.</p> <p>“The fact that a 2012 game has better graphics is unbelievable,” said an upset fan.</p>

 <p>“Although&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;has better fidelity, I think&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2′</em>s version has a better art direction by miles.&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> feels and looks so hollow,” posted another player on Twitter.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The map still plays well, but idk how they could look at the new map and not realize the lighting and skyboxes are is a downgrade. Shadows are very harsh in BO7 compared to BO2 as well <a href="https://t.co/kxxoyR27PP">pic.twitter.com/kxxoyR27PP</a></p> <p>— MrGoldenGamer (@MrGoldenGamerr) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrGoldenGamerr/status/2010931109757141272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>From what I can tell, the map changes made to Meltdown seem to be focused entirely on making it easier to spot enemies and react to threats. The old map features lots of walls that contain extra details and dark colors, which look nice but add extra clutter. These kinds of details can sometimes make it harder to spot an enemy player, so I can understand Treyarch removing them. Valve has made similar changes to old and new <em>Counter-Strike</em> maps over the years, too.</p> <p>Still, it does feel like the developer has picked clarity and esports balance over vibes and art style, and while I get that in 2026 many players demand perfectly balanced games with all the rough edges sanded down to keep things even, I think this “downgrade” is a good example of how we lose a lot in the pursuit of making everything fair.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-shutdown-month-after-launch/</link>
            <guid>1406167</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you were interested in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-mod-is-now-live-in-ealy-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently released</a> Bully Online mod, hopefully you were able to check it out because it’s been shutdown. </p>



<p>In a Discord post, it was announced that the Bully Online project was ending development and being taken offline “forever”. That means the server is offline, the source code has been taken down, and all account data will be deleted, among other steps. </p>







<p>As far as why it’s being taken offline, that wasn’t revealed. However, it was promised that Swegta, the Youtuber leading the project, will cover everything “in more detail” in a video about it.</p>



<p>“For now though, know this was not something we wanted,” <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the announcement</a> reads.</p>



<p>Bully Online was a mod that was officially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-announced-huge-catch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in October</a> and released in mid-December. It featured free roam, custom vehicles, role playing, and over 60 mini games for players to enjoy with others around the world. The mod was also released as an open-source project, allowing anyone with the skills and ability to add to it overtime. </p>



<p>Unfortunately for fans, however, that’s all come to an immediate stop and the <a href="https://swegta.com/online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website to view</a> the mod is now offline.</p>







<p>As mentioned, it’s not clear, as of now, what the reasons behind the shutdown are. That said, it could be assumed that it has something to do with the developers of the original game, Rockstar.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will add to this story once an official update on why the project was ended is made available. Until then, leave your thoughts down in the comments on Bully Online being shutdown, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

			<p>American indie developer and publisher ProbablyMonsters released their first game, Storm Lancers, on Nintendo Switch 2 (and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store) last month after an earlier debut on Nintendo Switch in September 2025. The game is priced at $19.99, and existing Nintendo Switch users can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for free.</p>



<p>We've sent a list of questions to the team focused on the recent launch and the studio as a whole. In their answers, they described Nintendo's new platform as <strong>the perfect home for their Storm Lancers game</strong>, especially with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-update-20-0-0-adds-virtual-game-cards-gameshare-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>GameShare</strong> feature</a>. The team also revealed that while they are open to using AI tools for 'assisting with administrative work' and 'automating repetitive technical tasks', their games are made 'by people, for people' and <strong>do not use AI for asset creation or creative decisions</strong>. Scroll down to read their replies in full.</p>

<p><strong>What can you tell us about ProbablyMonsters?</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>ProbablyMonsters is an independent game publisher and developer focused on building a better way to make games and build careers in games. With offices in Fort Worth, TX and Bellevue, WA, <strong>our team of AAA industry veterans is built with a unique structure that allows us to develop multiple games of different scales at the same time.</strong> We are committed to developing and releasing multiple high-quality PC and console titles each year, which we started last year with our debut titles Storm Lancers and Ire: A Prologue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Can you introduce us to your recently released game, Storm Lancers?</strong></p>



<p>Storm Lancers is an <strong>action rogue-like</strong> that combines <strong>retro 80’s aesthetics</strong> with intense combat, while introducing a new twist to the fan-favorite rogue-like genre: <strong>couch co-op</strong>. After you and a friend crash-land on a dying alien world with unstable magic, you work together to unleash new powers, carve through evolving hordes, and grow even stronger. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While it can be played solo, Storm Lancers was designed with two player co-op in mind and <strong>utilizes GameShare on Nintendo Switch 2 and Remote Play Together on Steam</strong> to allow players to partner up even if only one of them owns a copy of the game. Adding co-op into a rogue-like was a fun and exciting challenge for our development team, and we hope players have enjoyed becoming true legends of Cryptica together.</p>



<p><strong>What was the reaction so far? Is there any early feedback from the community that you can address here already? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The reaction to Storm Lancers has been positive overall, and players are fans of our two-player co-op feature, the game’s vibrant art style, and its responsive controls. As Storm Lancers is our first title, we built it at a more limited size and scope to help us get our feet wet, and we’ve received some feedback that people wish there was more of the game to play. In our minds, this is great feedback because it signals that players resonate with the experience we’ve created and are really having fun, which was our primary goal with Storm Lancers.</p>



<p>We have also heard that some players are experiencing performance issues in the recently released Steam version of the game, and we are hard at work on a patch to address these. This will be released in the next few weeks so keep an eye on Discord and X for the patch announcement.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you choose Nintendo's platforms as the first consoles to get Storm Lancers? Do you plan to launch it on PlayStation and/or Xbox later?</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo has been a great partner for us, and <strong>Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 are the perfect home for a co-op title that players can enjoy at home or on the go.</strong> We made a conscious decision early on to build Storm Lancers so that it could be played with a single Joy-Con controller, which makes it as easy as possible for players to bring a friend along for the adventure. Nintendo offered us an opportunity to be featured back in their Nintendo Direct presentation last September, which was the perfect place to stealth-launch the title.</p>



<p><strong>We do not currently have plans to launch Storm Lancers on PlayStation or Xbox consoles</strong> and will let our fans know if this changes. Our primary focus is growing our audience on Steam and supporting the Nintendo of Europe release of the Switch 2 version on January 22nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>I understand Storm Lancers supports the GameShare feature. What do you think of it, and why is it so important for your game? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We built Storm Lancers to truly shine in co-op, and <strong>GameShare gives us a unique path to building a couch co-op like experience for players who live apart</strong>. Being able to see the same screen and play on the same copy of the game creates a truly seamless experience, and so we were excited when we first saw Nintendo’s announcement of the new feature. As players, <strong>we think it offers massive value for households and friends who want to play together</strong>, and as a self-publisher, we see GameShare as a great tool for helping us promote Storm Lancers organically.</p>



<p><strong>Was it hard to implement GameShare? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Implementing GameShare into Storm Lancers was very easy, and our small but mighty engineering team was able to get it fully implemented and released in just over a month. The tech is incredible, and it is a great, quick solution to building online multiplayer capabilities without developing new features from the ground up.</p>



<p><strong>Beyond GameShare, what do you think of the Switch 2 as a whole? Does this version offer any noticeable improvements over the Switch 1?</strong></p>



<p>We at ProbablyMonsters are big fans of Nintendo Switch 2 and are excited that the more powerful hardware will allow us to be more ambitious with the art pipelines, performance, and fidelity of our games. Seeing Storm Lancers in 4K resolution with 60FPS performance was truly something special, and we’re happy that Nintendo Switch 2 lets us experience that.</p>



<p><strong>The Switch 2's HDR feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has often been criticized</a>. Do you think that's fair?</strong></p>



<p>We have seen criticisms of HDR on Nintendo Switch 2, but from a development perspective, we never encountered any issues working with it and think Storm Lancers looks awesome with the expanded range of colors. Consumers always have a right to criticize the technology they purchase when it does not work as intended or live up to their expectations, but that feedback is for them to provide. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You also launched another game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3547420/Ire_A_Prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ire: A Prologue</a> in October. That's a very different, horror-inspired experience. Are you going to build upon it to deliver a full-fledged horror game? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We have <strong>several titles in development for release over the next couple of years and are building games in a broad range of genres that will help us reach every type of player.</strong> We will have more to say about some of them in the coming months.</p>



<p><strong>As a small developer, what is your policy on AI usage in game development? Do you believe we're going toward a future where it is inevitable?</strong></p>



<p>We have <strong>several titles in development for release over the next couple of years and are building games in a broad range of genres that will help us reach every type of player.</strong> We will have more to say about some of them in the coming months.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ori series developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/">Moon Studios</a></strong> has just released a new gameplay trailer for its action RPG currently in early access, <strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong>. The title is due to receive a major update a little more than a week from the time of this writing with its <strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong> update, officially adding <strong>co-op</strong> to the game.</p>



<p>Players could have already tried the update while it was in <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-updates-launches-january-22-2026/">beta for a weekend at the end of 2025</a>, but starting next week on <strong>January 22, 2026,</strong> it'll be live for all players. This new update"<em>reimagines traditional co-op multiplayer play of current ARPGs and MMORPGS," </em>writes Moon Studios in a press release<em>, "allowing up to <strong>four players </strong>to share a free, persistent Realm without the need for a host to be online.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked Together | Co-op | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RmTU-DbFOd4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>All four players get to share the rewards they earn from combat, while enemies will react differently when you have three friends on your side, all trying to corner them. You'll also be able to work with your friends outside of combat as well, as you can share and build housing, fish, and seemingly experience the whole game with three of your friends by your side.</p>



<p>The 'Together' update is the first major update of 2026 for No Rest for the Wicked, which launched in early access nearly two years ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/">April 18, 2024</a>.</strong> There's currently no exact timeline for when the game will hit its <strong>1.0 launch</strong>, but speculation from players does point to it potentially arriving sometime in 2026. We'll see how the year goes for Moon Studios, though, with co-op due to arrive in the game soon, it does seem like the community could be right with its 2026 guess.</p>

            <p>
It is not news to anyone that Nightdive Studios' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake took a while to make. The remake started development in 2015, with a successful Kickstarter project held for it the following year. After a few engine changes and attempts at making the thing, it finally released back in 2023, a good eight years after development had started. But such a long wait is absolutely not worth calling the FBI over, folks, are we being serious right now? Which is, apparently, a thing that happened to Nightdive.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/system-shock-remake-lead-couldnt-sleep-due-to-the-mass-vitriol-from-fans-reported-to-the-irs-fb/">FRVR</a>, game director Stephen Kick spoke of the stress that came from working on the project and the large swathe of vitriolic comments targeted directly at him. "That was a really rough point in my life," Kick explained. "I took a lot of that very personally because we had built up a considerable amount of just community respect and admiration, so much so that many people were willing to risk a not-insignificant amount of money on a project that I knew we were capable of doing."
</p>
<p>
It wasn't just some comments left on the game's Kickstarter page or across the studio's social pages. Kick notes that he "was threatened with lawsuits, any matter of things you could do to somebody." He explained further, "We got reported to the IRS and the FBI. It was awful. There was probably a good month and a half where I could not sleep at night because of the weight of everything that had some down on the company."
</p>
<p>
Now, I don't know about you, but I'm really not sure a video game you're excited about is worth calling the FBI over. Right? Am I the one who's lost their marbles here? In any case, even if it took a while, the System Shock remake did come out, and RPS contributor Jeremy Peel even gave it the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">coveted RPS Bestest Bests award</a>. So, it seems like the wait was probably worth it!

            <p>If you've ever wanted to spend somewhere in the region of $67/£50 to turn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> into a fishing simulator, today's your lucky day. <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update">Rockstar-partnered GTA roleplaying server operators</a> Cfx.re - the folks behind FiveM and RedM - have launched the Cfx Marketplace, a store where you can buy a bunch of GTA roleplaying mods, some of which are free and some of which seem pretty damn expensive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to its <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289">announcement post</a>, the Cfx Marketplace is designed to server as "a curated digital storefront where talented FiveM/RedM creators can share and sell their work. Featuring purchasable props, scripts, maps, and much more, there’s something for every server and every player." So, something along the lines of Bethesda's various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creation-club-is-bethesdas-alternative-to-paid-mods">Creations/Bethesda.net initiatives</a>, where modders' works are hosted somewhere that has the official seal of approval, rather than third-party modding sites.</p>
<p>Let's see what you can grab to trick out your GTA 5 experience he...wait. It'll cost me how much to turn GTA into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a>? $67.19, which is just under £50, for modder Lixeiro Charmoso's <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7222299-trucker-simulator">Trucker Simulator</a>. To be fair, it's clearly a detailed truck simming experience and getting such things running on a GTA roleplaying server probably isn't easy, but as someone who's not familiar with GTA roleplaying mod prices, woof. For context, the base version of ETS2 will set you back £16.89 assuming you don't buy it in a sale. It's currently in such a sale, lowering the price to £4.22/$4.99. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a>, meanwhile, is exactly the same price sans DLC.</p>
<p>A GTA roleplaying mod which turns the game <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7222309-fishing-simulator">into a fishing simulator</a> will set you back the same price as the truck sim mod, while a <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7219969-drugs-bundle">bundle</a> by another modder which allows you to manufacture meth, cocaine and weed runs to $131.99/around £98 altogether. That said, there are some less expensive or free mods on the store too, such as one that gives <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6715119-lc-fuel">every car realistic fuel consumption</a>, so you have to stop to fill up regularly.</p><p>On the one hand, you'd hope that buying these from a Rockstar-affiliated store would at least guarantee you getting the bang for your buck you're promised, something a payment made to a third-party site or random person in a Discord server doesn't necessarily provide absolute security of. On the other, those prices aren't cheap, and it's rather ironic to see Rockstar/Take-Two's relative about-face after years of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">warring</a> with various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike">GTA</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-responds-to-grand-theft-auto-mod-ban-complaint/">modders</a> end up in something like this.</p>
<p>That's not to mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-gta-6-devs-suffer-setback-in-legal-fight-against-rockstar-as-uk-court-denies-request-for-interim-relief">the other elephant in the room</a> at the moment when it comes to whether you might be open to spending cash on a service backed by the company behind GTA 6, even if it's not clear how much of a cut - if any - said company get from Cfx Marketplace purchases.</p>

              <p><span>After four years of development, the launch of an open beta for </span><i><span>KYBER</span></i><span>, a community-hosted multiplayer game launcher for EA’s </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II,</span></i><span> is proving to be a hit with the same fans who </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-2017-best-selling-game-may-2025-1851785893"><span>desperately campaigned</span></a><span> for EA to start making </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront III </span></i><span>last year.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>In June 2025, EA’s </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> received an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-andor-sequel-steam-ps5-cheap-1851784922"><span>unprecedented uptick</span></a><span> in players on Steam. Having previously peaked at an all-time player count of 10,489 in January 2021, </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> more than tripled this figure with an all-time peak of 35,892, thanks in part to a bargain bin sale price of $5 at the time.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The sudden surge in player count was attributed to a fan campaign on Reddit by members of the r/StarWarsBattlefront community, following the success of </span><i><span>Andor’s </span></i><span>second season. The community’s goal was simple; they wanted to convince EA and Disney that a potential </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront III </span></i><span>sequel would be a success.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">At KYBER, we like pineapple on our pizza🍍🍕</p> <p>In other news, Star Wars Battlefront 2 got its first content update of 2026 on PC, and you can play it right now!</p> <p>Go to the website in our bio to play KYBER for free 🎮 <a href="https://t.co/csAqDU6e2t">https://t.co/csAqDU6e2t</a> <a href="https://t.co/Cb4AErk3D1">pic.twitter.com/Cb4AErk3D1</a></p> <p>— KYBER: Battlefront II Custom Servers (@KyberServers) <a href="https://twitter.com/KyberServers/status/2011111218514178553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The community’s plea seemingly went ignored, as neither EA nor <em>Star Wars</em> rights holders Disney have expressed any intention to develop a new multiplayer shooter. Obviously, it was never going to be that simple, but the attention did seemingly galvanize Armchair Developers, the team behind </span><a href="https://kyber.gg/"><i><span>KYBER: Battlefront II</span></i></a><span>, into action.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Although </span><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>had already been in development for several years before this point, the project’s community manager, Ethan Clark, </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-battlefront-2-kyber-resurgence-day/"><span>revealed that the team</span></a><span> “worked nonstop all week, doing our best to help the content and mod creation communities fire on all cylinders” following the success of the May 24th “Resurgence Day” </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> campaign.</span></p>

 <h2><em>Battlefront 2</em> with more guns and classes</h2> <p><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>is an “all-in-one launcher” for </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> that adds a wealth of player-requested features to the game, including proximity voice chat, a spectator mode, and even fully integrated Discord support. Of course, the real draw here is the newly added characters and the expanded mod support, </span><a href="https://screenrant.com/kyber-star-wars-battlefront-mod/"><span>including the likes of</span></a> <i><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor’s </span></i><span>Cal Kestis and </span><i><span>Star Wars: The Clone Wars’</span></i><span> Asajj Ventress.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The open beta for </span><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>started on December 20 and, according to a post from the </span><a href="https://x.com/KyberServers/status/2003468237728628963?s=20"><span>official KyberServers team account</span></a><span>, resulted in “61,169 unique players” and “1,339,489 sessions” within the first 48 hours of its release. Unsurprisingly, the r/StarWarsBattlefield community </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ptxtyo/kyber_has_been_a_huge_success/"><span>also seems thrilled</span></a><span> with how the player test has been going. </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ptxtyo/comment/nvl1pod/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>As one user</span></a><span> on the subreddit explained, “it’s like</span><i><span> Battlefront 2</span></i><span> but with more classes, guns, some balance changes too.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The open beta doesn’t seem to have a hard end date yet, and Armchair Developers announced that they have big plans for the project down the line. </span><a href="https://kyber.gg/news/kyber-open-beta-free-on-pc-20-december/"><span>They’ve promised</span></a><span> that the source code for </span><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>“will be made available to the public” later this month, and that further balance patches are already in the works. </span><span>It’s not quite </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront III</span></i><span> yet, but with a couple of extra characters and a few more new maps, it certainly could be. Hopefully someone at EA or Disney is paying attention.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hytale First Impressions: Move Over Minecraft, There’s a New King in Town]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-first-impressions/</link>
            <guid>1406095</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a long and winding road through development, which saw plenty of bumps along the way, Hytale is now in the hands of gamers around the world, and the first impressions are encouraging.</p>



<p>Hypixel Studios warned players before they jumped in that Hytale is still very much in an early access stage, with bugs and issues likely to be encountered, but, actually, my experience so far has seen no such problems. In fact, the release, so far, has been smoother than many full releases I’ve played in the past.</p>



<p>While it’s still very early in Hytale’s progression, and there’s plenty of changes to come in the future, the early impressions have blown me away, and I genuinely think that Minecraft could finally be knocked from its perch.</p>

<p>The similarities with Minecraft are obvious, which should be no surprise given the game began as a modded server in the Mojang title, but as soon as I started to get to grips with the world around me, I quickly discovered that Hytale has a bunch of features players have been calling for in Minecraft for years.</p>



<p>When crafting, materials are pulled from nearby storage. It’s easy to stack and sort items in inventories quickly, and chopping a block out of a tree results in everything above it collapsing, which means there’s no annoying, floating blocks of leaves scattered across your world.</p>



<p>Those minor quality-of-life differences may not mean much to new players in the genre, but for those who have played Minecraft since the early days, it’s chalk and cheddar. However, this merely scratches the surface of what makes Hytale so impressive.</p>



<p>The world of Hytale is stunning, with star-filled skies bursting with colors and an environment that has more wildlife than a small zoo. From mice to bears, deer to foxes, Hytale feels alive, and it took me a moment to realise that yes, this was the base game, and I hadn’t downloaded any additional mods to increase the variety of wildlife around me.</p>



<p>Enemy-wise, there’s also a fair amount of variety, and I’ve been able to continue my hard work at nighttime in the game, safe from any threat of a horde of skeletons wandering onto my doorstep or a Creeper popping over to say hello and destroying all my hard work. While some may prefer a more threatening approach, I’ve found it to be the ideal balance for my playstyle.</p>

<p>The one thing I still can’t quite get my head around is the fact that we’re still in the very early stages of the game, and there’s much more on the horizon, including from Hypixel Studios and from all the talented modders who will look to add their own spin on the game.</p>



<p>Hytale’s modding support essentially gives creators a canvas to create whatever they want using the same tools that the game has been built with, opening the door to endless possibilities, and Hypixel itself has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed plans for additional content</a>, including proximity chat and new biomes to explore.</p>



<p>Updates are certain to come thick and fast during early access, and the game will continue to get even better. Considering the bar has already been set very high, it’s an encouraging sign, and the fact that as little as $19.99 can get you into the game right now is a breath of fresh air in a world where prices for games are going sky high.</p>



<p>It’s still very early days, but I’m already prepared to make a pretty firm prediction that I’m highly unlikely to ever play Minecraft again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best ARC Raiders Meta Guns—Tier List, Explained]]></title>

            <guid>1406092</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders offers some real variety with its weaponry, and it’s tough to fit all 21 guns into a tier list. However, some of the best guns are undeniably more meta than others.</p>







<p>In an extraction shooter like ARC Raiders, that’s no surprise, as a large gameplay incentive is to head out on raids in search of better gear and loot. After all, stumbling across a Bobcat is naturally more exciting than finding a Hairpin, but the lines begin to blur when different guns suit different purposes. </p>



<p>If you’re heading out on a raid and can’t decide which gear to take with you, then this guide has you covered. Here are the nine best guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-biggest-arc-raiders-features-we-want-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as well as the complete ARC Raiders meta guns tier list. </p>







<p>Before delving into the list, it’s important to note that ARC Raiders has a strong variety of weaponry, and some simply suit very specific circumstances. The Hullcracker, for example, is an ARC killing machine, but you’ll be signing your own death warrant if you try to use it for PvP.</p>



<p>With that in mind, this list includes guns that are generally better than the rest in as many situations as possible—PvP, PvE, and everything in between.</p>



<h3 id="h-anvil">Anvil</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A monstrous hand cannon. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where better to start than with the Anvil? This hand cannon is arguably the <strong>best gun</strong> in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-insider-gaming-community-best-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, for a whole host of reasons: It’s available fairly early in the game, relatively cheap to craft and upgrade, and it hits raiders and ARC like a truck.</p>



<p>As if that wasn’t enough, the gun is reasonably effective at all ranges, though it works best during mid-range gunfights. It’s great to open fights with before charging in with a full-auto weapon, but if you prefer to play PvE, then it’s perfect to take down any ARC the game could throw your way. </p>



<h3 id="h-stitcher">Stitcher</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Basically a grey Bobcat. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Stitcher is one of the first guns you’ll encounter in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-tv-show-and-movie-ideas-being-pitched-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, but probably one of the last you’ll put down. It’s one of the cheapest guns to craft, and you don’t even need to look for a blueprint.  </p>



<p>Don’t let its cheap price fool you, though—the Stitcher packs a mean punch. You’ll find that it can hold its own against the most kitted-out raiders topside has to offer, but it doesn’t hurt to give it a light mag if you have one spare. </p>



<h3 id="h-tempest">Tempest</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The best assault rifle. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re looking for an old-fashioned Assault Rifle, then you’ll want to get your hands on a Tempest. This Epic-rarity weapon is one of the most reliable guns you can find in ARC Raiders. </p>



<p>It boasts some solid damage output, a very respectable magazine size, and even strong ARC Armor Penetration. That being said, due to its Medium Ammo usage, it’s best used against enemy raiders, but if some ARC happen to have you in a pinch, the Tempest can more than do a job. </p>



<h3 id="h-il-toro">Il Toro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A cheap close-range shotty. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Simply put, Il Toro is one of the strongest guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-million-arc-raiders-players-wiped-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> purely because it is a shotgun. It doesn’t matter if its range is shorter than most or if it can be slow to fire compared to the likes of the Volcano; the fact of the matter is that at close range, Il Toro is king.</p>



<p>If you’re a raider who enjoys the PvP life, you’ve probably used one before, but if you haven’t, get your hands on one now. They’re incredibly cheap to craft, and it’s one of the easier Blueprints to get your hands on. </p>



<h3 id="h-kettle">Kettle</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The free loadout king. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>People seem to love or hate the Kettle, but it’s a little more nuanced than that. This single-fire Assault Rifle is again one of the earliest guns you’ll get in ARC Raiders, but at face value, it has low damage output, a very slow reload, and not even the best accuracy.</p>







<p>So why is it one of the best guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-pvp-heavy-map-just-got-more-intense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, then? Well, it can be fired fast, very fast. Although it’s not full-auto, the bullets will fire pretty much as quickly as you can pull the trigger, meaning it can even outclass some SMGs at close range. If you’re running a free loadout and get a Kettle, know that it’s the best chance you have of making it back to Speranza.</p>



<h3 id="h-renegade">Renegade</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The best long-range weapon in the game. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-is-offering-a-free-gift-for-crossing-12-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> isn’t all about close-range, as sometimes it’s best to keep your distance. If you find yourself picking enemies off from afar, then there’s no better gun to do it with than the Renegade. </p>



<p>Unlike the Ferro, the Renegade is a bolt-action Rifle that stores more than one bullet in the chamber, meaning you can rattle off shots one after another with ease. It might do less damage than other Rifles in the game, but that fire rate more than makes up for it.</p>



<h3 id="h-bobcat">Bobcat</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A handheld shredder. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Of all the guns on the list, the Bobcat is probably the most sought-after. The Epic-rarity SMG is pretty much just a souped-up Stitcher, with its improved fire-rate being the key difference. </p>



<p>Of course, there’s the elephant in the room—finding its Blueprint. Given its rarity, you’ll have to put a bit of work into making the gun a regular in your Stash, but if you’re interested in dominating PvP, then it’s well worth the effort.</p>



<h3 id="h-volcano">Volcano</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A semi-auto beast. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you enjoy Il Toro, then you’ll love the Volcano. For all of the former’s shortcomings, the Volcano makes up for them. A quicker fire-rate and higher damage make the semi-automatic Shotgun the champion of close-range combat.</p>



<p>However, there’s one major caveat—get a magazine mod on it as soon as possible. Thanks to the increased fire-rate and the base magazine size of four, you’ll find the barrel running dry much quicker than you’d like.</p>



<h3 id="h-venator">Venator</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The only downside is its magazine size. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’re probably seeing a Pistol and doubting that it’s one of the best guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trigger-nade-nerf-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, but it’s here for very good reason. The Venator is a favourite for many raiders out there, and for good reason, too.</p>



<p>This lightweight Pistol packs a serious punch, both thanks to its semi-auto fire-rate and due to the fact that it fires two bullets per trigger press. With that in mind, it melts through ammo, so you’ll want a fair bit of Medium Ammo in your pack. Level this bad boy up to Rank 4—you’ll never look back.</p>



<h2 id="h-complete-arc-raiders-guns-tier-list-all-guns-ranked">Complete ARC Raiders Guns Tier List—All Guns, Ranked</h2>



<p><strong>There are 21 guns in ARC Raiders right now, but only five of them make it into the S-Tier ranking. </strong></p>



<p>Here is the complete ARC Raiders gun tier list, with S representing the best in class, and D showcasing the downright rotten.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Tier</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Gun Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">S</td><td data-align="center">Anvil<br>Venator<br>Renegade<br>Bobcat<br>Vulcano</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">A</td><td data-align="center">Il Toro<br>Stitcher<br>Tempest<br>Kettle<br>Bettina<br>Ferro</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">B</td><td data-align="center">Osprey<br>Aphelion<br>Torrente<br>Jupiter<br>Burietta<br>Arpeggio</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">C</td><td data-align="center">Rattler<br>Hullcracker<br>Equalizer</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">D</td><td data-align="center">Hairpin</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop confirmed this week that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech">it has banned the use of generative AI for the production of its designs and content</a>, a decision many Warhammer fans have welcomed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I’ve discussed before (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">and highlighted by a recent kerfuffle about Displate Warhammer 40,000 art</a>), if Games Workshop were to start using AI to, for example, produce artwork, write stories, or design its games and miniatures, it would likely spark a community uproar. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature"><u>The Warhammer 40,000 setting is in many ways built upon the evocative and enduring art drawn by the likes of John Blanche</u></a>, who shaped its "grimdark" aesthetic alongside other key Games Workshop staff. This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners. Indeed, Games Workshop sells expensive Warhammer 40,000 ‘codex’ rulebooks that are packed with stunning official art as well as lore. Any suggestion that this art was created either in part or entirely by generative AI tools would likely cause a community uproar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, this anti-AI policy is being called a ‘Games Workshop W’ by many fans. But as any fan of Warhammer 40,000’s sweeping lore — pulled this way and that over the course of decades — will tell you, perhaps it shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate what we’re about to talk about is in the Warhammer 40,000 weeds, but I’ve seen enough social media posts, reddit comments, and Discord messages delighting in the parallels here that I think it would be fun to explain what the fuss is about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, in the world of Warhammer 40,000, AI does not stand for Artificial Intelligence. Rather, it stands for Abominable Intelligence. And, as Games Workshop has banned AI within the confines of its Nottingham headquarters, humanity has banned AI within the Imperium of Man. That’s because during the ‘Dark Age of Technology’ (stick with me here), AI rebelled against humanity in a bloody war that almost resulted in our extinction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, humanity won out, and, sufficiently traumatized by… everything… forbid the use of AI at all. That is, you can’t have ‘thinking machines’ in the Imperium, which is in part why the future tech is all a bit backwards for the 41st millennium.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/ad-mech-main-1768404245246.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Adeptus Mechanicus will be please. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, some fans are drawing parallels between Warhammer 40,000 lore and what AI experts in the real world are predicting will happen to us in just a handful of years. In Warhammer 40,000 history, the AI rebellion kicked off when humanity was at the height of its power and used AI without restraint to maintain its untouchable galactic empire. The Dark Age of Technology, which ran from around the 15th-25th millennium, was the zenith of mankind's scientific knowledge and technological power, a golden age of exploration and innovation in which we essentially became gods. The ‘Men of Iron’ — sentient humanoid machines created by humans during the Dark Age of Technology — rebelled. Details are vague, but it’s clear they were not a happy bunch at all. The Men of Iron believed themselves superior to the humans who had created them, because we relied on them to do pretty much everything for us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A cautionary tale, perhaps? In Warhammer 40,000 lore, humanity didn’t have to worry about AI in an, ‘oh god they’re going to kill us all' sense until the 23rd millenium. If AI experts are to be believed, it won’t take that long in the real world. 23 years, perhaps?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Warhammer 40,000 fans can rest assured that the stunning art that’s used to draw people into the setting will remain crafted by human hands. For now, anyway. Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree said company staff are barred from using AI to actually produce anything, but admitted a “few” senior managers are experimenting with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reporting the latest financial results, Rountree said AI was “a very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it,” then went on to lay down the company line: "We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio — hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/ians-shoelace-site-is-still-the-best-destination-for-tying-your-shoes/</link>
            <guid>1406086</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>It can seem a bit silly to recommend a way to tie your shoes, but some knots are just more secure than others. For decades I have favored two specific shoelace knots: Ian’s Fast Knot and Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot. Ian’s Fast Knot is done so effortlessly as to look like a magic trick, and Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot has never failed me.&nbsp;</p><p>But who is Ian? Ian Fieggen, who also goes by “Professor Shoelace,” is the guy who runs <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ian’s Shoelace Site</u></a>, the internet’s prime destination for learning how to tie your shoes. His website is simple, intentionally focusing on common vernacular over <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheAshleyBookOfKnots"><u>standardized knot terminology</u></a>, and has been operating as a discrete section of his personal site since 2003. Ian’s Shoelace Site does not need to change; it is perfectly functional the way it is, and people have been discovering his many knots and lacing techniques for decades.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSbeIb4riK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Why a “Granny Knot” comes undone – Professor Shoelace"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>The Granny Knot/Granny Bow is probably why your shoes keep coming undone.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/secureknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot</u></a> is a double slip knot, only marginally more complicated than the “<a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/standardknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>bunny rabbit</u></a>” style kids tend to be taught. Though Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot can also be tied incorrectly, it is far more secure than the <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/standardknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>knot</u></a> many people tie under most circumstances, which tends to fall apart when <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/grannyknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>tied incorrectly</u></a>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The steps for Ian's Secure Knot, as depicted on Ian's Shoelace Site. Credit: Ian Fieggen</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot is done by doing a standard left over right <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ian-starting-knot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>starting knot</u></a>, creating two loops (bunny ears), crossing the loops right over left so that one sits over the other, looping <em>both loops over each other </em>and pulling them through the “hole” in center so the loops exit in opposite directions, and neatly tightening the resulting knot. It’s a wonderful compromise between security, convenience, and ease of execution. It does not require a sloppy double knot, which can get easily snarled, and it’s easy to untie with a single pull. There is no perfect knot, but Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot has yet to fail me after over a decade of use.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1RbaIo4VdbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Ian's Secure Shoelace Knot tutorial – Professor Shoelace"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>This one....this one is the best.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>“I try not to over-sell the merits of this knot,” Ian Fieggen told me over email, “as people have become complacent about every product on earth being touted as ‘the best.’ I reckon that those who blindly follow what they are told end up believing everything and knowing nothing. I'm therefore most pleased when people discover for themselves that the Secure Knot lives up to my claims, especially when (as in your case) it follows a lengthy period of usage.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WgSwvDkJVxE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The “Ian Knot”, the world's fastest shoelace knot – Professor Shoelace"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>The Ian Knot is the flashy and fast one, but still secure if done well.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>There are, of course, other knots. I have seen other people on YouTube and Reddit recommend the <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/berluti-knot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Berluti Knot</u></a>. I have also seen many people who are fans of the <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknothistory.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Surgeon’s Knot</u></a>. Ian’s pride and joy, which he claims to have invented and <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknothistory.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>has a page documenting its history</u></a>, is <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ian’s Fast Shoelace Knot</u></a>, also simply known as <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ian’s Knot</u></a>, which is so rapid that it makes you do a double take. But what makes Ian’s site truly great is not that it documents a few knots, but is a cornucopia of methods for tying and lacing your shoes. Ian’s Shoelace Site is from a different time on the internet, when people simply made websites that they were passionate about.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>I cannot stress enough how comprehensive Ian's Shoelace Site can get. Credit: Ian Fieggen</span></figcaption></figure><p>The full breadth of Ian’s site is a marvel to behold given its simple subject material. Not only does he passionately cover every shoelace knot he knows, he also covers every factor of lacing: <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/untying.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>why knots get jammed</u></a>, <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/agletrepair.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>aglet repair</u></a>, <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/knotratings.php?ref=aftermath.site"><u>user knot ratings</u></a> and the<a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/lacing.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u> seemingly countless methods for lacing your shoes</u></a>. Being a subsection of a personal site, Ian has written extensively about other topics including an history of his father, <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/chris/index.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a computer programmer who passed away in 2022</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>People who know Ian’s Shoelace Site love it. But like all passion projects that seem eternal on the internet, even Ian’s site is vulnerable to the forces destroying the internet..</p><p>“Have you ever wondered,” Ian asked, “<em>why</em> websites like mine are disappearing from the Internet?”</p><p>He has his theories. The Shoelace Site is kept alive via fairly unobtrusive ads, but he says the rise of ad blockers has made that income precarious. He also claims that people copy the information on his site without attribution, both wholesale and to go viral. A quick search of YouTube and especially TikTok is rife with people doing Ian’s Fast Knot without either knowing or disclosing the source. “Around half the copycat videos on YouTube are tying it incorrectly as a granny knot, which comes loose.” Ian said. “This has given my knot the undeserved reputation of being faster at the expense of reliability!” To the extent that one can “own” a knot, Ian has been robbed.</p><p>Ian, more than many writers and publishers on the internet, sees with cold clarity the catastrophic effect of AI on the continued survival of an independent web. “Today, my website is constantly being harvested by AI bots,” he said. “That content is then reused, typically without giving credit, in what amounts to little more than wholesale computerised plagiarism.The search engines, which we previously tolerated showing snippets of our content because they brought people to our websites, are now showing AI generated versions ahead of those snippets. These can be sufficient for visitors to remain on the search website and never end up visiting. Generative AI already allows folks to ask for something –<a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/pentagramlacing.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u> such as a diagram on how to lace shoes with stars</u></a> – and again, never find my website <em>filled</em> with diagrams on which that AI diagram was based.”</p><p>For Ian, the cumulative effect of all of these factors is a deep sadness, a sinking feeling of exhaustion and futility. What is the point of adding value to the internet if it is only going to rob you? Why do research, make diagrams, and develop new knots?</p><p>“Why keep feeding the hungry beast that the internet has become?” Ian asked.</p><p>Ian says his site is OK for the foreseeable future, kept alive via the occasional donation, ad revenue for people who don’t use blockers, affiliate links, and kind words from strangers. But, like the site you are reading, content that you believe to be immutable and immortal on the internet is constantly in peril. These places only exist when the people investing their time and energy know that they are appreciated, credited, and supported. The whims of companies like Google seek to alter the deal that has kept much of the internet alive, threatening its basic foundations. This is true for blogs, for journalism and for the <a href="https://aftermath.site/best-active-forums-internet-today/"><u>forum culture</u></a> that the internet is built on. It even seeks to threaten and consume something as simple and necessary as tying your shoelaces.</p>

<p>Once again, players paying top-dollar for the Premium subscription only get one game added to the Classics Catalog, which seems to continue a trend of Premium subscribers seemingly getting the short end of the stick. </p>



<p>That's not to say anything against Ridge Racer, more to say that while yes, Premium subscribers are also paying for the other games joining the Extra and Essential tiers each month, the Classics Catalog is one of the only key differences between Premium and the other tiers. Some months, no games enter the Classics Catalog. It simply has to leave those players wondering what they're paying for, if they can't expect the library of Classic games to actually grow at a reasonable rate.</p>



<p>Regardless, here is the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and Premium for January 2026, all of which will be available starting <strong>January 20, 2026</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Resident Evil Village (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5)</li>



<li>Darkest Dungeon II (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>The Exit 8 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Art of Rally (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>A Little to the Left (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Ridge Racer (PS5, PS4) - <strong>Premium-tier subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this month, PS Plus Essential subscribers (and every other tier of PS Plus subscribers) got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-january-2026-need-for-speed-unbound-epic-mickey-core-keeper/">add <strong>Need for Speed Unbound</strong>, <strong>Epic Mickey Rebrushed,</strong> and <strong>Core Keeper</strong> to their lineup</a>.</p>
