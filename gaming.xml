            <p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has dropped. It puts a ten-minute dent into the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>'s enigma, but the most tantalising question still remains: is Kojima using that subtitle to deliberately remind everybody of the original's <a href="https://youtu.be/5cnXkbUFdBs">most infamous scene</a>? Bold choice if so, although not the only one. Here's the trailer, complete with familiar mechs and very familiar bandanas. See Konami, this is what happens when you pop out for five minutes to re-release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars">Suikoden</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside The Solitude of Prime Numbers's Luca Marinelli wearing a Snakely bandana and a Rex-reminiscent mech, the trailer also has a console release date: 26th June 2025, or 63 days before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. This is approximately enough time for players unfamiliar with Kojima's works to pick up Death Stranding 2 on a whim, finish it, buy  Delta of out curiosity, then think "hey, this Snake guy is a total rip-off of Luca Marinelli's character!". A paratextual commentary on identity, memory, and hero worship? Kojima you sly old dog, you've done it again!</p>
<p>Shared as part of a panel at SXSW, the trailer joins news of an <a href="https://kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding-concerts-announced?dm_i=74N0,1E4S2,1MPLY2,4YF2G,1#m-scroll-target">orchestral concert </a>and <a href="https://kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding2_hamilton_announced?dm_i=74N0,1E4S2,1MPLY2,4YF2G,1#m-scroll-target">a watch</a>. Why, you could wear the watch to the concert and draw attention to yourself in the queue by loudly asking "what time does this thing start, anyway?!" and theatrically glaring at your wrist, then smarmily asking "oh, this old thing?" at great volume to no-one in particular. You'd be really cool if you did that.</p>
<p>It took about eight months for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> to break console containment. If this follows suit, we might well see the sequel on PC by the end of the year. I reckon we got the best of both worlds with the original's late release though: more time to play other games, and a shiny Director's Cut to boot. I enjoyed it so much I was compelled to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/object-ive-review-death-strandings-pizza">spill words aplenty on pizza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>For the best part of a decade we’ve explored video games through a historic lens in <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playing-with-history">Playing With History</a>, studying AAA blockbusters such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> to indie gems like <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/radio-commander">Radio Commander</a>, examining the real-world people, events, and cultures that inspired them.</p>
<p>We’re proud to announce that Playing With History is to become a premium print publication with its first volume heading to crowdfunding platform, Kickstarter, later this year. Available digitally and in both paperback and hardback, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">Playing With History: Volume One</a> promises over 200 pages of developer interviews, deep dives, and retrospectives, all presented in a visually arresting format.</p>
<div id="attachment_457611"><p id="caption-attachment-457611">Battlefield: The Endless War For Wake Island is just one of many original articles created for Playing With History.</p></div>
<p>Together, with video game creatives and historians, we investigate a wide spectrum of historic eras and how they are represented, from the prehistoric playgrounds of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/far-cry-primal">Far Cry Primal</a> to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>’s nightmarish Normandy landings and far beyond. Whether it’s Romans, Vikings, samurai, or pirates, we leave no virtual stone unturned, with plenty of fascinating detours along the way.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the project and get notified when the campaign goes live, please visit the Playing With History Volume One <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">pre-launch hub</a>. For regular updates you can follow us over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playingwithhistory.bsky.social">BlueSky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/PlayingxHistory">X</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Always the outspoken game designer, Hazelight's Josef Fares has recently commented on the negative influence that the widespread usage of microtransactions is having on the game industry. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjgQpyc1gh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to YouTube channel Fall Damage</a> in a reaction video to user comments, Fares explained:</p>
<p><em>Of course, and that goes for everything we do at Hazelight. I think that kind of shit affects the design of how the game should be done. Every time you take a design decision based on you making more money in the game, I think it's a huge problem, and it's stopping our industry from a creative perspective.</em></p>
<p>For a few years, especially around 2017-2018, there were instances of highly aggressive microtransactions that triggered massive backlash from fans. Famous instances include <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-hit-by-class-action-for-nba-2k-loot-boxes-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBA 2K</a>, Star Wars Battlefront II (where Electronic Arts was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced</a> to remove them just before launch), <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-now-features-gameplay-related-microtransactions-despite-promises-itd-never-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Avengers</a> (in this case, too, the developers had to quickly cut them from the game), and more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-community-is-angry-at-the-new-microtransactions-techland-responds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2</a>. Microtransactions even made it into several single player games, like <a href="http://wccftech.com/shadow-of-war-director-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Middle-earth: Shadow of War</a>, various Ubisoft games, and even CAPCOM's <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-time-saving-mtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Devil May Cry V</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-mods-bypass-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-gets-microtransactions-for-instant-weapon-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, developers are more careful when implementing microtransactions, sticking strictly to cosmetic items in most cases. However, microtransactions are more pervasive than ever, especially since the game industry isn't growing meaningfully anymore and development budgets continue to increase. The only solution, then, is to try to squeeze more out of the average consumer.</p>
<p>Thankfully, if you don't want anything to do with microtransactions, there are still several games completely devoid of them, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-has-no-drm-or-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> or even Josef Fares's own Split Fiction, which just launched to positive reviews. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8/10 score from Nathan Birch</a>:</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>

            <p>Over the weekend, hectic 1v1 shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> got yet more free maps in an update. The developers added <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/509574242369537162">eight new cramped deathzones</a> alongside a further four maps for owners of the "maps 'n' hats" DLC, then threw in a new submachine gun and a music player for good measure. But over on the game's Discord server, amid the mine-laying mercenaries and bum-sliding shootscum, the developers also held a poll that revealed future plans. They asked players what they'd prefer: a 2v2 mode or a four-player free-for-all? </p>
<p>"We'll do both," said devbrother Leonard Lemaitre, "but it's a matter of which one comes first."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The poll, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1124764095623741473/1265760231913422969/1347947995441664121">posted on Saturday</a>, currently puts the presumably chaotic four player free-for-all mode ahead, with twice as many votes as the 2v2 mode, which I can only imagine will be an intense bonding exercise for connoisseurs of early 2000s multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> lobbies. Although the poll is being conducted with emojis, and it's possible a lot of voters are getting the "two silhouetted people" emoji confused with the "two silhouettes hugging" emoji, thereby splitting the 2v2 vote. Is there an electoral commission for frenzied first-person killsports? Nah, we can solve this with a first-to-three in Chateaux_13_Alt_Alt. </p>
<p> It's very pleasing to see the game pumping out updates. It was already an "anarchic first-person speed dater you'll fall in love with" according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">Straftat review</a> from Rick, and that was before they added <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-resurrects-a-counter-strike-map-you-either-love-or-hate-cannibalising-fps-history-in-the-best-way-possible">another heaving bunch of maps to the concrete bullet brawler</a>. Including this latest update, my estimate is now 192 maps (if you own the DLC) although I could have easily lost count. There's a reason it was one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">favourite games of 2024</a>.</p>
<p>This weekend's update adds a few other bits and bobs. You can now view your match history in the stats menu, for example. And you can disable your crosshair in the options, if you are some kind of instinctually accursed murder master. Don't matchmake with me, please, I don't like that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new filing from the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has confirmed multiple Switch 2 features.</p>
<p>Now we know Amiibo figurines will be supported, as Switch 2 will support NFC - it's in the right Joy-Con, just like the original Switch.</p>
<p>It's also confirmed to have faster Wi-Fi compatibility with support for Wi-Fi 6 networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth, up from Wi-Fi 5 on the original Switch. However, it doesn't appear to support the more recent Wi-Fi 7 or Wi-Fi 6E.</p>

<p>Further, we already knew Switch 2 would have USB-C ports both on top and at the bottom of the console, but these filings confirm both ports can be used to charge the console.</p>
<p>We also now know the Switch 2's code designation is BEE, with BEE-001 being the model of the console, BEE-012 and 014 being the left and right Joy-Cons, and BEE-053 being the Relay Box.</p>
<p>Similarly, the GameCube had the code DOL (for Dolphin) and the Wii had RVL (for Revolution).</p>
<p>Below are images from the filings (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625931/nintendo-switch-2-fcc-nfc-wi-fi-6-usb">The Verge</a>).</p>

<p>We still don't know the release date for the Switch 2 but it's not long now until we find out - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo is hosting a Direct livestream</a> on 2nd April at 2pm UK time.</p>
<p>Little is known about the console so far, beyond its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">reveal back in January</a>, but it's hoped the Direct will provide a wealth of information: from its release date and price, to the launch line-up. Presumably that will include the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Mario Kart game previously teased</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>ESRB has rated Indiana Jones and The Great Circle for the PS5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/wario64/status/1899020272331575558?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>, if you search for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on ESRB’s <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40439/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will find two search results now, one for Windows PC and Xbox Series and one for the PS5. The game has been rated ‘T’ (Teen) with “Blood and Gore, Drug Reference, Mild Language, Violence” highlighted on the listing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in August last year that the game would arrive on the platform in Spring 2025. However, an ESRB rating for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the PS5 hints that things are well in motion and an official release date announcement could be around the corner. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The ESRB rating summary describes the game as a first-person action adventure in which players uncover mysteries, solve puzzles, and defeat villains. The game includes different types of combat, such as hand-to-hand, stealth, whip use, and ranged combat with the help of machine guns and rifles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The summary also highlights some of the game’s sequences that aren’t for all audiences, such as a scene with a severed arm and another with a corpse impaled with a spike trap. It also mentions certain drug references and curse words that were heard in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, more Indiana Jones games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are reportedly in development</a>.

            <p>After its VR catalogue was removed from the Meta Store earlier this year, Insomniac has announced the affected games are now making a return.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, three of the four previoulsy delisted games are again available on the Meta Store. These are Edge of Nowhere, Stormland, and Feral Rites.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Insomniac is still "actively" working on getting the fourth of its Meta VR titles - The Unspoken - back on the store front. "VR players, we appreciate your patience while we work with Meta [to] restore access to these games," <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1898232148911702187">Insomniac wrote on social media</a>.</p>

<p>All four of the affected games were developed with funding by Meta. While no reason was given for their removal from the store, the general consensus was that it was due to the certification process. A <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/stormland-oculus-rift-store-missing/#:~:text=Stormland%20and%20The%20Unspoken%20are%20back%20for%20sale,our%20blog%20from%20September,%E2%80%9D%20Meta%20explained%20via%20email.">similar thing happened back in 2022</a>, as well.</p>
<p>While the four games had seemingly been absent from the store for several months now, their removal was recently highlighted by freelance journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3ljd4dorpt42n?ref=uploadvr.com">Dominic Tarason</a> on Bluesky.</p>
<p>"I thankfully picked up Stormland (their best-known game) and can still access it, but the others are so thoroughly vanished that not even pirate and torrent sites seem to have the rest anymore," Tarason wrote at the start of the month.</p>

<p>The fake Snake is Neil, played by Luca Marinelli - a new character for the sequel. We see him towards the end of the trailer wearing a bandana in a look strikingly similar to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> protagonist.</p>
<p>The rest of the trailer includes plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-sure-sounds-a-lot-like-death-stranding-so-far">elements familiar to fans of the first game</a>, but with plenty more surreal and bizarre happenings.</p>
<p>There's a mysterious faction, an environment warped by chiralium, and some absolutely nightmarish BTs. We also see Sam Bridges exploring more varied locales, from lush forests and snowy mountains, to a post apocalyptic city caught in a storm, and the more familiar Icelandic tundra.</p>

<p>There are plenty of story hints too inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, though at this point little of it makes sense. Kojima also continues his penchant for simplistic descriptive names: Dollman, Doctor, and Rainy, for instance.</p>
<p>The trailer is soundtracked by a new song from musician Woodkid called To The Wilder, which is out now.</p>
<p>Speaking of music, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> Strands of Harmony World Tour will take place this year, beginning at the Sydney Opera House on 8th November and then visiting 12 countries across four continents until it ends in Toronto on 28th March 2026.

<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be available to pre-order from 17th March. According to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-details-leak-ahead-of-kojima-panel-later-today">leak ahead of the panel</a>, the collector's edition will cost $230.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-brings-a-%E2%80%98spitting-image-of-solid-snake%E2%80%99-to-death-stranding-2.1129707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed that Death Stranding 2 will be released worldwide on June 26. Alongside the reveal, Hideo Kojima’s team at Kojima Productions released a new trailer to showcase the ambitious (and somewhat confusing) sequel to the 2019 epic that sold almost 20 million copies. The trailer, which was bursting with cinematic quality, boasted a runtime of a whopping 10 minutes.</p>



<p>In the trailer, we get a look at Neil, a mysterious character played by Luca Marinelli. If you get Solid Snake vibes from his character’s reveal, that’s because it’s almost by design.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-solid-stranding">Solid Stranding</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMIVpVnef5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an Instagram post</a> from 2020, Hideo Kojima noted that Luca Marinelli had ‘caught his eye’. He remarked that the actor would be the ‘spitting image of Solid Snake’ if he put on a bandana, and lo and behold, he does just that in the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2 all these years later.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Pre-Order Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdzIwQhYABQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Luca Marinelli’s reveal in the Death Stranding 2 trailer could be pulled straight out of a Metal Gear remake – but the similarities to franchise that arguably made Kojima more than two decades ago don’t end there.</p>



<p>Further in the trailer, we get our first look at ‘Magellan Man’, a hulking construct that could be an alternate rendition of a Metal Gear weapon.</p>



<p>We don’t see much of Luca’s character in the Death Stranding 2 trailer, but like everything else featured, it’s more than enough to get the hype train stoked a little further. This is easily one of the most highly anticipated releases of 2025, and it promises to be a cinematic showstopper.</p>



<p>In tandem with the development of Death Stranding 2, Hideo Kojima is working with A24 to produce a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-adaptations-kojima-confirm/">Death Stranding movie</a>, as if the man wasn’t doing enough with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-physint-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has been a long time coming – are you excited about the impending release? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In just a few days, GDC will take place in San Francisco (and <strong>Insider Gaming </strong>will be in attendance!). It’s a proving ground for countless developers and publishers to show off what they’re working on, as well as for manufacturers to reveal the latest and greatest in gaming technology.</p>



<p>One topic that has surfaced recently concerns EA Motive’s Iron Man game, which has been kept mostly under wraps since it was revealed more than two years ago. In a recent schedule post, it was revealed that Motive will be presenting <strong>something </strong>to do with Iron Man at GDC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-stark">Becoming Stark</h2>



<p>Almost nothing is known about the Iron Man game being pieced together by Motive, but there are high hopes that it’ll deliver nicely on expectations. Fans are wishing for an open-ended game with full suit customisation that allows them to immerse themselves in the role of Tony Stark.</p>



<p>In September 2022, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motive-studios-officially-announces-new-iron-man-game/">revealed that Motive</a> is working on the game, as well as contributing to the ongoing development of the next Battlefield title. Historically, Motive has contributed to the Dead Space Remake, Star Wars Squadrons, and Battlefront II.</p>



<p>On the Iron Man front, all we know right now is that it’s a single-player, third-person action title. Shortly after the game was announced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motives-iron-man-game-already-starts-playtesting/">we covered the playtests</a> that were going on behind closed doors, and since then, production has kicked off in earnest, so it must be in a much better state by now.</p>



<p>Recently, eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j7gl6h/motive_may_show_off_iron_man_game_at_gdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit users</a> discovered an Advanced Graphics Summit segment <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/advanced-graphics-summit-revolutionizing-texture-pipelines-eas-journey-with-texture-sets/909461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taking place at GDC on March 17</a>. The session is being led by a technical artist from Electronic Arts, and the content is set to be focused on the development of texture sets for Dead Space and Iron Man at Motive. </p>



<p>The belief is that Motive will be showing off at least <strong>something </strong>from Iron Man during this segment, which would represent our first look at the game since it was announced in 2022. Even if the technical demo provides little more than <strong>a look </strong>at Iron Man’s suit, fans will be satisfied.</p>



<p>As you need certain credentials to access the tech summit hosted by EA at GDC, it’s highly unlikely that anything will be released publicly around this time, but you never know. It’s also entirely possible that we’ll see some kind of demo or trailer revealed during the Epic Unreal showcase at GDC, given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-iron-man-game-to-use-unreal-engine-5/">Iron Man is being built in UE5</a>.</p>



<p>What hopes do you have for Motive’s Iron Man? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, rumours started circulating that developers are starting to prepare games for the ‘next Xbox’. The focus title of these rumours was Call of Duty 2026 – it was claimed that it’d be released on whatever hardware the tech titan produces next, but a recent insider has suggested that might not be the case and that the next Xbox device will likely arrive in 2027 <strong>and not </strong>2026.</p>



<p>It was also suggested that the next Xbox won’t be a console at all, but more of a gaming PC with defined hardware that developers can better work with.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-consoles-for-xbox">The End of Consoles for Xbox</h2>



<p>For a while, Xbox has been teetering on a precipice. The brand has well and truly lost this generation of home consoles to the PlayStation 5, and the Xbox One generation should be forgotten about entirely at this point. Recently, a marketing campaign from Xbox proved that ‘everything is an Xbox’ and that you don’t even need a console anymore to be an Xbox-based gamer.</p>



<p>A former Xbox executive even went on record suggesting that Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-consoles-microsoft-would-not-make-choice/">would stop making hardware</a> right now if it had the choice.</p>



<p>In a segment on the most recent episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAOt7CKUEFY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Xbox Two podcast</a>, Jez Corden, an insider with a solid track record, mentioned that something drastic might be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Instead of creating a full-fledged Xbox console for a 2027 release, he said that Microsoft will instead produce ‘a PC in essence but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind.’</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Developers will be building for a Windows PC in a way but in such a way that they know exactly what the specs will be, so they can optimise exactly for it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corden also leaned towards writing off the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/">Call of Duty 2026 rumours</a>, explaining, <em>‘the devkit talk is more about what kind of specs they’ve been told to target for the next Xbox. I’m pretty sure the new hardware is not 2026; it’s 2027.’</em></p>



<p>The general assumption now is that the next Xbox will be a micro-form Windows-powered PC in a ‘console-like’ shell and chassis that can sit nicely under a television. </p>



<p>It’ll be compatible with all manner of peripherals and inputs, and it’ll likely have a ‘switchable mode’ that ports between a gaming interface and a general Windows layout, so you can treat it like a desktop PC as much as you would a home gaming console. </p>



<p>What do you think about these predictions? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-texas-has-now-lost-15-maps-back-to-back-prompting-major-concerns-from-fans.1129692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-lost-15-maps-back-to-back/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>OpTic Texas has found itself in a sticky spot since 2025 kicked off. The team’s last win in a qualifying stage was at the end of January, and at the Major in Madrid, the team crashed out after winning just one series in the lower bracket. The squad is on a historic losing streak, losing 15 maps in sequence and sitting one from the bottom in the CDL stage standings.</p>



<p>The team is drawing a 50-50 win-loss record right now in the overall season standings, but one more loss will push them into negative ground and could move them further down the leaderboard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-texas-in-turmoil">Texas in Turmoil</h2>



<p>The impact of the losing streak has been visible on the faces of the OpTic Texas crew in recent weeks. They’re looking sullen and extinguished on their camera feeds, and the energy that usually drives them is sorely lacking.</p>



<p>Recently, the organisation’s owner, Hector ‘H3CZ’ Rodriguez, made a controversial statement on stream, dubbing the squad the worst OpTic team ever. This losing streak is indeed like nothing we’ve ever seen for the organisation.</p>



<p>This stage alone, OpTic Texas has lost with an 0 – 3 scoreline against:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>
</ul>



<p>The running joke now is that even the Vegas Falcons, a team that has lost two dozen Hardpoint rounds since the season started and sits on a record of 0 – 16 overall has put up a better fight this stage.</p>











<p>OpTic’s most recent loss came at the hands of Toronto Ultra, which laid the utter smackdown against the team from Texas. In this series, JoeDecieves (ULT) set a new KD record at 2.05, helped by going double positive in the opening Hardpoint.</p>



<p>It was a crushing blow for Texas through and through, and the closing round of Control was a 3 – 0 masterclass from Ultra. Ironically, this is OpTic Texas’ Major event. The upcoming LAN tournament will be played at the arena in which they won their CDL Championship last year, and they’re entering the running in the worst position possible.</p>



<p>On social platforms everywhere, fans of the OpTic franchise are writhing and desperately figuring out a plan to right the ship. The consensus is that a major roster change is needed, but nobody seems to know who is at fault. The finger pointing is generally levelled at Kenny, and one of the most common claims is that Huke never should have been pushed back out for the return of Pred.</p>



<p>What do you think needs to be done for OpTic Texas to win a series? Let me know in the comments.</p>

However, those who buy the Digital Deluxe Edition or the Collector’s Edition get two days of early access from June 24.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 10-minute long video, below, includes various cinematics, gameplay clips, and, perhaps most notably, a close look at a character who many are already saying looks a lot like Snake from Kojima's world famous Metal Gear franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The character, Neil, played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli, is seen putting on a bandanna, as Snake does, before leading a team of creepy looking soldiers.

In a 2020 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMIVpVnef5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a>, Kojima heaped praise on the actor, saying that if he wore a bandanna he'd be a "spitting image" of Solid Snake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are many actors that I follow," Kojima said at the time. "Luca Marinelli recently caught my eye after watching The Old Guard and Martin Eden. He played an impressive villain in They Call Me Jeeg Robot, but I think that he will break out soon, and his popularity will increase. Also, I think if he donned a bandanna, he’d be a spitting image of Solid Snake!"</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/snake-lol-1741558708215.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kojima suggested Neil actor Luca Marinelli would look a lot like Solid Snake if he wore a bandanna, and so he does.

		<p>Clearly, we don’t know much about Death Stranding 2 as we’ve now had over forty minutes of trailers and every one&nbsp; of these has revealed something new. The latest, which also reveals a launch date of June 26th 2025&nbsp; for PlayStation 5, starts on shocking conversation.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdzIwQhYABQ?start=300&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We then get some backstory to explain exactly what has happened since the last game with humanity reconnecting (which, it turns out, was a very bad idea) and allowing automated deliveries, making Sam’s job as a postman obsolete. He has other things to do this time with a rise of a cult and Baby Lou to look after.&nbsp; Kojima hasn’t lost his touch with needle drops either, the trailer includes the haunting song&nbsp; “Too the Wilder” by Woodkid.</p>
<p>We also get a look at some new Tar enemies, new locations, new characters, and rather excitingly, motorcycle battles! Also, tentacles, lots of tentacles, mostly in places where tentacles should not be. Sadly there is no confirmation that we will get <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/15/penis-fans-outraged-to-discover-norman-reedus-has-no-dinkle-in-death-stranding/">to see Little Norman in the game.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/29/check-out-20-minutes-from-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Previous trailers</a> have shown us Fragile, Rainy, and Tomorrow posing for a photoshoot with cuddly toy versions of the white grubs that were introduced as food in the first film.&nbsp; They then model some nice jackets and have dance on some of the vehicles from the game.</p>

<p>The video then continues with the footage from the trailer that was released in January before what appears to be a new trailer with Baby Lou (at a guess) and some sort of religious ceremony before skipping back to Fragile carrying Lou away from some sort of danger.&nbsp; Next is a shot of the DHV Megellan before we are told that a private company, APAC, is funding the project. If that all seemed vaguely sensible the final shot is Baby Lou’s pod with octopus tentacles in it.</p>
<p>The game will launch with a Digital Deluxe Edition which will cost $10 above the standard $69.99 price and includes some in-game bonus items.&nbsp; The Collector’s Edition will cost an eye watering $230 and includes a statue.</p>

<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Check out our Death Stranding Hub for everything you need to know about the game!&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}"><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/death-stranding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out our Death Stranding 2 Hub for everything you need to know about the game!</a></span></p>
<p>Since its launch on PS4 the original Death Stranding has also been released on PC and Xbox as well is getting a “Directors Cut” with additional content.</p>

The upcoming game — known as <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> — got a fresh trailer and a long-awaited release date of June 26th <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSy6fI0SBU">during a presentation at SXSW</a>.</p><p>The PlayStation 5 exclusive will cost $69.99 and is available for pre-order starting on March 17th.

Following that, there’s plenty of Sam (Norman Reedus) navigating the wastes with his BB and his cargo, facing bad weather, an avalanche, and the series’ signature horrific monsters. The game has a lot of star power, with the trailer highlighting characters like Fragile (Léa Seydoux), Tarman (George Miller), Higgs (Troy Baker), Tomorrow (Elle Fanning), Dollamn (Fatih Akin), Rainy (Shioli Kutsuna), The President (Alastair Duncan), Lucy (Alissa Jung), Heartman (Nicholas Winding Refn), and Doctor (Debra Wilson).</p><p>Near the end, the trailer shows Neil donning a bandana that, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/epic-death-stranding-2-trailer-reveals-release-date-new-gameplay-and-some-serious-metal-gear-vibes"><em>IGN</em> notes</a>, is very reminiscent of Solid Snake, the lead character of Kojima’s famed <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series. The shot is creepy, with quick flashes showing his face intermittently replaced with a skull.</p><p>Kojima also announced “The Strands of Harmony World Tour,” a <em>Death Stranding</em> concert tour that will visit 19 cities and feature the music of <em>Death Stranding</em>, performed by a live orchestra and singers.

<p><iframe title="DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Pre-Order Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdzIwQhYABQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach features new characters Tomorrow (played by Elle Fanning) and Rainy (played by Shioli Kutsuna). This new trailer also shows off another character, Neil, played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli. Neil has an incredible likeness to Metal Gear's Solid Snake, which Kojima had pointed out a few years back, likely before reaching out to the actor about being involved in this game.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-film-adaptation-announced-kojima-to-produce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also working on a film adaptation of the first game</a>.</p>

                <p>Sony and Kojima Productions have announced that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will launch on June 26 for PS5 for $70. Additionally, <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/deathstranding2_otb_po" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders for the game</a> will start on March 17.</p><p>A lengthy 10-minute cinematic trailer was also released, showcasing the original song for the game called "To the Wilder" by the artist Woodkid. The trailer also has shots of the different actors playing the game's characters, including Norman Reedus, Lea Seydoux, George Miller, Troy Baker, Elle Fanning, Fatih Akin, Shioli Kutsuna, Alastair Duncan, Alissa Jung, Nicolas Winding Refn, Lucas Larinelli, and Deborah Wilson.</p><p>The end of the trailer, it shows a group of gunman with the narrator talking about how the United Cities of America's predecessor, the United States of America, had a prominent gun culture. It's possible that one of Death's Stranding 2's themes will be about America's culture and fascination with firearms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdzIwQhYABQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HdzIwQhYABQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Those who preorder Death Stranding 2 will gain an early unlock of the Quokka custom hologram, as well Level 1, 2, and 3 Silver Skeletons: Battle, Boost, and Bokka. These are leg attachments that protagonist Sam Bridges can use to augment his abilities.</p><p>The Digital Deluxe Edition includes the full game, 48-hour early access, the Gold version of the aforementioned Skeletons, an early unlock for the Level 1 MP Bullet Machine Gun, and three patches: Patch 70: Quokka, Patch 71: Chiral Feline, and Patch 72: Why Me? It will cost $80.</p><p>The Collector's Edition will include everything that the Deluxe Edition had, along with a 15" Magellan Man Statue, 3" Dollman figurine, a few art cards, and a letter from Hideo Kojima, all housed in a collector's box. Unfortunately, this edition will not include a physical copy of the game and will cost $230.</p><p>After Death Stranding 2 releases, Kojima Productions will move on to OD and Physint, which Kojima <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-od-and-physint-were-impacted-by-strike/1100-6528609/" data-ref-id="1100-6528609">said were impacted by the SAG-AFTRA strike</a>.</p>

And if you unlink later, you “will be constrained to relinking to only that specific and originally linked” Microsoft account.</p><p>The requirement stings given that there’s <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/forza/dont-buy-forza-horizon-5-again-on-ps5-just-yet-its-missing-one-crucial-feature">no cross-platform saving</a>, so the progress you make in the PS5 version isn’t reflected in the Xbox version. It’s the same situation for the Steam version, as the FAQ points out. As the page also notes, <em>Horizon 5 </em>players will need a PlayStation Plus subscription to access the game’s multiplayer feature, and there are “no plans for a disc release.”</p><p>When <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>releases on the PS5 on April 29th, it will be the latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079090/hi-fi-rush-ps5-xbox-release-date">Xbox exclusive</a> to make the leap to Sony’s console, joining games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, which also <a href="https://support.seaofthieves.com/articles/18270908747282-PlayStation-sup-sup-5-Microsoft-Account-Linking">requires you to link a Microsoft account</a> before you can play.</p><p>Gamers haven’t been keen on required account linking when Sony has done it in the past. The company actually removed a requirement for you to sign in with your PSN account for some PC versions of some games, including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">Helldivers 2</a> </em>and, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/601909/playstation-is-dropping-its-account-linking-requirement-for-some-pc-games">more recently</a>, <em><em>God of War Ragnarök</em></em> and<em> Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered.</em></p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new leak has revealed that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach will have a collectors edition costing $229.99.</p>



<p>That’s according to reliable dataminer <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, who reports that the game is gearing up for an announcement later today.</p>



<p>It’s theorised that the announcement could come during Kojima’s appearance at SXSW 2025, where Kojima Productions is set to host a panel. </p>



<p>If the pre-orders are not announced during the panel, then it’s almost certain that an announcement will be made later this month, as billbil-kun obtains his datamined information from the backend of websites and stores, meaning that the information has recently been uploaded to the backend and thus, ready for an announcement.</p>



<p>According to the leak, the game will have two different physical editions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Edition : 79.99 euros / 69.99 US dollars / 69.99 pounds sterling</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Collector’s&nbsp;Edition : $229.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>As pointed out in the leak, the contents of the editions are currently unclear, but at a hefty $229.99 price tag for the collectors edition, it’s likely to contain some kind of statue. The original Death Stranding collectors edition featured a Baby BB Pod Replica.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2 was officially revealed at the Game Awards in 2022 and is set to launch on the PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>
