		<p>Last week, Team Peak teased <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/peak-is-getting-a-new-biome-next-week/">the new Roots biome,&nbsp;</a>announcing it would be released on November 5th.

Roots will replace the Tropics up to November 17th and after that the maps will rotate between the two biomes. New tools including the Rescue Claw and the Checkpoint Flag have been added to help players, along with more badges and cosmetics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-is-out-next-week-adding-mods-and-new-cinematics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3 modding scene</a> might not be quite as thriving as that of a Bethesda game like Skyrim, there are still a couple of major projects to follow, such as the Path to Menzoberranzan mod. Modder Lotrich, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PathToMenzoberranzan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the help of over 1,309 Patreon supporters</a>, has established a team of more than 130 contributors.</p>



<p>According to a project update shared this week on the Path to Menzoberranzan Discord channel, the team operates under a centralized structure. There is a group of project directors for each branch of development, and each project director is assisted by leads (coordinators) and seniors, who help oversee project contributors across different departments.</p>



<p>While the full release of the Baldur's Gate 3 mod is still years away, the first playable Alpha is estimated to be available in the first half of 2026. The team said it will include the game's prologue, which should be similar in scope to the Nautiloid of BG3. Over time, more updates will be released to introduce new locations and advance the narrative. The extent of these updates will depend on feedback and the feasibility of implementation. Path to Menzoberranzan reportedly features many interconnected storylines, and the creators want users to experience a satisfying portion of the story with each new update.</p>



<p>As Forgotten Realms experts will have already surmised from the title, the mod adds an entirely new standalone adventure focused on the bright mercantile city of Athkatla and the dark and perilous nature of the Underdark, all the way to the legendary capital of the Drow.</p>



<p>Throughout the story, which spans three acts like Baldur's Gate 3, players will revisit areas from Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn while also exploring entirely new lands. The campaign is set to feature a new protagonist with a new personal quest and up to 8 brand-new companions, each with their own personal agendas and some of whom will be romanceable.</p>



<p>In Act I, players will visit Athkatla, shop at iconic places like the Adventurer Mart, and explore the long-abandoned dungeon once occupied by the malicious mage Jon Irenicus. In Act II, the player will begin their journey to the titular location, Menzoberranzan, and Act III will feature the drow city itself.</p>



<p>The Path to Menzoberranzan modding team also promised the following features:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fully voiced companions and world NPCs—no AI-generated voiceovers;</li>



<li>Custom concept art and 3D assets as needed;</li>



<li>Handcrafted visual style for Menzoberranzan, built from scratch;</li>



<li>Multiple side quests on top of the main overarching story;</li>



<li>New items, outfits, NPC models;</li>



<li>Original musical theme.</li>
</ul>



<p>Another large-scale Baldur's Gate 3 mod<span>, '<a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-the-grand-theater-sell-your-lute-to-the-devil-gets-first-playable-version/" target="_blank">The Grand Theater - Sell your Lute to the Devil</a>', is currently 25% complete,</span> according to its creators. If you're instead looking for a mod that lets you play against your friends, <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-versus-mode-closest-thing-game-master-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Versus mode</a> is the one to get.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-hottest-trend-in-speedrunning-is-flipping-a-coin.1344745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Unfair Flips</em> is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3925760%2FUnfair_Flips%2F" rel="sponsored">a game about flipping a coin</a>. And despite being designed around random chance, it has a vibrant speedrunning community, racing to see who can get to 10 heads the fastest.</p><p>That’s the only goal. You earn money with each heads and can spend that on four things: a more valuable coin, a combo multiplier for heads streaks, a faster flip time, and an increased heads chance, which starts at 20 percent and maxes out at 60 percent. When you get lucky enough, you flip 10 heads. Until then, the only thing you can do is keep flipping the coin. The current world record took 96 flips and two minutes and 52 seconds by a speedrunner who goes by ravspect. It was, he says, “nearly complete luck.”</p><p>But only nearly. The perfect run would essentially be entirely good fortune — it is hypothetically possible for someone to load the game and flip 10 heads in a row instantly, ending it in about 20 seconds. The odds of this are a hair under one in 20 million. But the thing about probability is that if enough players try for long enough, it eventually becomes statistically likely. Until then, there are a few things that can give a runner an edge, predominantly around upgrade strategy. A Discord community that originally grew up around some of developer Heather Flowers’ earlier games now has channels dedicated to figuring out the perfect approach. “Talking about the ‘nuance’ of flipping a coin might sound crazy, but they were a massive help,” says ravspect.</p><p>One of these community number crunchers, Laika, made a spreadsheet calculating how much money you make depending on combo multiplier and coin value. “I hoped it would help us understand the game better and to develop the best strategy for buying upgrades,” she says, but tells me so far the only concrete discovery is that it’s not worth it to buy a second combo multiplier before upgrading the coin twice. In other words, <em>Unfair Flips</em> is not a solved game.</p><p>Not without using additional software, anyway. But a player called Four spent about 20 hours in a single weekend to prove that it’s possible to force a perfect run by cracking the random number generator seed to find one where it’s predetermined that the coin will land heads 10 times. An alternative option would be to figure out the perfect time to start flipping by using software to “watch” the figure in the background sip their drink, since this is also partially randomized. (The figure’s name is Gar, and the drink is milk, although you won’t find these details in the game, which is about flipping a coin and only flipping a coin.) It’s estimated that this would take “days or weeks,” but since the speedrun timer only begins on the first flip, the run itself would be under 20 seconds.</p><div><p>“You’re literally just rawdogging random chance.”</p></div><p>A more concrete tactic than obsessively watching a masked man drink milk is multi-instancing. Players open multiple versions of the game after their first heads, and if none of those flip heads, they can try again by beginning the quit-out process in the original version and then canceling it by instead muting and unmuting the game, which resets the save. “This process takes like three to four minutes if you’re really good at the tech,” says Flowers. These runs are listed separately, and the world record is currently 2:51, a single second faster than ravspect’s pure-luck world record.</p><p><em>Unfair Flips</em> is a game that very directly addresses our relationship to probability as humans and within the games industry. “It is saying, how little of a game can somebody make while still keeping that same level of compulsion to continue playing?” Flowers tells me. “It’s very much inspired by other gambling games that have come out in the past few years and reductio ad absurdum — making the smallest, most absurd version.”<br>There isn’t supposed to be a way to cheat the randomness inherent in the game. “I think the line that people latch onto is ‘There is no way to beat these odds. There is only time,’” says Flowers. “I was wrong.”</p><p>Although Flowers says she didn’t expect speedruns to take off, she thinks runners get her design philosophy. “I think everybody in that community is doing it because they know that it’s really funny to speedrun this game in particular, because you’re literally just rawdogging random chance.” It’s a sentiment echoed to me by most of the runners I spoke to who talked about how they first got into the game. “There is just something very silly about speedrunning coin flipping and without some silliness life would be very boring,” says Laika.</p><p>There are other speedrunning categories. The game actually has five endings. When you’ve flipped nine heads, it randomly decides whether you’d normally flip heads again using the percentage chance you’re currently at. Then, if so, it decides which ending you’ll get. The leaderboard for the “All Endings” category has a single entry, a seven-hour run by enbyzee.</p><p>“[It] nearly broke me,” she says. “I’ve never been mentally battered by a speedrun as much as [that one]. Getting multiple streaks of nine heads in a row only to have tails come up on the 10th. Getting multiple endings I already had when I just needed the last unique ending to finish the run. It was absolutely brutal.” Although she’s done long speedruns before, they always have a lot going on, keeping things fresh and interesting. <em>Unfair Flips</em> does not. “I pressed the spacebar over 20,000 times during that run.”</p><p>After five hours and four unique endings playing alone, enbyzee took a quick break, considered quitting, and decided to continue on stream instead. A little over 90 minutes later she got the last ending she needed. “I wanted to scream and cry when it happened. My sister actually called me and told me off for being too loud but I didn’t care because it was over.”</p><div><p>“I pressed the spacebar over 20,000 times during that run.”</p></div><p>Ravspect adds that “hitting those 10 heads feels just as amazing on your first playthrough as it does on your 100th.” The community comes together in search of that feeling on Flippin’ Fridays. Every other week, “we connect, share our passion for this weird little speedrun, and just have a good time,” says Laika. One recent Friday, MsTruffles was one of the runners trying to improve her personal best while streaming to the community. In her first-ever session running the game, she set the then-world record at eight minutes and 20 seconds, the first sub-10-minute run. Since then, “I still haven’t been lucky enough to improve my time, even after about a hundred attempts,” she says.</p><p>She also adds that Flippin’ Fridays are a good opportunity to bring in new runners. “This is such an accessible game to speedrun because you don’t need to learn difficult tricks, practice hard glitches, or remember complicated routing,” says Laika. “You just flip.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE0MTA="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Castello</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/814111/unfair-flips-speedrunning]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It has not been a good time for Simmers recently, and that's not even touching the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">recent controversial private buyout</a> that has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">led to a creator exodus</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>, for a while now, has been riddled with bugs that simply make it difficult to play, prompting Maxis to outline a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/quality-of-life-roadmap">quality of life roadmap</a> in September. Part of said roadmap was delivered yesterday in a big update that introduced more than 150 community-voted fixes, as well as some free goodies!
</p>
<p>
First, the goodies. These are a collection inspired by West Africa to use in both the Create a Sim and build mode. It was made in partnership with the Pan African Gaming Group as well as some Simmers with "with direct connections to West African countries and lived experiences across the Black diaspora in the UK and North America," according to a separate <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/west-african-bgu">news post</a> about the collection.
</p>
<p>
You'll find new items like an Okuta Lamp with Woven Shade, an Ìtura Cushion, your Sims will now be able to cook dishes like Jollof Rice and Chicken Drumsticks, and there's new West African inspired fashion pieces like a "vibrant jumpsuit, bold patterned shirts, and a playful, printed dress for Toddlers and Children." Neat stuff!
</p>
<p>
Now, some of those fixes. If you're the kind of Simmer that likes to make your Sims woo-hoo up a family, inherited features should show up in the kids more, like if two Sims have big ears, the kid should too - though there might still be some differences occasionally, just not egregiously so.
</p><p>
There's also been an issue where Sims might put things like books or food items into something like a Sticker Storage Box rather than their more logically assigned homes (shelf, fridge), and that's been fixed. One issue that surely tickled man that saw Sims wearing hats while in their nude outfits has been fixed, though I must admit this one mostly feels like a shame. Forcibly make Sims wear hats while naked! It's funny!
</p>
<p>
And you can comfortably marry one Sim to another without fear of any fashion faux pas, as an issue where guests would wear random or work outfits if one wasn't chosen for them has been fixed too.
</p>
<p>
It's a long list of fixes, you can check out the full thing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-11-4-2025">here</a>, which covers mostly the base game, but a lot of different packs too.

The Source of the Contamination quest asks you to figure out what's causing the issue--and while it may seem pretty simple at a glance, it can be a little tricky to figure out the exact spot where things are going wrong with the water. Below, we'll fill you in on where to find the Flood Spill Intake on the Dam Battlegrounds map and how to solve this mystery.</p><p>Be aware that you don't need to extract with any items during this quest. Since you'll merely need to visit the location below and interact with an item, it's not a bad idea to handle things with a free loadout so you're not risking any of your hard-earned resources while exploring here.</p><h2>Where to find the Flood Spill Intake at the Water Treatment Center</h2><p>The Water Treatment Center is found just to the left of the middle of the Dam Battlegrounds map. It's a popular spot where a lot of raiders tend to visit to loot and fight, so it's probably best for you to approach it from the swamp if you're trying to keep things quiet. This is also a good call in general since the Flood Spill Intake is on the exterior of this POI.</p><p>The Flood Spill Intake is on the northern part of the Water Treatment Center facing toward the swamp. It's not too hard to spot as you approach.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596618-arcraiders_20251104234118.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596618" data-ratio="0.56639427987743" data-width="1958" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596618-arcraiders_20251104234118.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596618"></a><figcaption>Flood Spill Intake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596618-arcraiders_20251104234118.jpg"></figure><p>You'll know you've reached the right spot when you see concrete walls containing polluted water.

Fortunately, Battlefield Studios has been tracking the conversations regarding these tasks, as well as weapon- and mode-specific assignments, and is rolling out changes to streamline them.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Announced </a>on November 5, Battlefield 6 is receiving a significant overhaul to challenges, one which drastically shortens the vast majority of their requirements to "make them more achievable within a reasonable session length."</p><p>As an example, Battlefield Studios cites how it has reduced the amount of required revives for a Support class challenge from 200 to 60. An example of of a streamlined weapon assignment showed that players would only need to inflict 3,000 damage as opposed to the previous requirement of 10,000 damage.</p><p>Additionally, mode-specific challenges have become more "standardized." Tasks that once needed five wins to accomplish them now only require two wins, and objective kills needed to complete a challenge have been similarly brought much lower than before.</p><p>These changes follow an update that increased experience points gained at the end of matches as well as lowered the threshold for early weapon-attachment ranks. Across the board, these tweaks should make it much easier for players to log in, play a handful of matches, and rank up much more efficiently in shorter play sessions.</p><p>Changes like these, including ones to the more advanced and intensive Expert and Master challenges, are currently rolling out and more are on the way, with details on the rollout to come.</p>

It's a question former Sony Santa Monica director of product development, Meghan Morgan Juinio, and Gearbox Montreal executive producer Fleur Marty grappled with during an on-stage conversation at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, Juinio provided some context to explain why answering that question is so important. She noted that, according to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/essential-facts-about-the-us-video-game-industry/2025-data/">Entertainment Software Association's latest 'Annual Facts' report on the U.S. video game industry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, around 205 million Americans currently play video games—and 47 percent of those players identified as women.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how many women are building video games?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gdc-2025-state-of-the-game-industry-devs-weigh-in-on-layoffs-ai-and-more">GDC State of the Industry survey</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> found that around 25 percent of developers identified as women. Discussing that data, Juinio questioned how many of those respondents were game directors or studio heads? How many are executives sitting at the top of the table, making decisions about which titles get funded?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think over the past five to ten years, collectively around the world, we've put a great amount of effort and energy into bringing more girls into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). We've created more pathways for girls in high school and university to have mentorship and internship programs that create pathways for entry-level roles in the game industry," said Juinio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/outsourcing-studio-atomhawk-closes-canadian-branch" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sumo Group-owned outsourcing studio Atomhawk closes Canadian branch</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to continue that, but I believe this is a 'yes and' conversation here. So, now what? How do we bring more women along to influence the content that gets into the hand of the players?"&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To find out, I took advantage of a Q&amp;A session to ask Juinio and Marty how major publishers and studios—such as the ones that promoted them into senior positions—can take practical steps to help women who wish to pursue leadership roles?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;If you don't ask the question you'll never know&quot;">"If you don't ask the question you'll never know"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Juinio said there are many opportunities for companies to put their best foot forward in that regard. "One of them, which is quite basic, is to collect the data and share the data with hiring managers," she explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm not advocating for quotas or for top-down forced [hiring policies] that dictate what the team makeup needs to look like from a gender perspective, but If your hiring managers don't have awareness of what the makeup of the teams look like, how can they be part of the evolution we want to inspire here? So collect the data and share the data."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She added that employers should also strive to find and nurture cohorts of like-minded women within their studios by establishing development programs that allow women from different disciplines to connect. "Maybe there's one female engineer on Team A and two female animators on Team B and one female designer on Team F, way over there," Juinio continued. "But do they know each other? Do they have opportunities to meet and connect? I think really looking to foster connection and support and this sense of community will really help women to be stronger."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-persona-5-series-has-sold-over-13-million-copies" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Persona 5 series has sold over 13 million copies</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Marty agreed and noted how, when she worked at Warner Bros. Montreal, she kickstarted a Slack channel called 'Women of Warner' to unite women from different disciplines.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the time, developers were very separated from QA—because QA was on the publishing side and handling all of the titles for the company, while devs were just at Warner Montreal," she recalled.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But I said 'no, anybody who worked at Warner Montreal should be part of this and it allowed a lot of the women in QA to connect with devs and ask them questions. It's so simple and it's free and it's the most basic thing, but allowing that connection [helps]."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Marty added that companies should be proactive in identifying women who want to pursue leadership opportunities to figure out how to meet their specific needs. "Not everybody wants a leadership role," she added. "Some people are happy to remain individual contributors and experts, but if you don't ask the question you'll never know. So identify them and then ask 'what's the path [for this person]?

<p>"Most of our inspiration comes from the comic books"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are mere weeks away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> punching its way onto Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>1st December</strong>, and with the full character roster now out in the open, the team at Tribute Games has shared a breakdown of what we can expect from each fighter.</p>
<p>In the above video, the team explains how it assembled a lineup of both familiar and lesser-known faces, and how each character keeps things interesting.</p>
<p>We're sure that many people will be coming to this game only with knowledge of Marvel's big-screen appearances, though the team confesses that it has mainly taken inspiration from the comic books. This means that big players like Nova, Phyla-Vell, and Beta Ray Bill might not immediately stand out as the best-known of the bunch, though Tribute Games writer Yannick Belzil says this is completely intentional:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good superhero lineup has very recognisable faces, but lesser-known characters as well, because it makes you lean forward. Like, "Who is she? Who is he? Who's that person?" You want to discover new characters, and we wanted to introduce new characters to our audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of iconic figures in the game as well, and the video does a good job of also spotlighting the likes of Spider-Man, Captain America, Black Panther and Wolverine.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait until next month before we can pick our favourite fighters, but, as with every glimpse at gameplay footage that we get, we like what we're seeing.</p>

                <p>Lego's brick-built Game Boy replica is bound to be one of the most popular gift ideas for retro gaming enthusiasts this holiday. The 421-piece recreation of Nintendo's legendary 1989 handheld is wonderfully designed, fun to build, and looks great on a display shelf. It comes with two buildable games, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and Super Mario Land, which can be loaded into the handheld's Game Pak slot. Swappable lenticular screens recreate moments from each game as well as the Game Boy's boot screen. The $60 price tag makes it one of the most affordable Lego sets made for adults. The Lego Game Boy launched October 1 at the <a href="https://sovrn.co/10gqen0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Store</a> and major retailers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://sovrn.co/pgr7z89" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://sovrn.co/modu1on" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>.</p><p>I spoke with Lego Group Senior Designer Carl Merriam over email about the design of the newest Lego Nintendo display model. Questions and answers are attributed to GameSpot and Lego, respectively.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>I've always been fascinated by the logistics of designing a LEGO set. How do you start? How do designers determine how many pieces each build should have? How do you choose the shapes and sizes of the pieces? Did the Game Boy go through multiple iterations before finding the right design? Can you provide a general overview of how a designer gets from the idea to a finished product?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: We start with an idea. For the LEGO Game Boy the idea was: “Let’s make a LEGO set celebrating the original Nintendo Game Boy.” From there we built several different versions using existing LEGO Bricks. While doing that we determined that we would need a few new LEGO elements. We started developing the new LEGO elements and built many, many, many more versions of the LEGO Game Boy. Eventually we found combinations of pieces that looked like the reference, are stable when built and most importantly are fun to put together.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594904-legogameboydisplay.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594904" data-ratio="0.668" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594904-legogameboydisplay.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594904"></a><figcaption>Lego Game Boy 72046</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594904-legogameboydisplay.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Does the LEGO Game Boy set use any unique pieces not found in other LEGO sets?</p><p dir="ltr"><b>LEGO</b>: We developed a special 4x4 curved LEGO brick for the corner with the speaker, as well as a 6x8 tile for the back plate and a 2x4 bracket to build in the buttons. Many of the other pieces were existing bricks. The start and select buttons are tires, which originally launched in 1969, the A and B buttons are minifigure hats, AND we even managed to include a classic 2x4 brick inside.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>What did Nintendo bring to this design, in terms of knowledge, advice, and secrets?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: We work closely with Nintendo on all LEGO Nintendo products, and the Game Boy was no different. One of the most fun parts was working with Nintendo on what easter eggs to include and what game screens to replicate from Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening. Nintendo provided both design input on the build, as well as reference images of the actual hardware components.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>How important was it to make this set not only look like the Game Boy, but also feel like an accurate replica of a handheld device? At the same time, aspects such as visible studs on the D-pad make it evident this is a LEGO set. I imagine it's critical for a replica to still look like a LEGO set?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: During the development of this set, we built many versions with different levels of functionality. Given the size of the original Game Boy, we were presented with the opportunity to figure out creative ways to include physical functions into the build. During this process, we found that it was possible to make all the controls interactive. My attention then shifted to trying to replicate the haptics of the actual hardware. I started to focus on each of the controls, the buttons, dials and power switch — testing different versions of the build to find the closest simulation of the sensation of holding a real Game Boy.</p><p dir="ltr">The studs on the D-pad are included for two reasons:</p><p dir="ltr">1. We like to include studs to add LEGO DNA, so you can see it is a LEGO model.</p><p dir="ltr">2. That combination of LEGO bricks (with the studs showing) allows the D-pad to be able to tilt as it does on the real Game Boy. Recessing it into the LEGO Game Boy and adding tiles to cover the studs was one of the possible design choices, but that would remove the functionality.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Are the buildable cartridges the same size as actual Game Boy games? If so, can the cartridge slot hold real games?</p><p dir="ltr"><b>LEGO</b>: Unfortunately not. The real Game Pak is slightly too big to fit into the LEGO Game Boy set.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594905-legogameboy2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594905" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594905-legogameboy2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594905"></a><figcaption>Lego's building set is a near 1:1 recreation of Nintendo's Game Boy DMG.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594905-legogameboy2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Were Link's Awakening and Super Mario Land always the cartridge choices, or were other games in the running? What's your personal favorite Game Boy game?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: After looking at several different games, we landed on these two first-party games to celebrate our longstanding partnership with Nintendo.</p><p dir="ltr">Link’s Awakening is my personal favorite Game Boy game. I have a vivid memory of calling the Nintendo hotline for some help getting the Hookshot while playing it.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>What's the smallest detail on this set that you're most proud of? What was the biggest challenge you faced?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO:</strong> I used all my powers as both a veteran LEGO designer and a lifelong LEGO fan to make this set as excellent as possible, so there are lots of favorite things to choose from. If I have to pick just one... it has to be the power switch function. While working on this set, I focused on replicating all the haptics of the real Game Boy as closely as possible. I tried to make all the buttons press-able and the dials turn-able, but getting that power switch to slide and click like the real one... that is my favorite feature.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest challenge I faced was trying to replicate the dimensions of the real Game Boy. The closest LEGO dimensions to the form factor of the real Game Boy are: 11 studs wide by 18 studs long by 3.6 studs deep. Dimensions for LEGO Bricks tend to be in even numbers, so finding the right combination of elements to put the screen and screen surrounding in the center of the device was a real brain teaser.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Besides the Game Boy, what's your favorite LEGO Nintendo set?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: It has to be the LEGO Super Mario Desert Pokey (71363). I love this set, it is so amazing how well it replicates the interaction with the Desert Pokey from the Super Mario games in real life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594901-legogameboylenticular.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594901" data-ratio="0.668" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594901-legogameboylenticular.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594901"></a><figcaption>The Lego Game Boy includes three lenticular screen panels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594901-legogameboylenticular.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Lego Game Boy is the eighth <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DX3J6MT7,B0DRW6K649,B0CYM2V9FS,B0BXQ3M8JH,B0B2Y3WNH4,B0DF857JZ9,B08FCW3SB7,B09FMVDHDM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially licensed Nintendo building set designed for adults</a> and the second to release in 2025.

One such quest called Straight Record comes from Celeste, who sends you topside in the Dam Battlegrounds to turn on an old EMP. This task will require you to not only find the old EMP but also turn on multiple switches to get it going again--so if you're struggling to find them, we've got you covered. Here's how to complete the Straight Record quest in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find the old EMP trap for the Straight Record quest</h2><p>Completing the Straight Record quest does not require you to extract. As such, feel free to spawn into the raid using a free loadout to avoid any loss of resources in the event that you perish from enemies or other players while trying to get it finished.</p><p>Your first goal in Straight Record is to find the old EMP trap in the Victory Ridge area. This spot is located in the upper left side of the map just slightly southwest of the West Broken Ridge POI. Reaching this location shouldn't prove too difficult, though you may need to fend off a raider or two also doing the quest--or work together, if that's more your speed.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596490-arcraiders_20251104141541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596491-arcraiders_20251104141554.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596490,1300-4596491" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596490-arcraiders_20251104141541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596491-arcraiders_20251104141554.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596490-arcraiders_20251104141541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596491-arcraiders_20251104141554.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive, you'll spot a tall, thin machine with wires wrapped around it. This is the old EMP, and you'll simply need to interact with it to discover that it's not powered on yet. This will begin the next part of the quest.</p><h2>Where to find the power switches for the Straight Record quest</h2><p>There are three power switches you'll need to turn on before you can activate the old EMP. They're all close by, though, so you won't need to venture far to get them turned on.</p><p>The first switch can be found on a small cliff just north of the old EMP. You can walk around the outside of the cliff to reach it. Interact with it to turn it on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596492-arcraiders_20251104141727.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596492" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596492-arcraiders_20251104141727.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596492"></a><figcaption>First switch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596492-arcraiders_20251104141727.jpg"></figure><p>The second switch is located just east of the old EMP on a collapsed structure.

You'll find it directly next to a tree, so go ahead and turn it on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596493-arcraiders_20251104141753.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596493" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596493-arcraiders_20251104141753.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596493"></a><figcaption>Third switch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596493-arcraiders_20251104141753.jpg"></figure><p>With all of the switches found, you're ready to return to the old EMP. Interact with it once more to complete the quest.</p><p>With the quest complete, you can decide whether you'd like to go loot some more before extracting, or simply head to the North Complex Elevator to the northeast to get the hell out of dodge before any other players come try to take you out. Either way, don't let your guard down, raider!</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full quest list</a>.</p>

Perhaps the most substantial of these is A First Foothold, which asks you to visit four locations across Blue Gate. Each of these is on a completely different side of the map (north, east, south, west). It's a lengthy quest that may prove dangerous, but we're here to help you figure it out.</p><p>Luckily, you won't need to visit all of these locations in a single raid, meaning you can always knock out the tasks across multiple visits if you prefer. You also don't need to extract for any of them to count, so feel free to handle this with a free loadout that you don't mind losing if things get hairy.</p><p>Here's how to finish all four requirements to complete A First Foothold.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Stabilize_the_observation_deck_near_the_Ridgeline">Stabilize the observation deck near the Ridgeline</a></li><li><a href="#Enable_the_comms_terminal_near_the_Olive_Grove">Enable the comms terminal near the Olive Grove</a></li><li><a href="#Nail_down_the_roof_plates_on_the_Raider_structure_near_Trapper_s_Glade">Nail down the roof plates on the Raider structure near Trapper's Glade</a></li><li><a href="#Rotate_the_satellite_dishes_on_the_church_roof__north_of_the_Data_Vault">Rotate the satellite dishes on the church roof, north of the Data Vault</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Stabilize_the_observation_deck_near_the_Ridgeline">Stabilize the observation deck near the Ridgeline</h2><p>The Ridgeline is located on the eastern portion of Blue Gate.

Early-Bird tickets will go on sale starting <strong>November 7 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET</strong>, and are priced at $250 for both days of the fan expo. This includes taxes and fees, and it comes with commemorative in-game items as a bonus.</p><p>These tickets will be sold while supplies last, after which, Blizzard will sell a standard ticket weekend pass for $290 starting November 18. This is $10 cheaper than the standard tickets sold for BlizzCon 2023, and it also offers full two-day weekend admission to BlizzCon on both Saturday and Sunday.</p><p>Fans looking to upgrade their experience can purchase a $500 ticket to BlizzCon Charity Night, an exclusive event with Blizzard developers, artists, and community representatives. This does not include access to the convention, and proceeds will go to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p><p>There'll also be the Darkmoon Faire After Hours experience, an optional add-on that grants you entry to an exclusive three-hour event on the Saturday of BlizzCon.

Beyond that, the convention will see the return of the Blizzard Arcade, developer panels, and hands-on gameplay sessions for games like World of Warcraft, Diablo IV, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal. Presumably, these titles will have new content revealed for them, explaining their presence on the showfloor.</p><p>Last year, Blizzard said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/">it had decided to not hold a BlizzCon 2024 "after careful consideration."</a> The show has been held on and off again throughout the 2020s, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. BlizzCon 2022 was a digital-only presentation, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2023-tickets-start-at-300-first-show-details-revealed/1100-6515587/">BlizzCon 2023</a> was a traditional in-person event.

That's where Scrappy comes in. This little rooster hangs out at Speranza and gathers resources for you passively, which you can then claim each time you finish a raid. You'll want to make the most of this helpful little guy by upgrading him so he can provide you with faster accumulation of materials. Here's what you need to know about all of Scrappy's upgrades and where to find the items needed for them.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#All_Scrappy_upgrade_tiers_and_requirements">All Scrappy upgrade tiers and requirements</a><ul><li><a href="#Level_1">Level 1</a></li><li><a href="#Level_2">Level 2</a></li><li><a href="#Level_3">Level 3</a></li><li><a href="#Level_4">Level 4</a></li><li><a href="#Level_5">Level 5</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Where_to_find_all_Scrappy_upgrade_items">Where to find all Scrappy upgrade items</a><ul><li><a href="#Where_to_find_a_Dog_Collar_and_Cat_Bed">Where to find a Dog Collar and Cat Bed</a></li><li><a href="#Where_to_find_a_Very_Comfortable_Pillow">Where to find a Very Comfortable Pillow</a></li><li><a href="#Where_to_find_Lemon__Apricot__and_Olive_trees">Where to find Lemon, Apricot, and Olive trees</a></li><li><a href="#Where_to_find_Prickly_Pears">Where to find Prickly Pears</a></li><li><a href="#Where_to_find_Mushrooms">Where to find Mushrooms</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="All_Scrappy_upgrade_tiers_and_requirements">All Scrappy upgrade tiers and requirements</h2><p>Scrappy has five tiers, with each upgrade providing faster production of resource materials.

Two common spots to round these up include the Testing Annex in Dam Battlegrounds and the Hospital in Buried City.</p><h3 id="Where_to_find_Lemon__Apricot__and_Olive_trees">Where to find Lemon, Apricot, and Olive trees</h3><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-get-lemons-and-apricots-in-arc-raiders/1100-6535901/" data-ref-id="1100-6535901">Lemons, Apricots, and Olives</a> grow on trees across multiple maps. While you can certainly find Lemons and Apricots early by looking hard enough in the swampy areas of Dam Battlegrounds, you'll have a much easier time collecting all of these fruits on the Blue Gate map.</p><p>Lemon and Apricot trees can be found in the Village POI in the northern section of Blue Gate. This is a high traffic area, though, and the trees are mostly found in the village's center, meaning you may be spotted by patrolling ARC or other raiders. Approach this location with caution. Try to get in, snag what you need, and get out. Don't forget to kick the trees when applicable to drop extra fruits!</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596914-share_20251105_0434193.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596915-share_20251105_0434182.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4596914,1300-4596915" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596914-share_20251105_0434193.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596915-share_20251105_0434182.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596914-share_20251105_0434193.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596915-share_20251105_0434182.jpeg"></figure><p>Olives can be found very easily in the Olive Grove area in the south of the map. Simply wander around this area searching the ground beneath the trees and kicking them when possible to drop additional Olives. You may also spot a few Apricot or Lemon trees in this area, making it a great spot for obtaining all these fruits at once.</p><p>As a side note, even if you're just on Scrappy's second-tier upgrade, make sure you stock up on a lot of Apricots while looting, as you'll need a lot more for his fourth-tier upgrade.</p><h3 id="Where_to_find_Prickly_Pears">Where to find Prickly Pears</h3><p>Prickly Pears are found near cacti, which can be found all over the maps in Arc Raiders. However, the best spots to search tend to be on the outer perimeters of the Dam Battlegrounds and Buried City maps, especially in the northern part of the former and all along the southern section of the latter.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596918-share_20251105_0434160-copy.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596920-share_20251105_0435380.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4596918,1300-4596920" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596918-share_20251105_0434160-copy.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596920-share_20251105_0435380.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596918-share_20251105_0434160-copy.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596920-share_20251105_0435380.jpeg"></figure><p>You'll find numerous cactus spawns all across these outer sections, though actual Prickly Pear spawns are far less generous. Just keep at it, though, and you'll eventually find enough to make Scrappy happy.</p><h3 id="Where_to_find_Mushrooms">Where to find Mushrooms</h3><p>Mushrooms are likely to be the hardest resource to find for Scrappy's upgrades. These spawn in damp areas across multiple maps, but they're quite contested since everyone needs so many of them. It's best to be ready for a fight if you're searching in any area known for Mushroom spawns.</p><p>Generally, your best bet for finding Mushrooms will be on Dam Battlegrounds. You can catch them growing on trees throughout the swamp area on the left side of the map, but some better locations to look include the Wreckage in the southeast and inside the Water Treatment Center.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596911-share_20251105_0434432.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596912-share_20251105_0434421.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4596911,1300-4596912" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596911-share_20251105_0434432.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596912-share_20251105_0434421.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596911-share_20251105_0434432.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596912-share_20251105_0434421.jpeg"></figure><p>For the Water Treatment Center, head to the interior hallways and follow the pipes. Mushrooms will often be growing beneath or on these pipes, so you're likely to find at least one per visit if you're searching thoroughly enough. Again, however, remember you may run into other raiders here, so don't let your guard down.</p><p>For more on this extraction shooter, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

            <p>
I might not be massively into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> these days, but if there's one thing guaranteed to pique my interest in <em>anything</em>, it's a Disney Haunted Mansion crossover. So as someone who's been obsessed with the now five-and-a-half-decade-old theme park attraction since the age of three, it looks like a reinstall is on the cards. Epic has announced a "playful" new Fortnite experience celebrating Disneyland's 70th anniversary is launching 6th November.
</p>
<p>
Hints that something Haunted Mansion was afoot first surfaced on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/disneyparks/">official Disneyparks Instagram feed</a>, which shared an image of the attraction's iconic stretch room paintings, reimagined to include Fortnite characters like Peely and Fishstick. "This lobby has no windows and no doors", read the caption, suggesting the real chills, as they say, would come later.

<p>
And that 'later' didn't take long to arrive. Before we could even finish pondering why all this missed Halloween, Disney and Epic provided an answer: simply, there's more to it than those 999 happy haunts. The Haunted Mansion is coming to Fortnite this week as part of the newly announced Disneyland Game Rush; a "playful, limited-time" Fortnite Creative island "experience" designed to celebrate Disneyland's 70th Anniversary.
</p>
<p>
Starting in a Disneyland-inspired hub - featuring a central sculpture modelled on Sleeping Beauty Castle and a skyline of familiar resort landmarks - up to 11 players can branch off to explore one of seven "quick-play" mini-games. Haunted Mansion fans get Scavenger Haunt, Space Mountain is represented by Rocket Race, there's the Matterhorn: Slip-and-Climb, Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Sneak Out, Star Wars: Stormtrooper Showdown, Indiana Jones: Tomb Runner, and WEB-Slingers: Spider-Bot Blasters. By completing these mini-games, it's possible to unlock island-specific cosmetics, so if I don't get to manifest my head in a hatbox, I'll be wildly disappointed.

<p>
Speaking of disappointment, I was all ready to be a grump about the fact Scavenger Hunt wasn't exactly the massive Haunted Mansion Fortnite blow-out I was envisaging after seeing that original Disneyparks post, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-disneyland-game-rush-is-an-incredibly-authentic-first-step-into-fortnite-for-disney-parks">IGN has screenshots</a> of Disneyland Game Rush - complete with waltzing dinner party ghosts and, YES, a hatbox - and it actually looks pretty neat. 
</p><p>
Disneyland Game Rush launches on 6th July (you can find it using island code 4617-4819-8826) and serves as something of a prelude for the main event. Announced in February last year, Disney has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">partnered with Epic</a> to create an "expansive and open games and entertainment universe connected to Fortnite" which - judging by its concept art - looks very much like a virtual theme park. Perhaps we'll have more news on that soon.

<p>It's not a very long wait, which is nice, and maybe this will prove to be the perfect game to experience after the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> on 4th December.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that Marvel Games and PlayStation's Insomniac Games have a good relationship. We wouldn't have three <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">Marvel's Spider-Man games</a> and one upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">Marvel's Wolverine game</a> without a strong relationship between both companies, and in a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/11/04/general-manager-sheds-light-on-future-of-marvel-games">Game Informer</a>, we got a bit more insight into just how good Marvel feels about the relationship.</p>



<p>General manager of Marvel Games, Haluk Mentes, spoke at length about the importance of Marvel Games and the studios it collaborates with being aligned in their approach to making anything with Marvel characters, and making something that is authentically Marvel.</p>



<p>"<em>The challenge is more complex: authenticity doesn't necessarily mean one-to-one fidelity to source or reference material, whether it's comics or animation or movies. It's much deeper in that we allow our collaborating teams to reimagine 'familiar yet original' incarnations of our characters based on their own creative DNA...We absolutely do not want to be derivative. Otherwise, what's the point of working with some of the best talent out there?</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>There’s a great sense of responsibility at play here: Marvel is an almost 90-year-old creative brand, yet it’s as fresh as ever because during all that time, each new generation grew up with Marvel, ultimately became creators and left their mark, and then passed the torch to the next generation.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We also actively seek collaborators that want to take on the same mantle. As is usually the case, once we complete a project together, they, too, become “Marvel.” Marvel’s Wolverine with our dear friends at Insomniac Games is perhaps the epitome of this philosophy. We have been working together for more than a decade and developed such a shorthand across multiple Marvel’s Spider-Man games that when the time finally came to bring Logan back in spectacular and visceral fashion, it was obvious to everyone on our team that Insomniac was the perfect choice. It was our shared culture and values that brought us together, and we’re so proud to continue collaborating for many years to come.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-foresees-more-acquisitions-in-its-future.1344625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that making more studio acquisitions will form a key part of its business strategy in future, so it looks like we can expect to see more Nintendo subsidiaries popping up before too long.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">supplementary document</a> accompanying the Japanese gaming giant's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-dk-bananza-switch-2-sales" rel="nofollow">latest financial results</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa sets out how he intends to strengthen Nintendo's "business foundation".</p>

<p>Part of those efforts, Furukawa says, will be "acquiring development companies to make them subsidiaries", as well as "augmenting [Nintendo's] development facilities", all of which is intended to help "strengthen the internal game development organization" within Nintendo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-developer-acquisitions-xenoblade-chronicles-x.jpg?itok=5r_72rHj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-developer-acquisitions-xenoblade-chronicles-x.jpg?itok=r6Ac6BsK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More Nintendo subsidiaries, like&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>developer Monolith Soft, appear to be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>Other initiatives Nintendo is putting into effect to strengthen its business end include "building software assets in non-game entertainment", i.e. pursuing opportunities related to other media, and "maintaining and expanding [its] relationship with consumers".</p>

<p>Some of Nintendo's existing subsidiaries include the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/luigis-mansion-3" rel="nofollow">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mario-strikers-battle-league" rel="nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Next Level Games, as well as Monolith Soft, the studio responsible for the&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>series of RPGs.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant also owns Retro Studios, the developer to whom work on&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-reboots-metroid-prime-4-hands-development-to-retro-studios" rel="nofollow">handed back in 2019</a>. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">hotly-anticipated first-person shooter</a> is set to finally launch next month.</p>

<p>Some studios that technically aren't Nintendo subsidiaries, despite frequently working with the publisher, include&nbsp;<em>Kirby</em>'s HAL Laboratory,&nbsp;<em>Mario Tennis&nbsp;</em>developer Camelot Software Planning, and Masahiro Sakurai's Sora Limited, all of which could be potential contenders for Nintendo's next acquisition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-developer-acquisitions.jpg?itok=ZIdeiMRY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-developer-acquisitions.jpg?itok=AlL2_haB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>developer Sora be next on Nintendo's list of acquisitions?</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's pledge to acquire more developers comes after initial numbers indicate that the Switch 2, which was released back in June, is a roaring success for the company. Reportedly, Nintendo has asked its manufacturing partners to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report" rel="nofollow">produce 25 million units of the console by March</a>.</p>

<p>The news also comes after Doug Bowser, who was appointed as president of the company's American division in 2019, will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-of-america-doug-bowser-retiring" rel="nofollow">step down at the end of the year</a>. His role will be taken by Devon Pritchard, who's currently serving as NOA's revenue and marketing executive VP.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a new update for its PlayStation Portal device that allows you to stream PS5 games without needing your main console handy, but you'll have to be a PlayStation Plus Premium member to use it.</p>

<p>As outlined in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the update, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update" rel="nofollow">entered beta last year</a>, is being released today at 6pm Pacific (so you'll need to wait until 2am tomorrow morning if you're in the UK like me).</p>

<p>If you're a PS Plus Premium member, you can now stream PS5 games from your own library; not every game is supported, but Sony says the feature is available for "thousands of PS5 games", including the likes of&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, and the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-menu.jpg?itok=2hG2ghhE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-menu.jpg?itok=s3AKgPDY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games can now be streamed directly to your PlayStation Portal.</figcaption></figure><p>Prior to the update, you could only stream games to your PlayStation Portal if you were near your corresponding PS5, but you can now do so anywhere with a high-speed internet connection.</p>

<p>You'll also find a brand new home screen for the Portal as part of this update, with a brand new dedicated Cloud Streaming menu that shows which games can be streamed to your device without needing to connect to a PS5.</p>

<p>As well as the new Cloud Streaming stuff, the latest update also brings new features for both Remote Play and Cloud Streaming, including 3D audio support, a new passcode lock system to protect your Portal, and a network status screen that displays connection quality.</p>

<p>Cloud streaming additions include support for in-game purchases, new accessibility options, and the chance to receive game invitations from friends who are playing the same game as you. What a time to be alive, eh?</p>




<p>This latest PlayStation Portal update will be released today at 6pm Pacific/9pm Eastern, and it arguably brings the device one step closer to that dedicated Sony handheld <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-playstation-portal-gets-release-date-while-fans-keep-asking-for-real-portable" rel="nofollow">some fans have been clamoring for</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%98s-drone-glitch-is-still-ruining-matches.1344610/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve been playing a lot of <em>Battlefield 6</em> recently, and during nearly every session, my friends and I run into at least one group of players taking advantage of an easy-to-pull-off drone glitch that lets you get to areas that are normally impossible to reach. It’s been a problem basically since EA’s FPS launched last month, and it’s shocking that it’s still an issue weeks later.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launched on October 10. And less than a week later, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o83uar/friends_reaction_to_the_drone_exploit_is_priceless/">there were already posts on Reddit</a> of people using a newly discovered glitch to reach rooftops that shouldn’t be accessible on maps like Iberian Offensive. All you have to do is have a recon player plop down their remote drone, get another player (or two) to stand on the drone, and then smack it with the sledgehammer as the drone flies up. This will send the players and the drone upward, allowing people to then hop off the drone onto roofs, towers, and other out-of-the-way spots easily. Then squadmates can spawn on that player, drop ammo, respawn beacons, and rain lead and explosives down on players below who have very limited ways to counter.</p>

  <p>After numerous <em>Battlefield 6</em> updates and patches, nearly four weeks after it was discovered, the drone glitch is still a problem. The bug isn’t useful on every map or mode, but it can ruin certain maps if many squads are doing the glitch. I played one match where running around on the ground was like exploring a ghost town, as most players were drone glitching and sniping.</p>

 <p>Another recent match with friends on Iberian Offensive saw two enemy squads use the drone glitch to start racking up kills. Eventually, we decided to become rooftop police and used the glitch ourselves to hunt the other players down, and then hid a beacon up there so we could periodically check in and make sure they weren’t using the drone glitch. It was kind of funny, but when it happened again after that night, we were all so tired of it. Players in chat were also fed up, sharing angry messages about how it was annoying that EA and Battlefield Studios hadn’t fixed this bug or at least turned off the sledgehammer or drone while a fix is developed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oj4ai3/drone_exploit_is_still_in_the_game_i_have_no_words/">You can find similar posts on the BF subreddit</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oiq26f/this_glitch_is_ruining_battlefield_6_experience/">where players frequently complain</a> that the bug is still a problem after weeks of <a href="https://forums.ea.com/idea/battlefield-6-bug-reports-en/drone-glitch---iberian-offensive-map---to-fix/12874527">players sharing videos and screenshots of it in action.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>At the very least, we know the drone glitch is going to be removed eventually. On November 5, <em>Battlefield 6</em> lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986037795308343366">confirmed that it had been fixed</a> and that the fix would be applied in <em>BF6</em>‘s next patch. He wouldn’t say when to expect that patch, but considering how frequently EA has been updating the shooter since launch, I doubt the wait will be long. And that’s great, as <em>BF6</em>‘s drone glitch has been a problem for too long.</p>

<p><strong>Universal ways to buy the Pokémon Phantasmal Flames ETB are using the Pokémon Center, online retailers, resellers, or hoping for the best with physical stores.</strong></p>



<p>Using a reseller should be your last hope, as they will be resold for extortionate amounts. Pokémon Center stock is usually hit or miss, and you might have to have real-life battles with other collectors for in-store ETB boxes!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have plans to tweak aim assist settings for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> controller users – but that hasn’t stopped PC players from digging into the files to turn off crossplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson <a href="https://x.com/The_n0ttus/status/1985520194148802793" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed</u></a> BF Studios would be “reverting back” to open beta controller aim assist settings in an X/Twitter post earlier this week. It’s a major change, especially for those on console, that fans have pleaded for since Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Far less stickiness so it does not create that rotational persistence that is currently live. Consistent slow down, no ramp. Recoil reduction is a separate system from AA but will be getting adjusted also once the new tech is online.</p>— Matthew Nickerson (@The_n0ttus) <a href="https://twitter.com/The_n0ttus/status/1985523272935735804?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Nickerson says the change back to open beta settings will arrive “shortly,” adding that recoil reduction adjustments are also coming soon. Although PC and console players have disagreed on how aim assist has changed since the August open beta tests, many feel the settings have been tweaked for the worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the beta, aiming and shooting felt really satisfying, but now the aim feels completely different,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o5kwn3/is_it_just_me_or_does_the_aiming_feel_completely/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular comment</u></a> posted shortly after launch says. “Making micro-adjustments is harder; I find myself fighting with the aim.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m not the greatest on controller but I’m pretty good and I can also say confidently that this problem did not exist in the beta,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o5mbs0/something_seriously_wrong_with_bf6_aim_assist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comment at the time</u></a> said. “Aiming and aim assist felt perfectly fine on controller.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios has made more than a few adjustments to Battlefield 6 that have had players up in arms, but the post-beta changes related to aim assist have been especially controversial. They’ve been so divisive, in fact, that some PC players recently started tearing through the game’s files just to avoid players using the controller assistance feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The workaround comes from content creator and X user @otterTweets, who <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1985715884455817538" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>revealed the method</u></a> for those who are “tired of OP aim assist.” They say diving into the files at “documents/battlefield 6/settings/steam/PROFSAVE” and adding “GstGameplay.CrossPlayEnable 0” turns off crossplay completely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, unsurprisingly, a catch for those who do this, though. Ottr says turning Battlefield 6 PC crossplay off drops affected players into lobbies populated with bots instead of real-world players. If enough PC users switch crossplay off, they could theoretically begin playing with more actual players, but it could take some time to really catch on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With EA and BF Studios actively preparing to release aim assist tweaks for controller users in Battlefield 6, PC players may want to hold off on finding their own ways to sneakily turn off crossplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s taken five years for Pablo Clark to design and refine and illustrate The Old King’s Crown, his very first board game. Over that time, whispers have been growing among playtesters and convention crowds that this title, where players take the role of asymmetric factions competing to win the rulership of a fantasy kingdom, was something special. Something, certainly, that was better than we had any right to expect of a first-time designer. Now after a self-publishing <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yGYp6?object_uuid=f0d6abee-5dc3-4c4c-a98f-7950a303dab2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a> run, it’s finally here, and we can explore Clark’s kingdom in all its glory.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/old-kings-crown-contents-1762351601127.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no discussing The Old King’s Crown without first talking about the art. It’s right there on the box lid, after all, and it is stupendous. Rich with color and detail, stylized yet recognizable, bringing to life in glorious precision a world that has never existed. The fact that the designer is also the artist just makes you wonder how he got to the front of the queue when talent was given out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even when you slide off that sumptuous box lid, the art is everywhere within, almost every picture adding to the story and the setting. It’s on the board, which is a window from a high tower looking down on the provinces of a kingdom in civil war, as though players are plotting in their fastnesses while the people suffer. It’s on the deck of tarot-sized cards for each faction, filling in the wide narrative gaps in the brief rundown given to the setting in the rulebook. It’s on all the kingdom cards, faction-neutral buffs available for players to pick up. And it’s all astonishing: every time you play, you’ll notice something new.</p><div catalogid="87d6e367-43c9-48ae-b67f-213da2b5fae4" id="230074"><div id="230074" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Old King's Crown</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All the graphic design and component quality here is sumptuous and spellbinding. The layout of the rulebook with its pictorial examples, the way the board carefully walks you through the stages of each turn, the pleasing color and layout of each faction's markers and central board, embossed with pockets to hold cards and chunky, printed wooden pieces of the matching color. The remaining few generic items: a turn marker, clash order markers and a few other bits and pieces are simple black-and-gold wood. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assembled as a whole, it takes up a massive chunk of table space – but it looks incredible, a wood-and-cardboard invitation to stop and stare, a whole world laid out in squares and circles for those who take the time to look and appreciate.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/pxl-20251017-220916954-1762351693931.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is quite a complex game, but the complexity is in the sheer information density available rather than the core flow of play, which is relatively straightforward. Games last a fixed number of turns, normally five, and each turn is broken down into four seasons. The meat of proceedings takes place in summer, where players will fight over three locations, each of which has two possible rewards, to be chosen by the victor. First, in turn order, players place their herald into one of the victory spots, which will bring them bonus points if they win there. They can then place some of their small pool of supporters in a location, which provide a small combat bonus. Then it’s time for the card play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All players start with functionally identical card decks from which they draw a hand of six. Everyone places a card, face down, next to each location. Then they’re resolved one at a time, with everyone flipping over a card and adding the number on that card to the number of supporter pieces there. Highest total wins. Except, very often, it doesn’t. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s no discussing The Old King’s Crown without first talking about the art... It is stupendous.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason for this is that many cards have action icons which can be invoked to complicate matters. Ambush, for example, lets the owner play a second card into the melee. Flank lets that card slide out of the current combat and into a future one. There are others, but most terrifying of all is Deadly, which takes place after all other actions and kills enemy cards, putting them out of the game and into the dreadful “lost pile” for the remainder of play unless they have a helmet or shield icon, the latter of which also keeps them in the fray for that location.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/pxl-20251017-220908515-1762351715288.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to overstate quite how taut this is. Someone flips the cards and all at once everyone’s craning over the massive board, desperate to decode the game’s intricate array of symbology to work out who’s in contention and what the next steps might be. Combats that are decided by ambush, or value ties which are resolved with additional card play, crank the excitement up even more, as do deadly attacks which can see critical cards assigned to the lost pile forever. And then when it comes to heralds, the stakes just go through the roof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the locations score you influence, the game’s name for victory points. But if you win in a space where you’ve placed your herald, you get an extra point. And if you win in a space where you and others have placed their heralds, you get to take a victory point off each of those poor unfortunates. This is a game where a winning tally can be 15-20 points, so actually taking points off other people to add to your own is huge. A well-calculated herald placement can swing you from last place to first in one fell swoop, ensuring that everyone is in contention, right up until the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, this invites all kinds of scheming. Discard piles are public information, so you can grub around in people’s trash, seeing if they’ve played that deadly card or whether it might be lurking in their hand, still, to screw you over. It’s also possible for players to buy additional cards to add to their deck, which not only come from asymmetric stacks tailored to your faction, but can add even more wrinkles to the formula, like making it lowest card wins instead. You’ll need to keep an incredibly sharp eye on what everyone else is doing if you want to minimize the chance of nasty surprises.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/pxl-20251017-202658346-1762351731206.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Buying new cards is only one way in which the game’s asymmetry shows. Each faction has a set of four special one-use powers, plus a fifth that you can invoke if you win a particular location. They’re all unique, and roughly aligned to that faction’s thematic play style. The Gathering, which represents the cult-like state religion, can swap the positions of two cards in combat, or sacrifice cards into the lost pile in order to gain resources to buy more cards. The uprising, by contrast, which is a revolution of the state’s common folk, can give cards the deadly effect, or the retreat effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you begin to weave together the various unique card effects, asymmetry, special powers, and location victory effects you can begin to see all sorts of ways you can influence not only individual clashes but the game state as a whole. Your hand size will drop as the game progresses, except you can arrange things so it doesn’t. You’ll lose supporters, unless you find a way to gain them back. If you buy enough new cards you’ll get a point bonus, but you’ll have to make big sacrifices to do it. The number of ways you can approach The Old King’s Crown and still win is absolutely jaw-dropping, almost mind-crushing in its loops within loops within loops.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The number of ways you can approach The Old King’s Crown and still win is absolutely jaw-dropping.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And still there’s more! We’ve only really covered the summer turn so far. In spring, players use cards to bid in a selection of kingdom cards, most of which are game-breaking in their own right. They can let you swap cards you’ve drawn for one in the lost pile, steal other player’s special powers, or give your cards extra effects. Each is easily enough to build a strategy around by itself, but you can hold up to two of them. Except that after the initial bid, you can steal kingdom cards off other players instead of taking a fresh one, forcing them, and you, to replan on the fly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the autumn you can send cards journeying, which gives you the chance to buy more cards, or you can send them to council, where they stay and give a long-term special ability. This can mean potentially more points if you win with your herald, the chance to grab supporters back, or other effects. Finally winter is just a bookkeeping phase and, frankly, a chance to catch your breath after the absolute <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic</a> and social insanity of an entire round of The Old King’s Crown.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/pxl-20251017-220935670-1762351747833.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is not an exaggeration. While there’s a staggering amount to enjoy here, the sheer quantity of detail you need to take into your stride to maximize your chances is almost overwhelming. You need to be on top of your own special powers and special cards, along with everyone else’s, what they’re buying, what they’re playing, what’s in their discard pile or the lost pile. You need to be cognizant of each player’s kingdom cards, what they do and what you need to bid to steal them, or protect your own. Initially this seems impossible. It gets easier with practice but you’ll need to play an incredible amount of this game if you want to properly internalize it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don’t, however, need to do all that in order to win. It’s perfectly fine to play from the hip more, although the reams of detail will nag at the edges of your thought processes as you do so. And you can get away with it because, fundamentally, you can check every discard pile in the game and still not be certain whether a player has just thrown down their deadly card into a herald location or whether it’s a tricky bluff. You can do very well just by reading faces, voices, and body language. And that creates a strange tension at the heart of The Old King’s Crown: it’s a game that gives you the most astonishing range and leverage to build strategies, and then lets other players pull the rug out from under you with a cunning bluff.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/pxl-20251017-220855966-1762351770916.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGr26q?object_uuid=f0d6abee-5dc3-4c4c-a98f-7950a303dab2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Waterstones</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 5, 2025 4:09 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">In a market crammed with identikit optimization games and party titles, it’s rare to be able to say this but there is nothing else out there like The Old King’s Crown, neither visually nor mechanically. This is a grab bag of concepts from all sorts of other games, each given a loving polish and shape to fit it into a greater whole, wrapped in the most amazing eye candy, creating a unique package. To do justice to it, it’ll need to be on your table for weeks as you come to grips with its intricacies. Some players may find the information density overwhelming. Others may find the central dichotomy of having such a rich information density that can be torn apart by a simple bluff frustrating. But however you end up feeling about it, it’s worth experiencing for its sheer sensual and experiential overload.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-old-kings-crown-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>
