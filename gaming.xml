For many, sharing their creations on social easily from their Switch consoles at just a few button presses is one of the great joys of modern gaming.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Purchases-Subscriptions/Games/Information-Regarding-Image-Sharing-Features-in-Tomodachi-Life-Living-the-Dream-3016504.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=TomodachiLifeLivingTheDream%7CNULL%7CNDirectImageSharingNotice%7Cm_id_MWjeHHp9KL%7C3016504">Nintendo has announced</a> that it's implementing a handful restrictions on image sharing for the game. In a vague statement on its support pages, Nintendo says that in its commitment "to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone", it's placing "restrictions on certain image sharing features".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rgspzm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's the full statement from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo aims to create experiences where players have the freedom to enjoy their Mii characters in their own way. In <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> this freedom can sometimes lead to humorous, surprising or unpredictable moments during gameplay.</p>
<p>While these moments are often fun for players, we recognise that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>
<p>Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image sharing features. These limits help to make the worlds players create in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players.</p>
<p>We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting. However, they reflect Nintendo’s ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, not very specific! But Nintendo does outline things a little more clearly over on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">Japanese website</a> (via machine translation): "The console's functions for transferring images to smartphones, posting directly to social media, and automatically uploading images (Nintendo Switch 2 only) will not be available".</p>
<p>Essentially, automatic transfer to the Nintendo Switch app (on Switch 2), as well as transferring images to your smartphone or posting from your console directly to social media (for both consoles) will be disabled. GameChat on Switch 2 and streaming the game on Twitch or YouTube won't be restricted.</p>
<p>You can, of course, still take screenshots (at least, we assume so) and use your SD card or connect your Switch console to your PC to transfer photos to your computer and <em>then</em> share them online, but it certainly adds a few extra steps to the process of sharing your ideas and screenshots.</p>

<p>So, why is Nintendo doing this? We can only speculate, but those of you who remember <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/nintendo_letter_box">Swapnote</a> might recall that the drawing and photo-sharing service was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/11/nintendo_disables_swapnotes_spotpass_service_due_to_online_safety_concerns">disabled in 2013</a> as it was being used "to exchange offensive material". We have to imagine the company is trying to prevent fans from doing this again, from sharing potentially rude and lewd designs and harmful imagery.</p>
<p>Considering all of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">additions</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-will-allow-same-sex-relationships-and-non-binary-miis">inclusivity</a>, and creativity coming to this Switch sequel, it seems like a strange decision. For a game as social as Tomodachi Life, taking out the convenience of screenshot sharing a little frustrating. It can still be done of course, but it'll just take a little more effort.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[World of Warcraft: Midnight Roadmap Unveiled as Blizzard Teases “One for the Ages” BlizzCon 2026]]></title>

            <guid>1420051</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The first of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Blizzard</strong> showcases planned for the <strong>studio's 35th anniversary</strong></a> is dedicated to its golden goose, the 21-year-old MMORPG <strong>World of Warcraft</strong>. The so-called <strong>State of Azeroth</strong> livestream opened with Executive Producer <strong>Holly Longdale</strong> revealing that, in the first two weeks of early access to <strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight</strong>'s new <strong>Housing</strong> feature, players <strong>spent over four million hours in player housing</strong> (450 cumulative years, basically) and <strong>placed more than 14 million décor items</strong> in their new homes. So far, the most popular item was the Secretive Bookcase Wall.</p>



<p>Longdale then switched to talk a bit about <strong>WoW Classic</strong>, which is currently at the <strong>Mists of Pandaria</strong> expansion. The next major update, the <strong>Escalation</strong> patch, will be released in a few weeks, introducing a new quest campaign, the Battlefield: Barrens world event, the new Challenge Cards system and new bosses in the Brawler's Guild, four new scenarios and Heroic scenarios, and progression to the Legendary questline. Later this year, WoW Classic players can look forward to the arrival of the Siege of Orgrimmar and Timeless Isle. Meanwhile, the launch of <strong>The Burning Crusade Classic</strong> on the <strong>Anniversary Realms</strong> is very close, featuring iconic Outlands content.</p>



<p>The State of Azeroth livestream then featured Senior Game Director <strong>Ion Hazzikostas</strong>, who appeared to outline the roadmap <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the March 2, 2026 launch of the World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Twilight Ascension</strong> is a repeatable pre-launch event running until March 2, in which players join Magister Umbric and Grand Magister Rommath to repel <strong>Twilight's Blade</strong>, a splinter faction of Twilight's Hammer operating primarily in the Twilight Highlands. The cult performs large ritual events to summon rare elite bosses around the zone, which players must interrupt and defeat. By participating, players can earn limited-time rewards like pets, mounts, transmogs, and housing décor.</li>



<li><span>This week, Blizzard is also kicking off another limited-time event called&nbsp;<strong>Winds of Mysterious Fortune,</strong>&nbsp;in which experience gains when using characters between level 10 and 80 are boosted by 20%, and reputation gains, regardless of character level, are boosted by 5</span>0%. Additionally, quests and monster kills for leveling characters have a chance to award the player a so-called <strong>Mysterious Satchel</strong>, which can contain gear, cosmetics, and potions. It's a way to help returning players or existing players who are leveling alternate characters (commonly called ALTs).</li>



<li>On that note, there's also a <strong>Welcome Back Weekend</strong> live now. Former players with a lapsed subscription can enjoy free access to World of Warcraft until Sunday, February 1, with leveling up available up to 80.</li>



<li>The developers are giving away a unique <strong>Dark Portal</strong> décor item to active subscribers who log in between now and the launch of World of Warcraft: Midnight.</li>
</ul>



<p>After recapping <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the main features of the expansion</a>, Hazzikostas then moved to provide fresh details on the post-launch roadmap. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Season One</strong> will kick off a couple of weeks after March 2, introducing the 6-boss <strong>Voidspire raid</strong>, the single-boss <strong>Dreamrift mini-raid</strong>, four world bosses, a Mythic+ pool consisting of 4 Midnight and 4 returning legacy dungeons, a new Delve season, and a PvP season.</li>



<li><strong>March on Quel’Danas</strong>, another 2-boss raid zone, is scheduled to open a few weeks after Season 1 begins to cap off the expansion's initial story chapter.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.0.5</strong>, which goes to the Public Test Realm shortly after the launch of the expansion, is set to introduce global <strong>Void Assaults</strong> to the outdoor world and a lighthearted "Prop Hunt" inspired event featuring a new 5v5 mini-game located in Silvermoon City.</li>



<li><span><strong>Patch 12.0.7</strong>&nbsp;will further escalate</span> Void Assaults and introduce a standalone single-boss raid called <strong>Sporefall</strong> to experiment with a more frequent raiding cadence.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.1</strong> is going to be a major content update featuring a large new outdoor questing zone, a new raid, a new dungeon, new Delves, a new world boss, a Mythic+ refresh, and a complete overhaul of the <strong>Friend System</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.1.5</strong>, slated to go live alongside BlizzCon 2026, adds <strong>Labyrinths</strong> (which are mega-dungeon-inspired sprawling Delve experiences), another small narrative-themed raid that will set the stage fo what's coming in 2027, and an experimental standalone mode from the creators of <strong>Plunderstorm</strong> (the Pirate-themed Battle Royale mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-plunderstorm-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that launched two years ago</a>) and <strong>Remix</strong>. </li>
</ul>



<p>Hazzikostas also unveiled some of the improvements coming to the Housing feature, including <strong>copy/paste functionality</strong>, <strong>mass-select</strong> for moving complex structures, and the ability to share designs via <strong>import/export codes</strong>. Décor budgets will also slowly increase, both for interiors and exteriors, as Blizzard irons out technical limitations and provides players with a sense of progression as they grow their homes. </p>



<p>Future updates will allow players to place companion pets within their homes and hitch favorite mounts in their outdoor yards. With the launch of World of Warcraft: Midnight, the <strong>Neighborhood Endeavors</strong> feature will go live as well, and the team plans to use it to monitor player behaviour and inform future updates.</p>



<p>Last but not least, the Senior Game Director teased that <strong>BlizzCon 2026, the studio's convention that returns after three years, will be 'one for the ages' </strong>where Blizzard is going to unveil <strong>its plans for the next 20 years of the Warcraft franchise</strong>. As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlizzCon 2026</a> will take place at the Anaheim Convention Center on September 12 and 13. According to the latest rumors, <a href="https://wccftech.com/third-person-starcraft-shooter-will-reportedly-be-unveiled-at-blizzcon-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Blizzard</strong> <strong>will reveal a third-person StarCraft shooter during the keynote</strong></a>.</p>

            <p>When I first played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> I had trouble working out what it wanted to be – Spider-Man? The Witcher? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a>? Dragon’s Dogma? Jedi Academy? The first of three new talkthrough videos from developers Pearl Abyss has helped concentrate the game in my mind. This is a grittier medieval fantasy take on The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom, isn’t it! Those airborne ruins are a dead giveaway. All it’s missing is the elegance and feeling of completeness. OK, it doesn’t have a magic vehicle editor, either. That I know about. Without further ado, here’s the video.

<p>
Crimson Desert looks madder than a catful of hatters. If you’re wondering why main guy Kliff Macduff walks in such a weirdly jerky way, like a toddler on springs, it’s probably because he’s trying to restrain the compressed energies of every open world mechanic ever devised. He can grapple. He can mech pilot. He can throw barrels and do wrestling moves. He can fish.</p>
<p>I don’t mean this as criticism, though I don’t entirely mean it as praise, either. I strongly suspect that this game is going to be a triumphant combination of mechanically silly and tonally self-serious and savagely broken in a way that somehow demands to be experienced for tens of hours. 
</p><p>

In watching the video, you are sparing yourself the derangement of mastering Crimson Desert’s control scheme, assuming they haven’t revised it since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crimson-desert-is-a-dork-ass-enormity-of-an-open-world-action-rpg">I played the game last year</a>. I got thrown in the deep end with that preview, asked to make sense of a midgame Kliff with a multitude of clashing abilities to choose from, while fending off the hydra of jetlag.
</p><p>I spent a lot of my demo either caterpaulting Kliff Macduff into holes, or confusing Kliff Macduff with all the people killing Kliff Macduff, or plaintively asking the PR to explain why Kliff Macduff is on fire now. The boss QTEs are like something out of the original Steel Battallion. You will beg for the sweet relief of a Bennett Foddy game. Anyway, Crimson Desert is out on March 19th this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The community has had an explosive time with Battlefield 6 Season 1, but the time will come for it to make way for Season 2. Read on for full details about Battlefield 6 Season 2’s start date, times, and more.</p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>‘s player base has dropped quite dramatically since launch, you better believe there are still thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of players going into battle across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation/" id="81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/pc/" id="4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>. Battlefield 6 Season 1 dropped a decent amount of content, but Season 2 is creeping over no man’s land toward us.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-battlefield-6-season-1-end">When Does Battlefield 6 Season 1 End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to evac. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 Season 1 finally comes to an end on February 17</strong>.</p>



<p>This means you’ll have experienced four months of Season 1. Technically, it doesn’t mean you’ve been bereft of content for four months, as EA has slowly dripfed live-service content through mini-releases: Rogue Ops, California Resistance, Winter Offensive, and even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-6-season-1-january-27-bonus-content-frostfire-bonus-path-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 27 Frostfire Bonus Path content</a>.</p>



<p>The original end date was actually supposed to be January 21, but an unexpected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay</a> struck.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-battlefield-6-season-2-start">When Does Battlefield 6 Season 2 Start?</h2>



<p><strong>You can look forward to Battlefield 6 Season 2 starting on February 17, the same time that Season 1 ends.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re a regular live-service player, you get the gist of the transition between seasons. One season ends, another begins right away. Season 1 comes to a close on February 17, and Season 2 picks up where its predecessor left off.</p>



<p>We’ve already started to learn about S2 aspects as well, such as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-battlefield-6-map-leaked-ahead-of-season-2-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Battlefield 6 map leaking ahead of the S2 reveal</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-start-date-amp-times">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Start Date &amp; Times</h2>



<p><strong>Season 2 is expected to begin on February at 8 AM PT, with the start time varying in other regions.</strong></p>

<p>It includes time zones across America, Europe, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Phasmophobia devs have revealed a new roadmap for 2026 as they work towards the 1.0 update. </p>



<p>Phasmophobia developers, Kinetic Games, made an announcement earlier this month; however, it wasn’t related to the game. Instead, it was revealed that they are launching a new publishing label, <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phasmophobia-dev-launches-game-publishing-label/" target="_blank">Kinetic Publishing</a>, which</span> will&nbsp;collaborate with small teams and individual developers worldwide. </p>







<h2 id="h-phasmophobia-will-get-new-major-updates-new-map-amp-reworks-and-events-in-2026">Phasmophobia Will Get New Major Updates, New Map &amp; Reworks, and Events in 2026</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the new <a href="https://kineticgames.co.uk/news/phasmophobias-roadmap-for-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the developers of Phasmophobia are planning significant updates throughout 2026, categorized into three sections: major updates, maps, and events.</p>



<p>Players can expect major updates, including a complete overhaul of their character, reworked horror elements, a lore update for Phasmophobia 1.0, the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, and the Unity 6 and Netcode update.</p>



<p>Regarding maps, the developers will initially focus on updating older maps to meet current standards. The first of these will be an improved version of Tanglewood Drive, followed by Willow Street, which is set to be released in 2026. Additionally, a new map will be introduced this year, featuring a fresh style of location for the game.</p>



<p>In 2026, the popular in-game community events will return, featuring Cursed Hollow, Crimson Eye, and Winter’s Jest at approximately the same times as before. Furthermore, the team is developing a new limited-time event, with details to be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>In other news, check out Highguard’s roadmap, which reveals an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entire year’s worth of content plans</a>. Additionally, the ARC Raiders roadmap <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contains four months of content</a>, including new events, maps, ARC enemies, and more. </p>

			<p>Another Thursday means another <strong><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-linux/">GeForce NOW Thursday,</a></strong> with ten new games entering <strong>NVIDIA's</strong> cloud gaming service, led by the mountain climbing narrative game <strong>Cairn</strong> and <strong>The Bard's Tale Trilogy</strong>, while the newly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-available-linux-fire-tv-clients-more-games/"><strong>Linux-native</strong> GeForce NOW app enters beta</a>.</p>



<p>Cairn is the latest game from <strong>The Game Bakers</strong>, the indie team behind games like <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/423230/Furi/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=32982976">Furi</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/983970/Haven/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=32982976">Haven</a></strong>. It continues the studio's tradition of sticking to making something completely new genre-wise, while keeping a strong narrative focus. It was one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-most-anticipated-adventure-games-of-2026-against-fire-air-water-mind/">Wccftech's Most Anticipated Adventure Games</a> for the year, and it's out today on PC and PS5. It's even already a game of the year contender, if early reviews are to be believed. It's also one of the five games that are <strong>RTX 5080-ready</strong> for GeForce NOW users.</p>



<p>As for the other brand-new RTX 5080-ready games, players will be able to take full advantage of the power of an RTX 5080 with the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-midnight-walkers-zombie-fps-november-early-access-release-steam-next-fest/">first-person extraction zombie shooter, <strong>The Midnight Walkers</strong></a>, the physics-based medieval combat simulator <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/">Half-Sword</a></strong>, and the open-world adventure <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2191500/Vampires_Bloodlord_Rising/">Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</a></strong>. The final RTX 5080-ready game is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a></strong>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-death-stranding-space-marine-2-talos-principle-2/">now available to <strong>Xbox Game Pass </strong>subscribers</a>.</p>

<figcaption><em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was a big letdown for Paradox last year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Revenues for the quarter technically increased, driven largely by Paradox's strategy-focused back catalog (as well as the newly-released <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="94d6591e-5da9-4df4-85db-66063c38e046" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">first teased in May last year</a>), but sales for the year as a whole remained static when compared to last year.</p><p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester admits that <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>"did not meet [the company's] commercial expectations", but he says his studio is now reassessing its resource allocation to ensure it focuses on the right projects in future.</p><p><em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was released in October following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="14f47468-9696-4619-adfe-4a904a94f05a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">very lengthy</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="424a86e4-db05-4ea2-9339-418c1fb748b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">troubled development cycle</a>. The game was met with criticism for its perceived lack of similarities to Troika's original <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</em>, as well as shallow gameplay and a lack of meaningful RPG elements.</p><p>The game's poor reception led Dan Pinchbeck, co-founder of developer The Chinese Room, to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ec744b99-1543-4387-b78c-dd265b6df66b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suggest that the project's name was ill-fitting</a>, and that he and another former <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>producer attempted to convince execs "to not call it <em>Bloodlines 2</em>". Evidently, those efforts fell on deaf ears.</p>

The title, which launched in October 2025, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/798848/pokemon-legends-za-review-nintendo-switch-2">feels like a return to form</a>, according to our reviewer Charles Pulliam-Moore, and continues to push the series out of its iterative rut. At this price, the game is cheaper than the original Switch version (but pro tip: the Switch 2 cartridge will work in the original Switch, too, and will let you play the full game as if it were a regular Switch cart).</p><p>For those who haven’t jumped into a Pokémon game in a while, <em>Legends: Z-A</em> follows the formula that <em>Arceus</em> introduced. Rather than strictly operating as a turn-based RPG, the player can engage in real-time battles against Pokémon — even catching them sneakily without engaging in a fight is possible. Personally, games like <em>Pokémon Sword / Shield </em>burned me out on the idea of playing another, as it felt similar to playing previous titles, but with better graphics and a larger world. But shaking up how you engage with the core mechanics sounds like a good time.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you need an affordable-but-good MagSafe charging puck to recharge your iPhone while you’re in bed or working, <strong>Anker’s MagGo Qi2 puck with 15W charging</strong> is $14.99 at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMH2JVMM/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> in black or white.

<p>Building on the arcadey cyberpunk gangland arse-kicking of its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/598550/HUNTDOWN/">predecessor</a>, Huntdown: Overtime puts a roguelite twist on the carnage, with cybernetically-enhanced bounty hunter John Sawyer taking out as many targets as he can per run, before being dragged back to a cyber-doc's operating table on death. As you go, you'll murderdeath a lot of foes and gradually unfurl Sawyer's origin story by morphing from mostly man, part killer toaster to mostly killer toaster, part man.</p>
<p>"We've tried to capture that relentless, forward-momentum gunplay from classic action movies and modern ones like John Wick," said Tommy Gustafsson, art director at devs Easy Trigger Games. "Then we added a massive arsenal, cybernetic upgrades that reshape your playstyle, and wrapped it in a roguelite loop. The result is something we hope captures the badass spirit of 80s cinema while giving you a reason to keep hunting run after run."</p><p>The devs promise "multiple paths through gang territories, wastelands, and more" to help keep things fresh, in addition to weapons ranging from fists of fury, to fully automatic rifles, massive snipers, and explosives. The likes of flamethrowers, miniguns, and futuristic  beam or plasma shooters look to await those who rise up the killer toaster ranks.</p>
<p>"This hits a sweet spot for me," Adam Smith (RPS in peace) wrote in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/huntdown-preview-retro-game">2017 preview</a> of the first Huntdown. "On one level, it's not a particularly exciting game, doing things that I've been familiar with for a long time and lacking any specific hook. But at another level, it's one of those retro games that's actually far more detailed than any of the things that it remembers. As I was talking to the developer, I suddenly remembered a 'similar looking' game called After The War that I hadn't thought about since I was a kid. 'It's the same kind of future world, though in After The War a nuclear bomb has been dropped', I explained as I searched the internet for an image."</p>
<p>Huntdown: Overtime's scheduled to drop in early access in Q2 2026, which'd put in somewhere between April 1st and June 30th by my googling. If you fancy, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2473350/HUNTDOWN_OVERTIME/">Steam</a>.</p>

According to Schreier, Bloomberg News learned about the departure yesterday, which comes as Amazon reportedly retreats from the PC and console video game space in favor of its cloud gaming service, Luna.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news was shared after Amazon announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-layoffs-corporate-jan-2026">its latest round of job cuts</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a message to employees, later posted on the Amazon website, which will impact around 16,000 roles across the company. Beth Galetti, SVP of people experience and technology at Amazon, didn't clarify which sectors and divisions are impacted. Game Developer reached out to Amazon Game Studios for clarification.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, the official line is that Amazon will continue "hiring and investing in strategic areas and functions" that are "critical" to the company's future. "We're still in the early stages of building every one of our businesses and there's significant opportunity ahead," Galetti wrote one paragraph after announcing the 16,000 job cuts.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-retains-optimism-in-vr-after-reality-labs-loses-83-6-billion-in-six-years" target="_self" data-discover="true">Meta retains 'optimism' in VR after Reality Labs loses $83.6 billion in six years</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, the SVP said that announcing broad reductions every few months isn't the plan. Yet, every team will "continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers," and make adjustments "as appropriate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This new wave of layoffs is taking place mere three months after Amazon made approximately 14,000 people redundant within its corporate workforce, a decision which included staff within its video game division. At the time, Galetti said the aim is to operate like the "world's largest startup" and eliminating bureaucracy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs," she wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shortly after the announcement, Amazon Games announced the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amazon-is-ending-active-development-on-new-world">end of active development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on MMO </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New World: Aeternum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. According to the company, they reached a point where it was "no longer sustainable" to continue supporting the game with new content updates. At the time, the company reportedly shared insights about its goals and aspirations regarding its gaming business internally, as per a memo to staff </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/amazon-games-layoffs-halt-aaa-development-1236563508/">obtained by Variety</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. According to the report, the company said the staff cuts indicated a larger strategy shift within the games division.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Largely, this reportedly translated to halting a "significant amount" of first-party AAA game development work, which led to "significant role reductions" in Amazon's studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as its central publishing team. The company's plan, then, seems to be to continue to work with external studio partners. This includes Crystal Dynamics, which recently unveiled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider: Catalyst</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which are expect to launch in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

"Women must be involved not only as participants or consumers, but as designers, engineers, artists, leaders, and decision-makers who actively shape how these worlds function and who they serve."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/survey-82-percent-of-us-based-game-developers-support-unionization" target="_self" data-discover="true">82 percent of US-based game developers support unionization</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As such, the CEO says that if women are excluded from the creation of AI systems, virtual economies, and immersive worlds, existing biases around representation, safety, access, and opportunity will be "hard-coded" into the future.

            <p>
Nintendo's delightfully quirky <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream has been given the full reveal treatment ahead of its Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> release on 16th April. And amid the fresh deluge of information, Nintendo has confirmed same-sex relationships and non-binary options, fulfilling its promise to be "more inclusive" following controversy around the game's 3DS predecessor.
</p>
<p>
When Tomodachi Life released for 3DS back in 2013, players disappointed at the absence of same-sex romances launched a social media campaign to encourage Nintendo to add them in a post-launch update. The company's initial response was dismissive, insisting Tomodachi Life was not a "real-life simulation" nor "trying to provide social commentary." Later, however, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-refuses-to-allow-same-sex-relationships-in-tomodachi-life">took a more conciliatory tone</a>, apologising and pledging that while it was unable to make such a "significant development change" to the 3DS version of Tomodachi Life, it would be "more inclusive" if another instalment ever came.

<p>
Over a decade later, Nintendo has made good on that promise. As revealed in today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNtYngxAs1k">30-minute-long Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Direct</a>, players can choose from three gender identities when creating their Miis in the new game - male, female, or non-binary - plus any combination of relationship preferences from the same list, effectively making it possible to create characters who're gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, or heterosexual. And because this is Tomodachi Life, you also get to pick facial features, body shape, personality, even the silly computer-synthesised voices they'll use.
</p>
<p>
And once your Miis are ready to descend on their new island home, it largely looks like business as usual. Rather than controlling Miis directly, you'll encourage their growth by feeding them, giving them gifts, and creating new neighbours for them to interact with and befriend. And you can help introduce those friends to other friends, acting as a sort of omnipotent matchmaker to create a network of not always blissful social bonds.

<p>
Some encounters might happen while you're away from the game - perhaps your Mii will meet someone they take a fancy to - and you can keep abreast of events via the island's News Channel. Elsewhere, you can buy your Miis outfits from the clothing store, food from the supermarket, apartment decor from the Renovation Centre, and more exotic items - a lion?? - from the market stall. There's also a photo studio if you want to take some daft snaps.
</p><p>
Tomodachi Life residents might also make requests for island improvements from time to take, and you can decorate its outdoor spaces with everything from fences and picnic benches to new houses and additional terrain, all purchased from the Island Design Centre. And if you want to have a little more impact on your Miis, you can bestow them with quirks and traits, or drop them down at points of interest, so they can, say, jiggle in a sprinkler. It all looks as delightfully ridiculous as its predecessor, and that's before we get to the Studio Workshop where you can doodle your residents a 2D pet, or customise food, clothing, the TV channels they watch, and more. And yes there's romance, awkward love triangles, and marriage. Even shared housing for up to nine Miis.
</p>
<p>
Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream launches for Switch and Switch 2 on 16th April, but there's currently no word on any Switch 2-specific enhancements.

            <p>Nintendo is introducing image sharing restrictions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream in order to create experiences that are "welcoming and enjoyable for everyone".</p>
<p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/">As seen on the Nintendo America website</a>, a statement laying out why these restrictions are in place have been included. They read as follows: "Nintendo aims to create experiences where players have the freedom to enjoy their Mii characters in their own way. In Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, this freedom can sometimes lead to humorous, surprising, or unpredictable moments during gameplay.</p>
<p>"While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>

<p>"Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>"To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image sharing features. These limits help to make the worlds players create in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players.</p>
<p>"We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting. However, they reflect Nintendo's ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays."</p>
<p>As for the extent of these restrictions, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">Japanese Nintendo website</a> lays it out clearly: "The following features are unavailable: image transfer to smartphones, direct posting to social media, and automatic image uploads (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> only)." You can still share images via the Switch 2 Game Chat function.</p><p>The reaction to these restrictions are, as you can imagine, negative. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-restricting-image-sharing-features-for-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream.1419745/">Take Dal from ResetEra</a>, who described the decision as "wacky". Racoon, on the same ResetEra post covering the decision, stated their belief that Nintendo "killed the game", adding: "social media was going to shoot this into the stratosphere, instead they killed it". Another, Mullet2000, summed up their thoughts as such: "Nintendo gonna Nintendo".</p>
<p>It's clear that Nintendo is implementing such measures in order to prevent folks from sharing images from the game that could be considered a bit <em>naughty. </em>But given the funny, easily meme-able moments present in Tomodachi Life, it does feel a bit like throwing the baby out with the bath water.</p>

            <p>
One of the nicer Industry Trends of the past few years has been the rise and rise and rise of climbing sims. It turns out climbing is a source of many emotions, from the melancholy wonder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> through the savage loneliness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a> to the slapstick camaraderie of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> and the agony of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creator-of-a-game-about-eternal-punishment-and-frustration-is-tired-of-playtesting-it">various Sisyphus sims</a>. Also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/celeste">Celeste</a>. And I guess we should mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a> here? See, it's an absolute avalanche.
</p>
<p>
Cairn is on the somber side. Created by The Game Bakers, it's about a woman with bandaged legs and a scuttling robo buddy. She's trying to reach the top of a mysterious mountain, with a selection of routes to choose from and a backpack inventory to manage. I get the sense that there's more up there than goats, snow and the tents of fellow climbers. We will find out shortly, for Cairn is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">on sale now on Steam</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Nic (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-the-demo-for-heavy-breathing-open-world-mountain-climber-cairn-now">impressed by the Cairn demo</a> back in December 2024, even though the leg animations gave him funny emotions. Fortunately, Nic's funny emotions make for entertaining reading.
</p>
<p>
"No graceful, contextual, restrictive animations for Cairn," he wrote. "No sirree! You'll also be carefully balancing your supplies, and using pitons as quick checkpoints as you make your ascent. You'll be thinking about things like posture, effort and balance while climbing. 'Each wall feels like a boss fight,' says Steam. Do...the mountains do the spinny FromSoft thing? I'd love that."
</p><p>
I do wonder how much of today's flourishing climbing genre is a delayed reaction against the success of Assassin's Creed - the game that 'fixed' videogame climbing back in the noughties by transforming it into a fluid spectacle of semi-automated ledge grabs and cornering. Remember videogame climbing before Assassin's Creed? It was all vikings doing pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake at murky vine textures. Still, there's only so many synchronisation towers you can auto-parkour before you want to get your fingertips dusty again.
</p>
<p>
Cairn is another change of tune for The Game Bakers, hitherto known for the nimble RPG snogging of Haven and the gimlet-eyed boss-rushing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/furi">Furi</a>. Also the *squints* cephalopoddy eco activism of Squids Odyssey. What will they bake for us next? A martial arts romcom set in an alpine seafood restaurant? It's a martial arts romcom set in an alpine seafood restaurant, isn't it. I am giving The Game Bakers 24 hours to deny this, before I write it up as a news story.

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Is Going To Make It Really Hard To Share Screenshots In Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-image-sharing-screenshot-block-2000664167</link>
            <guid>1419910</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier today, Nintendo revealed a lot about the upcoming<a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-nintendo-2000664120"><em> Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream.</em></a> The cute life-sim sequel is set to arrive in April on Switch and Switch 2. But when it arrives, be prepared to take photos of your screen using your phone if you want to share anything online, as Nintendo is locking down screenshot sharing in the game.</p> <p>On January 29, shortly after posting a new Nintendo Direct all about <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, people noticed new information about the upcoming game on the company’s official support site. Specifically, as shared by deals guru Wario64 on social media, people discovered that the life-sim sequel, which lets you create characters and get them into wild situations involving other NPCs, will make it difficult to easily share screenshots of all the silliness online on both Switch and Switch 2.</p>

 <p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/">In a post on its support page for the game,</a> Nintendo says <em>Tomodachi Life</em> offers plenty of “freedom” that can sometimes lead to “unpredictable moments.” And that’s a problem.</p> <p>“While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed,” said Nintendo. “Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone. To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image-sharing features.”</p>

 <h2>Which image-sharing features are blocked in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></h2> <p>While support page doesn’t go into specific detail about what these restrictions are, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">but if you visit the official Japanese website for the game</a>, you can find this notice:</p> <blockquote><p><span dir="auto">The console’s functions for transferring images to smartphones, posting directly to social media, and </span><span dir="auto">automatically uploading images (Nintendo Switch 2 only) will not be available.</span></p></blockquote> <p>The notice does confirm that Switch 2 players will still be able to use Game Chat to share gameplay of<em> Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream.</em> Still, it is annoying that Nintendo is placing such restrictions on the game, especially when you consider that anyone can just grab their phone and take a screenshot of the game and post it. Which people are going to do. So this won’t really stop people from sharing silly images of characters kissing or whatever Nintendo is afraid is going to happen in April.</p>

 <p>It should also be noted that Nintendo is, at least from what we can tell, not blocking screenshots entirely, just the ability to share them easily online with others.</p> <p>“We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting,” said Nintendo on its support page. “However, they reflect Nintendo’s ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays.”</p> <p>Some reacted to this news by suggesting that this is likely Nintendo trying to avoid another “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnote#Discontinuation">Swapnote incident</a>,” but that seems like a very different situation that involved people directly messaging young kids for nefarious reasons using Nintendo software. Taking a screenshot of something silly or weird in your game and then instantly sharing it online using a console’s built-in screenshot button and sharing options is such a great feature in most modern consoles. Nintendo trying to make that harder is odd and also ignores that, once again, everyone has phones and will share whatever they want online. I also can’t help but notice this is happening with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-gay-nonbinary-nintendo-switch-2000664147">first Nintendo game to officially feature gay and non-binary Miis. Hmm…</a></p>

 <p><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> arrives on Switch and Switch 2 on April 16. Don’t you dare share a screenshot of something weird happening, or a Nintendo lawyer will get you.</p>

Shortly thereafter, Nintendo found itself embroiled in a major controversy after Japanese fans alleged that Nintendo had initially developed, then removed, same-sex relationship options for in-game characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/05/nintendo-on-gay-marriage-and-tomodachi-life">Nintendo's Bill Trinen commented on the issue to IGN at the time</a>, and stated that while Nintendo had indeed updated the game, the update's intent had been to fix a data leak issue when importing characters from a previous game. Separate to this fact, Trinen said, some players had been using the same feature to import male Mii characters that could then be designated female, allowing for the appearance of two Mii characters of the same sex to marry and have a baby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo never intended to make any form of social commentary with the launch of Tomodachi Life," <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/nintendo-virtual-equality-life-game-23620844?singlePage=true" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo then said in a statement</a>, which did little to stop the growing backlash. "The relationship options in the game represent a playful alternate world rather than a real-life simulation. We hope that all of our fans will see that Tomodachi Life was intended to be a whimsical and quirky game, and that we were absolutely not trying to provide social commentary."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As fan complaints grew, a fan petition for "<a href="https://miiquality.tumblr.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miiquality</a>" was launched, and the situation caught mainstream attention — including a high-profile skit by late night TV host John Oliver, who broadcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5w8OFrm6U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a skit featuring Mario and Link snogging</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo then issued a further statement with an apology for "disappointing many people" — and it was here that the company made a "pledge" to make a title that "better represents all players" should it release another Tomodachi title in future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We apologize for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life," Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/09/nintendo-next-installment-of-tomodachi-life-will-be-more-inclusive">said at the time</a>. "Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to change this game’s design, and such a significant development change can’t be accomplished with a post-ship patch. At Nintendo, dedication has always meant going beyond the games to promote a sense of community, and to share a spirit of fun and joy. We are committed to advancing our longtime company values of fun and entertainment for everyone. We pledge that if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream allows players to create Mii versions of themselves, their friends, fictional characters and love interests and get them to all interact on a fantasy island. Clearly aware of some of the potential uses of this, Nintendo followed up today's Direct broadcast with a vague <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> that said it would "place restrictions on certain image sharing features" for the game.
