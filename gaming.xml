                <p>After everyone spent the last couple weeks believing the headlining artist for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Festival Season 9 would be Deadmau5, the reality ended up being something completely different: Bruno Mars will be the <em>actual</em> <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/bruno-mars-is-home-in-fortnite-festival-season-9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Festival Icon</a> when Season 9 launches on Wednesday.</p><p>Bruno Mars is an interesting choice because he's already in Fortnite. The Silk Sonic set, which included skins for both Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, was released way back in 2022. None of the eight previous Festival season headliners had been added to the game as skins prior to their respective seasons.</p><p>The new Fortnite Festival Season will come with a new Music Pass, which will be available for 1400 V-Bucks or via Fortnite Crew. The highlight is the Die With a Smile Bruno skin, which is based on the singer's look in the video for his and Lady Gaga's track Die With a Smile. That skin unlocks instantly when you purchase the pass, and you can gain XP across any Fortnite experience to progress the pass from there. Also included with the paid pass is a guitar, a drum kit, and jam tracks for Bruno-San's Theme Song, Silk Sonic's Leave the Door Open, ABC by tThe Jackson 5, and Mun Ra by Sabotage. There are free rewards as well for those who don't buy the pass, including instruments, auras, and four jam tracks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4515832-fortnitebrunomarsshopstuff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4515832-fortnitebrunomarsshopstuff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515832"></a><figcaption>This new Bruno Mars skin will be available in the Fortnite item shop throughout Festival Season 9.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4515832-fortnitebrunomarsshopstuff.jpg"></figure><p>Naturally, Bruno Mars will also have a set of cosmetics in the shop throughout the season, starting with the Bruno-San skin, which has two distinctive styles. Alongside the skin will be a back bling, a contrail, a keytar, a bass, and both an emote and jam track for his song Bonde do Brun√£o--all of these will be included in one big bundle. Outside the bundle, the shop will also have jam tracks for Die With a Smile by Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, and APT by Rose and Bruno Mars.</p><p>For longtime Fortnite players, this update will also come with a feature that's been heavily requested for years and years: If you set your lobby music to random, it will actually play a different song when the one you're listening to finishes. Since lobby music was first introduced to Fortnite in Chapter 1 Season 6--that was seven years ago!--the random feature would simply pick one song and play it on a loop until you left the lobby.</p>

The new Money Fronts expansion is live, which lets players take control of a massive money-laundering operation.</p><p dir="ltr">GTA Online offers players several ways to increase their income, and the latest revenue stream comes from working for the head of San Andreas' biggest money-laundering network. In Money Fronts, players start out by taking over the Hands On Car Wash in Strawberry to clean some dirty money. Purchasing the Hands On Car Wash will then unlock the ability to purchase two other money laundering locations: Smoke on the Water dispensary and Higgins Helitours.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Owning these new business fronts allows access to unique Money-Laundering missions. Earnings from these laundering operations are stored inside the player's duffle bag found in the car wash bedroom. To celebrate the launch of Money Fronts, Rockstar says that missions launched from the Hands On Car Wash will pay out 2X GTA$ and RP this week.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting into the laundering business also benefits other operations in GTA Online. Owning the car wash boosts all Counterfeit Cash Factory sales from a player's MC business, while owning the dispensary provides a bump to all Weed Farm sales. Additionally, Operating Higgins Helitours as a front results in a lift for all Air Freight Cargo.</p><p dir="ltr">While money laundering is great for building a cash empire, there are some risks that come with cleaning all that dirty money. Money-Laundering missions raise suspicion from the authorities in the form of Heat on the various business fronts. Businesses with Heat will be flagged with caution signals on the map, and it requires players to cool things back down by completing legal activity. This means activities such as cleaning customer cars at the car wash and delivering legal weed for the dispensary.</p><p dir="ltr">Mr. Faber, the head of the money-laundering network, also gives unique missions for additional extra cash and RP rewards. These Mr. Faber Work missions include various tasks, such as recovering stolen assets, escorting valuable cargo, and dealing with rival outfits. These raise the Heat level on a player's money-laundering businesses, and more of the legal activities will need to be completed to reduce this.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4515896-overflodsuzume.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515896" data-ratio="0.56235997012696" data-width="1339" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4515896-overflodsuzume.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515896"></a><figcaption>The new √ñverfl√∂d Suzume supercar.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4515896-overflodsuzume.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Money Fronts expansion includes six new vehicles for purchase, including the √ñverfl√∂d Suzume supercar.

<p>Should have stapled some photo credit on there</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Sad DK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30f78c9fe1a1d/switch-2-sad-dk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A couple of weeks ago, we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">reported</a> on a handful of unlucky Switch 2 customers who rocked up to their local GameStop on launch day only to find their console screens punctured by a poorly-placed staple. Keen to escape the hot water that such a fiasco (rightfully) landed the company in, GameStop attempted to make light of the situation with a new advertisement announcing console restocks in its stores, but the joke has only ended up pinning more trouble on the company. <em>Tut, tut</em>.</p>
<p>We'll start with the self-deprecating promo itself. GameStop proudly announced its Switch 2 restocks with the new tagline, "Staples not included". The accompanying picture in the company's <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1934729633393725468">announcement tweet</a> shows a Switch 2 unit suspended in mid-air, with a red stapler brandishing a "Do Not Use On Box" message in the foreground.</p>
<p>While perhaps a bit insensitive to those unlucky enough to land a punctured unit, it's just about self-critical enough that we cracked a little smile when we first saw it. "Fair play, GameStop," we thought to ourselves, "you might just bounce back from this"...</p>
<p><em>Whoops</em>, spoke too soon! As it turns out, GameStop forgot to staple some photo credit to its funny little promo. That cool image of the floating Switch 2? It ain't GameStop's to use.</p>
<p>As pointed out on Twitter by Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/chriswelch/status/1934750202478711084">Chris Welch</a>, the snap was originally taken by photographer Janelle Jones <em>for</em> Bloomberg. It even takes centre stage on the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-06-16/nintendo-switch-review-hardware-performance-game-selection-battery-life">outlet's console review</a>, for crying out loud! All GameStop did was crudely edit a picture of a stapler over the OG's dock without credit or mention. You can see it for yourself in Welch's tweet below ‚Äî <em>spoiler</em>: it's not a good look for ol' GS.</p>

<p>As it stands, the GameStop promo is still live on the store's social media accounts, but we imagine it will only be a matter of time before that quietly disappears from our feeds. <em>Sigh</em>, only GameStop could manage to land itself in more hot water while attempting to make light of a previous slip-up.</p>

			<p>Blizzard has announced that Season 17 is set to begin next Tuesday in Overwatch 2. The developers also shared what players can expect to find in the upcoming season of the free-to-play team-based hero shooter game.</p>
<p>The team previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Stadium continues to be very popular among Overwatch 2 players, so it is no surprise that much of this season is dedicated to the mode. Three heroes (Zenyatta, Sigma, and Junkrat) will be available in Stadium, and two new maps are being added: Esperan√ßa and Samoa. Moreover, thanks to expanded build tools and the debut of Stadium Forge, match strategy will run deeper. Stadium Forge is a create/save/share system that will allow players to test and refine team compositions. It will even include early and late game example loadouts for every hero.</p>
<p>Season 17 will also see the first-ever Stadium rank reset, giving everyone a fresh start to prove their skill. Drives will reward consistent performance, Custom Games will let users create their own rules, and fresh All-Star rewards will incentivize players to partake in the mode.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>At long last, map voting is being added to Overwatch 2 in Quick Play and Competitive. After the role queue locks, players will see three randomized map options to choose from. Every vote adds a 1-in-10 chance to that map's odds, and the winner is selected using a roulette-style roll. Team chat, battle tags, and individual votes are hidden to minimize pressure. Leaver penalties kick in as soon as voting begins, by the way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 17: Powered Up! Official Trailer | Overwatch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7p5K_d1qgfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Blizzard is also introducing three new maps. In Core mode, Aatlis is a vibrant new Flashpoint map showcasing the beauty and culture of Morocco. With lush gardens and luxury resort spaces, this map is built for tighter fights, cleaner rotations, and fast-paced momentum. As mentioned before, in Stadium mode, the streets of Esperan√ßa return in a round-based format with new elevation layers, allowing teams to switch tactics between rounds. It's kind of a Push map designed specifically for Stadium's unique format. Finally, the volcanic control point from Samoa joins the Stadium pool, bringing lava and loadouts together. Expect open arenas, intense vertical action, and ample space for high-mobility competitions.</p>
<p>Blizzard is launching two Mythics on day one for the first time in Overwatch 2. These are D.Va's Mythic Horang Hero Skin and Reaper's Mythic Steel Death Weapon Skin, both of which evolve through four tiers.</p>
<p>In about a month, the game will get a limited-time 6v6 mode called Hacks &amp; Hijinks in which match modifiers change every round. Players might float in low gravity, chase down health packs that charge your Ultimate, or react to brand-new mechanics that shake things up. Hacks &amp; Hijinx is only going to be available on Control maps between July 15 and 28.</p>

            <p>
I find Fortnite's desperation to be the everything game both fascinating and overwhelming. There's always something new for you to do around the corner, some new game mode that's attempting to tap into current trends of whatever it is that kids are into at any given moment. Currently, on the younger audience side of things with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, Epic Games are launching Expeditions, a new wave-based mode that looks like a bit of a blend between a hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'll be honest, the framing of the whole thing is very much not for me, because I am not a child. A place called the Supernova Academy acts as your base before you head out on PvE missions all in the hopes of stopping "the evil Mask Maker Daigo from destroying the world". It's as generic a setup as can be, which I feel is a shame because kids do deserve quality storytelling, something which Fortnite itself isn't awful at (I don't love the FOMO nature of its events, but it's certainly Doing Something at the very least).

<p>
Missions see you facing down hordes of enemies as is typical of the wave-based format, there's a map to explore with Lego people to rescue and resources, money, and gear to gather up. You also have different hero classes to choose from, like one that can fly around to get a lay of the land, another can use rifts and summon crystals to deal damage to a bunch of enemies, you get how this all works.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing very much feels like it was made for kids who think the big boy shooters their siblings or teenagers are playing online look really cool, but obviously are far from old enough to play. This is a Fortnite mode though, as cynical as I might feel about this thing, I'm sure it'll do well enough.
</p>
<p>
Lego Fortnite Expeditions is launching tomorrow, June 18th.

It can be a little tricky to nail this move at first. <strong>The secret to Rail Riding is to either drive over them when they‚Äôre already underneath you (such as with train tracks) or to land on them from above after using a ramp or a charge jump.</strong> Your aiming needs to be great here because while your kart will only magnetize to them if it‚Äôs very close.</p><p>Landing on a rail from a ramp or high jump is pretty easy. If you find yourself just missing the mark, try performing a spinning trick by pressing R + left or right. This is a great way to nudge yourself slightly to the side when you‚Äôre in the air. If you‚Äôre having trouble with Charge Jumps, remember that you need to be driving straight. Charge Jumps are done by holding down R until you notice blue sparks coming out from the back tires. Letting go of R will launch you straight into the air or up and to the side if you move left or right at the same time.</p><p>Grinding on rails is a pretty on-rails technique (heh), with your kart simply following along without any input. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre forced to sit there and watch. You‚Äôll steadily build up a turbo charge just like drifting, but you can only use the boost by jumping off. It‚Äôs also possible to trick jump in place, although this seems more beneficial for dodging enemy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bullet-boo-flower-shell-bob-omb-kamek-1851783874&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bullet-boo-flower-shell-bob-omb-kamek-1851783874">power-ups</a></span> than gaining any speed.</p><h2 id="h91863"><a id="2"></a>How to Wall Ride</h2><figure id="" data-id="928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-recommend-id="image://928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A purple Yoshi collects coins while wall riding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple Yoshi collects coins while wall riding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-recommend-id="image://928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A purple Yoshi collects coins while wall riding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next up is another mechanic that can feel a little finicky, but be activated in similar ways: Wall Riding. <strong>This works by launching yourself at a wall after using a ramp or Charge Jump.</strong> Your kart will seemingly magnetize to the surface and leave you driving sideways for a few seconds.</p><p>This technique works in more places than you‚Äôd think. As long as the surface is a bit bigger than your kart and relatively flat, you can wall ride along the likes of buildings, natural terrain, and even big trucks on the road. Wall riding builds up your mini-turbo incredibly fast, so it‚Äôs great to use these for some quick boosts when appropriate. Keep in mind that not every wall will be a benefit in every race. The same can also be applied to rails, as I‚Äôve grinded quite a few and been taken off course.</p><p>Trying to ride on every rail and wall you see in Free Roam mode is a must. Besides being a ton of fun and helping you master these techniques, it can be necessary for collecting some Peach Medallions or completing specific P-Block challenges.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Tron: Catalyst Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-catalyst-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tron-catalyst-review.1220796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-catalyst-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to get drawn in by the unmistakable chrome and neon look of the Tron movies. It definitely made Tron: Catalyst, a top-down action game set in a different virtual world than those we've seen in the films, catch my eye. But in this case, those aesthetics only carried me so far. It doesn't make any critical system errors, but almost every part of it seems like it could have used a little more compute time.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Catalyst focuses on a determined and likeable courier program, Exo, who gets mixed up in a sweeping conspiracy relating to a potential hard reset of the server she and her fellow digital consciousnesses reside on. This Arq Grid was created by Kevin Flynn, AKA Jeff Bridges from the films, and is currently the stage for an interesting political struggle between the authoritarian organization Core and their free-thinking opponents, Automata. Getting to explore this world held my attention, but a lot about it felt two-dimensional.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tron: Catalyst Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the life it has is injected by occasional dialogue scenes with fairly respectable but somewhat inconsistent voice acting, and I‚Äôm not sure the cartoon character art hit quite the right tone. It almost reminds me of the animated kids‚Äô shows Disney often does these days to follow up many of their popular, live-action blockbusters. And that doesn't quite fit the gloomy, noir vibes of apocalyptic intrigue. I did like the character designs conceptually, though. Every major player is certainly distinct and imaginative.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Catalyst really is the picture of a game that is merely pretty good and rarely ever great.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The plot is also just alright. At the risk of repeating myself, Catalyst really is the picture of a game that is merely pretty good and rarely ever great, in just about every arena. I was interested in the various factions and sub-factions, but they never got fleshed out enough to matter. I was intrigued by the central mystery and the looming threat of the server ending, but I rarely felt a strong urgency to unravel those threads. The writing at least does what it needs to do to move things, but frequently relies on what feel like deliberate leaps of logic to avoid breaking up the flow of a level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best example of this is the Glitch, a condition affecting Exo that allows her to reset the server to an earlier state. This is essentially a way to start the current chapter over from the beginning, but retaining any knowledge you've gained, abilities you've earned, and shortcuts you've unlocked remaining open. It‚Äôs a very clever idea, but I feel like this mechanic had a lot more potential than what it ends up being used for.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Glitch mechanic had a lot more potential than what it ends up being used for.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, I simply pressed the reset button when the quest objective told me to, or when I'd goofed up big time by getting too much heat from the Core enforcers. There weren't enough instances in which I felt like I could use it in a clever or dynamic way to open up optional paths or gain an advantage I wouldn't have had simply by following the main quest rigidly. It‚Äôs a time loop story without a lot of opportunities to exploit the fact that you know what‚Äôs going to happen. Time travel is always tricky to work with, and Tron: Catalyst mostly plays it safe in that regard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is also, and I'm sorry again for sounding like a broken record, but‚Ä¶ it's fine. The controls are very responsive and the animations are kinetic and snappy. It looks cool as hell to dance back and forth through a pack of cyber cops, bouncing the light disc off walls and slashing away with stylish violence. But it started to feel fairly repetitive and never really got my blood pumping or my neurons firing in the way a better action game might because its attempts to keep me on my toes never succeeded at breaking me out of the same basic hack and slash routine.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Games Based on 80s Movie Franchises</h3><p>The films of the 80s have inspired many a great game over the years. Here are some of the best.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a respectable difficulty curve, introducing new mechanics along the way like the ability to steal an enemy's code to copy their fighting style, or bosses that can only be damaged by parrying one of their attacks first. But too many fights can still be concluded swiftly and with token effort by spamming dodge and melee attacks. Eventually Catalyst introduces a stealth system, but I didn't use it except when I was forced to because it's pretty dull, and fighting through a level the loud way seemed so risk-free that it didn't even offer a meaningful advantage.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a respectable difficulty curve, introducing new mechanics along the way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The key problem with combat is that it usually doesn't feel necessary to think very tactically to progress on the default difficulty. This is the entire skill tree right here, and it's possible to fill it out completely long before the end of the journey if you're meticulous about looking for secrets like I am, so there aren‚Äôt a lot of either/or choices to make. Even stolen enemy abilities that can power up your attacks like this blade module didn't end up feeling all that impactful for me, to the point that I wasn't bothering with them in the majority of fights. To be clear, it's not bad. It's fun enough. But that's all it ever is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, a Tron game without light cycles would be very odd indeed, so Catalyst gives you one pretty early on that makes it quick and enjoyable to navigate some of its larger areas. Many outdoor zones still ended up being a bit cramped for how fast this thing is, though. And the few instances of light cycle combat or chases highlighted how clunky it can feel in certain circumstances. There's even a light jet you get to pilot later, but this felt even more like a minigame and less like a well-thought-out mechanic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe the aspect I was most underwhelmed by, though, was the music. At this point, I associate the Tron universe with the likes of Daft Punk and Trent Reznor. And that's a high bar, I'll admit. I doubt any of those guys are available to create bespoke music for a project of this modest scale. But Tron: Catalyst's subdued, understated, overly safe blend of orchestral and electronic never gave me the chills I was looking for, even when I put my nice headphones on and turned the volume way up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The score often fades into the background because it's too repetitive, and it doesn't vary enough in intensity between stretches of low-key exploration and the biggest plot reveals or action sequences. Sure, it does the job. But if there's one aspect where I would expect a Tron tie-in to go above and beyond, it would be the music. So it was harder to accept ‚Äúmerely acceptable‚Äù on that front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it might sound like damning with faint praise, I honestly think one of the aspects of Tron: Catalyst that works best is its restrained scope and length. It didn't even take me 12 hours to finish, playing pretty meticulously, and that's just about exactly how much attention I had to give its digital world. It would have been really easy to overstay its welcome, especially with the meager trickle of new mechanics it doles out, so it was definitely a smart decision to not pad this out. Playtime isn't directly correlated with quality, and I respect how much this adventure respected my time.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/im-reviewing-death-stranding-2-heres-what-i-thought-of-the-original<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello. I‚Äôm Simon, and I‚Äôll be reviewing Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for IGN. As you probably know, the response to the original Death Stranding was varied to say the least, so I thought it would be helpful to provide a bit of context regarding my own feelings about the 2019 sci-fi epic before hearing my thoughts on the sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn‚Äôt review Death Stranding for IGN ‚Äì that was the job of the excellent Tristan Ogilvie, and you can read his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review"><u>thoughts here</u></a>. His score of 6.8 isn‚Äôt anywhere close to the most negative assessment Death Stranding received at launch, but it‚Äôs also far from the glowing praise some others bestowed upon it. As I said, verdicts were varied, and I‚Äôm about to add yet another to that mix. Opinions are inherently subjective, especially when it comes to art, so naturally my thoughts on Death Stranding differ from Tristan's, albeit not by too much. This is not a re-review, so you won‚Äôt get a different score here, but let me explain what I did and didn‚Äôt like about the original.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let‚Äôs start with the story, arguably the most complex and divisive aspect of Death Stranding. It‚Äôs the element I enjoyed the most, as I fully embraced its ever-increasing glossary of fresh sci-fi terminology and ended up quite connected to its core cast of characters. I think it's definitely the sort of experience that rewards you the more you put into its world, and while it can prove a little impenetrable during its slower, earlier hours, I really did end up fully invested by its final act. Sam‚Äôs connection to Lou, as well as the dynamic between Cliff Unger and Die-Hardman, especially resonated with me. Die-Hardman‚Äôs final scene, brilliantly brought to life by Tommie Earl Jenkins, is one of the most affecting performances in a video game that I can remember. That‚Äôs not to say that the rest of the cast aren‚Äôt also fantastic; I could lay on praise for all of them, ranging from Margaret Qualley‚Äôs dual roles to Lea Seydoux‚Äôs complicated Fragile. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing new faces join them this time around, in particular Elle Fanning‚Äôs enigmatic Tomorrow, and I‚Äôm willing to go on the record as saying I don‚Äôt trust her at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, there‚Äôs a huge scale here in its world-ending events and giant oil monsters, but this is the sort of sci-fi and post-apocalypse fiction I really connect with ‚Äì grand, global stories rooted in deeply personal tales, a la Denis Villeneuve‚Äôs Arrival or Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs The Road. Death Stranding delicately balances moments of wonder, whether they be colossal looming threats or simply walking over the crest of a hill to a dose of Low Roar, with one-on-one conversations that anchor that grandeur in relatable humanity. It‚Äôs those very human themes of birth, death, hope, and grief that we can all relate to, and I enjoyed greatly how these shone through, no matter how much alien language was thrown my way over the 40 or so hours its tale takes to tell.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is the sort of sci-fi and post-apocalypse fiction I really connect with ‚Äì grand, global stories rooted in deeply personal tales.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, it looks like we‚Äôll be getting more of that MGS-flavour tactical espionage action from Death Stranding 2, if recent hands-on previews are anything to go by. This excites me greatly, because no matter how much I enjoyed the original‚Äôs story, I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt find the act of actually playing Death Stranding a slog at times. In fact, it‚Äôs what made me bounce off of it when it first released back in 2019. On my first go around, I got just a handful of hours in before deciding all that walking just wasn‚Äôt working for me. Its routine of setting out for a hike, crossing rivers and mountains, before eventually reaching nothing more exciting than a delivery location became tiresome for me very quickly, especially during its laborious (and seemingly never-ending) third chapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I‚Äôm very glad I gave it another shot a couple of years ago, this time playing the Director‚Äôs Cut to completion, as I found myself having a much more enjoyable time with it. That new version‚Äôs addition of deeper combat and new delivery tools, such as the companion bot and catapult, introduced some much-needed variety into the mix. Plus, the fact that many half-built highways, helpful ladders, and convenient bridges already existed in the world thanks to the online Chiral network definitely made the journey a lot smoother than it was at launch. The further I got into the game and the more my collection of tools grew, the more fun I found myself having. I bombed along on a motorcycle and enjoyed setting up zipline systems to dart around with ease. I‚Äôm hopeful that many of these more convenient delivery options are available from the get-go in Death Stranding 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Travelling across Death Stranding‚Äôs world was ultimately rewarding, then, but I still can‚Äôt say I ever fully clicked with its combat. Yes, I did have a good laugh chucking blood and piss grenades at a big oily lion, but I largely found its BT encounters a bit of trudge. It meant that I avoided conflict as much as I could ‚Äì a perfectly valid way to play Death Stranding, but one that did result in me letting out a groan every time it started to rain. I also found myself largely dodging human enemies, too, with their yellow hazmat suits often signifying tedious stealth situations. I‚Äôm encouraged, then, that Death Stranding 2 looks to be quite a bit more action-heavy in the way it's expanding your arsenal and enabling you to deal with threats in more dynamic ways. While I‚Äôm not asking for Sam to become a super soldier able to take waves of enemies head-on, I am looking forward to wielding a bit more firepower this time around instead of opting to skirt around the edges of combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, the TLDR version is that I really enjoyed the world of Death Stranding and its characters, but didn‚Äôt find the moment-to-moment gameplay consistently rewarding. I liked it, just didn‚Äôt love it. I am very excited to jump back in with Death Stranding 2, though ‚Äì from what we‚Äôve seen so far, it does look like the story is packed full of intrigue again, and that we‚Äôll be treated to the sort of spectacle that rarely gets created outside of Kojima‚Äôs studio walls. I‚Äôm just hoping it has the gameplay to match its cinematic ambitions this time around, and doesn‚Äôt make the gaps between its gloriously sculpted cutscenes as much of a chore. I guess we‚Äôll all find out when my review of Death Stranding 2 drops on June 23rd.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

                <p>Greek teenager Angelos Mako was a young man on a mission. Almost 10 years since Facebook removed Dungeon Rampage, Mako wanted to bring back the game that was a safe space for him during a rough time in his life. After years of trying to recreate the code, Mako now owns the code and the license, and it'll soon be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3053950/Dungeon_Rampage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>"My parents were going through a very nasty divorce. Dungeon Rampage was there for me.

"It took care of me when no one else could."</p>

<p>Playing the game every day for five years straight, it became part of his young life, then suddenly the game was removed. That set off his quest to get it back, even at the age of 10.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png" data-ref-id="1300-4515870" data-ratio="0.5671875" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png" data-ref-id="1300-4515870"></a><figcaption>Dungeon Rampage is back!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png"></figure><p>"I couldn't fathom it. I couldn't understand why it happened," he continued. "But even from that moment, I said that I'm going to find a way to get this back again. I had no clue how, but I had a dream."</p><p>He eventually did some apprenticeships for a Roblox team, working in Unity. While he was doing that, four years later, he ran across a Discord server that was trying to remake Dungeon Rampage and joined in. He quickly learned they wanted to remake the game instead of restoring the original, but Mako took over that project last year, trying to do more of the latter.</p><p>"I was fed up. I wanted this to come to life," Mako said. "Okay, I'm starting from scratch. I'm taking initiative. And I went directly to try and get the copyright of Dungeon Rampage." Using a saved credits screen from the game, he made a LinkedIn account and messaged everyone he could find. "People replied, actually. That's the weird part."</p><p>One of the first people to reach out was Jason Yeung, the game's original creative director. Yeung agreed that the attempt to remake Dungeon Rampage was a cool project, but he needed to speak with Mike Goslin, former head of Rebel Entertainment, the original Dungeon Rampage developer. Mako soon spoke to Goslin on the phone, who then introduced him to the CEO of the parent company, and he got his license agreement.</p><p>Only one problem: Nobody seemed to have the original code.</p><p>Mako tracked down the last engineer on the project, who said he might have the files of the last build on a laptop--something he gave his young daughter to play with. Luckily, the laptop and the files were still intact. It turned out to be a tougher challenge than they expected because Dungeon Rampage wasn't a simple Flash game; it was Flash and C++ and a PHP backend. When one part was working fine, others seemed to fall apart, but after several trials and errors, the game finally booted up, with Mako being the first one to play it in eight years.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamebreaking/dungeon-rampage" rel="nofollow ">Kickstarter campaign</a> was set up and easily crushed its initial $25,000 goal--it's at $66,000 now, and on its final day. The team event got access to the original game's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dungeonrampage/">Facebook</a> page as well.</p><p>"It's a very fun game and it's been a very fun game forever," Mako added. "Those first days of playing again were the first days of discovering fire as a caveman. That's my best analogy of this."</p>

<p>Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">hands-on with FBC: Firebreak</a> earlier in the year and called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">Rematch, meanwhile, comes from Sifu developer Sloclap</a> and gives a fresh perspective on the beautiful game.</p>
<p>The following games will all be leaving Game Pass on 30th June:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Paradise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Journey to the Savage Planet (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>My Friend Peppa Pig (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Robin Hood: Sherwood Builders (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>SteamWorld Dig (Cloud and Console)</li>
<li>SteamWorld Dig 2 (Console and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them - luckily Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>

<figure><a title="Zelda movie casting rumour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78231f8f0257b/zelda-movie-casting-rumour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you'll undoubtedly know by now, Nintendo's very exciting live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film"><strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> movie</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-been-delayed-but-not-by-much">has been delayed</a> by a little bit to a release date of 7th May 2027. Now, that may sound a long time away, but when you're making a huge movie that every gamer and their donkey (Kong?) is gonna be champing at the bit to see, well, that's not very long at all.</p>
<p>So, it may come as no real surprise to learn that the casting process has reportedly gotten underway already. Now, before anyone gets too excited, none of this stuff has been confirmed, so make sure to have a cold drink of water handy as you imbibe the purported facts that follow here.</p>
<p>With that said, <a href="https://zeldauniverse.net/2025/06/17/casting-for-zelda-movie-is-possibly-in-the-works/">and according to Zelda Universe</a>, movie industry insider Daniel Richtman has shared details via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/131325843">his Patreon account (paid)</a>, saying that casting for the roles of Link, Princess Zelda, Ganondorf, Impa, and the King of Hyrule could be taking place right this very moment. We knew we could sense a disturbance in the fo...oh wait, wrong franchise.</p>

<p>Link and Zelda‚Äôs casting also, according to Richtman, seems to be focused on performers between the ages of 16 and 23, at least for Link and Zelda. The article also suggests that this casting period could be all wrapped up and done by August this year (I mean, you'd hope so!), so it could very well be that we hear who we've got in lead roles fairly soon. If any of this is even remotely factual!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-zelda-live-action-movie-eyes-popular-princess-pick">Last month</a>, Richtman claimed that Hunter Schafer was in the running and we ran down some of our own picks for people we could see in the principal roles back when the movie was first announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-who-could-play-link-zelda-ganondorf-in-the-zelda-movie-25-actors-who-could-fit-the-bill">in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be no surprise if the actors required are fairly young, as this could end up being a trilogy, so there's a whole lot of years of work ahead for those lucky enough to fill the legendary shoes of the likes of Link, Zelda or indeed everyone's favourite, <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Zill_(The_Wind_Waker)">booger boy Zill</a>.</p>

            <p>"Factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>-style pixel physics" is a pitch even more calculated to make me flee screaming than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-cave-diver-blends-the-joyful-physics-of-qwop-with-the-less-joyful-physics-of-being-trapped-underground">"game in which you die in very small caves"</a>, but I'm writing up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sandustry">Sandustry</a> anyway, because <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> came out this month, and as such, all sand-based games gain +20 press appeal.</p>
<p>We've covered the game before, with Ollie selecting the demo for one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-demos-from-steam-next-fest-winter-2025">Steam Next Fest round-ups</a>. Today's news is that Hooded Horse, fans of moderately weird strategy games, have signed on to publish the thing, much to solo developer Lantto's delight. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Sandustry lets you loose upon the surface of a procedurally generated world, in which every pixel "is a resource waiting to be mined, mixed, processed, or destroyed". Expect "countless chemical and physical reactions" as you assemble a planet-gobbling logistics network from conveyor belts, pipes, pumps and elevators. It's absolute chaos, from the sound of things. I already suck at building symmetrical production lines in games that <em>don't</em> simulate things like water turning into steam, which then returns to the earth as rain. Don't even get me started about the prospect of self-combusting slagpiles. Naughty slagpiles! Enough of that now.</p>
<p>Volatile terrain materials aside, you've also got to worry about ancient threats lurking deep beneath the crust. This is problematic, because those forbidden depths also harbour new technologies for your factories. This being such a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>-ass piece of work, I imagine one solution would be to painstakingly dig a channel from the surface and fill the depths with factory byproducts, thus incinerating two birds with one deluge of white-hot slag. But it also looks like you can just head down there with a rocket launcher and take care of business in person.</p>
<p>"Partnering with a publisher means I can finally focus 100% on making the game without worrying about all the indirect tasks that currently eat up a lot of time," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2764460/view/525345073881155519?l=english">enthuses</a> the developer on Steam. "I'll retain full creative freedom while having a team to support me with everything else. I can't think of a better home for Sandustry, and I'm stoked to start revealing future plans for the game, including details on playtests and release dates."</p>
<p>You love to see it. That demo is still live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2764460/Sandustry/">Steam</a>, if you fancy giving it a go.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Acer's 50mm drivers provide a robust soundscape for the price, so it's a solid option for a travel headset or for casual and younger players shopping on a budget. Most impressively, the headset can run for up to 100 hours on a full charge.</p><p>It's also versatile thanks to 2.4GHz Wireless and Bluetooth support. On PlayStation consoles, you'll need to connect the wireless receiver to your console's USB port to establish a connection. PC players can sync wirelessly via 2.4GHz or Bluetooth, with the latter also providing compatibility for Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, Steam Deck, mobile, and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. A wired connection is available with the included, detachable 3.5mm audio cable. The microphone for chat has built-in noise-canceling tech, but it's worth mentioning that the mic will not work with Nintendo Switch consoles.</p><p>As mentioned, the cheapest model at the moment is black with red accents on the headband and exterior earcups, but there are other accents as well as two models with a white base color. All models come with plush earcups and a cushioned, plastic headband. Keep in mind that cheap headsets tend to wear down faster than pricier models due to material quality.</p><p><strong>Acer wireless headset deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLYH2DRN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Red</a> -- $34 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L637P6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pink</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L2QFF1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blue</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L3HLYH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Green</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L3HHKF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orange</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPQB42N1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pastel Pink</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPQ7CRWS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>If you are in the market for a new headset in the $100 range, SteelSeries has just launched a new wireless model in its popular Arctis Nova range, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F9548L67,B0F94KTF6C&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Arctis Nova 3 Wireless</a>.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At an event like Summer Game Fest, where demos and trailers are coming from every direction, the really special experiences are the ones that stay with me long after my demo time has ended. Whether it's the game I try, or the conversation surrounding it, the games I continue to think about days or weeks afterward are the ones I most heartily recommend others explore as well.</p><p dir="ltr">For SGF 2025, that game was Ambrosia Sky, the first project from Toronto-based Soft Rains Studio. The brief demo I played seems like a "clean-'em-up" style game like Powerwash Simulator, but the underlying story surrounding those cleanup missions is so interesting and introspective that it has stuck with me ever since. There is a respect and reverence paid to the dead in Ambrosia Sky that video games routinely lack, and I think that respect is going to lead to a very emotional story when the game is complete.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing Ambrosia Sky is pretty straightforward: I control a woman named Dalia, who holds the role of "Scarab"--this world's version of a "mortician." She's someone who is tasked with disposing of bodies, collecting mushroom samples around those bodies, and testing them to try and find a way to rid the universe of the invasive fungus. As Dalia, I enter a cluster colony near the rings of Saturn, as I've been assigned a recently deceased man to examine.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVVYIfCX6tg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FVVYIfCX6tg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As the demo begins, I'm armed with a pistol-like tool that shoots cleansing water and other elements to remove fungus I see in my path. Some fungi hold special properties--one strain is electrified and can damage me if I get too close, while another is highly flammable and can be destroyed over time with a well-placed flame shot from my tool.</p><p dir="ltr">One room requires me to solve a puzzle by routing electricity to a dormant power terminal in order to unlock the door next to it. I learn that I can use a sample of the electrified fungus to shoot a version of it from my tool, which I can use to create a path from a nearby light on the ceiling to the power terminal, giving it the electricity it needs for me to proceed. It's a neat trick, as it gives a small "aha!" moment and makes me wonder how other elemental blasts will come into play.</p><p dir="ltr">I reach my target and begin the process of disposing of the body and collecting the sample--and this is where Ambrosia Sky ascended from "simple cleaning game" to "thought-provoking experience." Rather than simply standing and watching while the corpse fades away and converts to the sample I need, I watch through Dalia's eyes as she starts the process, and then quietly kneels in front of the deceased, her hands on her lap.</p><p dir="ltr">She places herself in a pose of reflection, respect, and reverence for the dead, creating a moment I found beautiful and poignant. In her own way, she is paying respect to the departed, and I didn't have to press F to achieve it--it was part of the normal gameplay experience.</p><p dir="ltr">This, co-founder Joel Burgess told me after the demo ended, was completely intentional.</p><p dir="ltr">"The idea of after-death care is something we've thought about a lot; there's a combination of sterility and intimacy in it, acting at the same time," Burgess said. "Treating these bodies with respect has been very pervasive throughout, with the challenge being how we actually portray that through actions and presentation."</p><p dir="ltr">Dalia--whose name certainly sounds like it was intentional given the themes of death and dying, but Burgess would not confirm or deny--went through multiple iterations on how she acts around these dead people throughout the development process, Burgess explained. "How does Dalia touch a thing? Is she handling this object a bit too rough?" he says. "That, plus the kneeling posture shown in the demo, are all parts of us trying to convey that respect."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515861"></a><figcaption>Ambrosia Sky</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515862,1300-4515863,1300-4515864,1300-4515865,1300-4515866,1300-4515867,1300-4515868" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's also a personal layer to this story for Dalia--one that the demo alludes to through in-game messages, but doesn't outright call out. Dalia is a former citizen of this cluster, and the person she's tasked with collecting is someone she knew before she left 15 years prior. In fact, if you search the target's terminal across the room from where the body is found, you'll find that he archived the last message he received from Dalia before she left.</p><p dir="ltr">That personal connection is at the root of Dalia's reverence for those she's tasked with performing these last rites for, and Burgess and his team not only explore that through her, but also through environmental storytelling like the terminal above. Every corpse Dalia comes across on her way to her target can be analyzed, and doing so is usually followed by Dalia paying her respects by saying something to the effect of, "I'm sorry I couldn't help you."</p><p dir="ltr">The personal elements to Dalia's story have layers of their own, too: Other in-game messages reference the fact that, in order for a corpse to be collected by a Scarab for this research, the deceased must give consent before they pass away. It's also brought to light that our target only gave his consent moments before he died; Burgess says that, if you look hard enough, you'll learn that the deceased knew Dalia became a Scarab--and that she would be assigned to his collection should he give his consent.</p><p dir="ltr">The layers upon layers of storytelling contained in a game that, on the surface, involves simply removal of fungus from a space station, is what makes Ambrosia Sky so interesting. The focus on death--and particularly the payment of respect to those who have passed--also possesses a universal appeal, which is why Burgess and his team decided to place it at the center of their story.</p><p dir="ltr">"At the end of the day, death comes for all of us; it doesn't matter what culture you're from, what your background is, your age," Burgess said. "You will die, you will know people who pass, you will go through this as well." That relatability, once Ambrosia Sky is released, has the chance to resonate with everyone who decides to give it a try.</p><p dir="ltr">Ambrosia Sky is "coming soon" on PC.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Most Nintendo fans are familiar with Totaka's Song: a short, 19-note melody that composer Kazumi Totaka famously hides in every game he's ever worked on. K.K. Slider once crooned it to a villager in Animal Crossing, while Luigi's Mansion and Pikmin 2 both play the song if you sit on a certain menu screen for too long. Now, the melody has surfaced in Mario Kart World, which makes for the 25th confirmed instance of the melody being hidden in a Nintendo game.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-long-running-musical-easter-egg-has-been-found-in-mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>, a Reddit user by the name of "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1la5xcm/totakas_song_in_mario_kart_world/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">charizardtelephone</a>" found the song in the latest Mario Kart's character-select screen. By moving the cursor to Yoshi and leaving it there, the cute little dino starts humming the familiar tune.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This is not the first time the song has appeared in a Mario Kart game, nor is it the first time Yoshi is the one singing it--in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, if you move your kart close to a Yoshi watching the race, you'll hear Yoshi's voice singing the tune there as well. Fittingly, Totaka himself has provided the voice of Yoshi since Yoshi's Story in 1998.</p><p dir="ltr">Totaka's Song first appeared in X, which was released in 1990 for the Game Boy, before making an appearance in Mario Paint in 1992. Since then, it has appeared in 25 different games, including multiple titles in the Mario Kart, Animal Crossing, and Yoshi franchises. Its most recent appearance before this was 2020's Animal Crossing: New Horizons, where players could request it by asking K.K. Slider to play "K.K. Song."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/154965/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>In 2013 (!), Square Enix released a game in Japan for the 3DS called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/bravely_default">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy</a>, which (after a modest update) eventually received a Western release as just <strong>Bravely Default</strong>. At the time, the company had been focusing development resources much more heavily on games it believed would appeal more strongly to Western audiences, and the developers were shocked when fans responded with overwhelming positivity to a release that they expected to flop overseas. Now that a handful of direct and spiritual sequels have since been made, Square Enix returns to where it all began with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>. Though not exactly a comprehensive overhaul, this remaster stands as a solid refresh of this JRPG classic.</p>
<p>Bravely Default takes place in the world of Luxendarc, which sits on the brink of chaos as the four elemental crystals that maintain balance have been consumed by a mysterious darkness. You begin the adventure as a boy named Tiz, whose entire village was destroyed in the devastating cataclysm that followed the crystals falling to darkness, and soon pair up with Agnes and her cutesy flying fairy companion. As a member of the crystal orthodoxy, Agnes shares that she‚Äôs on a mission to cleanse the darkness from the crystals and restore balance to the land, kicking off a quest to save the world while evading capture from the forces of the Eternian Duchy.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156816/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What begins as a rather rote JRPG plot slowly becomes something much more interesting with the introduction of certain controversial plot twists later in the game. Suffice it to say, the story isn‚Äôt what it initially appears to be, and while the execution of those controversial plot elements could have perhaps been done better, I appreciate how the developers sought to upend expectations. It is, at the very least, a <em>memorable</em> plot, which is far more than many ‚Äòinoffensive‚Äô JRPGs can say.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Bravely Default draws heavy inspiration from the classic era of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>, but with a dash of modern polish and tweaks to make things flow more smoothly. Case in point, enemy encounters are still random when you‚Äôre out in dungeons or the overworld, but you can easily adjust the encounter rate on a variable scale to either double the norm if you want to go all out while grinding or to zero if you just want to explore without being interrupted every few minutes by another gang of mooks.</p>
<p>The blueprint is familiar in that you still explore an overworld, battle enemies in turn-based combat, develop your party, and delve into dungeons for loot and boss fights, yet the developers clearly considered how they could modernise certain aspects of the loop.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156828/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The combat system is arguably the most lauded aspect of Bravely Default, largely due to the fun and creative way that it approaches playing with the economy of a standard turn-based battle system. On any character‚Äôs turn, you can choose to 'Brave' to borrow up to three extra turns (and thus three extra actions) from your character‚Äôs future self to utilise <em>right now</em>, but doing so will create a deficit in which that character then spends up to three turns completely idle and open to any enemy retaliation.</p>
<p>On the other end, the standard ‚Äòdefend‚Äô option is replaced with the 'Default' command, in which your character defends and stores an extra turn action that can then be spent later via Defaulting.</p>
<p>In practice, this leads to a dynamic battle system that rewards careful planning and strategy as you cautiously weave between pressing the attack and falling back on defence. A random encounter with a pack of low-level goons can be easily wiped in one turn by having every character Brave and go all-in on the offensive before your foes even get a chance to respond.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/154964/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Meanwhile the opening minutes of a boss fight may be best navigated by having your designated healer Default for the first few turns to stock up on extra actions to use later for when the whole party gets damaged by a strong AoE attack. I appreciated the increased agency that this combat system affords, as it leads to much more interesting battles with mightier foes as you carefully balance the turns that each character stores and spends.</p>
<p>Another standout feature here is the Job system, which quickly gives you quite a bit of material to work with for teambuilding. As you progress the story and complete side content, you‚Äôll collect ‚Äòasterisks‚Äô that each grant you a new Job that brings with it a unique blend of new commands, support abilities, equipment aptitude, and stat allocations. Each party member can independently level each of the Jobs, growing their proficiency and unlocking more powerful abilities as they progress.</p>
<p>But the real interesting bit comes in when you realise that you can effectively equip a <em>secondary</em> job to a character, allowing them to mix the skills and abilities between jobs that they‚Äôve gained proficiency in.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/154961/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>For example, the Spiritmaster has an ability that diminishes damage output, but bolsters recovery magic. Pair this with the recovery magic casts of a White Mage, and you can have a designated healer who can punch quite a bit above their weight in terms of the heals they can put out.</p>
<p>The Job system was clearly designed for players to find exploitable synergies like this to abuse, and pairing this with the leeway that the brave and default system offers leads to combat that continuously feels fresh as you find new ways to ‚Äòbreak‚Äô the game.</p>
<p>As a re-release of a decade-old game, both the best and worst part of Bravely Default HD is probably that not a whole lot has changed about it. Aside from things like the expected visual bumps and some cute new minigames that use the Switch 2‚Äôs mouse mode, this is almost exactly the same game that you could play on your 3DS all those years ago.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156836/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On one hand, it speaks to its timeless quality that there wasn‚Äôt a whole lot the developers felt they needed to change‚Äîit was a great game back then and it‚Äôs still a great game now. On the other, there‚Äôs a lingering feeling that more could‚Äôve been done to make this remaster more of a definitive version, perhaps through the inclusion of something like the extra side story or epilogue Monolith Soft has added to its recent Xenoblade remasters.</p>
<p>Even so, those minigames <em>are</em> kind of cool, and they do a good job of demonstrating some of the Switch 2 mouse controls' possibilities. The first, Luxencheer Rhythm Catch, acts as a rhythm game in which you control two cursors (one in each hand) that you manoeuvre around the screen to catch beats as they pop up. The other one, Ringabel‚Äôs Panic Cruise, places you behind the complicated controls of the airship and challenges you to juggle multiple tasks as you steer the ship, repair occasional damage to various parts, and adjust things like the AC and radio according to party member requests.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156837/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Both minigames reminded me a bit of the kind of side content that you‚Äôd find in most modern mainline Kirby games‚Äîthey‚Äôre fun, bite-size distractions that offer up a nice palate cleanser from the base game. They clearly aren‚Äôt the main draw and there‚Äôs a rather limited amount of content to explore here, but they also have more depth than you may initially think and take a fair amount of time to master everything.</p>
<p>Plus, they aren‚Äôt <em>totally</em> isolated from the main game‚Äîalthough you can initially jump into the minigames from the title screen, progress in the campaign eventually leads to you unlocking new content in each one. And once you‚Äôve passed a certain point in the story, your performance in these minigames is rewarded with currency you can use to buy special equipment and items.</p>
<p>Visually, Bravely Default HD does a modest job of updating the memorable visuals of the original, although this is hardly a <em>massive</em> overhaul. Everything runs at a smooth frame rate and the bite-sized worlds look great in HD, particularly the richly detailed, painterly look of many towns and dungeons. Yet it‚Äôs also clear that the same squat and simplistic character models from the original release were reused here, and they can look a bit basic when blown up on the big screen of even the Switch 2 handheld screen.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/154962/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Bravely Default HD isn't an ugly game, but it‚Äôs also far from a showcase of the added power of the new Switch 2, and we can‚Äôt help but wonder why a version of this remaster couldn‚Äôt have been produced for the original Switch.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster is a solid update of one of Square‚Äôs finest modern turn-based RPGs. Its combination of a flexible job system, dynamic combat, and unexpectedly interesting story makes for an adventure that no fans of the JRPG genre will want to miss out on, especially any such fans that enjoyed Team Asano‚Äôs more recent work on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> duology.</p>
<p>That in mind, there isn‚Äôt really anything <em>new</em> in this remaster that justifies the price of a double dip‚Äîif you already put a lot of time into this one on the 3DS back in the day, I‚Äôd caution you to first consider just how badly you want to spend your money on what ultimately amounts to little more than a nice visual bump. All the same, Bravely Default was and still is a great RPG; if you haven‚Äôt had the chance to give this one a shot yet, this port is a great way to see what the fuss is about.</p></section>

			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally is launching in a few months, but Microsoft reportedly has yet to commit to a price due to the uncertainty of the current economic situation.</p>
<p>In a new report shared today, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/so-just-how-much-will-the-xbox-ally-cost-heres-what-we-know-so-far">Windows Central</a> corroborated the rumored October launch window for the two handhelds, clarifying they are tentatively slated for late October. According to the outlet's sources, however, the rumored prices of $499 for the base model and $799 for the premium model may not be accurate, as Microsoft has yet to commit to a price due to the tariffs imposed by the United States on products manufactured in countries such as China and Taiwan, where ASUS manufactures its products.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X were revealed earlier this month during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, following a few teases shared in the past few months. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life. The premium X model will be powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, which will deliver higher framerates and sharper visuals than the base model. Neither model, however, will feature a superior<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/"> OLED display</a>, as ASUS had to balance adding the nowadays essential VRR support with power draw and costs, deeming an LCD panel an ultimately better choice.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally handhelds will launch before the end of the year worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-ubisoft-and-creative-assembly-dev-reveals-4x-space-sim-stellar-reach.1220682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Ubisoft and Creative Assembly staffer James Miller has announced&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach</em>, a 4X space sim from his new studio Stelleas, and it's due to arrive on PC this September.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Miller intends&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>to be "as rewarding for genre veterans as it is approachable for newcomers", which is a hard sell; this is, after all, a famously complex genre, but perhaps Miller can truly straddle the line.</p>

<p>Miller and Stelleas promise "classic 4X gameplay across a real-scale, fully 3D star-system map", so if you're a fan of the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stellaris" rel="nofollow">Stellaris</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sins-of-solar-empire-is-making-comeback-after-15-years" rel="nofollow"><em>Sins of a Solar Empire</em></a>, then you're probably going to dig this one as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim-ui.jpg?itok=eckYfwOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim-ui.jpg?itok=Nd4h-kbI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>aims to offer classic 4X space sim fun.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>will feature eight different factions, and Miller says each of them will have "unique tech trees and strategic approaches". You can also look forward to three distinct victory paths: Supremacy, Prosperity, and Industrial Supremacy, which are all fairly self-explanatory.</p>

<p>There's also a "comprehensive research system" in the game, which will grant you access to six tech trees and shared technologies that enable "strategic synergy".</p>

<p>You'll be able to exploit 13 different resource types across&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach</em>'s galaxy, and each will play "a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of your fleets, armies, and industries", according to Miller and Stelleas.</p>

<p><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>will also be taking place across "a fully 3D starfield", although whether or not that means the game will feature&nbsp;<em>Homeworld</em>-style Z-axis combat remains to be seen. I, for one, sure hope so.</p>




<p>It's fair to say the 4X space sim market isn't exactly barren; games like&nbsp;<em>Master of Orion</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galactic Civilization</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Endless Space&nbsp;</em>remain hugely popular among their fanbases, so Miller and Stelleas have some work to do if they want to dominate this particular galaxy.</p>

<p>We'll get to find out whether he can achieve this goal when&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2578670/Stellar_Reach/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, apparently sometime in September. Stay tuned for more.</p>
