            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>release date, so get ready to start slaying some zeds come springtime.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the third installment in the studio's&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series will launch on March 25th across PC and current-gen consoles, and pre-orders are open now if you already know you're going to be playing this one on day one.</p>

<p>Several versions of the game will be available at launch, and pre-ordering any of them will net you a bonus that includes a weapon skin, a trinket, and a player card. Of course, you'll get a bunch of extra goodies if you order any of the non-standard editions as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-floor-3-release-date-giant-zed.jpg?itok=aNSyQFki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-floor-3-release-date-giant-zed.jpg?itok=tlyplPpP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>launches in March.</figcaption></figure><p>If you pick&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>up at retail, you'll be able to get the Standard Edition in North America or the Day One Edition outside of that territory. The latter comes with the Flatline Tactical Bundle and a special skin pack, while the former either comes with the skin pack or the bundle (and costs a little less into the bargain).</p>

<p>As for digital editions, you will,óf course, be able to buy the game on its own, but you'll also be able to pick up the Deluxe and Elite Nightfall Editions, which pack in a bunch of extras and some Creds to go along with them.</p>

<p>If you want to check out <i>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</i>before it's released, you can still <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gain access</a> to the game's closed beta, which runs from February 20th to 24th. You can check out the trailer below to learn more about that.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's a multiplayer FPS that serves as the third installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>franchise. It takes place 70 years after the events of the second game and once again sees you teaming up with your buddies to fight off waves of hostile "zeds" (read: zombies, but with qualifications).</p>

<p><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 25th.</p>

            <p>
Box office hit Wicked features Epic Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> during the movie's most iconic musical number.
</p>
<p>
The film's finale, built around breakout song Defying Gravity, sees Elphaba burst out of a window and try to take flight upon her broom.
</p>
<p>
But what you probably didn't realise is that, during this sequence, the sound effects you hear of Elphaba falling are taken from Fortnite. 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, Wicked uses Fortnite's sound effects that play at the beginning of every battle royale match as you leap from the Battle Bus and glide through the air down to the ground.
</p>
<p>
The detail can be seen in a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBAv0Ld38Lk">The Rough Cut</a>, where Wicked's editor Myron Kerstein discusses the complex sequence and all the visual, musical and sound effect cues that went in to putting it all together. 
</p>
<p>
Kerstein doesn't specifically call out the use of the Fortnite sound effect, but it can clearly be seen within the film's audio mix, labelled "All Skydiving Fly Sounds (Fortnite) - Sound effects for editing", around the 7:20 mark in the video below.

<p>
This sound effect appears to have been released by Fortnite developer Epic Games for use, royalty free. You can take a listen to the audio track on its own below.

<p>
As for Kerstein's video, it's an interesting watch if you've seen the film or have a passing interest in how scenes like this are put together - not least because Kerstein appears to find it amusing how many times Defying Gravity is paused then restarted throughout the film's final scene (too many).
</p>
<p>
Wicked star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-fortnites-ariana-grande-concert-to-rewatch">Ariana Grande is already in Fortnite</a>, of course. So, Epic Games, when can I nab an Elphaba skin?

		<p>And with that, January is done. Often the longest month known to man, it’s actually flown by here, helped in no small part by having lots of games to play. I’m making a started on Avowed for our review in mid-February, and I’ve loved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/eternal-strands-review/">Eternal Strands</a> this week, which is well worth checking out if you have Game Pass. Other than that, I enjoyed some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/27/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-review/">Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</a> and I’ve been tinkering with my Retroid Pocket 5 (not a euphemism) and drowning in a sea of data transfers and microSD cards that have decided they’re unhappy.</p>

<p>First up this week, <strong>Jim</strong> has been juggling a few different games with Alan Wake II at the top of his playlist. He told us, “I’m glad Remedy got another shot at making one of these – the combat gameplay isn’t terribly inventive though I’m enjoying the wacky story and setting. I’ve also revisited Dynasty Warriors: Origins which continues to be great fun. I’d be surprised if we don’t see some kind of DLC in the near future, perhaps unlocking new weapon types.” He continued, “Finally, I played some SMITE 2 which is now in open beta. It’s still a great concept, pitting deities and mythological heroes against each other, and it plays beautifully on PS5. I’m just not sure I’m ready to commit to another MOBA after all these years.”</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> is not here, opting instead to go on his honeymoon to Japan! So far he’s done a tour of Tokyo and set foot on Mount Fuji, and we’re not jealous in any way. Nope, not one bit. *sob*</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> <em>is</em> here, and he’s taken a break from overdosing on Unicorn Overlord to review the side-scrolling beat ’em up Big Helmet Heroes. He dropped an immense bombshell relating to this, saying, “Whilst the game is embargoed until next week, I can exclusively reveal that the heroes do indeed have very big helmets.” After that shock, he managed to play at least one other thing, saying, “I’ve also been playing the recently released remake of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black for review. It’s still great and I’m now even more excited for Ninja Gaiden 4 than should be allowed. The government should pass some legislation to prevent my excitement levels from increasing any more, lest I explode.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/cuisineer-review/">Cuisineer</a> for review. He’s not been well though, saying, “I’ve played nothing else because I’ve been devastatingly ill for four days. Again.” Get well soon mate!</p>

<p>He might also have recovered from multiple illnesses in reality, but <strong>Steve</strong> has been struggling with Stone of Madness, the new game from the Blasphemous devs. He says, “I love the setting and themes but am just awful at stealth and that’s the primary mechanic – should have read up on it in advance!” He continued,&nbsp; “I also ploughed through Gears of War 3 in my rapid run through the series. It’s really impressive how much the games improve over each iteration and I’m excited to see how the next-gen Gears of War 4 shapes up, but I’m going through Baird’s story in Judgement first. I am wondering what will provide the emotional centre given some of the events of 3 which does feel like an appropriate end to the trilogy in lots of ways.”</p>
<p>Finally, after my positive review he’s also installed Eternal Strands and played the opening sections, saying, “It feels pretty cool and I’m looking forward to see how it opens up.”</p>
<p>Finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been playing a shooty zombie game (which required him to install Windows 11, really ramping up the horror factor), shot his way through a bunch of Nazis in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/27/sniper-elite-resistance-review/">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>, and after all that shooting has now decided to start a new life as a tram driver.</p>
<p>What about you, what have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fable, the next entry in the series in development by Playground Games, may be a multiplatform release right from launch, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Spanish website<a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350777664/starfield-fable-y-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-llegaran-a-playstation-5-y-switch-2-segun-nuestras-fuentes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vandal</a>, which previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-big-steam-deck-new-joy-cons/">proved</a> to be somewhat reliable, shared in a new report today that work on the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 versions of Fable has already begun, and the game could release on the two systems at the same time as it lands on PC and Xbox Series X and S.</p>
<p>In addition to revealing that Fable is already in the works for other systems, the new report also revealed that Killer Instinct and Starfield are among the closest former Xbox exclusives to release on other platforms. The PlayStation 5 version of Bethesda's latest RPG has been in the works since its launch in late 2023.</p>
<p>While the news of Fable being a multiplatform release right from launch must be taken with a grain of salt, there's a good chance of it happening, considering Microsoft's new strategy, and some recent statements from Phil Spencer, who said outright that <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-keeping-games-off-other-platform-xbox-series-s-handheld/">keeping their games off other platforms is not the path for the publisher</a>. In addition, Microsoft's new multiplatform strategy has started to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-top-publisher-december-2024/">bear fruit</a>, so it really wouldn't be surprising for the publisher to double down on it, and release some of its most anticipated games on other platforms right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Fable is currently scheduled for a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/">2025 release</a>, so it shouldn't take much longer to learn more about it, including its rumored multiplatform launch. We will keep you updated on the matter as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>Today's new Switch Online addition is&nbsp;<em>Ridge Racer 64</em>, and just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-banjo-tooie" rel="nofollow">other</a> N64 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the service, you're going to need an Expansion Pack addon if you want to play it.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the basic Nintendo Switch Online subscription will get you access to the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-january-2025" rel="nofollow">SNES</a> and NES games, as well as Game Boy classics, but you'll need to fork out a little extra if you want N64, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-genesis-november-2024" rel="nofollow">Genesis</a>, and Game Boy Advance games (as well as DLC for a couple of Switch games).</p>

Unusually, it's also one of the only times Nintendo itself has worked on an IP that isn't its own.</p>

<p>The game received a DS port in 2004, but obviously, it's the N64 version you'll be getting here, complete with its full track complement and range of unlockable extra cars.</p>

<p>You can also enjoy local multiplayer with up to three friends, as well as several different gameplay modes including Grand Prix, Quick Play, and special modes like Time Attack and Car Attack.</p>

<p>If you want to know what you're getting into when you play&nbsp;<em>Ridge Racer 64</em>, you can check out Nintendo's new trailer for the game on Switch Online right here.</p>




<p>Nintendo is currently gearing up for the impending launch of the Switch 2, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">announced the console</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>We don't know when it's releasing yet, but we do know that the Switch Online service will continue to be available on Switch 2, so it's likely that the current console's retro game lineup will also be accessible on the new machine.</p>

<p><em>Ridge Racer 64&nbsp;</em>is available right now for Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack holders.</p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 will take place roughly 70 years after the previous installment, when megacorporation Horzine has created the ultimate army: a docile horde of bio-engineered monstrosities called Zeds. The only thing standing between them and mankind is the rogue group known as Nightfall. The game puts players in the role of a Nightfall specialist, who'll then team up with up to five teammates. Smarter AI, dynamic environments, new and fully customizable weapons, and even more realistic dismemberment are the signature features promised by Tripwire.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Closed Beta Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RCHPgFjXXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If having to wait two months sounds too long, you could try <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing up</a> for the Closed Beta that will take place between February 20 and 24. As a side note, the game's release window s<a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hared in May 2024</a> by Embracer Group has been respected. We'll see if that's the case for two other games published by Embracer, Titan Quest II and Gothic Remake, both of which were also slated to launch by March.</p>

<p>Since its release last week, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has seen a lot of attention from the modding community, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few mods</a> have already been released to address some of the game's most glaring issues and allow players to do something that is not possible in the vanilla game, such as adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-addresses-pop-in-playable-sephiroth-zack/">Sephiroth and Zack to the party</a>. The two characters work reasonably well in combat, but what is possible to do with them is extremely limited at the moment, as no one has currently figured out how to change their equipment and Materia.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the Remake trilogy by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

However, the Nixxes-developed port has debuted to a 'mixed' Steam user review rating, with many players complaining about technical issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, 55% of Spider-Man 2's Steam reviews are positive. “Despite having a high-end GPU and running the latest Nvidia drivers (5.66.36), the game frequently crashes,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/neodemio/recommended/2651280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said one RTX 4090 user</u></a>. Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041082525/recommended/2651280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>read</u></a>: “The game is completely unplayable on PC.

It includes a total of 207 cards and is therefore significantly smaller than Genetic Apex's 286.

<p>The issues persist even for those with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/neodemio/recommended/2651280/">higher-end PCs running the latest drivers</a>.</p>
<p>"Hold off on buying until they get a couple of stabilisation patches out because holy hell," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/">said</a> one reviewer who felt obliged to share their experience after just half an hour with the game.</p>
<p>"To say this is 'rough' is an understatement. Lighting doesn't load in some cutscenes, those same scenes run at seconds-per-frame, audio desync issues up the wazoo, freezing, stuttering, and just about every other performance issue I can think of.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna get a refund for now because frankly, there's other stuff I could use $70 for right now."</p>
<p>Even players who leave a positive thumbs-up are taking the time to caution others.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the launch is pretty bad," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ravyyyyyyy/recommended/2651280/">added</a> another player. "Crashes every 20 minutes or so if you have turned ON the Frame Generation (which, guess what, is turned ON by default). A bit of stuttering here and there. The hair on the models looks awful. OH! And the biggest issue I had, was that I tried to delete my saves so I can start a New Game (you can't do that until you get rid of the old one), and I couldn't do that, seems it wasn't working. I had to disable the Steam Cloud, manually delete the save, and only then it worked. BIG OOF.</p>
<p>"Other than that, haven't had any other problems.</p>
<p>"I am only recommending it because I believe they will solve these issues, as they have pushed a minor patch after the launch, and because I am a Spider-Man fan."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Sony confirmed it was dropping its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">formerly mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements across a select number of its predominantly single-player titles on PC</a>, but introduced in-game content "benefits" as an incentive to continue using one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-period-release-times/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>One of the worst-kept secrets is out in the open—Forza Horizon 5 is coming to the PS5. We know its release period, and the developer has already discussed the game’s release time details and brand-new content on the way.</p>



<p>The Xbox and PlayStation partnership continues to blow minds in 2025. The two companies have waged war for two decades across numerous generations of Xbox and PlayStation consoles. But the tides have turned in the last few years. We’re seeing more Xbox exclusives and Microsoft-owned titles come to the PS5.</p>



<p>Halo is rumored to be coming to PlayStation, as are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War and Hellblade</a>. One title we can tick off though is Forza Horizon 5. The Horizon series (and Forza Motorsport) have battled against PlayStation’s Gran Turismo for years, but now the racer has turned a corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-forza-horizon-5-coming-to-ps5">Is Forza Horizon 5 Coming to PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beauties. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5 and it marks the first time a Forza title has ever been released on a PlayStation console.</strong></p>



<p>We thought the official announcement was coming in 2024, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5 PS5 Release was apparently delayed</a>. The news finally arrived on January 30 to say <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5 is on its way to PS5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-release-period">Forza Horizon 5 Release Period</h2>



<p><strong>Spring 2025 is the release period for Forza Horizon on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>The season of Spring is considered <strong>March, April, and May</strong>, meaning Forza Horizon 5 isn’t far away. I can hear the tires screeching in the distance it’s that close. As the weeks fly by faster than a Lamborghini, we’re sure to get a more accurate release date for you to write down in your diary.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we learn the latest on Forza Horizon 5’s release date. </p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-forza-horizon-5-s-release-times">Do we Know Forza Horizon 5’s Release Times?</h2>



<p>Official release times haven’t been released yet, but developer Playground Games has said to “<strong>Wishlist Forza Horizon 5 on the PlayStation Store&nbsp;today to stay informed about updates and release times.</strong>“</p>



<p>This is significant because it makes me believe we may be getting different release times everywhere. Again, stay tuned for updates on Forza Horizon 5’s release time for PS5.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-horizon-realms-content">Forza Horizon 5 Horizon Realms Content</h2>



<p><strong>Horizon Realms is a completely new piece of content for Forza Horizon 5, and it’s “a curated collection of some of the community’s favorite previously released Evolving Worlds.”</strong></p>



<p>That’s not all though as the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer is also promising</a> “<strong>other surprises</strong>” too. The content is releasing alongside all “the same content as the Xbox and PC releases of the game.” PlayStation 5 players have a lot of gameplay to look forward to and a lot of rubber to burn!</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve primarily been a PlayStation and occasional Nintendo fan in my life, making Forza Horizon 5 my first foray into Forza. How about you? Is this going to be a debut drive? Or have you already racked up a ton of mileage?</p>



<p>We have even more rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-playstation-exclusives-are-coming-to-xbox-next-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox games coming to PlayStation</a>, and we already know other Xbox and Bethesda games are PS5-bound: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-be-on-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod.1096788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly two years since PureDark started <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-mod-for-tes-v-skyrim-is-out-now-alpha-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing</a> his DLSS Frame Generation mods with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. While the regular DLSS mod is available for free, the Frame Generation one was locked to his Patreon subscribers.</p>
<p>At last, the Community Shaders team has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a free version of DLSS FG for Skyrim. This is based on the NVIDIA Streamline plugin; however, due to a long-standing DX11 bug that exists for DLSS FG and Reflex, NVIDIA's technology isn't actually lowering the latency. According to the CS team, this isn't a big issue if your frame rate is already running over 60 frames per second, though, of course, they still hope NVIDIA will eventually fix that bug.</p>
<p>There are a few more caveats. The mod does not support Skyrim VR (you've got space warp there, which they say is even better), is not compatible with the SSE ReShade Helper mod, and also isn't fully compatible with ReShade itself. From the mod's description:</p>
<p><em>Effects will run twice as slow, and depth effects are not supported. Basic effects are fine.</em></p>
<p>To ensure that everything is working as intended, you'll need to set the frame rate limit via SSE Display Tweaks (which is also a requirement) to half your refresh rate (rounded down).</p>
<p>The Community Shaders team acknowledged the sudden release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-adds-smooth-motion-a-driver-based-frame-generation-ai-model-for-rtx-50-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Smooth Motion</a> as a potential better way to add frame generation for the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards; however, this mod remains useful for GeForce RTX 40 Series owners.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Community Shaders suite was recently updated with some major graphics enhancements for Skyrim, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Physically Based Rendering (PBR)</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-dynamic-cloud-shadows-thanks-to-new-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic cloud shadows and skylighting</a>, just to name a few. There's more on the way, too, including a fix to unlock the amount of draw calls so that more of these graphics features can be enabled at once without crashes.</p>

The Tustin, California Micro Center store seems to have received the most stock, but other stores reportedly had 10 or less RTX 5090 cards. While Nvidia’s RTX 5080 was a little easier to purchase on launch day, cards rapidly went out of stock at retailers like Best Buy and Amazon.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1ie4y57/3_days_and_2_nights_later/">Reddit poster</a> claims to have secured an RTX 5090 after three days waiting in line, and others have posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1idr7en/thank_you_miami_microcenter_for_the_surprise_fes/">purchase vouchers</a> that were handed out to people in line at a Miami Micro Center.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-fps-released/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-has-30-40-and-60-fps-modes-for-xbox-series-x.1096779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-fps-released/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new leak has shared that Avowed will have 30, 40, and 60 FPS Modes for the Xbox Series X.</p>



<p>Also leaked was that 30 and 40 FPS modes will also be available for the Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>The news was shared by <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, who shared the information from someone who appears to have got a review copy of the game (which were sent out earlier this week).</p>



<p>Avowed faced some criticism in mid-2024 following an announcement via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w&amp;ab_channel=IronLordsPodcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron Lords Podcast</a> that the game would be “targeting a baseline of 30FPS,” even on the more powerful Xbox Series X. </p>



<p>“It’s a first-person, single-player game, you don’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-doesnt-need-60-fps-mode-says-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">necessarily need that 60 frames</a>. And that allows us to get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting and all this other stuff,” said Obsidian art director Matt Hansen. Of course, after the comments, social media blow up in rage at the lack of 60FPS, but it’s a feature that Obsidian has seemingly overcome.</p>



<p>Even so, Insider Gaming’s Senior Editor Grant-Taylor Hill got hands-on with Avowed at Gamescom 2024 and failed to see any issue with how Avowed ran. “Even in intense combat sequences filled with blasts of magic and clashing swords, the game looked brilliant on screen,” he said.</p>



<p>On social media, players seem to be happy with the leak, with some even going saying that 40fps is the best FPS for single-player console gaming.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, it’s currently unclear on if Avowed will be capped at 60FPS or not on PC.</p>



<p>Avowed releases on February 18, with its review embargo lifting on February 13. You can see more dates on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Calendar</a>. </p>



<p>What do you think of Avowed’s 30, 40, and 60 FPS options? Let us know what you think about this news on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

		<p>Ridge Racer 64 is the latest game joining the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> library of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/n64">N64</a> games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo 64 – January 2025 – Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_AB_X-Blv4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ridge Racer has always been heavily tied to the PlayStation brand – “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaBUeINW_3s">Riiiiidge Racer! Remember that one?</a>” – but Ridge Racer 64 broke that trend, bringing the arcade racer series to Nintendo 64 for the first time. While it drew upon the original Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer Revolution for some of its tracks, this wasn’t a simple port. In actual fact, the game was developed by Nintendo Software Technology – the company’s US-based team founded in 1998 – with Namco licensing the IP to the console manufacturer to develop and publish their own game. RR64 was originally only released in America and Europe.</p>


<p>The game features three different environments and a total of nine courses, which you can play in Quick Play or with a Grand Prix mode. There’s also Car Attack, Time Attack and a few multiplayer modes.</p>
<p>RR64 was ported in 2004 to Nintendo DS as Ridge Racer DS, adding things like touch-screen and wireless support, but the N64 original was skipped over for Nintendo’s Virtual Console scheme over the last few generations.</p>

<p>The game has now been brought to Nintendo Switch Online and the N64 library that is locked behind the higher priced Expansion Pack. As is often the case, online multiplayer has been retrofit into the game, allowing you to play with others online across&nbsp;Battle Mode, Stage Mode, and Team Mode.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-comparison-video-highlights-significant-performance-and-vram-usage-improvements-even-on-rtx-40-series.1096761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new NVIDIA RTX Mega Geometry tech seems to bring significant performance and VRAM usage improvements even on previous generation RTX GPUs, as highlighted by a new Alan Wake 2 comparison video.</p>
<p>The video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Compusemble">Compusemble</a> puts the survival-horror game developed by Remedy running on an RTX 4090 GPU at 4K resolution with DLAA and DLSS Quality, high path tracing, and maxed-out settings running side-by-side with and without RTX Mega Geometry, which was introduced to the game with updated 1.2.8, highlighting how the new NVIDIA tech brings an average 13% improvement and a significant reduction in VRAM usage. Considering the RTX 40 series lacks the 4th generation ray tracing cores designed for RTX Mega Geometry featured in the RTX 50 series cards, the results should be even better on the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/">RTX 5090</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5080-suprim-soc-16-gb-gpu-review-superior-cooling-stunning-looks/">5080</a> GPUs and the upcoming rest of the lineup that will launch in the coming months.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 - First RTX Mega Geometry On vs Off Performance Comparison!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lxg6TRvn70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The RTX Mega Geometry tech seen in action in Alan Wake 2 above is only one of the new technologies that launched together with the RTX 50 series cards. Among them is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">Multi Frame Generation</a>, which is capable of generating more frames than the regular DLSS Frame Generation tech. NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution is also seeing a massive improvement with the introduction of a Transformer model which improves <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-super-resolution-performance-better-dlss-3-8-quality/">image quality and detail</a> considerably over the previous CNN model. Except for Multi Frame Generation, all the tech above is compatible with all RTX GPUs.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The creator of frying pan simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arctic-eggs">Arctic Eggs</a> is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, Sega Bass Fishing, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a>, says developer The Water Museum in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewatermuseum.bsky.social/post/3lbkxvnpxmc2o">post on Bluesky</a>. It may have <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1870901507857817795">a splash</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a> when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1880394328885063771">a strange man</a> might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1881521452324954221">turn completely red</a>. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That is the sum of what I learned from a cursory creep upon The Water Museum's social media feeds. Though it may be a deeper hole than I can account for. There are hints that you might be selling your fish or buying things <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1867366841602936854">at a stall</a> (or maybe just chatting to the lady who works there?). You might have <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1868098692450066667">branching conversations</a> with some of the folks you encounter. It is, we are told, <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1883567851661070599">"not a horror game"</a>. </p>
<p>As I've mentioned in other posts, I enjoy seeing devs share their ongoing progress, even if the stuff they're showing off will likely change in big and small ways. It also means you get to see the fun bugs. Like this attempt to implement <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewatermuseum.bsky.social/post/3lbx56ugr7s22">"triple-A immersive wall-touching technology"</a>. </p>
<p>Again, this is early days. But I am taking note. A previous demo for another short game by the same developer, <a href="https://the-water-museum.itch.io/eating-nature-demo-playtest">Eating Nature</a>, sees you playing as a big-eyed fish yourself, swimming in a small pond and leaping haplessly onto the rocks in an attempt to catch and eat ants that come to slurp at the water's edge. It's a very small prototypey thing, but features the same crispy, low-resolution visual style of their previous game, Arctic Eggs.</p><p>Fish would appear from time to time in your frying pan in that game too, alongside eggs, bacon, cigarettes, cockroaches, and other delicacies. We didn't review the game at RPS, because we are a dwindling sack of mortals whose fingertips wear closer to the bone with every passing day. But I did play it and found it to be a fine example of strong NPC dialogue. Remember when you'd walk around an RPG town and everyone would have just one comically short line, entirely bespoke to them? It's like that. Except everyone lives in a concrete polar apartment complex and some of them are prisoners and also they yearn for cooked shards of glass. Don't overthink it. It's normal to enjoy a bit of glass. </p>
<p>No idea when the fishing game is coming out, or even what it will be called. This is okay. These are the regular stages of creation. Weep if you must, but your feelings are irrelevant. We may choose to tell you when we learn anything of actual importance. Or we may not. Goodbye.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I had to tell you about the latest game being published by Wholesome Games, because not only is it wholesome, it might be the most British idea for a game ever. Is This Seat Taken? is a game about matching the needs of different people as you try to shove them all into places like a bus, a waiting room, or a wedding. Basically, it’s a game where you have to manage spending time with people you’d really rather not. It’s quite possibly the most delightful idea for a puzzle game I’ve seen in a long while, and you should all definitely be excited to check it out when it launches later this year for PC, iOS and Android.</p>
<p><iframe title="Is This Seat Taken? Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5Nw0qzomec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Go on, watch the trailer. You too can’t help but want to play it, and make all these people/shapes happy. Each level gives you a batch of characters that need sorting out, all of which have different needs, either that they have high hygiene standards and will refuse to sit next to someone smelly (if only this were an option on the tube), or that they want a window seat so they can see the view. Different events and places have different requirements too, so at the cinema you have to consider whether the seats are dirty, whether people are sitting too close or too far away, or if there’s someone next to them so they can steal some popcorn. I hope you can solve that by putting someone with low standards next to a dirty seat, and they’ll eat the popcorn off it. Just me? Oh, OK.</p>
<p>There’s actually a narrative at play here, and you have to help Nat to make their way through the world, while organising everyone around them, leading them on a journey of self-discovery and correct seating plans.</p>


<p>If you too are interested in social engineering you won’t have to wait long, with a Steam demo arriving on the 10th of February. I can’t wait!</p>

			<p>A Dark Souls 3 official remaster isn't getting developed anytime soon, but from today, PC players can enjoy playing the third entry in the series by FromSoftware with some amazing visual improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remaster.</p>
<p>The Dark Souls 3 Visual Overhaul mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1849?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, has been developed by fromsoftserve, the same modder behind the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a>, and packs many of the same visual improvements, which include modified reflectance maps to fix an overly metallic look, improved SSAO, improved pointlights, dynamic shadows, removed hero lights from the player and enemies, introduces TAA via Reshade while disabling in-game AA and more. Also, these improvements are only the beginning, as the modder has plans to upscale all textures and add parallax occlusion mapping to more surfaces in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Souls 3 Visual Overhaul is out now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzl0coaV3cc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before releasing the Dark Souls 3 Visual Overhaul mod and the release announcement video above, fromsoftserve also shared a lengthy video detailing the process of improving the game's visuals and how the work on the Bloodborne Remaster Project helped. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>Dark Souls 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the third and, for now, final entry in the series by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-iii-review/">review.</a></p>

            <p>
Hidden away on NASA's <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/voyager-golden-record/">Golden Record</a>, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, <a href="https://fleursdumal.org/poem/102">Élévation</a>, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I'm shamelessly piggybacking on my own academic research here. But look, it's on point. Three Verses is a grid-based first-person "typing RPG" in which you help poets finish their poems by asking various gods to supply the concluding line. "You" being a disembodied soul seeking elevation from a purgatory of royalty-free, PS1-style spaces - washed, pixel-scabbed streets tormented by metronomic trains, interiors made up of soiled slabs and motel doors. Not vast, but certainly sorrowful and vexing. Oh, and hovering synthwave mazes. And minigames featuring bubbled green cats and chunky dice. Your equipment consists of a pop-up organiser for note-taking, with phrases manually typed in. Typing is also how you'll cast spells during simple turn-based battles with creatures like door-blocking gargoyles.
</p>
<p>
The poems themselves - all awaiting recombination, with no apparent opportunity to improvise or deviate - aren't original to Three Verses. As detailed on <a href="https://d-mag.itch.io/three-verses">the Itch page</a>, which includes a free version of the game, they're lifted from Brion Gysin's Permuted Poems and Robert Ashley's TV performance Perfect Lives: an opera, among other texts. As such, the game is something of a restless archive that triangulates some interesting links between various literary traditions, a cousin of the Golden Record that, again, invites the recipient to resolve or toy with the gaps. I played about 30 minutes of the Itch demo yesterday and got stuck on a puzzle involving sewer valves. I'd like to play more, perhaps after it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3139120/THREE_VERSES/">launches on Steam</a>. Now, what would be the most obvious and obnoxious way to finish this article. Ah, of cour

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ridge-racer-64">Ridge Racer 64</a> is now available for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers.</p>
<p>Up until now, the arcade racer - the first Ridge Racer game to come to a Nintendo-flavoured console - was only playable for those who still have a Nintendo 64 hooked up.</p>

<p>Released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo states this "arcade classic" takes you on "fast-paced races across three different environments for a total of nine courses".</p>
<p>"Dive right in with Quick Play to race three laps around the Revolution Novice course or take on Grand Prix and choose any available track to test your skills," the blurb teases. </p>
<p>"Other modes include Car Attack, which lets you compete for better cars, and Time Attack, where the only thing you're racing against is your own best time! Challenge your friends in Multiplayer and put the pedal to the metal in three modes: Battle Mode, Stage Mode, and Team Mode."</p>
<p>Last week we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-three-more-snes-games-promising-puzzles-brawls-and-ninjas">Nintendo added another three classic games to its SNES Switch Online collection</a>, including one not seen in the west before: Fatal Fury 2, and Super Ninja Boy.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, Nintendo Switch Online is Nintendo's answer to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus</a>. </p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-must-pay-to-play-nintendo-switch-online-from-next-week">launched back in 2018</a>, and marks the first time Nintendo has locked the ability to play multiplayer games online behind a paid service.

			<p>Sony angered a lot of PC gamers when it demanded that players register for a PlayStation account in order to play some of their ports, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-will-soon-require-a-psn-account-even-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarok</a>, just to name a few. It wasn't just a matter of not wanting to create another account beyond those required to actually purchase the game on Steam or the Epic Games Store; there's also the simple fact that some countries aren't even supported by PlayStation Network accounts, which made those games impossible to get there.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it appears that Sony has finally heard all the negative feedback on the subject. Four big single player games, two already released, one just released, and another due soon, won't require a PSN account on PC anymore. Instead, Sony is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implementing</a> some exclusive bonuses for those who choose to connect their PSN accounts anyway.</p>
