		<p>It’s no Seikret that we love Monster Hunter here at TSA. There probably isn’t a Monster Hunter title that we haven’t poured hundreds of hours into between us, and it’s probably best we don’t think about the upper limit of that number… Much better to think about all the exciting and fun times that await in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>And so, when our friends at Capcom offered us a chance to come play the first four hours of the game — completely uninterrupted —&nbsp;along with two special hunts from later in the game, we seized the opportunity with both hands.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 6th Trailer | Into the Iceshard Cliffs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFoueW07mxQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This, naturally, came with the same kind of caveats that any pre-release game build has. The multiplayer aspect was still a little sticky and the lip sync wasn’t quite, well, synced. They’re minor issues that are sure to be rounded off in the final weeks and months of development, and the amount of polish that is on show throughout the game is already impressive.</p>
<p>We picked up the game after the opening sequence we last played in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">our first Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a> last September. We escorted Y’sai back to his Kunafa village, taking in the scenery and meeting some colourful new characters along the way. One of our colleagues at the base asked us to keep an eye out for some honey so Y’sai pointed it out for us along the way.</p>

<p>But, as much as I love honey – and hot honey is, of course, very trendy right now – what I was really waiting for was a mission, and it didn’t take long before we were asked to kill a Quematrice — a Brute Wyvern new to Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>

<p>It’s always exciting to come across new beasties, and the Quematrice did not disappoint. This greenish-brown brute with red and blue scales has a large comb atop its head, and a wattle on its throat, giving it the appearance of a cockatrice — unsurprising perhaps given its name. It also has a very large tail that sprays oil on the ground, which it then strikes to ignite.</p>
<p>Aggressive though it was, we dispatched it and moved on, meeting up with Y’sai to continue the dual mission of reuniting Nata with The Keepers and hunting down the White Wraith.</p>
<p>What was doubly exciting is that, unlike the old days of Monster Hunters past, we weren’t sitting around watching load screens. Instead we could just run out the base and leg it to where the monster waited, battle it and then simply move towards our next target in this large open biome.</p>
<p>We soon wind up in a forest, meet some new characters and stumble across what was easily my favourite monster of the day, a Lala Barina. This temnoceran (a monster type that covers arachnid-likes) is also new to Wilds, and is also pretty cool. Well, so long as you like spiders that are red, white and fluffy all over, and have spikey legs. When enraged, its abdomen opens up into what looks like a large rose, and this is where it gets really cool. It shoots out ‘florets’ — neuroleptics that float in the air ready to ensnare and paralyse you.</p>

<p>Naturally, we killed that and moved on, setting up a pop-up base in the Forest along the way. This is a great new mechanic in that, unlike in Worlds, the base can be destroyed by local monsters. In this case it was ransacked by some Wudwuds. These are basically Monster Hunter’s version of the Ewoks, if they were taught English by a surfer from the 60s. It’s a little jarring at first, but unlike your Felyne’s English voice (I quickly changed the setting to Felyne language), it quickly becomes endearing.</p>
<p>A bout with the farting gorilla monster of a Congalala brought back some misty memories of the first time I battled one back in 2006, but the next treat in this area was another brand-new monster, the Uth Duna.</p>
<p>In testament to its strength, we didn’t have to kill this one, just repel it. This leviathan was impressive, coating itself with a veil of water that repels attacks and moving with incredible speed and agility in terrain that you struggle to just walk in. While it was a nightmare to fight, it was gorgeous to look at.</p>

<p>And that’s where our story preview ended. The opening hours had us facing off against three new monsters — a fire, paralysis and water type — and have a crack at an old favourite that hasn’t been seen in a main-series game since 2014. We got to see a few new biomes, meet some new characters, and see the quality of life updates that will be very exciting for long-term fans, and even just those wanting a true sequel to World.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t where our time with the game ended, with two more new monsters and two more biomes from later in the game to see. First was the Rompopolo in the Oilwell Basin.</p>

<p>This monster has a fascinating design. Rather than the typical Brute Wyvern build, it has an insectile head with a mosquito-like nose, scythe-like hands, a forked tongue and a stinger. It uses these appendages not only to jab and slash, but to either shoot jets of poison or inject it into the ground, causing explosion of oil and tar.</p>
<p>All this made for a pretty exciting fight — despite its aggressive nature, we still took it down inside of 10 minutes, like everything else today.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our final monster — the temnoceran Nerscylla in the Iceshard Cliffs.</p>
<p>It was really exciting to get a chance to try another new temnoceran that attacks in a very different way. Instead of paralysis, this one uses poison to attack. It also flings itself across the room like Spider-Man, occasionally dangling from the ceiling as it watches its tiny spider spawn try to rush you. Fortunately, it can be shot down from its cocky little perch with a well-placed shot.</p>

<p>Perhaps the coolest thing about this monster is that if offers a unique insight into the ecology of Monster Hunter. Look carefully and you’ll see that it is wearing a Gypceros hide. That’s some Silence of the Lambs-level nonsense right there.</p>
<p>Our key takeaways from this final preview hands on are that the game is shaping up incredibly well. Combat is smooth and slick, and feels even better than it did in our first preview. The addition of wound damage in Wilds is excellent, adding another dimension to gameplay.</p>
<p>The new monsters we fought are all unique in their own ways, and the biomes we visited are both vast and exciting, underpinning that sense of adventure that comes with each new game. While the weapons and mechanics are familiar, as are some of the monsters that you fight, Wilds feels like a brand new adventure, and that is incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds comes out in just a few short weeks, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-out-in-february-2025/">on 28th February</a>, but I am itching to get my hands on it once again. And if you’re a fan of either the franchise or the genre, you should be too.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows creative director recently revealed what players should expect from the game’s side quests, and it seems we might get some flashback sequences for Yasuke and Naoe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows creative director Jonathan Dumont recently spoke about the game’s world, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-will-adapt-to-the-character-you-are-playing-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dual-protagonist system</a>, side-quests and more during an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a>. When asked about the content of the side-quests, Dumont explained three different types, “objective board or bandits”, “relationship-oriented”, and ones that are “hidden behind a couple of meditation mechanics”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows side-quests that are hidden behind these meditation mechanics are the ones that let you “experience the past” of Naoe and Yasuke. At the start of the game, players will not know who these characters are exactly, but with the help of these flashbacks, they will understand why they are here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective board or bandits side-quests in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be familiar to players. You need to hunt targets across the world, and they each have different abilities and values. It will be interesting to hunt ninjas and samurais this time around. On the other hand, the relationship ones help players build bonds with different characters, recruit them, and explore romantic options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is receiving&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-prequel-manga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a prequel manga</a>. Also, the game&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has the largest file size</a>&nbsp;in the franchise’s history.&nbsp;What are your thoughts on Assassin’s Creed Shadows side-quests?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Ready at Dawn co-founder Andrea Pessino has detailed some of the issues his company faced during the development of PlayStation 4 exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/order-1886">The Order: 1886</a>.
</p>
<p>
Launched in 2015, Victorian steampunk shooter The Order: 1886 was lauded as a technical marvel and one of the best-looking games on Sony's then-new hardware. But its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-order-1886-review">linear approach and reliance on cinematic sequences rather than gameplay left critics cold</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0">Minnmax</a>, Pessino said changes within Sony during the game's production had added strain to its development - most notably, the internal PlayStation team reshuffle that saw Shuhei Yoshida - who had been working closely with Ready at Dawn's team - become less hands-on.
</p>

<p>
"When Shu went to Japan - he was promoted - he became in charge of the whole thing [PlayStation], a lot of people followed him," Pessino said. "There was a whole shuffle upwards. 
</p>
<p>
"Leadership is a delicate balance, one person changes, things change. So everything changed for us after that event. The people we'd agreed on things with had gone... they were still up the chain of command, but you can't bypass it. It's like the military - you can't just go 'hey, Shu!'. So the amount of friction... everything started to change at that point."
</p>
<p>
Pessino declined to go into much more detail on the causes of this friction, other than mentioning that the studio had to spend time discussing "contracts".
</p>
<p>
"It wasn't the only issue but it certainly did not help development in any shape or form," Pessino added, "the fact we were constantly fighting them about the dumbest, stupidest shit possible."
</p>
<p>
Founded in 2003, Ready at Dawn had worked closely with Sony for more than a decade on projects such as PSP installments of Daxter and God of War, as well as the God of War: Origins Collection for PS3.
</p>
<p>
The Order: 1886 was seen as the company's attempt to make its own mark, with a new franchise it could originate and hold the reigns for. Alas, after a mixed response, it was not to be.
</p>
<p>
"One of the problems is so much was cut, a lot of the more subtle narrative parts were lost because so much was chopped away," Pessino said. "Things that were supposed to be interactive became a movie... We were desperate, we needed to ship... We needed at least one more year. And we didn't get it, so it was 'cut, cut, cut'."
</p>
<p>
Ready at Dawn had pitched a sequel to Sony, and held discussions over its setting. It would have contained multiplayer gameplay, Pessino said, and could have launched three years later in 2018. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Sony chose not to move forward with any sequel plans after the first game failed to find a warm reception.
</p>
<p>
"I actually don't think it was the sales, I think it was the critical reception," Pessino said. "Sony is a very proud group, rightfully so. And the critical reception [to the first game] - if it had even been in the 70s, we would have had the sequel, I'm convinced. Just a few points more, it would have been okay. But because it got into the 60s... it was death.
</p>
<p>
"In a way, it's better that they passed," Pessino continued. "Because if we thought we'd have been screwed before... we'd have signed our life away. We were going to do it just because we wanted to deliver to the players, but we would have been... The budget would have been smaller, we would have been completely at the mercy of whatever decisions because we had no leverage whatsoever. We were not in a decision to negotiate a reasonable contract, they could have done whatever. 
</p>
<p>
"But we would have taken it, because we wanted the chance to redeem the franchise, which we thought certainly had a shot. All of the groundwork was really, really good."
</p>
<p>
Ready at Dawn subsequently moved to developing VR games, and in 2020 was bought by Meta - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-and-the-order-1886-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-shut-down-by-meta">until August 2024, when Meta shut the studio down</a>.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’s Creative Director has revealed that the game will adapt to the character you are playing with.</p>



<p>Many have wondered how Assassin’s Creed Shadows can be played with two characters with distinct archetypes and backgrounds. What if someone wants to play with only Naoe to be stealthy throughout their experience, or maybe Yasuke to be as aggressive as you can? The developer has now revealed how the game will change according to the player’s preferences while having unique experiences for both characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-director-on-splitting-time-between-the-two-heroes-the-core-of-the-game-can-be-pick-your-character-and-the-game-adapts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Jonathan Dumont, the game’s creative director, spoke at length about how the dual protagonist system will work for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Dumont explained that Yasuke and Naoe are distinct in gameplay but “complementary” in narrative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the story and the world are experienced from “two different sides.” Naoe comes from a Shinobi background, and Yasuke is a stranger but nobility at the same time. Dumont said he likes how “both voices sound very different, in the sense that they look at the world a little bit differently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont added that both Assassin’s Creed Shadows characters will receive “individual introductions and then they get their own questline”. This means Yasuke can’t play Naoe’s personal quests and vice versa. However, “the core of the game can be pick your character, and the game adapts”, explained the creative director.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont also clarified that there might be “a couple of choices here and there”, which might make players wonder “what would happen with this character”, but he doesn’t think they are “missing out”. The developers don’t want to force players to “try to split the time”; players can decide whether to stick to one or balance it out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-prequel-manga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a prequel manga</a>.

<p>The WWE Universe is once again preparing itself for War (Games). The release of WWE 2K25 continues 2K’s annual take on professional wrestling. With the profession hotter than ever, the developer is looking to deliver a five-star show worthy of headlining any Wrestlemania.</p>



<p>WWE 2K25 welcomes new wrestlers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-features-revealed-including-new-game-modes-and-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">match types</a>, and more chaos than ever before. It mirrors real-life WWE in its sense of progression and scope. The Triple H-era of WWE is producing record gates, attendances, and social media numbers and the interest is sky-high. It feels like 2K’s WWE games have been going the same way.</p>



<p>Gameplay footage has already revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-cover-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover star</a> and a gargantuan amount of graps, and we love it. If you’re also looking forward to 2K25, let’s check out everything we know about its key details.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-release-date">WWE 2K25 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dirty Dom has had it coming. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 releases on March 14 for all players, whereas you can get your name on the card earlier on March 7 via Early Access.</strong></p>



<p>March 14 is the official worldwide launch of <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a>. This is when anyone with any edition can jump in. But Early Access is a chance for keen fans to flex their muscles (and wallet) by purchasing the Deadman and The Bloodline Editions. </p>



<p>Doing so entitles you to a lot more content, including special <strong>Early Access or WWE 2K25</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-platforms">WWE 2K25 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Steam AKA PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox X|S are the supported platforms available for WWE 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>2K has a habit of launching new titles on as many platforms as possible. While it probably means more work for the developer and gives it a harder time when it comes to optimization and balancing out what works and what doesn’t on old-gen, it’s an inclusive way to bring in as many new fans as possible.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, like another common trend in 2025, the <strong>Nintendo Switch misses out</strong>. The PS4 and Xbox One editions aren’t as equipped as the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC releases, but they can still handle a solid version of WWE 2K25. The Switch can’t though. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen if the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> can handle WWE 2K25 or future releases.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-editions-amp-price">WWE 2K25 Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 has a Standard Edition, Deadman Edition, and The Bloodline Edition to purchase. In order, you are looking at $69.99 or £64.99, $99.99 or £89.99, and $129.99 or £119.99.</strong></p>



<p>These are the RRP figures for each edition of WWE 2K25. If you’re going physical, you might be able to get the wrestling title cheaper elsewhere. Also, there is no super-duper Collector’s Edition or anything like that here.</p>



<p>Check out every edition and its price right here.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">WWE 2K25 Edition</th><th data-align="center">WWE 2K25 Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$69.99 or £64.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deadman Edition</td><td data-align="center">$99.99 or £89.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Bloodline Edition</td><td data-align="center">$129.99 or £119.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

"We oversee a diverse portfolio of over 40 companies, including several significant media outlets like Echo24, Týdeník Echo, Hrot magazine, and Radio Prostor," he said. "Most of our operations are structured under the SPM holding company, though Parlamentní listy remains a separate entity."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-new-ceo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ninja Gaiden</em> and <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> studio Koei Tecmo has announced that it has appointed a new CEO, who's due to take office in April. He'll replace one of the company's co-founders in the position.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/news/docs/ir6_20250210_EN.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official Koei Tecmo site (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/koei-tecmo-names-new-ceo-as-co-founders-yoichi-and-keiko-erikawa-step-back" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>), Hisashi Koinuma will become Koei Tecmo's new CEO on April 1st. He's currently serving as a representative director and executive VP for Koei Tecmo Games.</p>

<p>Koinuma will replace outgoing CEO Yoichi Erikawa, who's also one of the company's co-founders alongside his wife Keiko. Yoichi will become the representative director for Koei Tecmo Games, as well as its chairman, while Keiko will become the representative director and president of a new corporate finance division.</p>

<p>As Game Developer points out, it's currently understood that Koei Tecmo won't be altering its strategy significantly as a result of this change, so it's unlikely that Koinuma's appointment will have any impact on upcoming games like <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Koei Tecmo's work, the studio is best known for franchises like historical hack-and-slash series <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> and, uh, ninja-themed hack-and-slash series <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>.</p>

<p>Other major Koei Tecmo efforts include&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series of JRPGs, and strategy sims like&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Nobunaga's Ambition</em>, as well as work on games in franchises like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes" rel="nofollow">Fire Emblem</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>.</p>




<p>Right now, the studio is hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, which subsidiary Team Ninja is co-developing alongside&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Wonderful 101</em>'s PlatinumGames.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo is also gearing up for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-pc-release-march" rel="nofollow">PC release of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em></a>, its historical open-world actioner set during the turbulent Bakumatsu period of Japanese history.</p>

Of course, being Steam with its Remote Play Together feature, this doesn’t exclude those who don’t want awful other people coming in their private space. Most games with a couch co-op feature have adopted this system, that lets you play co-operatively online, without  other players having to own a copy of the game. All of the convenience, none of the vacuuming.</p><p>The remit is spread very widely here, such that anything with a co-op mode is included, rather than being to particular about the furniture used—not least because most people playing on PC aren’t sat in a sofa. And this is to our advantage, of course, because it just means more games are on sale. Valve has done a decent job with the layout for the sale, too, so while—yes—<em>Call of Duty Black Ops III</em> and <em>NBA 2K25</em> are in there, they’re not dominating such that indie games aren’t visible.</p><p>We’ve picked through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/multiplayer_coop?snr=1_4_4__118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/multiplayer_coop?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the colossal list</a></span> for some co-op games you might have missed that we think deserve your attention, or are major titles you already know but now a lot cheaper. Like, you know, <em>Portal 2 </em>for 99c. The list below shows you the sale price, <strong>good through February 17</strong>, and the regular price in parentheses after.</p><hr><p><strong><em>Portal 2</em></strong> - 99c ($10)</p><p><strong><em>Left 4 Dead 2</em></strong> - 99c ($10)</p><p>These two Valve titles are now old enough that you may have missed them the first time around. Both are extraordinary, we’re talking “best games of all time” levels of good. Getting them both for two bucks is wonderful madness.</p><p><strong><em>Baldur’s Gate III</em></strong> - $48 ($60)</p><p><strong><em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em></strong> - $13.49 ($45)</p><p>Obviously any time the best game of 2024 is on sale is a good thing, but if you’ve already completed it, you might want to go back a generation and play the developers’ previous game, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>. You may have been put off by the number in the title, but fear not—this is a completely standalone game, and damned close to as good as <em>BG3</em>. (I, whisper it, think I prefer it.)</p><p><strong><em>UFO 50</em></strong> - $21.24 ($25)</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865">As championed by <em>Kotaku</em>’s backbone, Carolyn Petit</a></span>, this collection of imagined retro classics is one of 2024's best releases, and while the discount here is minimal, the game’s still new enough that this is a great deal.</p><p><strong><em>Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em></strong> - $10 ($50)</p><p><strong><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></strong> - $20 ($50)</p><p><strong><em>Overcooked! 2</em></strong> - $6.24 ($25)</p><p><strong><em>The Jackbox Party Packs</em></strong> - various</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/33030169/view/541096269502742768&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/33030169/view/541096269502742768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The whole <em>Jackbox</em> collection is on sale</a></span> in this fest, the earliest games at 50 percent off, the most recent (7-10) at 35 percent off, bring them down to around $15 to $20 each.</p><p><strong><em>Hellcard</em></strong> - $15 ($25)</p><p>If you ever wanted to play <em>Slay the Spire</em> in co-op, <em>Hellcard</em> is your answer.</p><p><strong><em>Stranded Deep</em></strong> - $10 ($20)</p><p>I feel that <em>Stranded Deep</em> was rather underrated, as a result of its releasing at the absolute saturation point for survival sims. There was very much a vibe of “yet another one” about it, and that’s not really fair. It’s lacking a unique twist (it doesn’t have <em>The Forest</em>’s horror or <em>Raft</em>’s raft) but it delivers the core experience with respectable solidity.</p><p><strong><em>Chained Together</em></strong> - $4.49 ($5)</p><p><strong><em>Pico Park</em></strong> - $4 ($5)</p><p><strong><em>Broforce</em></strong> - $3 ($15)</p><p><strong><em>The Past Within</em></strong> - $3 ($6)</p><p>Rusty Lake’s approach to co-op was, of course, far weirder than anyone else’s. One player is in the Future, the other in the Past, trying to solve puzzles together, while not being entirely sure if you trust them.</p><p><strong><em>Cassette Beasts</em></strong> - $12 ($20)</p><p><strong><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></strong> - $3 ($15)</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Despite his rough-and-ready demeanor, Takemaru’s really a nice guy on the inside. Impulsive, straightforward, and honorable to a fault, he’s sworn to never use his strength to bully the weak.</li><li><strong>Shouma Ginzaki</strong> (voiced by Shun Horie) – A young man who, by his own admission, has absolutely nothing going for him. On a scale of one to ten, his self-esteem’s at negative five. He’s constantly putting himself down.</li><li><strong>Moko Mojiro</strong> (voiced by Kukuko Inoue) – A young woman who is blowing up on the high school pro <a title="Genres > Wrestling [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/wrestling">wrestling</a> scene. Her courage and boundless energy is a source of inspiration for the entire Special Defense Unit. Whenever she has a problem, she faces it head on. She didn’t choose the wrasslin’ life—it chose her.</li><li><strong>Nigou</strong> (voiced by Ikue Otani) – Sirei’s assistant and second in command. An odd little robot that has a gentle, caring personality, but is also prone to making careless mistakes. He’s completely loyal and subservient to Sirei.</li><li><strong>Nozomi Kirifuji</strong> (voiced by Tomoyo Kurosawa) – A high schooler who combines a kindhearted nature with dogged determination in battle. She’s very passionate about the Special Defense Unit’s mission, but also seems to be hiding something. For some reason, Nozomi is identical in appearance to Takumi’s childhood friend Karua.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,627 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,310 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on April 24 worldwide.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Firaxis did note that cross-play multiplayer has been temporarily disabled so that it can "expedite" deployment of the patch, but console players looking to cross-play against other console users should remain unaffected.</p><p>For the changes to the UI, Firaxis says the patch will fix issues that resulted in several bugs, like missing text, portraits not showing up under leaders, and menus failing to open. Other tweaks here include adding a notification for when espionage actions have been completed and general improvements to the layout of text and visuals. Strangely, there's no mention in the patch notes regarding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-players-hear-coughing-in-game-music-but-no-ones-choking/1100-6529324/">weird

			<p>A couple of insightful Nintendo Switch 2 videos were shared online, comparing the new system's specs with those of its predecessor and other current generation systems and more.</p>
<p>The new videos, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FrameRated">FrameRated</a>, are a great way to learn more about the system's specs, how they compare with those of the other current-generation systems and its predecessor, how a comparable PC GPU, the RTX 2050 mobile, handles multiplatform games, what developers will be able to achieve with the system, and more.</p>

<p>A second video released a few days earlier also discusses the Nintendo Switch 2 ARM Cortex A78C CPU, whether it may be able to handle future tech, and how memory bandwidth could be a concern in certain cases. You can check out this second video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU: ARM Cortex A78C - is it Powerful Enough?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b_PRdx02Slk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it is not yet known when the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch worldwide, some people online <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-out-priced-350/">claim</a> to have already obtained a unit, such as a Chinese user who obtained a CAD model of the system. If this user's claims are true, then we may be getting more information on the console sooner than early April, when Nintendo will properly unveil the new system in a dedicated Direct.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be released later this year worldwide. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>What would do, oh what would you do?</p>
<p>Yes, what would <em>you</em> do, with an infinite shoe?</p>

<p>Would you keep ajar infinite doors…alright enough of that. I'm very sorry. I had too much cheap energy drink for breakfast and it appears to have given me <em>rhyming cancer</em>. Also, the urge to browse the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> mods, to see what players of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> were downloading most at the moment. I find there's usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/popularalltime?nav=1&amp;page_size=15&amp;page=2">Nexus Mods page</a> where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game <em>in theory</em>, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.</p>

<p>The two most popular mods are currently one for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14">infinite saving</a> (see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ware-ye-this-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-crash-bug-that-cost-me-hours-of-progress">Edwin's experience for frustrating context</a>) and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/32">instant herb picking</a> ("We all know how good Henry is at his leg day game, but we’ve seen this animation enough times"). Right next to that are mods to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/59">stay clean for longer</a>, and to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/63">carry more stuff</a>. Less pesky simulation, basically, and very similar to the most popular mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance?tab=popular+%28all+time%29">for the first game</a>. A bit further down is my favourite one though, tied closely with this "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/12">totally unnecessary reticle for bows and crossbows</a>".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/125">Infinite shoe durability</a> does what it says on the shoebox - disabling the wear and tear Henry accumulates on his footwear while gallivanting around the Bohemian wilderness, and so eliminating the need to replace or repair his favourite pair. To me, this is both a little baffling (again, surely you play a game like KC:D II for this kind of frictive minutiae), but also very funny, simply because I find the idea of infinite shoes very funny.</p>
<p>So, this is a call out. The first person to mod a quest into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> II where Henry meets the fabled Infinite Cobbler gets my kingdom, my horse, and one pair of my actual, finite shoes. There wasn't a massive quest modding scene for the first game, mind. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/1101">The Cuman War mod</a> allowed you to fight repeatable battles all over the map, and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/958">Architect mod</a> added base-building features, but otherwise the modding tools available don't seem to have been conducive to something like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s many fan-made stories. Ah well, we'll always have those shoes at least.</p>
<p>"Warhorse's historical open world RPG makes Elder Scrolls feel shallow," wrote Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">in his review</a>, "but its deft feudal portrayal is checked by the routine boy's fable at its core".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Order: 1886 arrived in 2015 as an action game about werewolves in Victorian London but, despite being among the best looking games of the generation, it received middling reviews from critics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It would have been an incredible sequel, I can tell you that for a fact," Pessino said, though admitted he couldn't say much because he doesn't own the franchise rights. "We pitched the sequel to Sony regardless of [the critical reception] and, in a way, it's better that they passed because if we thought we were going to be screwed before, man, with the sequel, we would have signed our life away."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pessino said Ready at Dawn had a difficult relationship with Sony while making the original game and ultimately had to cut myriad elements in order to hit deadlines and eventually released The Order: 1886 before it was ready.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The graphical fidelity of the game's initial pitches and reveal led Sony to expect the same quality of builds to be submitted at certain milestones in its development, Pessino said, but payments were withheld when Ready at Dawn had to prioritize other things and temporarily couldn't hit the same graphical standards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Pessino said this is industry standard for third party publishers, it led to a frustrating relationship between Ready at Dawn and Sony. The team was ready to sign up for a worse situation to make a The Order: 1886 sequel regardless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were going to do it just because we wanted to deliver it to the players but we would have been... Terrible budget, budget would be small, we would have been completely at the mercy of any decisions and things because we had no leverage whatsoever," Pessino said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were not in a position to negotiate a reasonable contract; they could have done whatever. But we would've taken it because we wanted a chance to redeem the franchise. All of the groundwork was really, really good, I can tell you that for a fact. There was so much there that just needed to be built on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Order: 1866 was also left on a blatant cliffhanger so fans were desperate for a sequel to come. Ten years on and those hopes are dashed, of course, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ready-at-dawn-vr-studio-that-once-worked-on-god-of-war-shuttered-by-meta">Ready at Dawn being shut down by owner Meta in 2024</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-order-1886-review">In our 6/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Though a stylish adventure, The Order: 1886 emphasizes its cinematic polish at the crippling cost of gameplay freedom."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Remasters of the first three entries in the God of War series will be revealed soon, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>According to Reddit user<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1im4gtf/comment/mc0td3a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Feeling-Examination6</a>, the three games will be announced during this week's yet-to-be-confirmed State of Play and will be released as part of a collection of some sort later this year. If these remasters are real and coming, it will be very interesting to see how much they will be improved over the already available PlayStation 3 remasters of the first two entries in the series and the remaster of the third released on PlayStation 4 ahead of the release of 2018's God of War.</p>
<p>While we have to take the news about these God of War remasters with a grain of salt, there's some reason to believe the information shared by Reddit user Feeling-Examination6. Just yesterday, the user revealed the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/s/17kFt49uUj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hell is Us release date</a> before it was confirmed earlier than intended on the Xbox Store. The user also revealed that Ninja Gaiden would be coming back this year, although this could have been a lucky guess, considering the user talked about a reboot, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> is not.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the popular series is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, which is now available on PC and PlayStation consoles. The game was going to be followed by a live service game in development by Bluepoint Games, which was ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">canceled</a> along with Bend Studio's next project.</p>

<p>SEGA’s unwavering commitment to the Yazkuza/Like a Dragon series shows no signs of stopping. Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is the newest release—arriving quite soon after Infinite Wealth—and we’ve put together an all-in-one guide to its key details.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-gets-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> is a new, fully-fledged Like a Dragon game. It’s one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2025-is-the-year-of-the-rpg-upcoming-rpg-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s biggest RPGs</a> and Goro Majima is the leading man again as we journey through the franchise’s bizarre new direction. If you thought 2024’s Infinite Wealth was starting to get wacky with its foray into Hawaii, you’ve seen nothing yet.</p>



<p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii gives overboard on the pirate theme. It looks to be the most swashbuckling entry in the series’ illustrious history and looks to be a cutlass above the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It makes you want to scream yarrrr! Credit to SEGA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>February 21 is the release date for Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not sure how developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has managed this, but the predecessor Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth was released on Jan. 26, 2024. This means it’s only a <strong>13-month turnaround for the sequel</strong> to happen.</p>



<p><a href="https://ryu-ga-gotoku.com/pirate/asia_en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> isn’t going to be a 100+ hour marathon like many Yakuza games, however, expect to spend a good chunk of time roaming around Hawaii—pillaging and pirating.</p>



<h2 id="h-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-platforms">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC are the confirmed platforms Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is available</strong> <strong>on.</strong></p>



<p>Want to play Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii on old-gen hardware? You got it. Fancy seeing Goro on a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S? You can. Or does PC take your fancy? SEGA caters to most people’s needs.</p>



<p>Nintendo Switch is the only major platform missing out as it stands. The power of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-nintendo-switch-2-direct-reveal-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> might mean a future port isn’t out of the question though.</p>



<h2 id="h-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-editions-amp-price">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>You can buy a Standard Edition for $59.99 or £54.99, the Deluxe Edition for $74.99 or £74.99, or a Collector’s Edition of Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii for $129.99 or £109.99.</strong></p>



<p>It’s standard fare where Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is concerned. A standard edition is the base game and maybe a pre-order bonus. The Deluxe Edition features a lot more content—usually digital, and the Collector’s Edition is for the biggest fans offering the most sought-after memorabilia.</p>



<p>Here’s an easy-to-read table showing every edition and its costs.</p>

                <p>When you think of Transylvania, the first monster that comes to mind is probably a vampire like Count Dracula. Or perhaps even a werewolf. But in the upcoming co-op asymmetrical horror game Deadly Quiet, we're not quite sure what to make of the creatures living in Transylvania's Hoia Baciu forest. As seen in the game's first trailer below, these monsters have humanoid bodies and animal-like heads--including antlers. They also carry around multiple human skulls, if you want a preview of what your character's fate will be if you can't escape.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYJ9blmeFy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XYJ9blmeFy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Deadly Quiet is a first-person game, players aren't looking through the eyes of their characters. Instead, the action is seen through a bodycam, which may be why the visuals look so intentionally rough. There are some advantages to this approach, including being able to spot the outlines of the three other players in co-op, even in pitch-black conditions. The downside is that the camera has less clarity than your own eyes, and it seems as if these creatures can sneak up on you in the darkness if you're not extremely careful.</p><p>Much like last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review-quite-a-pace/1900-6418305/" data-ref-id="1900-6418305">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>, sound is your enemy in Deadly Quiet. Whatever these creatures are, their hearing is very acute. If you step on the wrong twig, they'll hear you. Even speaking into your mic with teammates can give away your position.</p><p>Galactic Crows--the developer behind Deadly Quiet--has also shared a few details about the game's story. Players will assume control of a group of friends who have clearly made the wrong choice by deciding to camp out in the Hoia Baciu forest. Thanks to some very bad luck, the car that brought this group to the forest is destroyed, and the friends have to survive a perilous trek to a nearby town in almost total silence in order to avoid the creatures who live there.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/galacticcrows/status/1888981253543669926" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Calling all content creators! <br>Deadly Quiet is out for wishlisting on Steam.

The game looks to redefine mech-based warfare in online multiplayer PvP battles. You'll take to the cockpit of your own war machine and pilot your way to victory in this new entry in the War Robots series.</p><p>Having been in early access since November 2022, War Robots: Frontiers is set to enter its full release phase, which sees the game move to a free-to-play model. Taking community feedback on board, developer MY.GAMES has made plentiful adjustments, additions, and improvements throughout the game's early-access period. Thanks to frequent playtesting and feedback, the UI has been completely refreshed, a new tutorial has been added, maps have been reworked, and the mechs have been constantly adapted and evolved. The developer has also set up a community <a href="https://warrobotsfrontiers.com/l/discord" rel="nofollow ">Discord</a> where players can continue to provide feedback and get in-depth insights to War Robots: Frontiers' development process.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="183971858" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Stepping through the world in your giant robot feels heavy, with each step reverberating from your weight. Having been built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, War Robots: Frontiers looks simply stunning.</p><p>There's more freedom of expression in War Robots: Frontiers, too. To construct your machine, you can select from various parts options including the chassis, core, weapons, and skill upgrades. This fully customizable mech suits your needs and combat style. Choosing from the appearance options makes it unique to you, too. Finally, selecting a pilot gives the option to unlock specialized abilities, so whether you prefer all-out firepower, more agility, or higher defense, the power is in your hands.</p><div tabindex="0"

Civilization 7 cross-play between PC and consoles is currently disabled, as developer Firaxis has launched a new update just for the PC, Max, Linux and Steam Deck versions of the game. 
</p>
<p>
"To expedite updates to the PC experience, we will sometimes deploy patches to PC at a different cadence than we do on consoles - including today's Patch 1.0.1," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508445806184891583">Firaxis wrote</a>.
</p>
<p>
"As a result, cross-play between PC players and console players is temporarily disabled. This will have no impact on console players attempting cross-platform play with other console players, nor on PC-to-PC multiplayer."
</p>
<p>
Fan feedback to Civilization 7's advanced access period is reflected in today's patch, Firaxis continued, with "some" of the initial issues raised by players addressed.

<p>
Civilization 7 is now generally available, after a week of advanced access which saw the game land with a "mixed" user response on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Today, Firaxis published its PC patch notes for Civilization 7 update 1.0.1 - and thanked fans who had flagged bugs so far. 
</p>
<p>
"We are reading and collecting all of your feedback, and will continue to do so as we roll out improvements going forward," Firaxis said, highlighting its previous pledge to turn the game around.
</p>
<p>
The patch includes a string of gameplay bug fixes, tweaks to the game's AI opponents, and some small improvements to the game's UI. 
</p>
<p>
From a quick scan, there's nothing too meaty here yet - and so it's worth also flagging the work currently being taken on by modders to improve the game themselves. 
</p>
<p>
Take, for instance, the <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/sukritacts-simple-ui-adjustments.31860/">Simple UI Adjustments Mod</a>, which adds a series of handy floating tooltips that save you from having to dig through menus to find information about a particular tile. Handy!
</p>
<p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis told fans it would "need some time to digest all of your feedback"</a>, but pledged to prioritise community-requested features such as being able to pick starting and ending Ages, and adding hotseat multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
"A competent entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality," Sin Vega wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer's Civilization 7 review</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Civilization 7 update 1.0.1 - Windows PC/Mac/Linux/Steam Deck patch notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>

<li>Fixed inconsistencies with Naval Combat.</li>
<li>Naval Units will use the correct Combat Strength values when attacking another Naval Unit in all instances.</li>
<li>Naval Units will properly take reciprocal damage after attacking another Naval Unit.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue after too many bonuses to Growth where Food needed for the next growth event became negative.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/edifier-hecate-gx05-gaming-earbuds-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You really do owe it to yourself, to your games, and to the audio designers and composers out there to make sure you can hear the games you’re playing with the best fidelity possible. Outside of a new GPU for PC gamers, or a fancy new OLED TV or monitor, high quality earbuds or headphones are perhaps the best way to upgrade your entire gaming experience.&nbsp;With the Edifier Hecate GX05, a pair of gaming-focussed true wireless earbuds, Hecate may have won the award for most over-engineered earbud case, but frankly, I couldn’t love it any more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edifier Hecate GX05 - 15ms Ultra Low Latency Gaming Earbuds" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNT1iS7OLGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The unboxing experience is immediately a bit different. The GX05 arrives in a serious plastic case emblazoned with the Hecate logo and a big red clasp. Opening it feels like you’re going to find a top-quality watch inside rather than a pair of earbuds, but you immediately see the metal form of the GX05’s charging case nestled at the centre of the package.</p>


<p>It looks, for want of anything else, like a prop from a Star Wars movie. It’s seriously heavy, with its metal build adding both weight and the sense that this is a premium product. The earbuds, and the 2.4Ghz USB-C dongle nestle inside, protected by a three-armed metal frame that rotates with a supremely satisfying click. Rotating this frame also starts the RGB lighting, with the case itself and each earbud boasting matching lighting strips. I expected a hologram of Princess Leia to jump from it, and the only disappointment was that it didn’t…</p>
<p>All that weight and the many edges mean that the Hecate GX05’s case is not one you’re likely to pop in your pocket, and probably not in a bag with any other uprotected electronics – the zinc alloy build means it’s more than likely to scratch any screen it comes into contact with. Still, it makes a great focal piece if it’s kept on the side, or, perhaps it would do a great job as an illuminated paperweight.</p>


<p>The premium experience is borne out by the GX05’s £149.99 RRP, though if you’re willing to import, it looks as though you can find it for well under that. The earbuds themselves match the silver finish of the case, though rather than being fashioned from metal, they’re light and sturdy plastic. The body of each is a little chunky, but I found they stayed easily in place, and looked sleek enough to any observers, especially with the ice blue RGB strips lending them something of a Tron look.</p>
<p>The RGB is controlled via the case, with the pairing button on the underside taking double duty to cycle through the different solid or breathing colours. Those looking for something a little more subdued will be happy to know that you can turn them off altogether, but if you do that, are you really a G4M3R?</p>
<p>If you’re connecting via Bluetooth, the GX05 is capable of the standard SBC codec or the high-resolution LHDC 5.0, meaning that it’s certified for Hi-Res wireless audio, but only if you’ve got a device capable of it. I’ve got a brand-new Honor Magic V3 and it supports LDAC but not LHDC, meaning that I’m stuck to the painfully ordinary SBC unless I use the dongle. Using SBC, the sound is fine, but far from special.</p>
<p>The GX05 comes to life when you use the dongle. Given that most things made in the last couple of years are equipped with USB-C, it worked perfectly with my MacBook, Nintendo Switch, the Magic V3 and my PC, and the audio quality is absolutely fantastic, the 10mm drivers delivering crystal clear audio directly to your ears.</p>

<p>I did find that it seemed more important to get the eartip sizing right than with some earbuds, but once I’d selected the right one, it delivered both high and low frequencies with stunning detail. Given the Hi-Res certification, it’s almost reductive to say that I was able to hear parts of a song that I’d never heard before, but in the case of Papa Roach’s Liar – on heavy rotation thanks to watching them live this week – it sounded like an entirely new song.</p>
<p>The Hecate GX05 do a fantastic job with music, but they are designed for gaming, with a low 15ms latency helping keep you in tune with the on-screen action, while the high-quality audio delivers every detail. I put them through their paces with some Overwatch 2, and I could hear the enemy team running for their life – I might have imagined that bit – while picking up the movements of those still coming to try and take mine.</p>
<p>The microphones do a decent job of keeping things clear and concise, letting your teammates know exactly why you’re not very happy as no one plays the objective as they run off in random directions – I hate multiplayer gaming sometimes. That’s not the GX05’s fault though, and they’ve proven to be a great companion for gaming, no matter what’s happening on screen.</p>

            <p>
Comicbook mulchfest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> once planned to reset player ranks twice per season, but these recently-hatched plots are no more, for the gamers have descended upon NetEase like rogue Iron Man suits, and the developers have acquiesced to their verbal kicks and punches.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Yesterday, NetEase <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html">announced</a> that they would reset player ranks on 21st February to inaugurate the second half of the hero shooter's first season. The idea was to "shake up the battlefield" alongside the arrival of new characters The Thing and Human Torch plus some "major balance adjustments". Specifically, players were told to expect a rank drop of four divisions, in order that they might rank-up afresh to unlock new rewards such as costumes and crests.
</p>
<p>
"After careful observations and consideration, we have concluded that players' ranks during the first half of Season 1 are the best indicator of their competitive skills within the season," the devs wrote. "So, we will be introducing additional rank reset to better align with the upcoming content and changes!"
</p>
<p>
That jovial exclamation mark was a provocation too far. Like wrathful yet relatively articulate Hulks, the players took to their keyboards and filled social media and Reddit with their outrage. I don't truck much with Marvel Rivals at the minute but I can understand the complaints: imposing rank resets at this frequency forces players to pump in more time to earn the game's digital trinkets. It feels like a cheap and dirty way of driving up Engagement, the worst Marvel supervillain of all.
</p>
<p>
NetEase have heard the cries of the faithful, and are rolling back the changes. "After the release of Dev Talk 10 regarding the seasonal rank adjustment, we received a wealth of feedback from the community," reads a conciliatory note, <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html">issued today</a>. "A common concern was the pressure associated with having a rank reset every half-season, which has made participating in competitive mode less enjoyable." 
</p>
<p>
 As such, there will no longer be a rank reset when the second half of season 1 begins on 21st February. If you're already max rank and you want to earn rewards in the remainder of season 1, you'll simply need to complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet "the relevant conditions".
</p>
<p>
Marvel Rivals remains popular despite these fan skirmishes. It's 7th on the Steam Most Played chart at the time of writing, vying with hardy perennials <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and the Wallpaper Engine for its place in the top 10. I haven't played not so much for lack of enjoyment but because the last time I did the chibi shark kept eating me, and I felt bad about myself.

<p>Marvel Rivals developers are going back on their decision of rank resets for the second half of the first season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-detail-season-and-half-season-ranks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer update</a> for the second half of the upcoming season. In it, we learned about the release date, forthcoming changes, and a rank reset that drops players by four divisions. This worried many players, as they would have to drop four ranks now and another six ranks when the second season begins. Naturally, there was a huge uproar, and due to the massive feedback, Netease decided to reverse the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from Marvel Rivals delves deeper into the concerns around rank reset. NetEase understands that a rank drop every half-season will make the “competitive mode less enjoyable” for the community. Hence, rather than a rank reset, players must “complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the relevant conditions by the end of the season” to earn new rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rewards for the end of the second half will be the same as those they just received. Players will be eligible to earn “a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.” The Marvel Rivals community is <a href="https://x.com/Valennxxte/status/1889209660822970688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">happy</a> their concerns received a swift response from the devs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals has its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-section-disney-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own section on Disney Plus</a>. Also, Ninja thinks NetEase’s new game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-dead-ninja-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has killed Overwatch</a>.

            <p>
PUBG: Battlegrounds maker Krafton has said it generated record sales and profit last year - which was its best in the history of the company.
</p>
<p>
Originally launched in 2017, battle royale PUBG shifted to a free-to-play model in 2022 and has seen continued growth ever since. 2024 saw the game hit its best-ever concurrent peak - of 890,000 players.
</p>
<p>
Spending in PUBG across PC and consoles globally last year totalled "nearly" a 1tn korean won - around £556m - breaking Krafton's own record for the game.

<p>
On smartphones, PUBG's breakout spin-off Battlegrounds Mobile India saw its sales rise by 35.7 percent year-on-year, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
Next up for Krafton is its plan to secure a new big franchise IP,  while continuing to update PUBG and grow the game's Indian mobile spin-off. 
</p>
<p>
The company will launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-sims-like-inzoi-delayed-into-next-year-to-give-it-a-stronger-foundation">inZoi, a visually-impressive Sims-like game, on 28th March via Steam early access</a>, following a delay from last year. Could this be Krafton's next big franchise?
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming titles include fantasy extraction RPG Dark and Darker Mobile, underwater survival sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, and pioneer life simulation game Dinkum Together.
</p>
<p>Last year, Krafton hit the headlines when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">scooped up Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft effectively closed the studio</a>. There's no official word - yet - on what that team is up to next, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">Krafton has acknowledged the fan desire for a Hi-Fi Rush sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Robert Yang's next game is Tryhard, a turn-based RPG in the world of rugby described as part of the "sportslike" genre.</p>
<p>Yang is known for his controversial games exploring explicit queer themes of sexuality, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robert-yangs-the-tearoom-appeals-to-censors-by-swapping-cocks-for-glocks">bathroom simulator The Tearoom</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-as-a-burly-sexy-lumberjack-in-this-forestry-sim">sexy lumberjack game Logjam</a>.</p>
<p>Tryhard is decidedly more tame, though judging by its trailer it still includes LGBT+ representation with its relationships.</p>

<p>Set in New Zealand, players will be tasked with managing an underdog rugby club. "Everyone expects you to fail," the Steam description reads. "You've never even played rugby before! But you'll prove them wrong, challenge the champs, and win the Ramphorlie Shield." How very Ted Lasso!</p>
<p>There will be management sim elements, a branching story, relationships to manage and - perhaps most interestingly - rugby matches based on turn-based battles between mixed gender teams.</p>
<p>There's even a dog who can join your team.</p>
<p>Tryhard will be the first full release from Grapefruit Games, a studio co-founded by Yang that has previously worked on artistic and support projects.</p>
<p>As part of the game's announcement, the studio has released its <a href="https://grapefruitgames.com/sportslike/">"sportslike manifesto"</a> to establish the genre. "The sports game is too busy," it reads. "Everyone expects franchise-career modes, motion captured stadiums, sweaty grass physics, and the latest microtransactions."</p>
<p>By contrast, a sportslike game focuses on the way people interact with a sport - not just playing the sport itself, but the people behind the scenes, its news and history, and the lives of players.</p>
<p>The studio suggests a number of already-released games that could be considered sportslikes, including 2017's Golf Story and 2023's Roller Drama. Presumably the RPG mode of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-golf">Mario Golf</a>'s Game Boy outing would count too.</p>
<p>Tryhard is yet to receive a release date, but is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3443270/Tryhard/">Steam</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap is another studio attempting to redefine the sports genre, as its next game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">Rematch</a> - is a fresh take on football action.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> of the official Baldur's Gate 3 modding tools by Larian back in September 2024, the modding community has begun creating full-fledged custom campaigns for the award-winning cRPG. One of the first to get a playable version is '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14914/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Grand Theater - Sell your Lute to the Devil'</a> by Moezilla. Here's the overview provided by the modder:</p>
<p><em>This is a custom modded campaign set nestled on the outskirts of Baldur's Gate, hidden from the prying eyes of the city, stands an imposing, yet strangely inviting structure: The Grand Theater. The flickering lights of lanterns and the alluring sound of music draw in travelers from far and wide, promising an experience of unparalleled entertainment. However, what lies beneath the polished veneer of extravagant performances and mesmerizing illusions is a darker, more sinister story.</em></p>
<p><em>The theater is owned and operated by a powerful faction known as the Red Wizards of Thay—arcane masters and manipulative schemers whose true intentions are often cloaked in secrecy. As they push their hidden agendas, they have crafted a show unlike any other: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for performers to showcase their talents... but at a cost.</em></p>
<p><em>In the halls of the Grand Theater, you’ll find that the show must go on—but the question remains: who will be the star of the final act, and what will they lose to secure their place under the spotlight?</em></p>
<p><em>This is a world where the Red Wizards hold the strings, and you’ll have to decide whether the cost of fame is worth the price of your soul. Will you play your part, or will the Devil demand his due?</em></p>
<p>The modder warns users that they should have finished the base Baldur's Gate 3 campaign first. This is because Larian has reportedly made it so that if you never encountered some NPCs in the default game, they won't appear in modded campaigns, either.</p>
<p>Additionally, version 1.0 is very limited in its feature set. Players will find around two thousand new lines of dialogue (text-only, no voice acting or lip sync), with six quests that can be started but only one that can be currently completed. There's also no combat yet, though the modder plans to add it to version 1.1.</p>

<p>Some of the most exciting Baldur's Gate 3 custom campaigns to look forward to include Path to Menzoberranzan by Lotrich (who just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oBlmSvi1So" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a video showing off the mod's progress) and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forsaken</a>, which is set in the world of Warcraft, more specifically in the Undead starting zone of Tirisfal Glades. Forsaken is also currently very early, with only the starting area available.</p>
