What better way to follow <a href="https://aftermath.site/anger-foot-dark-messiah-kick-button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a passionate plea for all games to have a kick button</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/kick-button-all-games-moving-houses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the beginning of a revolution in which all games will</a> than by honoring the many flying feet that have come before? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we remember all the kicks that have knocked us flat over the years.</p><p>We begin the episode by discussing a week that feels like it’s lasted ten years, largely due to an assassination attempt against Donald Trump, the aftershocks of which have rattled every corner of the internet, including the world of video games. Almost immediately after it all went down, players of games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Minecraft </em>began <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-roblox-minecraft-steam-trump-assassination-attempt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digitally recreating the scene</a>. Companies, in turn, have moderated some instances of this and washed their hands of others. We reflect on <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-should-we-talk-about-the-trump-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what it all means</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We also dig into some significantly more lighthearted topics, including the best kicks in video games and <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris’ espresso-centric mad science projects</a>. Then we, three people who are not licensed therapists, offer some extremely good mental health advice: <a href="https://aftermath.site/log-off-cross-intro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">log off</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can amass the time and resources necessary to retroactively add a kick button to every game that’s ever existed.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What kicks do you think best represent the form?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Most obvious is Chun-Li. I mean, that’s just all kicks.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I’ve thought about this, though, because how are we defining this? There’s a lot of games where you kick, like <em>Street Fighter</em>, like you just said, Chris. There’s a lot of kicking. But it feels like there’s a distinction between a game that features kicking and a game that specifically breaks down a kick button, like a first-person game. In a fighting game, you expect kicks. It’s standard. But a first-person shooter where you can kick a door down feels more special, more worthy of focusing on.</p><p>Otherwise, I would just say <em>Yakuza</em>. Because fuck, those kicks are awesome. You kick dudes into walls and stuff, and their faces break. It’s amazing. But I don’t think <em>Yakuza </em>qualifies. I think <em>Duke Nukem 3D </em>qualifies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think <em>Dying Light </em>has one of the best kicks, because it’s just a dropkick.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It sends zombies flying off rooftops. Incredible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That usually ends with them hanging off a light post or something like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> has something similar. It’s not as well staged, but a few bad guys you run into, you can just kick ‘em. I think you kick doors down, when you’re running full speed?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>That’s interesting, though, because I saw somebody talking about the <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> kick, and they were like “It’s a really good kick, but it also feels at odds with my conception of Faith as a character. I didn’t really feel like she’s somebody who would kill people, and so I tried to avoid using that.” Because you could just kick dudes off buildings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>You can avoid every fight, I think, except a brief quicktime event battle with a boss. I’m pretty sure every other piece of combat can be avoided. But yeah, that’s the broader argument with <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>: The combat itself doesn’t fit the game. But if you do want to do it, the sliding kick and the dropkick in <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> are – if you can put aside the conflict between the mechanics and the character – very cool.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It also just feels like a kick better fits any sort of game that’s very movement heavy. A kick arises from the legs, so you can jump right into it. Much harder to jump into a punch. Not impossible, but harder. And so anytime you slow that entire progression down and start to do hand-to-hand combat, it no longer feels in sync with the rhythm of the game. Which is another cool thing about kicks: They change the dynamic of the way that you’re fighting.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>A kick is more disruptive. You can come in and out of punches really quickly without disrupting your stance or the viewpoint, but for a kick, you have to be way more dedicated. And that’s why the coolest kicks you get in games – like the <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> one, like the <em>Dying Light </em>one – they actually disrupt your view. The camera will jerk in a weird way or there’s a specific sort of animation focus on it where it’s like, for 0.8 seconds, the entire game is focused on this kick. That sort of immersion and dedication to the act is I think what lies at the heart of conversations like this. It makes something that sounds mundane actually really fucking cool and special and fun.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I do think that, historically speaking, kicks in FromSoft games have been bad. However, the kick in <em>Sekiro</em>, if I remember correctly, is really, really good. And kicks in <em>Elden Ring</em>, that wasn’t a good Ash of War, but then they introduced Dryleaf Dane’s weapons. He has one that’s fists and kicks, and then you later on get one that’s just kicks. And so kicks just got better, and now there’s an actual amulet you can get that is all kicks, basically. So it buffs your kicks, which makes it a very powerful move, because a lot of things count as a kick. So there are kick-based builds that are now fun in <em>Elden Ring</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Going back to what Luke was saying for a second, I agree that the disruption of a moment with a kick is really key to what makes it so much fun. Because I got into this in one of my pieces a little bit, but I do think there are a lot of things that are not explicitly kicks that could be considered akin to them. I included the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> shove, just because it’s a means of very forcibly relocating your enemies – making them go flying from one place to another place, or off a ledge.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I don’t know if I agree with that on a basic level.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I’m building to a broader point here, though. You could also put, like, the Fus-Ro-Dah from <em>Skyrim </em>in a similar category <em>if </em>you were categorizing it this way. But, in both those cases, you do not have a giant foot coming out of nowhere to deliver that force and, as you were saying, Luke, disrupting your field of view – causing everything to shake and move in this tangible way. I think you can make both arguments, but sometimes you just want the big foot to appear.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think I’m a foot purist. I think I’m really a foot purist. I don’t think it counts if you use your hands. That’s a different thing.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Here on Aftermath Hours, we’re all foot guys.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I’m not. But I am a purist when it comes to the form. I think it being a concussive or pushing thing is a venn diagram of, there are many foot things that involve pushing, but there are many foot things that also involve striking, and so I think it can encompass both of them, but it’s sort of a logical fallacy to believe that all things involving pushes are implicitly kicks. It doesn’t make sense logically to me. But I understand the spiritual gameplay mechanic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think I mean more in the sense that, when we’re talking about games, some of the most enjoyable parts of a kick often involve people being sent flying backward and that forcing them to traverse terrain in a way they were not expecting – or being pushed onto new terrain, or being harmed by a wall, or a spike trap or whatever. And so, as a result, these other motions that kind of accomplish something similar feel like kicks to me, because that’s what kicks in games so often do. It’s the purpose they actually serve, mechanically.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I think <em>Bayonetta</em>’s got a lot of good kicks. Does<em> Devil May Cry</em> have a boot thing? I forget. It’s been a minute since I played the last DMC game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I feel like <em>God Hand</em> has some good ones.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> <em>God Hand</em> has a lot of good kicks. Anything in that lineage, I think, is going to have a pretty good kick. But <em>Bayonetta</em>’s all legs, so it’s gonna happen. And by extension, <em>Smash Bros</em> has some good kicks, I think. Doesn’t Ganondorf have one where he lifts his leg up and slams it down?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> He has a similar move set to Captain Falcon, so he has his own version of the Falcon Kick.&nbsp;</p><p>Did either of you play <em>Dark Messiah of Might and Magic</em>? That was the game that sealed the deal for me in terms of being a video game kick appreciator. It was such an interesting game for its time, because I believe it was running on the Source Engine, and it came out not long after <em>Half-Life 2</em>. But it was pretty radically different. It was not a shooter; instead it was a first-person melee sword-and-shield brawler game, with some magic. It was kinda immersive sim-y, but a little bit removed from that.&nbsp;</p><p>And yeah, it just ruled. The combat was very detailed and hard hitting in first person, which you still don’t see that much of and definitely didn’t see that much of back then. I remember back then it was, like, that and <em>Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</em> if you wanted really good first-person melee combat. But what <em>Dark Messiah</em> had going for it was this amazing kick. Opponents would cover up a lot, so then you’d kick them, and because the game was Source-based, it was very physics-y. And so if there was somebody standing next to stairs and you kicked them, they’d go tumbling down and ragdoll around.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Source had the best fucking physics.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yep. It was amazing. And then enemies would climb back to their feet, but what this game got right is, instead of them just being perfectly OK after that terrible experience, your enemies would be pretty beat up from falling down the stairs. And then they’d drag themselves at you very slowly in this honestly pretty pitiful way. But when you’re in that mindset already, you’re like “Hahaha, I feel so evil.” That, to me, is the best kick in video games.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Digital Extremes invited Wccftech to a recent media preview of TennoCon 2024, where we got to watch today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tennocon-2022-roundup-new-mmo-soulframe-announced-veilbreaker-teaser-trailer-duviri-paradox-details-announced-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulframe</a> presentation in advance.</p>
<p>The presentation started with a first look at the character customization process, where players will be able to choose the physical traits of their mother (complexion, hair, eyes, etc.) to determine their own. The player character's mother is a Night Maiden, a role that was described as a ward of different counties in the part of the world where the game is set.</p>
<p>The developers then moved to discuss the Warsongs Prologue, a Fable introducing the world, its characters, and beasts. It's a sneak peek at an experimental approach to choices and character design. As an Envoy, players must heal the Ode curse to restore the forgotten culture and memories to the beings of Alca.</p>
<p>Ancestry is a big theme in Soulframe. Players will gather various Ancestors in the Nightfold (a sort of parallel dimension) to make use of their skills. In the presentation, Digital Extremes introduced Verminia, the Rat Witch, who can enhance the customization of cosmetics while also assisting in crafting potions, elixirs, and other tinctures. Interestingly, we got confirmation that you can go back to the Nightfold from anywhere in the world as long as there is no enemy in the vicinity, which will allow you to craft things easily or just change gear as needed.</p>

<p>Digital Extremes is calling Soulframe's structure Overworld, a 'very large' overworld. Later, during the Q&amp;A, I asked for a comparison with Warframe's open zones and was told that just the starting island is twice as big as the Plains of Eidolon. Still, the studio is spending much time on adding content density rather than just focusing on map size.</p>
<p>The developers also provided a first look at a new enemy called Nimrod, who manipulates thunder and lighting while wielding a devastating tesla-coiled melee staff.</p>
<p>We then learned that the next game from Warframe's developers will launch in some form of early access later this year. Preludes (the current Pre-Alpha build) is going to be opened to everyone at some point this Fall, though the developers warned it might be rough at first, just like Warframe when it launched in 2013. Soulframe Creative Director Geoff Crookes said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The closed testing we’ve been doing with our community has been so impactful; we’ve learned a ton, and we continue to listen and learn each day. We’re hoping to open this up to a lot more players this Fall. Everything is still rough around the edges, but that’s part of our style - the feedback is important to us, and we really do iterate on it regularly.</em></p>
<p>There will be some Founder's Packs things, but Digital Extremes will try to make it 'less exclusive' than Warframe's.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-games-in-development/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Netflix has enjoyed a successful push into the games industry, with the platform’s more interactive elements peaking in popularity with the introduction of classic Grand Theft Auto games. To that end, the streaming titan has reiterated that it has more than 80 games in development, many of which are based on ‘specific Netflix IP’, such as the Squid Game title that was recently given a release window.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-very-different-types-of-games">‘Very Different Types of Games’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/18/netflix-nflx-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent earnings call</a>, Netflix’s representatives stressed that the playing field is set to become more diverse. While the company has been able to capitalise quite quickly on ‘interactive narrative games’, a diversification effort is in the pipeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have lots more, including very different types of games yet to come in the quarters and years ahead.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s ultimately a mission to keep users on-platform when the inevitable pause between seasons lands. Netflix wants to keep subscribers engaged, even when their favourite show is taking a break or has hit a lull. That was a sentiment raised by Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO at Netflix:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think our opportunity here to serve super fandom with games is really fun and remarkable. I think the idea of being able to take a show and give the super fan a place to be in between seasons, and even beyond that, to be able to use the game platform to introduce new characters, the new storylines or new plot twists, now, you could do those kinds of things and then they could then materialize in the next season, or in the sequel to the film.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Netflix has released several show- and movie-themed games on the platform, including the likes of of:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Queen’s Gambit Chess</li>



<li>Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales</li>



<li>Too Hot to Handle: Love is a Game</li>
</ul>



<p>And of course, indie developers have flocked to the platform to use it as a staging ground to bring their games to a new and thriving market. Pretty soon, consoles will be a thing of the past as users just turn on their television, grab a remote, and start streaming or downloading games through an application like Netflix. That’s what Xbox is aiming for with Game Pass, of course – why not Netflix, too?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-the-most-beautiful-horror-games-i%E2%80%99ve-ever-played-is-free-on-epic.932712/</guid>

<p>Until July 25, Epic Games is offering Maid of Sker for free on the Epic Games Store (on PC). This is one of the most chilling games I’ve ever played, and it boasts some seriously innovative elements. It’s also beautiful, featuring a gorgeous world, masterful set pieces, and a stunning soundtrack that’s borderline ethereal. </p>



<p>It’s 100% off on the Epic Games Store – that’s a <strong>sweet </strong>deal.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-even-breathe">Don’t Even Breathe</h2>



<p>Maid of Sker was released in 2020 by Wales Interactive, the talented team that also recently released Sker Ritual, a Call of Duty Zombies-like wave survival game that features some of the grotesque enemies from Maid of Sker. Today, it’s available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>In this puzzling horror game, you’re challenged with surviving the many threats lurking in the darkness in a remote hotel, with the game taking on inspiration from the likes of Outlast and Resident Evil. It’s one of those games that restricts you by making you unable to fight back, so your survival is dependent on running and hiding, or using a gadget to stun enemies. </p>



<p>One of the most innovative elements in Maid of Sker is the way enemies interact with the environment, relying on <strong>listening </strong>to catch the player out. When trying to navigate past enemies, players need to watch their every step, even going so far as to hold their breath to avoid alerting terrifying creatures and faceless hunters. </p>



<p>It might have some questionable design elements here and there, but that’s just me being honest. As a horror game, it’s fantastic, and as it’s <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/maid-of-sker-2ae24e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">free now on the Epic Games Store</a>, it’s the perfect time to try it out.</p>

<p>It’s official – Bethesda Game Studios is the first Microsoft studio to unionise, having joined force under the CWA banner fully. In recent news, it was confirmed that workers at Bethesda Game Studios’ Dallas, Rockville, and Austin studios had formed a ‘wall-to-wall’ union. Microsoft has formally recognised this union and presently, there’s no conflict.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stronger-together">Stronger Together</h2>



<p>In a press release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-microsoft-game-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked up by IGN</a>, the move was celebrated by Mandi Parker, senior system designer at Bethesda Game Studios:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are so excited to announce our union at Bethesda Game Studio and join the movement sweeping across the video game industry. It is clear that every worker can benefit from bringing democracy into the workplace and securing a protected voice on the job. We’re thrilled to get down to brass tacks and win a fair contract, proving that our unity is a source of real power to positively shape our working conditions, our lives, and the company as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>More than two years ago, when Microsoft started to lock down the Activision acquisition, the tech titan stressed it wouldn’t stop AB from unionising post-purchase. It has made good on those promises by not standing in the way of Bethesda Game Studios’ unionisation efforts. BSG isn’t alone in this, though. Over time, team unionising in the games industry has become a trend, and it has been gathering pace since drama unfolded over the last year-and-a-half with layoffs and shutdowns occurring almost daily.</p>



<p>Johnny Brown, the president of CWA Local 2108, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In a groundbreaking achievement, the dedicated professionals at Bethesda Game Studios have demonstrated that, no matter your job title, you too can benefit from having a union. Through securing a protected voice on the job, workers are taking a step forward to negotiating better working conditions, helping to raise standards across the industry. We are incredibly proud to welcome these workers into our union and are confident that together, we will secure a brighter future for all workers in the video game industry. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>As this trend gathers stream, we’re openly expecting to see more developers, publishers, and other industry workers get on board.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>When <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23758032/capcom-showcase-2023-news-trailers">debuted during Capcom’s digital summer showcase last year</a>, I didn’t pay much attention. It looked like a high-concept action RPG based in Japanese mythology that took some of its artistic cues from another one of Capcom’s highly stylized games, <em>Okami</em>. And while I have nothing but love for action RPGs and Japanese folklore, nothing in that initial trailer, nor the ones that followed, showed me enough of what the game was about to be interesting.</p><p>It was only after trying the game’s demo at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">this year’s Summer Game Fest</a>, and later getting my hands on a copy, that I finally <em>got it. </em>And damn is this game worth getting into.</p><p>In <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, you play as Soh, the guardian of the priestess Yoshiro who you must protect and guide through the land helping her purge it of evil demons. In an email to <em>The Verge,</em> art and game director Shuichi Kawata wrote that it wasn’t intentional that the marketing surrounding <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> made it unclear what kind of game it was. </p><p>“This title is a mix of several genres,” Kawata wrote. “And we imagined the possibility that there would be a range of impressions people would have.”</p><p><small>I defy you to guess what kind of game this is based on this launch trailer.</small></p><p>Kawata described <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> as a “maiden” defense game. Gameplay is divided into three parts: day, night, and a base-building cycle. During the day, Soh goes about mountain villages blighted by demonic corruption. He cleanses the corruption and rescues villagers who will help him in the night cycle to come. At night, demons attack, hoping to make their way to Yoshiro to kill her. To stop them, Soh assigns villagers different jobs, each with their own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, and positions them throughout the village to prevent the demons from reaching Yoshiro. Once Yoshiro gets to the end of a village, it is permanently cleansed, making it a new base Soh and the villagers must repair before moving on to the next location.</p><p>I love how <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> cleverly iterates on tower defense games. You assign roles to villagers with crystals, a resource gained through defeating demons at night and cleansing a village in the day. Not every villager can perform every role, and some roles aren’t combat viable, though they have other benefits. During a day cycle, I might assign a couple of my people to the thief role, sending them out to dig up more crystals or rations that act as health potions for Soh and the villagers. But thieves are useless at night, requiring me to burn up precious time and crystals to reassign and redeploy them. Sometimes, I might not have enough crystals, having used them all to buy the expensive sumo wrestler role — who draws demons’ attention to themselves and away from Yoshiro — or the acetic who uses their power to freeze demons in their place, making them easy pickings for the archer’s bow or the woodcutter’s axe.</p><div><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> offered the kind of challenge that makes my puzzle and strategy-obsessed brain sizzle with excitement</p></div><p>In addition to simply completing a stage, each village battle also comes with a set of special parameters that, if met, will get you extra goodies. One parameter required that I use no more than 1,900 crystals. While that initially seemed trivial, that goal got a lot harder to meet because that stage <em>also</em> required that I give 1,500 crystals to Yoshiro to complete it. I was then left with only 400 crystals for my villagers — an extremely tight budget when the basic roles like the archer and the woodcutter are 50 crystals a pop, while the more powerful roles cost between 150 to 300. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</p><div><figcaption>The woodcutter is one of your basic villager roles, specializing in melee attacks.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Capcom</cite></p></div></div><p>I really enjoyed that tension between strategic assignment and deployment. Do I spend the crystals to get the powerful roles, leaving me with fewer defenders? Or do I risk my larger but weaker army getting overrun? <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> is also special in that it never fell into the trap of being too trivial. In other tower defense games, it’s possible to set your defenses so well that you can sit back and watch the game play itself. That never happened for me. No matter if I had a glut of resources and well-placed villagers, I always had to stay on high alert, often coming to Yoshiro’s rescue with one of Soh’s ultimate attacks. At every level, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> offered the kind of challenge that makes my puzzle and strategy-obsessed brain sizzle with excitement.</p><p>While it’s not a prominent feature, there’s also an interesting bit of narrative to the game. Each villager you rescue has a name and a bio, and I enjoyed reading their stories and how they all intertwined. These people became more than nameless units to throw at a demonic horde, but members of a living, breathing community made up of married couples, family, and friends. It made for a beautiful message that reminded me of the aphorism “we all we got.”</p><p>In <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>, Soh is the only one with martial training while everyone else is farmers, fishermen, and housewives. Instead of waiting for outside help or succumbing to the relentless demons, those ordinary people took up what little arms they had to defend their homes and families. In a political climate that seems determined to roll back protections for women, queer people, and people of color, it’s nice to see that message. Help isn’t coming — we are the help. It’s a sentiment supported by what Kawata shared as <em>Kunitsu-Gami’s</em> main theme. </p><p>“Challenge is the driving ethos for this game,” he wrote. “We face various conditions seriously and push forward without fear.”</p><p><small><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is out now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>House of Golf 2 has been delayed to August 16th, Starlight Games has announced. The reason given for the short delay from the original release date of July 25th is that the team are working on a few more improvements and tweaks. House of Golf 2 features collaboration with Razer too, incorporating things like Razer inspired golf balls. The game features over 100 hundred courses, four player local multiplayer, and online leaderboards.</p>
<p><iframe title="House of Golf 2 Coming 16th August 2024!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDRcECcicjU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Razer collaboration also includes Chroma, Axon, and Cortex. The Razer Chroma feature in House of Golf 2 creates a visualisation effect that introduces a spectrum of colors from the game’s environments into players’ homes and device setups, when synchronised with lighting ecosystems. Razer Axon brings together various dynamic wallpapers to gamers, which can be<br>
synced to Razer Chroma enabled devices. Razer Cortex is a game performance booster.</p>
<p><em>“House of Golf 2 is a labour of love and we’ve chosen to push back the release of the game across all platforms to ensure that the game is available for all to enjoy and have an entertaining experience,”</em> said Gary Nichols, Founder of Starlight Games. <em>“The slight delay of release allows us to implement a final few tweaks and additions to the development of House of Golf 2, and players be able to put their putting skills to the test across many challenging yet wild courses.”</em></p>
<p>House of Golf 2 is available to wishlist on all available platforms.</p>

<p>In our preview, Stefan said, <em>“The fundamentals of House of Golf 2 are pretty similar to the menagerie of other minigolf games that have teed off in recent years – your Golf With Friends, and your Golf Gang, and all the rest – as you are represented purely by a ball in the game world, pick a direction and strength, then tap to send the ball flying in that direction. It’s far less technical than a PGA Tour game with multi-tap shot power, spin and all the rest – that said, a pull back to power option is there in the options for those that want it.”</em></p>
<p>House of Golf 2 will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/necromunda-hive-secundus-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hive Secundus was once the jewel of Necromunda, bursting with knowledge and creativity. But a Genestealer infestation changed all that. After the engineering feat of building the Dust Wall to surround Hive Secundus to keep the infestation in, it was levelled with orbital weapons and left to rot.&nbsp; Although still sealed off from the rest of <em>Necromunda </em>through the Dust Wall, there are still ways in, and treasure hunters and adventuring nobles brave the ruined depths in the hope of finding wonders. This brand new <em>Neromunda</em> box set opens up Hive Secundus for you and your gangs to explore, and we check out what's in the box, and how to use it in our&nbsp;<em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus</em> review.</p>
<p><em>Necromunda</em> is a skirmish wargame from Games Workshop, and rather than featuring clashes from mighty warriors like Space Marines, it features gang battles with the detritus of humanity battling among the lower levels of a gigantic hive city on the planet <em>Necromunda</em>.</p>

<h2>What's Included In Necromunda: Hive Secundus?</h2>
<p><em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus</em>&nbsp;is a new box set for the gang warfare skirmish game, and it includes everything you need to jump into a game. Included in the box is:</p>
<ul><li>Secundan Incursion Gang (8x&nbsp;Van Saar Tek-hunters, 2x Orrrus Spyre Hunters, 1x Caryatid Prime)</li>
<li>Forces of the Malstrain (6x&nbsp;Malstrain Genstealers, 4x&nbsp;Malstrain Tyramites, 8x&nbsp;Brood Scum)</li>
<li>A rulebook containing a full copy of the rules for Necromunda,&nbsp;a self-contained Underhells Campaign, and the rules for the 2 included gangs</li>
<li>Necromunda Bulkhead Terrain set (containing 5x&nbsp;barricades, 2x&nbsp;doors and 2x gaming mats)</li>
<li>A deck of Hive Secundus cards featuring Archeo-loot cards, Underhells Territory cards, Malstrain Forces fighter cards, and blank fighter cards</li>
<li>Tokens, a ruler, 2x&nbsp;blast markers and a flamer template, 2x&nbsp;rules reference sheets, and 16x Necromunda dice</li>

<p><em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus </em>is technically a starter set for <em>Necromunda</em>. It includes everything that 2 players need to play, including 2 gangs, all the components, and a full set of rules. But Hive Secundus isn't <em>Necromunda</em> in the traditional sense and features a gang battling against the Malstrain forces in an attempt to find loot. It acts as an expansion for <em>Necromunda</em> for existing players, but can be used as a jumping-in point for new players, and we'll tell you how to take Hive Secundus forward as a new player below.</p>

<p><em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus </em>includes a brand new setting for your games of <em>Necromunda&nbsp;</em>and 2 new gangs to use as part of the campaign.</p>
<p>The first gang, the Forces of The Malstrain don't act like a standard gang and each scenario gives a number of Malstrain points with which to build their force. Malstrain points are simplified from gang credits, and a scenario might give the Malstrain player 10 points, with Brood Scrum and Tyramites costing 1 Malstrain point, and Malstrain Genestealers costing 3. The Malstrain Genestealers aren't as powerful as those that stalk the rest of the universe, but they're still extremely deadly for the gangers of Necromunda.</p>

They build their gang as normal, but scenarios have a mix of random and custom fighter selections (but always include the Spyre Hunter) for deploying into the scenario. In the Hive Secundus box, you get a group of Van Saar Tek-Hunters to use. These are specialist gangers with access to specialist equipment and weaponry and a unique post-battle action across the 4 specialist types.</p>

<h2>As A New Player, How Do I Take Necromunda: Hive Secundus Forward?</h2>
<p>If you're coming into <em>Necromunda</em> as a new player with Hive Secundus, then you'll have everything you need to play standard games of <em>Necromunda</em>, except one of the standard gangs to use. The 2 gangs in Hive Secundus can't be used as they come in normal <em>Necromunda</em> games, so you'll need to pick up the 'House of' book for the gang you want, along with the miniatures for the gang you wish to play. For example, if you want to play Escher, you will need the House of Blades and the Escher Gang box.</p>
<p>If you wish to keep playing the gangs in Hive Secundus, the next book, <em>Necromunda</em> Book of Desolation might have more options to continue with the Malstrain and the&nbsp;Secundan Incursion Gang.</p>

<p>The <em>Necromunda Hive Secundus</em> box is a fantastic experience. The 2 included gangs and the campaign work very well together, and while it's not a regular <em>Necromunda</em> experience, it's still very enjoyable. The boxed set comes with a 2d map and the rules for that are great for beginners, who can upgrade to the full gang and 3d scenery experience after. Existing players will be able to test their gangs against the forces of the Malstrain and play through the campaign and earn some new loot in the process.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Necromunda: Hive Secundus?</h2>
<p>If you're a veteran <em>Necromunda</em> player, this offers a new opportunity to test your gang through a campaign against the Malstrain. If you're a new player, this box gives you everything you need to play Necromunda, but you will have to pick up a gang, their rulebook, and some more scenery to get the full <em>Necromunda</em> experience.</p>

			<p>Except for the UK, Xbox isn't doing well in Europe. This isn't exactly news, but lately, sales of Microsoft's consoles have really <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-flatlining-europe-publishers-questioning-support-ps5-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flatlined</a> in the continent, reportedly leading some publishers to question whether supporting the platform makes sense for them.</p>
<p>Last week, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-ceasing-marketing-of-xbox-consoles-in-emea-shifting-focus-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a rumor that Microsoft was seriously considering winding down marketing efforts for Xbox consoles in certain EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) markets to focus solely on Game Pass, its subscription service.</p>
<p>Now, Xbox EMEA Marketing Director Michael Flatt has openly spoken about getting much fewer funds than Sony's PlayStation division. In an interview <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/xboxs-marketing-boss-fight-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Marketing Week</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>From a funding point of view, we need to work really hard against our competition. Regrettably, they (PlayStation) outspend us. They’re blessed with marketing funds that we’re just not able to enjoy. But that’s totally fine. We adopt what I would call a more fiscally responsible approach to media investments. We’re not blessed with huge media budgets, so we have to be quite scrappy really, and quite tenacious to fight for funds that would probably go somewhere else.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, hearing a marketing lead of a Microsoft division talking about having to be scrappy will raise a few eyebrows. After all, Microsoft is a $3.25 trillion market cap company, currently the second in the world after Apple, although the two have traded spots a lot recently.</p>
<p>Moreover, Microsoft has spent a lot of money in the past few years to acquire publishers like Bethesda for $8.1 billion and Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. Why wouldn't they market Xbox appropriately?</p>
<p>Well, it is a bit of a chicken and egg problem. Microsoft probably has evaluated that there isn't enough interest in the consoles, so spending more money on marketing would be futile. Then again, if the Xbox EMEA team had a bigger marketing budget to begin with at the start of the generation, perhaps things could be different now. Either way, it's certainly a bit odd to see an executive speaking plainly about being underfunded.</p>
<p>Xbox is certainly in a tough spot in Europe right now. Will they try to stage a comeback or throw in the proverbial towel, at least when it comes to marketing? Let us know your opinion in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-hotfix-1-0-3-addresses-frame-generation-issues-fixes-memory-leak-addresses-abort-mission-exploit-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nexon has deployed The First Descendant hotfix 1.0.3 across all platforms, addressing frame generation issues as well as an 'abort mission' exploit, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch for the shooter is labeled as a hotfix but contains quite a few fixes and changes. Those playing the game on PC will be happy to learn that the 1.0.3 hotfix fixes a memory leak when using frame generation. In addition, it fixes a memory leak while playing in windowed mode. Also, the patch aims to resolve an issue of temporary frame drops when opening inventory with DLSS Frame Generation as well as an issue where the frame limit was not restored when using frame generation.</p>
<p>Another interesting change is that this new patch adds a new 'Away from keyboard (AFK)' option to the player report menu. "We have been keeping a close eye on recent trends regarding AFK, and we agree that AFK hinders the game play for other players". the developers <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2604920?headlineId=1015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explain</a>. "However, we believe that a cautious approach is required in this matter. This is because AFK judgment mechanisms can sometimes be bypassed with simple shooting or moving actions, and the AFK kick system can be exploited for other purposes."</p>
<p>The First Descendant hotfix 1.0.3 also comes with a fix for an exploit with the party member’s ‘Abort Mission’ system. Following this patch, the Void Shard attribute will now be displayed on the map directly. "<span lang="EN">We discovered and fixed an issue where a party member’s ‘Abort Mission’ system was being exploited to repeatedly play the Void Fusion Reactor without consuming any Shards", Nexon writes. "While addressing this glitch, we also considered why players might resort to using it. We realized that the transition from Shard farming to actual Void Fusion Reactor missions was quite inconvenient and tedious. Therefore, we not only fixed the bug but also increased the amount of Void Shards obtained and improved the farming process to make it more convenient."</span></p>
<p>The full release notes for this hotfix <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2604920?headlineId=1015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The First Descendant is available worldwide now for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-model-kits-for-adults<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Model making is a great hobby, but knowing how and where to start is another story. It can be overwhelming for novices: Injection-molded plastic models have been on the market for close to a century, and there are kits of everything from military vehicles to sports cars and anime robots to household objects. Looking at some of the incredible creations of seasoned model builders, it might seem like you need an entire workshop of tools and equipment, the steady hands of a brain surgeon, and years of practice to make something cool-looking, but that’s not the case.</p><p>To make getting into this delightful pastime a whole lot less daunting, I’ve put together a list of kits that are worth checking out. Quite a few of these recommendations are based on my own firsthand experience. Up top are kits that don’t require glue, paint, or much else in the way of supplies, but keep scrolling for some recommendations if you’re ready to get your hands dirty and possibly stuck together. Head all the way to the bottom for essential tools and supplies you’ll need for model kits and where to buy these excellent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-lego-alternatives">LEGO alternatives</a>.</p><h2>No Paint? No Glue? No Problem!</h2><p>For a very long time, model kits needed to be glued together and painted. Nowadays that’s not always the case. Most model companies offer entry-level kits that come pre-colored and can be easily snapped together. Keep in mind that some kits that advertise themselves as “for beginners” or “entry level” are <em>so</em> simplified it's hard to count them as traditional model kits. However, plenty still offer a satisfying challenge without requiring any messy stuff like paint and glue. Case in point: Gundam! If you’re looking for a beginner route to model kits, and you think giant robots are cool, then either of the following two kits is a good start.</p><div><div id="202708" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai Hobby HGUC RX-78-2 Gundam Revive Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>1:144 Scale. Recommended age: 15 years and up.</p></div></div><div id="202709" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai Hobby MG Gundam RX-78-2 Version 3.0 Action Figure Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>1:100 Scale. Recommended age: 15 years and up.</p></div></div></div><p>Gundam kits are classified by grade, the two most common being High Grade (HG), which are usually $15-30 and about 6 inches tall when complete, and Master Grade (MG), which’ll run you around $30-50 and are a couple of inches taller, but usually a lot more detailed and complex. There’s also Real Grade, which is somewhere between HG and MG; Entry Grade, which is for absolute beginners; and Perfect Grade, which is for advanced builders.</p><div><div id="202710" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby 174 Wing Gundam Zero</h3></p><div><p>The Wing Zero HG kit comes with a twin buster rifle, beam sabers, pile driver shield, and machine cannons.</p></div></div><div id="202711" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Gundam IBO Gundam Barbatos, Bandai Spirits MG 1:100</h3></p><div><p>The Gundam Barbatos 4th form has appeared as an MG, with a reproduced Gundam frame of internal mechanics as well as a recreation of the Suit's Ahab Reactor!</p></div></div></div><p>Gundam modeling (or Gunpla, short for “Gundam plastic models”) has become so massively popular, it warrants its own list of recommended kits. But for anyone who doesn’t care for big anime robots (Why not? Who hurt you?) I've rounded up a bunch of kits that take the same no-fuss appeal of Gundam kits applied to other properties and subject matter.</p><h2>Star Wars Model Kits</h2><div><div id="202715" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai AT-ST 1:48 Scale Star Wars All Terrain Scout Transport Walker</h3></p><div><p>Y-Wing Starfighter kit has an inner cockpit</p></div></div><div id="202716" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai Hobby Star Wars 1:72 Y-Wing Starfighter Building Kit</h3></p><div><p>AT-ST from Star Wars was recreated as a detailed model kit with articulated legs, rotating head and weapon systems.</p></div></div></div><p>Bandai has given the Gundam treatment to a number of other beloved pop-culture properties, most notably Star Wars. A good number of characters and vehicles have been turned into pre-colored snap-together kits. Some lend themselves to this treatment better than others; some of the less colorful subjects may look a little bland without a bit of paint or finishing touches. A <a href="https://youtu.be/1i61SlfOD34?si=e9PDSG4ArZ1XNa9R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>basic wash</u></a> or some <a href="https://youtu.be/raCbD4nkFIc?si=f7ywCKx4JKydISNl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>dry-brushing</u></a> will really make the details pop on the more monochromatic Original Trilogy machines.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><div id="202720" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Boba Fett, Bandai Spirits Hobby 1/12 Plastic Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Your favorite Star Wars bounty hunter is now a 1/12 scale model kit with a full array of accessories including interchangeable hand parts.</p></div></div><p>Boba Fett is nice and colorful and looks great without a drop of paint, which speaks to the character’s inherently kitbashed aesthetic. The Stormtroopers looked a little too plain out of the box, so my esteemed colleague <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/b-altano-ign"><u>Brian Altano</u></a> and I personalized them a bit:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Bandai Stormtrooper Model Kits</h3></div></output><h2>Anime Model Kits</h2><div><div id="202722" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Son Goku Figure-Rise Standard Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Recreate iconic scenes from Dragon Ball Z with this standard model kit of Son Goku featuring an upgraded Muscle Build-Up System.</p></div></div><div id="202723" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Uzumaki Naruto Figure-Rise Standard Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Enjoy another fan-favorite anime build for Uzumaki Naruto, with superior tooling in the joints. Achieve action poses and signature attacks such as “rasen GAN”, “rasen shuriken”, and “shadow Clone jutsu”!</p></div></div></div><p>If full-color injection-molded action figure model kits work for giant anime robots, why not anime people as well? Bandai’s Figure-Rise line has tackled <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/dragon-ball-z">Dragon Ball Z</a>, Naruto, Digimon, and even some of the human characters from Gundam.</p><h2>Giant Robot Model Kits (That Aren’t Gundam)</h2><div id="202725" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Kotobukiya Kotobukiya Metal Gear Solid: Metal Gear Rex (Black Ver.) Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>From Konami's series Metal Gear comes an epic model kit of the nuclear-armed bipedal tank Metal Gear Rex. Buying options vary and range from $154 and up.</p></div></div><p>Currently sitting at the top of my pile of shame is Kotobukiya’s 1:100 scale Metal Gear Rex. Part of my procrastination is because it’s a big beautiful model kit and I don’t want to mess it up, but also because I built the Metal Gear Sahelanthropus, which was an extremely frustrating build. This may have been because I got it partially assembled from a friend and picked up where he left off, but the more intricate and top-heavy design of the Sahelanthropus also doesn’t lend itself as well to a physical kit. From what I’ve read, Rex’s more squat form makes for a more straightforward build. Unsurprisingly, a mech designed for a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps1-games-playstation">PlayStation 1 game</a> literally has less moving parts than one designed for the PS4.</p><div><div id="202874" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Good Smile Company  Horizon Forbidden West: Thunderjaw Moderoid Plastic Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>This giant model kit comes in at 15" in length and will help you get into (mechanical) beast mode. It's an amazing build for Horizon Forbidden West fans and robot fans alike. Prices vary but start at $107.</p></div></div><div id="202875" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Good Smile Company  Aliens: Power Loader Moderoid Plastic Model Kit</h3></p></div></div><p>Good Smile Company’s Moderoid line of kits come pre-painted, which is great if you just want to put something together and display it, but they’re also on the pricier side.</p><div><div id="202971" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Store Bandai Hobby - Imaginary Skeleton – 1:32 Imaginary Skeleton Tyrannosaurus</h3></p><div><p>Who doesn't want to own a cool miniature dino? This 1/32 T-Rex model kit is highly rated for its attention to detail, including impressive skull and two rows of special teeth on the upper jaw. It's posed in a crouching position so it's ready to jump!</p></div></div><div id="202974" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Store Triceratops</h3></p><div><p>If T-Rex isn't your thing, you can build the 1/32 Triceratops version of this Bandai model kit at a similar price point!
</p></div></div></div><p>Like a lot of Bandai kits, these dinosaur skeletons snap together and are molded in all the right colors. However, since they’re a bunch of bones, that's actually only one color. That said, for anyone who doesn’t have much confidence in their painting abilities, but still wants to paint <em>something</em>, this might be for you. I tried out a bunch of weathering techniques on mine to make it look appropriately prehistoric, and then made a custom base.</p><div id="202972" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Store 1:1 Cup Noodle</h3></p><div><p>This is a unique and fun model kit for beginners. The inside is filled with 3D scanned noodles, egg, shrimp, and "mystery meat" to bring the food staple to life.
</p></div></div><p>Not quite the weirdest model kit I’ve built (that honor goes to a 1:24 scale urinating dog), but it’s definitely up there. This is basically a Gundam, but it’s soup. It’s completely snap together, though surprisingly, deceptively complex in how it’s assembled. The finished product, without a drop of paint, is impressively hard to differentiate from the real thing, which is funny but also raises some concerns about how closely instant ramen noodles resemble polystyrene.</p><div id="202976" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Nissan C110 Skyline GT-R Custom White 1:32 Scale Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>This white 1:32 scale Nissan car model kit is affordable, easy to build (with only 30 parts), and fun to display on any collector's shelf.</p></div></div><p>As the name suggests, Aoshima’s The Snap Kit series of model cars are a *snap* to put together, literally and figuratively. Much like Gundam kits, no glue is required and the majority of the pieces come molded in the correct colors. (Stickers are included for the ones that aren’t.) They’re a great option for anyone who’s looking for a quick project that doesn’t require a lot of tools or materials. Without paint, the end result might look a bit more like a toy than a proper replica, but painting is still an option. If that’s the part of the hobby that appeals to you, these’ll get you off to the proverbial races faster.</p><p>I turned The Snapkit’s 2000GT-R Skyline into a beat-up junker, and kitbashed the Prius into a heavy metal post-apocalyptic monster truck. A “Judas Prius,” if you will. That one’s a work in progress; it looks too Halo, not Mad Max enough.</p><h2>Military Model Kits</h2><div><div id="203002" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya Tamiya 35346 1/35 US Medium Tank M4A3E8 Sherman Plastic Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Meet the M4A3E8, AKA "Easy Eight" model kit, a perfect build and paint project for history buffs and Fury movie fans alike.</p></div></div><div id="203003" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya Tamiya Models M1A2 Abrams Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>The "worlds' strongest tank" but smaller! This 1/35 Abrams tank model kit even comes with body figures as an extra touch.</p></div></div></div><p>The beauty of tanks, aside from being a cross between a cannon and a bulldozer, is how forgiving they are of a messy paint job. The real, full-size ones are frequently painted just one color, but get caked with dirt, mud, grease and grime, which is immensely gratifying to recreate in miniature with dry brushing, washes, and pigments. If you screw up during constructing, just call it battle damage! Tamiya makes some excellent armor kits, along with just about any other type of military hardware and/or accoutrement you could ask for, including but not limited to <a href="https://zdcs.link/oeYDg?object_uuid=cfd6c3fb-50a7-497a-ae84-c528d48b421d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>1:35 scale farm animals.</u></a></p><div><div id="203007" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hasegawa 1:72 AV-8B Harrier II Plus</h3></p><div><p>This 87-piece build is great for intermediate builders. The AV-8B Harrier II is  redesigned from the previous generation.</p></div></div><div id="203008" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hasegawa 1:48 AV-8B Harrier II</h3></p><div><p>This 166-piece build has an impressive scale down from the complex form of the Harrier II.</p></div></div></div><p>The scale of models can be a little confusing, but it’s just fractions. A 1:1 scale model is life size, 1:2 scale is 50% the size of the real thing, and so on. However, different subject matter is suited best to certain scales. Cars are usually 1:/24 or 1:32, and the standard for military ground vehicles, like tanks and trucks and infantry, is generally 1:35. Larger aircraft models are 1:48, but 1:72 isn’t uncommon, and when you get into larger naval vehicles it gets even more fractional. There’s plenty of overlap, so if you want a little truck to go next to your 1:48 helicopter, it probably exists somewhere out there. The scale of railroad models is the gauge of the miniature train tracks being used, which I’m not even going to go into here. The point is: You can get a big Harrier jet or little Harrier Jet, or you can buy two big ones and pretend it’s a mommy and a daddy and a baby jet.</p><h2>Car Model Kits</h2><div id="203011" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hasegawa 621123 Model Car BMW 2002 Tii 1:24 Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>A classic BMW car model kit that brings a little bit of a challenge.</p></div></div><p>I am admittedly not much of a car guy. My dad, on the other hand, is very much the opposite. As a Father’s Day gift one year, I tracked down Hasegawa’s 1:24 BMW 2002 Tii kit, and painted it to look like a real car he’s been tinkering with and repeatedly repairing for the last few decades. He loved the gift and I had a great time putting it together. The amount of detail and tiny parts in a kit like this might be overwhelming for a novice modeler, but it’ll certainly keep you busy.</p><div id="202999" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Revell Revell of Germany 07051 McLaren 570S</h3></p><div><p>Tip: Get yourself the Revell of Germany kits and not the American ones. Only 8 left in stock of this one!</p></div></div><p>Two companies called Revell make model kits: Revell USA and Revell of Germany. The general consensus among the model building community is that the ones from Germany are excellent and the American Revell kits leave a lot to be desired. I’ve only built the American ones, and I wasn’t impressed.</p><div><div id="203014" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 11 1:24 Scale Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>This Lambo includes exclusive parts for the R-SV such as the body and engine, plus scissor doors you can open up.</p></div></div><div id="203015" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Volkswagen 13AD Beetle 1303S ’73 1:24 Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>VW fans love this kit based on the classic 1973 Beetle.</p></div></div><div id="203016" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Bunka Kyozai 1:24 Mobile Sales Series No. 8 Yakitori Ryuho Plastic Model</h3></p><div><p>This realistic reproduction of a food truck is adorable!</p></div></div></div><p>What’s your dream car? A Lamborghini? What about a kebab truck? Aoshima makes a range of great vehicles, from luxury supercars to civilian automobiles to a surprisingly broad selection of funny little food trucks. </p><h2>How to Get Started with Model Kits</h2><h3>Tools:</h3><div id="202992" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>BXQINLENX  8-Piece Model Tools Set</h3></p><div><p>This basic tool set is ideal for beginners. Tools include pliers, a carving knife, blades, sanding tools, and tweezers. Plus, it comes in a plastic case to take on the go and store the tools in.</p></div></div><p>This is a great little set of tools to get started. If you get serious, it’s worth investing in a nice pair of hobby shears, side-cutters or “nippers” for cutting the individual parts off the runners. The cleaner the cut, the less trimming, filing and sanding needed during assembly. I have a pair of Tamiya side-cutters that I swear by, but the God-tier option in this department is the “God Hand” line (not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/10/god-hand-review"><u>PlayStation 2 game IGN gave a controversially bad score</u></a> to a million years ago).</p><div id="202991" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>anezus 12inch x 18inch Rotary Cutting Mat Double Sided 5-Ply Craft Cutting Board</h3></p><div><p>Multipurpose craft mat and cutting board for model builds, cutting, engraving and beyond.</p></div></div><p>A sturdy cutting mat is helpful for not ruining your dining room table and getting yelled at, and also for easily moving your entire project away from the dining room table because you have company coming over and you don’t want people to see the funny little things you make in your spare time. </p><div id="202988" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya 87038 Extra Thin Cement Glue Fine Tip 40ml</h3></p><div><p>Ditch the glue! Grab some model cement to fill in tiny gaps in your plastic kits or to fuse two pieces together.</p></div></div><p>Model cement is different from regular glue in that it’s actually a solvent that slightly melts the plastic where applied, letting you fuse parts together. This makes it effectively useless on other materials, but for plastic kits, it’s my favorite. A tiny brush is built into the lid, so you just hold two pieces of your model together and apply a drop where they touch. The cement is so thin it’ll usually flow into the crack on its own. </p><h3>Paint:</h3><p>Without venturing into the messy, expensive, and frequently frustrating world of airbrush operation and maintenance, my preferred method of painting models is with a combination of “rattle cans” and water-based acrylics. Primer is key because it gives the surface a finish that paint will adhere to more easily than bare plastic. It’s possible to use regular spray paint from a hardware store, but it comes out thicker and can very easily ruin any fine details. Cans of hobby spray paint produce a fine mist, which is much easier to apply carefully. </p><div id="202982" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>GSI Creos Mr. Hobby B519 Mr. Surfacer 1000 Large Spray</h3></p><div><p>A go-to primer for model kits, Mr. Hobby is a trusted brand for plastic builds.</p></div></div><p>Mr. Hobby’s Mr. Surfacer is an excellent primer that will even out the appearance of a kit prior to painting, covering up imperfections in the plastic while also providing a nice matte finish that paint will stick to really well.</p><div id="202979" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Vallejo Vallejo Basic USA Acrylic Colors Paint Set</h3></p><div><p>The Vallejo brand brings model builders a non-toxic paint set option for model kits and miniatures. Coming in a pack of 16 assorted colors, this set was made for use on both metal and plastic, leaving no brushstrokes behind.</p></div></div><p>Unlike lacquers or enamels, water-based acrylic paint doesn’t need any special thinners or solvents when it comes to mixing or cleanup. Vallejo’s Model Color line comes in every shade imaginable, and the dropper bottles make it easier to avoid spills. </p><div id="202977" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya Tamiya 86034 PS-34 Bright Red Spray Paint, 100ml Spray Can</h3></p><div><p>This classic red paint comes in a 100ml spray can and brings your model kits a nice, matte finish. It's high quality for its price.
</p></div></div><p>Tamiya has a whole rainbow of hobby-grade spray lacquer, which is a great alternative to hand-painting large areas and worrying about brushstrokes. If the model is mostly one color, laying down a base coat and then doing the details by hand is a good system. It’s unlikely you’ll use an entire can of paint on one kit, so if you grab a color or two per kit, over time you’ll likely collect a nice variety.</p><p>Like any good hobby, model making is basically a bottomless pit of enjoyably wasted time (that’s not actually wasted if you enjoyed yourself). No matter how good you are at it, you’ll inevitably come across someone who’s so much better than you it makes you want to give up entirely. On the bright side, a lot of experts share their work online along with handy tips and tutorials for any skill level. On YouTube, a few accounts you may want to check out are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SpruesNBrews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SpruesNBrews</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NightShiftScaleModels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>NightShift</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JunsMiniGarage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jun’s Mini Garage</u></a>. If you are looking for some inspiration for dioramas, or just to see some ridiculously cool stuff getting made, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8PPpb-2kFmb5zgqL7EmAmw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Laser Creation-World</u></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@minibrickscraft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Minibricks</u></a> both put up some great work. Happy modeling! </p><h2>Model Kit FAQs</h2><h3>Where is the best place to buy model kits?</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Amazon</strong>: You can find some awesome deals throughout the year, but you’ll also want to be wary of resellers marking up prices. If you find something you like, it’s always worth googling it to see what the going rate is.</li><li><a href="https://www.hlj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HobbyLink Japan</strong></a>: Model making is a hobby that requires patience, and sometimes that starts before you even get the kit. HLJ is the biggest online Japanese hobby shop and has a flat-out overwhelming selection of model kits and supplies, plus toys, statues, gacha machine prices, apparel, books, and even adults-only stuff you probably won’t find many places outside of Japan. The catch? Shipping is usually expensive, slow, or both. The cheapest option can take four to seven months to arrive. Cost is generally calculated based on size rather than weight (model kits are big, but light) so it often makes sense to save up and order a bunch of stuff at once.</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.megahobby.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MegaHobby</strong></a><strong>:</strong> I haven’t used this one personally, but it’s also got a great selection and it seems like most stuff ships out in six months or sooner.</li><li><a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/model-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>IGN Store</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We've got a modest but solid selection of kits on there, generally of the anime/pop-culture variety. (The best-sellers from HLJ occasionally show up on the IGN Store.) New items are added regularly, and older stuff goes on sale, so it’s worth checking back regularly. </li><li><strong>Your local hobby shop:</strong> No, really! See if there’s a hobby shop near you, and go support it. Those are a dying breed and the people who work there will often actually know what they’re talking about, and it’s also a great place to meet fellow builders of small things. Bear in mind that model building is a broad hobby, and hobby shops usually cater to one particular corner of it. The 80-year-old WWII diorama builder might not know what a Perfect Grade Exia Gundam is, and the kid with a Char Aznable tattoo may not know what a Panzerkampfwagen is, but they both can most likely tell you about drybrushing, panel lines, and gunk wash.</li></ul><p><em>Max Scoville is a senior writer, host and producer for IGN covering video games, movies, toys and collectibles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-gets-its-first-ever-discount-after-prime-day<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Super Monkey Ball is one of those franchises that randomly has a huge fan base you rarely ever hear from. One such fan is my wife, who doesn't seem to like any video games at all but absolutely <em>loves </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/super-monkey-ball">Super Monkey Ball games</a>. She played the first Super Monkey Ball game on the Gamecube obsessively and talks about it every time we have any sort of discussion about gaming. So naturally, as soon as I found out Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble was on sale, I immediately picked it up.</p><p>Truthfully, I too am a fan of these games and am very much looking forward to playing it as well. While I coudn't get myself to pay full price for any Switch game, the price of $34.99 feels just right.</p><h2>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble Deal - 30% Off</h2><div catalogid="4e60cab1-e9be-44c0-8a59-b67cb3bd6459" id="205004"><div id="205004" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Super Monkeyball Banana Rumble</h3></p></div><p>While I haven't yet had the pleasure of playing Banana Rumble myself, I have read the IGN review of the game and it convinced me that it is absolutely worth playing. With an impressive set of 200 courses across 20 worlds, we've concluded that this is the best Monkey Ball has been since the GameCube era. Our own Nintendo expert <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/MrHurgy">Logan Plant</a> had the chance to go hands on with the game and here's a quick snippet of what he thought in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review">our review</a>:</p><p>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble was release just last month on June 25 and this is the first and biggest discount we've seen on this game. It's especially surprising after a rather lackluster showing of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-nintendo-switch-deals">Prime Day Switch deals</a> earlier this week. If you've been hoping to pick up this game at a discount, now is the time to do so.<br>
