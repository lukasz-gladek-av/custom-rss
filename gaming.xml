			<p>Achilles: Legends Untold, released in 2023, introduced us to a new developer with great potential. Sure, several aspects of the game were certainly rough around the edges, but there was enough quality gaming to be had in this action RPG to suggest Dark Point Game had what it took to release an absolute banger. Their follow-up game, Achilles Survivor, is the realisation of that potential, offering one of the most-compelling and thrilling experiences available in the embryotic bullet heaven genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Achilles: Survivor. Release date trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15ahxwZMgYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Smartly reusing many of their gorgeous visual assets from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/03/achilles-legends-untold-review/">Achilles: Legends Untold</a>, Achilles Survivor bears an uncanny resemblance to its forbear. Played from a top-down perspective, Achilles or one of many other unlockable mythological characters, must survive for either ten or twenty minutes against an unending horde of monsters. This being a twist on Vampire Survivors, you do that with only one controller input: movement. You steer your character around the small, enclosed environment, dodging hordes of enemies, or smashing headlong through the smallest pack of them to break free.</p>
<p>Combat is automated, with each of your attacks auto-targeting foes on a repeating cycle. As you kill monsters, ranging from Ray Harryhausen style skeletons, to Cyclopes, and unpleasantly animated giant spiders, you quickly level-up. Doing so is crucial, as each incremental level provides you with a selection of additional attack powers or heightened abilities to choose from. Soon, you become the bullet hell, spewing out a multitude of deadly blades, a plume of poisoned griffin talons, and a parade of marching giants. It’s up to you to position and move your character just right to ensure you hit as many of your enemies as possible, whilst still being able to nimbly dodge their attacks.</p>


<p>One aspect that sets Achilles Survivor apart from many of its bullet heaven brethren is the rather neat building mechanic, which adds a lashing of strategy and consideration to your actions. As your survivor explorers the environment they’ll fine stone mines. Hang out around the perimeter of the mine and you’ll gradually accrue stone – this in and of itself adds to the tension, as gathering resources whilst a horde of enemies lumber towards you is quite the thrill – this can then be used to build defences at specific locations marked by a flag. You’ll get a random selection of four structures to choose from, some with offensive properties and others defensive in nature.</p>
<p>Defence types are varied, from flame thrower turrets and healing stations to poison emitting fountains and friendly warrior spawning Trojan Horses. Some defences only activate whilst you remain beside them, forcing you to bravely lure the enemies towards you before frantically fleeing at the last moment, while others work better in combination, such as a device that blasts enemies away so that they land in the spikey embrace of a nearby spear turret. Experimenting with different combinations to best thin the numbers of the enemy is all part of Achilles Survivor’s appeal.</p>
<p>There are various challenges to take on in each level that helps keeps things fresh. You can open up portals to add to the enemy count and ultimately be rewarded with some powerful loot, or close enemy spawn points by seeing off a set number of extra-powerful beasties. There are zones that if you remain within whilst killing enough baddies you’ll get a tasty bonus ability and treasure chests that can be peeked inside if you can just get past the veritable army blocking your way.</p>

<p>It all adds up to a ridiculously fun gameplay loop, satisfying and accessible, and one in which anyone could pick up a controller and have a riotous blast. Pacing is perfect, the volume of enemies gradually increasing until there are hundreds of the blighters on screen, as you desperately attempt to flank them before they close off your escape route, whilst the final remaining seconds on the clock tick down.</p>
<p>After each run, your character gains permanent upgrades, and also class specific bonuses which impact any other character you choose too. There’s always something cool to unlock, fostering that ‘just one more go’ mentality, be it new abilities, spells, buildings, characters, or levels. It’s intoxicatingly addictive, and before you know it hours of your life have gone by, as you sat with a glazed expression, slightly drooling from the ridiculous grin plastered on your face as you finally make it through a particularly challenging level.</p>


<p>My only complaint? Well, the bosses are a drag. They pop up infrequently but when they do, they often overstay their welcome. It’s not like they are particularly challenging – their area attacks can be easily dodged – it’s just that they are ridiculous bullet sponges who absorb a stupendous amount of damage. As such, the precise pacing and rhythm of the game is lost when the bosses turn up, turning proceedings into a slog until you finally whittle down their expansive health bar. One ten-minute level was doubled in length after a particularly gruelling battle with Paris – not the city, but the irritating prat from Troy. With any luck, a patch or two will refine the boss experience. Either way, bosses or not, Achilles Survivor staunchly remains one of the best examples of its genre currently available.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft have released update 1.07 for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and it brings a popular feature, New Game+ mode. In short, if you have finished the main story you can restart the game but keep all the trinkets and gubbins you acquired during your first run, so you are super powerful to start with.</p>
<p>Here are the Assassin’s Creed Shadow Update 1.07 patch notes:</p>


<h3 id="TkVXIEdBTUUr">NEW GAME+</h3>
<p>Upon completing the main story on any difficulty, start a new game while keeping all collected skills, gear, Allies and hideout progression from your first playthrough. You can start a New Game+ playthrough from the Memory Menu in the Animus after finishing all journeys of Naoe, Yasuke and Junjiro.</p>
<p>Upon completing a New Game+ playthrough you’ll be awarded Whisper of Gold, and Dragon’s Gold! Brand new gold plated Legendary Long Katana and Legendary Katana with their own unique perk engravings.</p>
<p>Take your journey through Feudal Japan to the next level as many times as you want… or at least up to 8 times with New Game+! With each new venture into New Game+, face stronger foes, more demanding challenges, and tests of your Shinobi and Samurai skills.</p>

<h3 id="S05PV0xFREdFIFJBTksg">KNOWLEDGE RANK &amp; LEVEL CAP INCREASE</h3>
<p>Prepare to push beyond your limits! We’ve raised the level cap from 60 to 80, meaning tougher foes with enhanced tactics and awareness – demanding sharper reflexes and smarter strategies.</p>
<p>To meet this rising threat, we’ve also expanded the Knowledge Rank system to 9 &amp; 10 allowing players to unlock and develop a broader array of skills, passives, and combat techniques to become even more masterful.</p>
<p>New Game+ awaits! But before taking on the task of a new journey, you can upgrade the passives and skills of Naoe and Yasuke! Players will gain 1 new rank for multiple nodes in their Mastery Skills, and 10 new ranks for all existing Knowledge passives to become even more formidable.</p>
<p>A test of your skills is no match without the right gear! The Forge can now be upgraded to level 4, allowing players to upgrade all weapons and gear to level 80 to have the edge on the rising threats that await.</p>
<p>With new levels and ranks, come three new achievements and trophies waiting to be unlocked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enjoy the Ride</strong>: Reach Level 80</li>
<li><strong>Stars Unseen</strong>: Reach Knowledge Rank 10</li>
<li><strong>Worth its Wait</strong>: Obtain the Gold Katana and Gold Long Katana (by completing the story on New Game+).</li>

            <title><![CDATA[IGDA Calls for Greater Transparency Amid Adult Game Bans]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/igda-calls-for-greater-transparency-amid-adult-game-bans.1256097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has issued a statement regarding recent adult game bans on platforms like Steam and Itch.io, calling for "greater transparency and fairness" in the matter.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> on its website, the IGDA says it's "alarmed" by the way in which "legal, consensual, and ethically-developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators", have been delisted and deplatformed by storefronts like the aforementioned two in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The association says that while it does not wish to engage in "the defense of harmful material", it does want to advocate for "reform, developer voice, and platform accountability", calling for developers' works to be assessed "fairly, transparently, and contextually".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/igda-statement-adult-game-bans-steam.jpg?itok=4TKURuPY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/igda-statement-adult-game-bans-steam.jpg?itok=_5FVIrWG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The IGDA says platforms like Steam aren't assessing adult games fairly or contextually.</figcaption></figure><p>The IGDA laments the sudden ways in which platforms like Steam and Itch.io are delisting and banning adult-oriented content, bemoaning the "lack of transparency around enforcement criteria, sudden shifts in policy, and...absence of appeal pathways" open to developers.</p>

<p>As the IGDA points out, these issues can lead to developers losing income, not to mention damage to their reputation; after all, some might be less likely to buy a developer's next game if they learn the previous effort was banned due to content Steam or Itch.io deem objectionable.</p>

<p>Not only that, but these policies can have a "disproportionate impact on marginalized voices", as the IGDA says. Censorship the association describes as "overreaching" may have a greater impact on "queer, trans, femme-identifying, and POC developers".</p>

<p>So, what does the IGDA recommend? The association is calling for clearer guidelines on what content is prohibited, as well as "timely communication" if action is taken. That's in addition to greater appeal pathways for developers, "advisory panels", and regular transparency reports.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-adult-content-bans-igda.jpg?itok=3geS6vM7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-adult-content-bans-igda.jpg?itok=rYqnAEAx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io has also been enacting adult content delistings in recent days.</figcaption></figure><p>This all began a couple of weeks ago, when a report by the activist group <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Collective Shout</a> alleged that platforms like Steam and Itch.io were hosting content that glorified sexual abuse and contravened the guidelines of payment processors like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard.</p>

<p>Following that campaign's commencement, both Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">and Itch.io</a>&nbsp;began deindexing and delisting adult games from their platforms, the rationale being that if payment processors objected, then they may withdraw their services, leaving customers unable to pay for games.</p>

<p>However, this scorched-earth approach has already begun to affect creators it arguably shouldn't even go near.&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>creator Cara Cadaver, for instance, recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" rel="nofollow">reported that her game had been banned from Steam</a>, despite the fact it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer" rel="nofollow">about as far from a glorification of sexual abuse or violence</a> as it's possible to get.</p>

<p>Let's hope the IGDA's statement stops this issue from getting too out of hand. It's all too easy to imagine a world where developers don't feel confident creating games with any adult themes in them at all for fear of upsetting nebulous organizations that have very little to do with the games they're causing to get banned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Godbreakers</em> is a multiplayer roguelike with some interesting ideas but a lot to prove. It’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this year and hoping to reverse a recent trend of underwhelming games by parent publisher Thunderful, which was just purchased by Atari amid its latest round of layoffs. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196307" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="657" data-playlist="196307,196539,195891" data-current="196307"><div><p>10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21857.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Godbreakers</em> is a third-person action game in which you brawl your way through short levels to take on big arena boss fights. You can do it solo or in squads of up to four players, with loot and upgrades to collect along the way. One of the key things differentiating <em>Godbreakers</em> in a fun but overcrowded genre is a mechanic that allows players to explode low-health enemies and steal their powers. The one-shot abilities offer DPS, crowd control, and other benefits with the potential to augment the usual roguelike buildcrafting with an extra layer of strategy. </p><p>I played a recent demo that left me intrigued but somewhat unconvinced. The action is fairly tight, with cancelable animations, responsive dodge dashing, and some crisp combos, including a fun slide attack that feels surprisingly good for this type of game. But the demo didn’t leave me with a good sense of the overall flow of a playthrough, or whether levels will be less boring and more visually interesting in the finished game. A loadout menu back at the home base before launching missions also showed cosmetics for customizing character appearances, along with possible ambitions for the game that the demo that I played seemed nowhere close to supporting. </p><p>Ultimately, whether <em>Godbreakers</em> can turn a bullet point list of decent but familiar gameplay ideas into a fun co-op arcade roguelike experience will come down to how the loot, upgrades, and RNG-fueled progression of each run feels. That’s one of the more difficult things to get a sense of from a short demo, and it’s also the one quality that’s often make-or-break for roguelikes without a strong visual style or other distinctive qualities. In other words, my time with the demo gave me a sense of a version of <em>Godbreakers </em>that could be worth making time for, but I’m not sure that’s a version that can launch in the next few months. </p><p>The game is being made by To The Sky, a recently formed team led by an ex-EA development director named Jugo Mirkovic, and which Thunderful, publisher of the <em>SteamWorld</em> series and other games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-acquires-to-the-sky-games-studio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-acquires-to-the-sky-games-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased back in 2021</a></span>. “We shopped around with this game quite a bit,” he told <em>Kotaku </em>during a recent developer presentation. “The premise of the game is still kind of similar to what we pitched, but we found the fluidity and the gameplay a bit after we pitched the game. We wanted to pitch a combat kind of action, melee, roguelike. That’s what we pitched. But we ended up with something a lot more fluid, and that surprised even us.”</p><p>The studio stresses that <em>Godbreakers</em> is very much gameplay-first, which certainly comes across in the demo. But these days, games that aren’t firing on all cylinders—story, art, unique mechanics—can be hard to make time for when there are dozens of new games coming out every week. Thunderful also published<em> Reignbreaker</em> earlier this year, a neat-looking punk take on <em>Hades</em> that struggled to connect with enough players. The studio behind it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shut down before it even released</a></span>.<em> Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>, a roguelike spin-off of the whimsical gothic adventure from 2021, faced a similar uphill battle. One negative review praised the look and gameplay but said the progression during each new run felt too shallow to stick with. </p><p>Thunderful blamed weak sales of <em>The Eternal Die</em> for its latest round of layoffs announced on Tuesday. “It is unfortunate to have to implement further operational measures that affect some of our colleagues,” Thunderful chairman Patrick Svensk told investors. “At the same time, I am convinced that this is the right path for Thunderful to create an efficient organization within the publishing business where our announced release pipeline remains intact.<em>” </em></p><p>Amid rising debt, Atari (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-life-death-death-death-death?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-life-death-death-death-death?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back from the dead again, this time maybe for good</a></span>) announced today that it has taken a controlling stake in Thunderful for just  $5 million. That bargain bin price comes after years of great games—<em>Viewfinder</em>, <em>Planet of Lana, SteamWorld Heist 2</em>—that didn’t do well enough to make up for all of the other missed bets. Hopefully, <em>Godbreakers</em> can end up bucking that trend instead of becoming the latest casualty of it. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/godbreakers-roguelike-trailer-demo-atari-thunderful-1851787237]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2><strong>When is the Battlefield 6 open beta?</strong></h2><p>There is no release date yet for the Battlefield 6 open beta, but online speculation suggests it will begin in early August.</p><h2><strong>How to get into the Battlefield 6 open beta</strong></h2><p>Given it's an open beta, presumably anyone will be able to access the Battlefield 6 test. If it works like other open betas, players will be able to find the download from their store of choice and go from there.</p><h2><strong>What's in the Battlefield 6 open beta?</strong></h2><p>The contents of the Battlefield 6 open beta have not been announced, but it's expected the beta will allow players to try out some of the maps and modes. Battlefield Studios also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-confirmed-will-include-this-key-change/1100-6533303/" data-ref-id="1100-6533303">already confirmed</a> that the beta will allow players to choose either an "open" or "closed" weapon setup.</p><p>"Why not both?" the developer said. In the open beta, players can choose playlists that have signature weapons locked to a specific class, or not. "More to come," the developer said.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom. It appears DICE is trying to appease both audiences by giving them the option in Battlefield 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540239" data-ratio="0.55546875" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540239"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 6's open beta is on the way.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg"></figure><p>Battlefield 6 has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-campaign-is-inspired-by-this-movie-and-tv-show/1100-6531514/" data-ref-id="1100-6531514">campaign mode</a>, too, along with the rumored return of the Portal mode and a potential battle royale mode. The open beta, however, is only expected to offer up a multiplayer trial.</p><h2><strong>Does progress from the beta carry forward?</strong></h2><p>EA has not officially announced the specifics of the Battlefield 6 open beta, but history suggests that progress from the beta will not carry forward to the full game when it releases. This is how things normally work, and it's expected that will continue with Battlefield 6's open beta.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first new Battlefield game since 2021's tepidly received Battlefield 2042. A release date hasn't been announced, but speculation suggests it's launching on October 10. That's about a month before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s rumored November 14 release date.</p>

                <p>Despite the ongoing problems and constant shuttering of live service games, it's looking like Warner Bros still wants a piece of that questionable pie. A job listing at Warner Bros Games Montreal for an <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/" rel="nofollow ">executive producer role</a> went live recently (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/following-suicide-squads-flop-warner-bros-is-hiring-for-another-live-service-game/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), which explicitly makes mention of live service titles. The role would "oversee post-launch content and live service strategy," for one, and it also notes that having a "deep understanding of the full game development lifecycle, including live services," would be beneficial experience.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a couple of mentions of overseeing live operation processes, so it certainly seems like whatever WB Games Montreal is working on will have some kind of live service element. That obviously might raise some eyebrows for a couple of reasons.</p>

                <p>Get ready to draw, doodle, animate, and compose as Mario Paint has returned for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 via the Nintendo Classics Online library. Originally released in 1992 for the Super NES, Mario Paint turned your console into a full-on art studio, complete with a mouse and a whole world of creative tools. Now, a new generation can jump in and create colorful masterpieces, goofy animations, and original tunes--all with a modern twist.</p><p>On Nintendo Switch 2, you can use the Joy-Con 2’s new mouse-style controls to sketch, paint, and animate. Prefer a traditional setup? Plug in a compatible USB mouse--sold separately--on either Switch model and go old-school. And yes, the iconic music maker is back too, so get ready to compose your next virtual jam with chirping cats and bobbing mushrooms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8hd9D6ImM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ok8hd9D6ImM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Coloring Book is back with fresh designs and your favorite Nintendo characters to fill in, freestyle, or remix however you want. If you're feeling competitive, Gnat Attack is back to perfect your mouse skills.</p><p>If you're a Nintendo Switch Online member, you can save your creations and share them online. On Switch 2, GameChat2 lets you connect with voice, video, or screen share, so you can sketch, animate, or just hang out and watch your friends draw a very questionable Yoshi. Let the creative chaos begin.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-the-lukewarm-reception-to-battlefield-2042-fans-seem-to-be-getting-behind-battlefield-6-as-steam-wishlist-numbers-soar.1256067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Battlefield 6 was officially unveiled earlier this month, and it looks like so far the community is keen for the upcoming release, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042s-opening-weekend-has-been-a-disaster">somewhat lacklustre initial reception to its predecessor Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7355565272528826369-FoP1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8">a LinkedIn post</a> shared by Alinea Analytics CEO Rickard Linder, following the debut of Battlefield 6's reveal trailer last week, the game racked up nearly 500,000 Steam wishlists over the weekend (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wishlist-on-steam-half-million/">Insider Gaming</a>). Linder added roughly 60 percent of those who added Battlefield 6 to their wishlist had played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't too shabby when you consider that former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">Eurogamer editor in chief Martin Robinson called Battlefield 2042 "the weakest Battlefield in some time"</a> when it first released in 2021. To be fair, the team did work on improving Battlefield 2042, and in 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-with-humility-and-hustle-dice-might-yet-win-the-war">Eurogamer noted DICE had "course-corrected in dramatic fashion"</a>, though the developer would likely "have to wait for the next iteration to see its efforts rewarded". Given those wishlist numbers, it seems this may indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Like I said, we got our first look at Battlefield 6 last week, courtesy of a new trailer. While a firm release date was not provided as part of this reveal, the disclaimer URL featured in the video takes you to a page that says: "This promotional offer expires October 10, 2025. Code expires October 10, 2027." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-revealed-with-a-dedicated-multiplayer-reveal-coming-next-week">This indicates that pre-sell offers end on October 10, and that a release date for Battlefield 6 may be October 11, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>A separate multiplayer reveal is scheduled for later this week, on 31st July.</p>
<p>Aside from what has been officially announced, we already know a fair amount about the next Battlefield entry. Leaks from the Battlefield Labs tests revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush will be coming back to Battlefield 6</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">single player details have spilled out into the internet</a>, and a variety of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">weapons that'll be usable in the full release have made their way online, too</a>. Then, just this weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leaks-keep-on-coming-this-time-its-the-battle-royale-map">Battlefield 6's Battle Royale map popped up online</a>.</p>

<p>Also recently shared via the world that is social media are images from the Battlefield 6 alpha showing that the 'Battlefield stretch neck' - which is exactly as it sounds, with players having overly stretched necks - is back (see image above).</p>
<p>"It is an absolute classic that dates all the way back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a> beta," <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1949885360613323210">reads a post on X</a>. "It is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>"Battlefield is so back."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-lukewarm-reception-to-battlefield-2042-fans-seem-to-be-getting-behind-battlefield-6-as-steam-wishlist-numbers-soar]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d11b2f819c3bf/ninja-gaiden-ragebound.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're two days away from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, Dotemu and The Game Kitchen's gorgeous pixel art spin-off from the <strong>Ninja Gaiden</strong> series (which is experiencing something of a comeback lately). And ahead of the game's launch, publisher Dotemu has some potentially disappointing news for Switch owners.</p>
<p>The Switch 1 version "will average a 30 FPS experience at launch", the publisher <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dotemu.bsky.social/post/3lv4656qehq2z">announced</a>, while other platforms will hit a solid 60fps. Not the <em>best</em> news, but it's par-the-course for many games on the older hybrid.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The game, however, will be playable to Switch 2 and will, in Dotemu's words, "benefit from the console's specs". A little vague if you ask us — does that mean it'll be a solid 30fps? Will it aim for 60? Time will tell.</p>

<p>In more good news, Dotemu confirmed that it would be sharing details of post-launch updates ASAP. That may mean performance boosts for the newer console, stability fixes, or just new content.</p>
<p>Many people on social media have questions around what all of this means for those playing the game on Switch 2. We've reached out to Dotemu for clarification, and we'll update this story if we get a response.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-pre-orders-go-live-gamescom-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Xbox confirmed its lineup</a> for what it will feature during Gamescom 2025, with over 20 games on the list, and that its recently announced upcoming handheld, the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, will be available for players at the show to go hands-on with. Today, notable and reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-vous-devoile-la-date-douverture-des-ventes-60300">Billbil-kun from Dealabs</a> reports that pre-orders for both handhelds will go live the same day that Gamescom 2025 kicks-off, on August 20, 2025.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun also corroborated previous reports around the pricing for both handhelds, saying that the previous report of the ROG Xbox Ally being €599 and the ROG Xbox Ally X being €899 are correct, though Billbil-kun is not able to confirm the official pricing for the US and other regions around the world.</p>



<p>We know that Xbox will be featuring the Xbox Ally during its two days of broadcasts on Wednesday, August 20, and Thursday, August 21, so it could be that the official regional pricing and pre-orders will go live during that broadcast. Though it's also just as likely that the official prices will be revealed during <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom 2025 ONL</a> the night before, on August 19, to get players ready for the pre-orders to go live on August 20.</p>



<p>And if the official pricing is revealed on the 19th with pre-orders live on the 20th, then it's fairly safe to assume we'll know the official release date of the handheld on the 19th.</p>



<p>Regardless of when pre-orders go live or when the Xbox Ally launches, some players are using Dealabs' report to claim that August 20 is also when we'll know the release date for Hollow Knight Silksong. When the ROG Xbox Ally was revealed, it featured Silksong playing on the device, and when Xbox revealed its Gamescom 2025 lineup yesterday, it highlighted that there will be a playable demo of Silksong at its booth, which players can try out on the Xbox Ally.</p>



<p>The logic then seems to be that Xbox plans to have its new handheld out after Silksong has finally released, so it can be playable on the Xbox Ally on day one. Gamescom ONL is also the last major show of announcements before The Game Awards at the end of the year, and by then, it's expected that Silksong will have launched.</p>



<p>We'll see what surprises Gamescom 2025 has in store.</p>

Originally released back in 1992, <em>Mario Paint</em> was a unique SNES title, because although it included a handful of mini games, it was first and foremost a creative tool letting players draw, paint, animate, and even compose music using the 16-bit console.</p><p>What also set <em>Mario Paint</em> apart from other SNES games was that it didn’t rely on the console’s standard gamepad. It came bundled with a two-button mouse and a plastic mouse pad that made drawing and navigating the game’s on-screen menus and drag-and-drop interface much easier.</p><div><p>In 1992, creative apps like Photoshop were still in their relative infancy —- Photoshop didn’t even have its useful layers feature yet — and for many kids, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-miss-mario-paint-when-nintendo-gamified-art-class-1847664087"><em>Mario Paint</em> was their first exposure to using a digital creative tool</a> (and perhaps even a mouse).</p></div><p>Alongside <em>Mario Paint</em> being added to the Switch’s SNES catalog, Nintendo has enabled mouse support for the Switch’s SNES app, which is compatible with games like <em>Mario’s Super Picross</em> and <em>Nobunaga’s Ambition. </em>On the original Switch, players can connect a compatible USB mouse to play <em>Mario Paint</em>, while on the Switch 2 the Joy-Con 2 controller’s mouse functionality can be used.</p><p>The company also recently added 19 tracks from <em>Mario Paint</em> to the Nintendo Music mobile app, including the three sample compositions available in the game’s music sequencer.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/715104/nintendo-mario-paint-super-nintendo-switch-2-online-mouse-mode]]></content:encoded>

First released in 1992 for the Super Nintendo, the beloved art creation game allows players to create digital artworks, compose music, create custom animations, and more.</p><p>The game combines multiple creative applications, such as its titular digital painting application that lets you create custom artworks using a variety of tools or fill in coloring book images. Outside of painting, Mario Paint features minigames, a music composition tool (which players have used to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/09/04/get-lucky-recreated-in-mario-paint-isnt-daft-punk.aspx">recreate countless real-life songs</a>), a stamp designer for creating custom game sprites, and even animation software.

		<p>Nintendo has finally added Mario Paint to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, the SNES painting game considered a true classic by connoisseurs, and in a pleasant surprise, it arrives with full Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and USB mouse support in general!</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Paint - Super NES – Nintendo Classics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ok8hd9D6ImM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a bunch of different modes in Mario Paint that engage different styles of early digital artistry. For beginners, the colouring book mode lets you select from a palette of colours and fill in the line art of whatever scene is before you, but there’s further fun quirks like filling with pixel art sheets. Drawing Board is then more like a full on MS Paint with different brush types to bring your digital paining into reality – it’s where the iconic Undo Dog comes from to… undo stuff.</p>
<p>Stamp Designer lets you create 16×16 pixel art, saving a small handful of these tiles that you can then combine and animate across scenes with up to nine frames that repeat and follow a path you draw.&nbsp;Then there’s Music Composition creating songs from 15 distinctive sounds, including dog, cat, pig, goose and baby!</p>
<p>All of these can be combined to create and play scenes of your own devising. The original cartridge and game seriously limits how much you can save, but with four save slots available to suspend the game in Switch Online, you can quadruple the possibilities.</p>

<p>Rounding things out is Gnat Attack, a mode where you break out a fly swatter and slap flies that are buzzing around.</p>
<p>All of this was played best with a mouse on SNES, and will be here as well. On Switch 2, you can just detach a Joy-Con 2, hold it on its side to a surface and use mouse mode, but there is also support for USB mice on both Switch 2 and the original Switch, plugging them into the dock.</p>
<p>In a nice little extra, all the music from Mario Paint is also now available in the Nintendo Music app, which Switch Online subscribers all have access to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 29/07/2025:</strong> It appears to have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mcaanu/possible_footage_of_bmwukong_dlc/">confirmed</a> that this video is not a real leak of Black Myth: Wukong DLC and is indeed just some impressive work from a fan. </p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>A video from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th2bp9e0QUQ">DonPablo Gaming</a> claims to be footage from an unannounced DLC for Black Myth: Wukong, featuring a new underwater region and a quick-time-event fight between the game's protagonist, The Destined One, fighting what looks like a hydra on the back of a dragon. The video's description also claims that more details, like when this DLC will be available, will be announced on August 20, 2025, the day that Gamescom 2025 kicks off and the day <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-launch-scheduled-for-exactly-one-year-after-pc-ps5/">Black Myth: Wukong comes to Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p>



<p>Last year, rumors circulated that Black Myth: Wukong was set to receive <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/">two DLC expansions</a> ahead of a sequel, with the first of those DLCs planned for 2025. After the game surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/">18 million copies sold</a> (and would later <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/">surpass 20 million</a>), Daniel Wu from Hero Games, the largest external shareholder for the game's developer, Game Science, confirmed that an expansion was in development. </p>



<p>But beyond that, we've not had any other official or even close to official word on any DLC.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth Wukong Upcoming DLC Under Water" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/th2bp9e0QUQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Which is why it's still worth taking this video with a grain of salt, even though, through all its pixelated features, it does appear like it has a chance of being real. Especially since the video does capture the kind of grandiose encounters the original game is known for. The uploader also claims in the comments of the video that the footage is pulled from a beta test version of the DLC. </p>



<p>Is there a chance that this video is real? Sure there is. Is there a chance that someone is showing off their talents at faking this kind of footage? Always. We'll know one way or another by August 20th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Sues Tencent Over Horizon-esque Light of Motiram]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-esque-light-of-motiram.1256004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has filed a lawsuit against Chinese gaming giant Tencent over the latter's open-world survival game&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which Sony alleges is a "slavish clone" of its own&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series of games.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/" rel="nofollow">Reuters</a>, the lawsuit was filed in California federal court and accuses Tencent of copyright and trademark infringement over&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which it says contains several elements from the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>According to Sony, it declined to work with Tencent on a&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>spinoff game last year, and the announcement for&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which looks suspiciously similar to&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>, followed soon afterwards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/light-of-motiram-sony-tencent-lawsuit.jpg?itok=ff21AEIv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/light-of-motiram-sony-tencent-lawsuit.jpg?itok=gEzoLXQY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pop quiz: is this shot from&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>? (It's the latter.)</figcaption></figure><p>As part of its lawsuit, Sony is asking for damages (although the amount is undisclosed), as well as an order to block Tencent from violating its IP rights, according to Reuters. Presumably, that means development on&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>would either immediately cease or swerve direction swiftly.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow">announced back in November last year</a>. When I reported on its announcement, I said it had "strong 'we have&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>at home' energy", and I stand by that; the trailer is...well, brazen feels like too mild a word, honestly.</p>

<p>Let's just say that&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s aesthetics, robot wildlife, and tribal outfits are extremely strongly reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>, so I can understand the grounds on which Sony is pursuing this lawsuit.</p>

<p>You can check out the original announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>below if you want to remind yourself of what, exactly, it's being accused of stealing.</p>




<p>Tencent's proposed&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>collab isn't the only external partnership in the franchise that Sony has backed away from in recent months; back in January, it was reported that an unannounced&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO, developed in conjunction with&nbsp;<em>Guild Wars&nbsp;</em>studio NCSoft, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">had been canceled</a>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether this lawsuit will materially affect&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s development, but in the meantime, you can still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist Tencent's game on Steam</a> if you want.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Gray Lady has not been having a great time lately. From its<a href="https://glaad.org/nyt-podcast-trans-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> hurtful coverage of trans people</a> to its<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/media/new-york-times-trump-coverage-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> toothless reporting on the 2024 election</a> to its<a href="https://newyorkwarcrimes.com/dossier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> feckless approach to the ongoing genocide in Palestine</a>, the once-storied newspaper of record has faced increasing criticism as to what, exactly, it thinks it's doing for a world (and readership) that's rapidly shifting on its axis.</p><p>It seems silly to hold the paper's AI coverage and longstanding disinterest in video games up to the same scrutiny as those life-and-death matters, but this is a video game website, and a recent story on AI and the games industry published in the Times is <em>so </em>bad that I think it warrants a mention, even if it’s just a footnote below the paper’s bigger problems.</p><p>Called<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/arts/video-games-artificial-intelligence.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> “The Unnerving Future of A.I.-Fueled Video Games</a>,” it's a piece from Zachary Small, a writer who’s been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/insider/leveling-up-on-the-video-game-beat.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of the NYT’s renewed video game coverage</a> since 2023. One paragraph in particular stands out, in which Small seems to conflate the "AI" found in video games with the same "AI" that is currently boiling lakes and threatening the <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decimation of entire creative industries</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Most experts acknowledge that a takeover by artificial intelligence is coming for the video game industry within the next five years, and executives have already started preparing to restructure their companies in anticipation. After all, it was one of the first sectors to deploy A.I. programming in the 1980s, with the four ghosts who chase Pac-Man each responding differently to the player’s real-time movements.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The NYT is notorious in games media circles for its apparent neglect for video game coverage; <a href="https://game.substack.com/p/why-the-new-york-times-returned-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has never hired a dedicated staff or spun off a video game-specific vertical, instead relying on freelancers, syndication, individuals and adjacent writers like Small</a>. And once again here it shows; this excerpt <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bryantfrancis.me/post/3lv2zp4bfvc2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is understandably getting dunked to hell and back on social media</a>. But as silly as that paragraph is, I take wider issue with the positioning of the story itself. Like so much other reporting on AI from mainstream outlets, it's got an almost breathless tone to it, a story built on the premise that an AI revolution is inevitable, that any obstacles standing in the way of that will be taken care of in just a few years, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>Small, <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/optimistic-cowardice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like so many other dupes in tech reporting</a>, repeatedly takes AI grifters–like “tech founder Kylan Gibbs”, who despite the vague descriptor used in the NYT piece <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylangibbs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can more accurately be described as CEO of what was originally a games-related AI company</a>, which pushes stuff like AI-generated voice actors--at their word, despite their word holding as little proven value as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the AI bubble itself</a>. Small mentions “impressive tech demos at the [Game Developers] conference in late March”, referring to a succession of AI smoke-and-mirrors shows that sounded…<a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-npcs-nvidia-unity-ubisoft-convai-inworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well, impressive is not the word I’d use</a>. And when raising ethical concerns about the tech, he<a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> doesn't speak to an affected artist or developer</a>, or anyone<a href="https://sustainablegamesalliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who knows about games and their environmental impact</a>, but speaks to an academic with the title "director of responsible A.I. practice", as though there were such a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Every time I see shit like this I think about <a href="https://defector.com/toward-a-theory-of-kevin-roose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector’s “Toward A Theory Of Kevin Roose”</a>, where Albert Burneko sums up one of the biggest rubes on the beat, Kevin Roose (also of the New York Times), with:</p><blockquote><p>I was thinking about Kevin Roose, serially and with apparent enthusiasm donning each next pair of gigantic clown shoes handed to him by this or that Silicon Valley titan, and dancing in them long past the point when everybody else figured out it was all on behalf of a grift.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>And I think about how after Big Tech’s successive scams of the past decade–blockchain, NFTs, the Metaverse, all of which were supposed to be just as life-changing as AI is supposed to be, all of whose mainstream hype cratered when nobody had any actual use for them–should have ruined this kind of thinking, this kind of reporting. It should have taken what little credibility Silicon Valley had left and set fire to it, and made writers and reporters anywhere near the tech industry sit up and take notice.</p><p>But it hasn’t. We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and it’s being laundered in the same kind of stories. This newspaper sucks, man. It doesn’t suck because it posted something dumb that betrays the paper’s poor commitment to video gaming’s wider place in our culture and artistic landscape. It sucks because it’s doing to games, and AI, what it seems to be doing to every other important beat of the 2020s: taking the worst people at face value.</p><p>Anyone interested in tech, video games, AI and the points they all collide deserve better than this kind of coverage.

It will acquire around 82% of the outstanding shares at approximately €4.5 million.</p>
<p>The Swedish Securities Council has granted Atari an exception to complete the transaction without needing to bid for the remaining shares.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This news comes just after <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update">Thunderful Group announced</a> that it would be restructuring the company to "improve operative cash flow", as the company is operating at a deficit.</p>
<p>Its most-recent release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random_the_eternal_die">Lost In Random: The Eternal Die</a> — which only launched last month — has "shown weaker sales than expected". CEO Martin Walfisz <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-martin-walfisz-to-leave-the-role-as-ceo-of-thunderful-group-ab">will also be stepping down from his role</a> by the end of the calendar year.</p>

<p>Thunderful went through a restructuring twice in 2024, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/thunderful-announces-its-second-restructuring-program-in-one-year">second as recently as November 2024</a>. Its newest SteamWorld game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/steamworld_heist_ii">SteamWorld Heist II</a>, reportedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/new-steamworld-game-sales-fell-slightly-short-of-thunderfuls-expectations">fell slightly short of expectations</a>. Thunderful just announced it was bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> to Switch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/acclaimed-puzzler-viewfinder-bends-reality-on-switch-this-winter">later this year</a>.</p>
<p>Atari has made a number of fruitful acquisitions over the past few years, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/atari-enters-agreement-to-acquire-night-dive-studios">Nightdive Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/atari-acquires-retro-specialist-digital-eclipse">Digital Eclipse</a>. With Thunderful's woes over the past few years, <em>hopefully</em> this will turn out as well as these two seem to have.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari has announced that it will acquire a majority stake in&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>publisher Thunderful, and the latter has also revealed that its CEO will be stepping down as soon as a successor is found.</p>

<p>According to an Atari press release, the company will be acquiring 82% of Thunderful's shares, a move CEO Wade Rosen describes as "another important milestone in Atari's development" and a big part of the expansion of Atari's "publishing and development capabilities in the European region".</p>

<p>In a separate <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> of its own, Thunderful says that it will be undergoing a restructuring operation that will result in layoffs across the studio, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">recent release&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a>&nbsp;</em>selling less than Thunderful had hoped in its second quarter of the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-atari-thunderful.jpg?itok=eYaPsEa9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-atari-thunderful.jpg?itok=wD0LkoCp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Atari now owns a majority stake in Thunderful.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the restructuring, Thunderful says its upcoming slate remains the same, although the studio says it has been "overly dependent on individual game releases" in recent years. It's not entirely clear how the studio intends to pivot away from that reliance, however.</p>

<p>One thing that will be changing as part of Thunderful's restructuring is its CEO. Per <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-martin-walfisz-to-leave-the-role-as-ceo-of-thunderful-group-ab" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another press release</a>, current CEO Martin Walfisz will be departing the company, but he'll be remaining in his position "until a new CEO has assumed the role".</p>

<p>He will, however, not be remaining beyond December 31st this year at the latest, so we can assume that Thunderful will have found itself another CEO by then.</p>

<p>Atari's investment in Thunderful follows a challenging year and a half for the studio. In January last year, Thunderful <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">laid off around 20% of its workforce</a>, and it followed that decision with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" rel="nofollow">closure of Stage Clear Studios last May</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" rel="nofollow">yet more staff cuts in November</a>.</p>

In 2024, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-intellivision-acquisition" rel="nofollow">acquired its erstwhile rival Intellivision</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgeon-simulator-acquired-by-infogrames" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Surgeon Simulator&nbsp;</em>IP</a> through its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-infogrames-publishing-revival" rel="nofollow">newly-revived Infogrames label</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what its majority stake in Thunderful yields for the latter, but it's unlikely that the&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>studio will continue without some major internal policy shake-ups. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Forbidden West</a> publishers Sony have called in the lawyers over Tencent’s upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-22">Light of Motiram</a>, arguing in a <a href="https://www.law360.com/dockets/download/68840a41345c54c3d2bea683?doc_url=https%3A%2F%2Fecf.cand.uscourts.gov%2Fdoc1%2F035126006772&amp;label=Case+Filing">lawsuit filing</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/">Reuters</a>) that the post-apocalyptic action adventure looks a little too much like <em>their</em> post-apocalyptic action adventure. The case alleges that Light of Motiram, currently in development at Tencent subsidiary Polaris Quest, is a "slavish clone" of Guerrilla Games’ original series, and seeks to block its release on copyright infringement grounds.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So far, so <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">Nintendo vs Palworld</a>. Except Sony’s complaint also claims that Tencent approached them in 2024, supposedly with work on Light of Motiram already underway, and unsuccessfully pitched the Japanese publishing giant with a plan to produce a new, official Horizon game under license. The suggestion being that Tencent knowingly created a game they intended as a direct spinoff or sequel, then continued with it anyway after failing to win Sony’s agreement.</p>

<p>Under US law, copyright or trademark infringement doesn’t need to be provably intentional in order for a violation to have occurred, but Tencent will have a hard time arguing that the similarities are just happenstance if Sony can show this meeting did occur. A harder time, rather, because come on, just look at it. Even if Guerrilla don’t hold the patents on combat-rolling girl protagonists or leafy far futures, the robo-tribal aesthetic, metallic beast designs, post-collapse narrative setup, and even the trailers’ wailing soundtrack work are so Horizonish you can practically hear Ashly Burch whispering puzzle solutions to herself.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Light of Motiram has enjoyed at least some degree of... if not legitimacy, at least acceptance, especially compared to similarly borrow-happy games like the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306030/EBOLA_VILLAGE/">Ebola series</a> of Resident Evil copycats. Nvidia, for example, have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgFVQ8BezLg">showcased its promised DLSS 4 features</a>. Maybe that’s why Sony have taken the better part of a year to get the courts involved, perhaps having hoped it would fade into obscurity rather than sticking around as "Horizon with survival crafting" – not unlike a certain "Pokemon with guns".</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>All that said, I’m not sure that I’m actually on board with any legal book-throwing. For one thing, it all sounds rather petty for a company of Sony’s stature. Their complaint that the release of one originality-challenged RPG (that doesn’t currently have a release date) would cause "irreparable harm to SIE and the consuming public" is particularly laughable when the same document boasts how the Horizon series has shifted 38 million copies. Besides, let’s be honest, everyone copies everyone at least a tiny bit in modern gamesmaking, and arguably across art as a whole. Imagine where we’d be if even just the relatively obvious inspirations and homages were grounds for a jury trial: we wouldn’t have games like the Warhammer 40K-aping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>, or the I Can’t Believe It’s Not Warcraft that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>. And then I’d have never spent 2,800 hours of my life in the latter, getting angry at little wizard men for not hitting magic rocks when I ask them to.</p>

The card, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/wisdomofseaandsky/210.shtml&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/wisdomofseaandsky/210.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">included in collections on various Pokémon fansites</a></span>, shows the static image that appears on one of Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s two animated cards—that is, a card that, when pulled in the game, will play out an animation that begins and ends with the main image.</p><p>The two Ho-Oh are not <em>identical</em>, and clearly there are only so many ways to draw the same Pokémon, but when you flip and overlay the two images, they certainly line up.</p><figure id="" data-id="e864a33e626f206d136ead9458a8617d" data-recommend-id="image://e864a33e626f206d136ead9458a8617d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The two images overlaid to show how the ho-oh lines up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The two images overlaid to show how the ho-oh lines up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / lanjiujiu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e864a33e626f206d136ead9458a8617d" data-recommend-id="image://e864a33e626f206d136ead9458a8617d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The two images overlaid to show how the ho-oh lines up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What makes this situation more bemusing is that the artist listed on the Pokémon card is Sie Nanahara, who has provided plenty of adored previous cards in the TCG, as well as across multiple other franchises. Nanahara created the beloved art for Crown Zenith’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.serebii.net/card/crownzenith/H56.shtml&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.serebii.net/card/crownzenith/H56.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hisuian Zoroark VSTAR</a></span> and Obsidian Flames’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.serebii.net/card/obsidianflames/199.shtml&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.serebii.net/card/obsidianflames/199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ninetails</a></span>, for instance.</p><p>So what are the possibilities here? One is that the card that’s being shown as part of Wisdom of Sea and Sky is in fact not real. The images shown on various sites are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1mc2ybg/wisdom_of_sea_and_sky_cards_list_full_set/#lightbox&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1mc2ybg/wisdom_of_sea_and_sky_cards_list_full_set/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">based on a leak</a></span>, rather than an official reveal, and there’s something odd about the coloring and overlapping images on the H0-Oh card. It has that strange, washed-out look on the left and right, with the images not matching, and that certainly wouldn’t be in the final image. It could be because the card animates, and these are from different points in the animation. Quite <em>how</em> an incorrect art would have slipped into the otherwise apparently accurate leak isn’t obvious, but it remains the case that the art makes it look very odd.</p><p>An unlikely possibility is that lanjiujiu created their art after the fact, but again, no such accusation is being leveled here. It’s suggested the art was actually made in 2021.</p><p>Another possibility is of course that something untoward has taken place. It’s worth noting that the two drawings <em>aren’t</em> identical, tiny details like the curls on the Ho-Oh’s head being drawn differently and the far longer tail, which reduces the likelihood this is a rushed Photoshop fake. The prolific artist involved has yet to respond to various inquiries on their X account, although they did post a message before the issue was originally raised that machine-translates to “As expected, you won’t improve unless you draw originals.” It just doesn’t seem to fit that this artist would suddenly lift someone else’s work.</p><p>We’ve reached out to both Nanahara and The Pokémon Company to ask about the situation, and to find out if the image in the leaks is accurate to the set, and will update should we hear back.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-card-art-plagiarism-1851787197]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-is-2d-action-done-right-the-final-preview</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to 2D action platformers, I don’t necessarily need them to be revolutionary. But I do expect a superb execution of the fundamentals – speed, control, and challenge – all of which the upcoming Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is nailing down based on a two-hour hands-on demo I played. That’s not to say it doesn’t have new ideas woven into the formula, it’s just that I came away simply impressed by how this reboot plays like a well-oiled machine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven’t seen it in action yet, think of it as the classic Shinobi franchise getting the Streets of Rage 4 treatment; a vibrant and expressive hand-drawn art style that looks fantastic in stills and even better in motion. Many of the developers at LizardCube had worked on the Streets of Rage reboot, and it ended up being a great fit because it breathes life into a 2D world in a way few other games have done. A level’s backdrop can give a notable sense of scale, and the illusion of distance in this new Shinobi – what could’ve been a drab shipyard level feels immense when you see the details of huge cranes, ships, and containers in the background. And the interiors painted with neon signs and neo-modern shops and stalls fill the in-betweens with personality. A great sense of style pops in small but effective ways.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A banging electronic trip-hop soundtrack fused with traditional Japanese folk instruments also feeds into its balance of classic and modern sensibilities, vaguely reminiscent of something out of Samurai Champloo. The Art of Vengeance both looks and sounds effortlessly cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I went through the opening level that I played earlier this year at Summer Game Fest, which reintroduces series protagonist Joe Musashi as his village and clan are under attack the minute you start. His wife Naoko and understudy Tomoe are introduced as he has to leave them behind to chase down a military invasion led by the antagonist Lord Ruse and a gang of his demonic minions. You’re taught the basics like combos, dodging, wall-jumping, and special abilities, quickly pitting you against a mix of platforming sections to sharpen your mobility and combat encounters to test deftness with the blade and Ninpo specials.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance - Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This preview round, however, I cleared two full levels around the midway point, where I had a slew of new abilities and much tougher foes. I had to play both in Arcade Mode which reconfigures levels for a time attack-style version of them, and while the checkpointing was generous, Arcade Mode is all about having a seamless run to earn a high grade in the end. The aforementioned shipyard had pesky drones, guards in riot gear, and enemy ninjas with unblockable dark spells – any combination of these guys made for some tough normal encounters that can get overwhelming if you don’t know who to prioritize. And with clever but trial-and-error platforming challenges, it was a tall task to get through without death (at least on my first try). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s the flow and fluidity of the gameplay that made my time with Shinobi so enjoyable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I know that on paper, all this may sound like what you should expect from a proper 2D action platformer, but it’s the flow and fluidity of the gameplay that made my time with Shinobi so enjoyable. When I can slice a gang of enemies within a sliver of health and hit the shoulder buttons to pull off a swift and dramatic multi-hit execution, I’m pumped up like I’m stringing a series of glory kills in the new Doom games. The novelty hadn’t worn thin because, like glory kills, it doesn’t get in the way of the flowing fast action, and you get health and Ninpo energy in return as a treat. Hitting your light-heavy combos is all well and good, but when I execute my counterattack Ninpo on a dime to chop down a strong enemy’s health, I’m nodding my head in satisfaction. And Joe’s ultimate ability, which builds up through taking damage, just burns through everything on screen which was clutch in sticky situations that had me popping off when it finished a boss. Even something as simple as going from a platforming section into divekicking a foe to start my combo string in combat sequence is a small but effective thing that shows LizardCube knows what makes 2D action tick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There wasn’t any real story content to glean from these later levels, but boy, are these stages <em>long</em>. And when they’re capped off with intense boss fights, Arcade Mode can really wear you down – which isn’t a derogatory mark, but rather an indication of demanding Shinobi can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all going from left to right, however. The second level I played was in neon-soaked slums that had three sections to the west, east, and south where I had to find and save children being held captive. This stage leaned more into exploration, where connecting ziplines and jumps to avoid hazards and lurking enemies pushed me to be more precise with movement. Snipers lurking in the distance could one-shot me lest I one-shot them first, goopy slimes moving underground can pop-up for toxic damage, and those damn riot guards are a different kind of challenge in close quarters. The boss fight here was my favorite, which had me thinking more about aerial combos since he could fly across the combat arena – he also had a phase where he would heal up if I didn’t do enough damage in time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Balancing depth and approachability is one aspect I think Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is getting right from what I’ve played. I have just enough tools to feel equipped for its toughest battles, not overwhelming and not shallow. Thus, the focus is on your mastery of the toolset and reacting to some devastating combat mechanics from enemies. Since it controls incredibly smooth, and is properly paced with a speed to match its style of challenges, the fundamentals of a good 2D action platformer seem to all be here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The return of our old ninja-themed action games is great to see – well, maybe it’s just this and Ninja Gaiden Ragebound (which also has Streets of Rage 4 lineage via publisher DotEmu). But in the years since both series’ heyday, we’ve seen countless others set the bar higher and higher with games like Dead Cells, The Messenger, and Katana Zero to name a few. To speak for Shinobi specifically, Art of Vengeance feels like an old head coming back to show the youngins that they still got it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’ll truly prove whether or not the series still has the juice when Shinobi: Art of Vengeance launches on August 28 this year for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-is-2d-action-done-right-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>
