            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-new-eberron-2025-supplement-bringing-back-older-dd-setting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced two new supplements coming to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. One of those is a new Eberron 2025 supplement, bringing players back to one of the fantasy TTRPG's most beloved settings.</p>

<h2>The Eberron 2025 Supplement Announcement</h2>

<p>In a recent report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/d-d-adds-two-new-books-to-2025-slate-including-new-eberron-book.710194/#post-9568885" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, the Eberron 2025 supplement has been added to Wizards of the Coast's upcoming slate of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> books coming this year.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-2025-adventurer-artwork.jpg?itok=XUICQ1Tk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-2025-adventurer-artwork.jpg?itok=VktmOXzJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Eberron is the name of an original setting set in the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> . It was created by Keith Baker, James Wyatt, and Bill Slavicsek and debuted in 2004 for <em>D&amp;D 3.5 Edition</em>. It is a setting distinct from Dragonlance or The Forgotten Realms for its introduction of fantasy technology like trains, airships, automatons known as Warforged and iconic arcane tinkerers: Artificers.</p>

<p>The Eberron supplement, officially titled <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>, will come to store fronts this August. The book will be a companion to the previously released book, <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, and will contain new player options, bastion options tied to the Eberron setting, and new airship rules.</p>

<p>Among those new player options is the revised Artificer class. This aligns with Wizards of the Coast recently releasing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Artificer playtest material</a> for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> after the class was conspicuously absent from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the Eberron 2025 will contain some changes to the setting's lore. Dragonmarked houses are no longer species-locked , players can join any house. In addition, dragonmarks will be made into more fully fleshed out Feats including pre-requisites Lastly, the Khoravar, originally treated as a form of half-elf, will now be treated as a separate player species.</p>

<p>The design team on this new supplement will include James Wyatt and Keith Baker will act as a consultant.</p>

<p>The announcement of the Eberron 2025 supplement is in keeping with Wizards of the Coast's latest wave of books for the latest iteration of their fantasy TTRPG. Their release slate also includes a <em>Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</em> containing 8 new subclasses and a <em>Forgotten Realms Adventurer's Guide</em> providing GMs with worldbuilding details on the land of Faerun.</p>

<p>Another virtual reality (VR) studio has been bitten by the layoff bug. Fast Travel Games, the developers behind titles such as  Cities: VR and Into The Radius, announced on Tuesday that it is laying off 30 people because of low game sales.</p>



<p>The announcement was made via a statement on social media.</p>



<p>“Due to lower sales than expected from our six game launches in 2024, in combination with a more uncertain year ahead for VR Games as a whole, we’ve taken the difficult decision to make 30 employees redundant at FTG,” Fast Travel Games’ statement reads. “These changes will affect mainly our Publishing, Marketing, and Admin departments, although the Studio will also be impacted as we consolidate down to one development team.”</p>



<p>They continued: “This is an exceptionally difficult decision, but we believe it’s necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company.</p>



<p>“Our focus now is on supporting all Fast Travellers through this challenging time. We’re grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to continue launching incredible games for our players.”</p>



<p>With the layoffs at Fast Travel Games, January has seen 21 studios either hold layoffs or shut down. The <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">total estimated jobs lost</a> as of writing sits around 700. The only bright spot at the moment is that, at this time last year, the games industry had already seen nearly 6,000 lose their jobs.</p>

"The Dreadnaught has reawakened for the first time in almost a decade, spurring the Vanguard and Guardians across the system to take notice. We finally get to see what has become of the Dreadnaught years after Oryx was felled and its halls were left to corrode, without a Navigator."</p><p>In other Bungie news, the company underwent significant changes in 2024 when it announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">mass layoffs and a restructuring that will see some staffers form a new team inside parent company Sony to make a new game.</a> In addition to ongoing support for Destiny 2, Bungie is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">working on Marathon</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-dev-teases-sci-fi-project-inspired-by-frogs-comedy-mobas-and-fighting-games/1100-6517010/" data-ref-id="1100-6517010">a game inspired by frogs and comedy.</a></p>

Fans got a quick glimpse of the great ape in the Switch 2 demo reel with (what appears to be) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">Mario Kart 9</a>, but it seems the new look for DK isn't just for the game, but in merchandise as well.</p><p>It's not the first time Donkey Kong has been given a facelift since his original design in 1981, which was more like King Kong, and then completely overhauled with Rare's Donkey Kong Country franchise.

Movie, which eagle-eyed fans have noticed on Nintendo's <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/goods/VM_NSJ_8_CMAAT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Japanese merchandise</a>. The brow was scaled back, giving him a sort of kinder, rounder look. DK's superfans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1iahhoh/history_is_being_rewritten_in_front_of_our_very/?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> weighed in on the design with some not sure, while others were in favor of the new look. </p><p>"At first I was against the design change, however after looking at it more I agree that it better allows DK to convey facial expressions and emotion. Before DK just kinda always looked angry? The brow reduction allows a greater range of expression and honestly looks pretty good once you get over the initial surprise of the change," one user said.</p><p>For now, it's just Donkey Kong himself getting a new look though it's unclear if Diddy Kong and the rest of the Kong family will be spared.</p>

			<p>2025 is going to be a jam-packed year for new games being released, but who could forget about the many DLCs and expansions that are confirmed to be happening this year? Admittedly, some have yet to be detailed or even announced, but the ones that have been are bound to keep you watching the calendar for their release date. Without further ado, here is Wccftech's most anticipated DLC of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strategy and Simulation</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooter</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-multiplayer-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atomic-Heart-DLC-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Atomic Heart: Enchantment Under the Sea (January 28)</h2>
<p>This expansion actually launches today on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomic-heart-soviet-bioshock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 2023 launch</a>, Atomic Heart has already received two DLCs, both of which have been welcomed with mixed feelings across the board. However, the third time's the charm, right? In this DLC, you will return to Facility 3826 as Major P-3, with Twin at your side as you go diving into the depths and explore uncharted watery depths to try and save humanity.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/age-of-empires-4HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Age of Empires 4 Untitled DLC (TBA)</h2>
<p>The name of the upcoming DLC hasn't been revealed yet, but World's Edge has confirmed that there will be a new DLC coming at some point in 2025 for Age of Empires 4. So far, the game has received a lot of seasonal content, but it has also received a mixture of <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-iv-anniversary-season-3-upate-ottomans-malians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free</a> and paid DLC. These DLCs have added the Ottomans and Malians to the game, as well as a paid DLC called The Sultans Ascend, which added other civilizations to the game. Hopefully, the DLC is what the fans have been hoping for.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Indiana-Jones-Giants-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle - The Order of Giants (TBA)</h2>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the best games released in 2024</a>. Needless to say, we're eager to get our hands on its announced story-driven DLC, The Order of Giants, which is included with the purchase of the Premium Edition. As implied by the title, this expansion should shine further light on the secretive organization that the main game reveals to be actually named Nephilim Order. There's little doubt that Indiana will once again face many shenanigans in this new adventure, though we don't know who else might appear in it - could we see other familiar faces from the movies? Only time will tell.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Lies-of-P-header.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Lies of P Untitled DLC (TBA)</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is another DLC that doesn't have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/">confirmed release date yet</a>. However, we do know that it is slated for release this year, possibly in the first quarter, while Neowiz is also working on a sequel to Lies of P that is coming in the future. It's uncertain as to what this DLC will be about, but it's perfect for those who enjoyed Lies of P or are wanting more of the soulslike experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rain-world-the-watcher-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>Rain World: The Watcher (March 28)</h2>
<p>Rain World has already received a fair bit of new content over the years since its release in 2017, with Downpour being the first major DLC that the game received back in 2023. Luckily, for those who are a fan of the slugcats, Rain World will be getting its second paid DLC, named The Watcher, released on March 28, 2025. While January has been going on for what feels like ten years, it will soon be over, meaning March will be even closer than before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/sniper-elite-resistance-tips-ping-health-noise-1851749709<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is a challenging sequel that doesn’t shy away from testing your marksmanship. As such, you’ll want to bring your best self to each mission. Below, we’ve got a handful of tips we think might help you do exactly that, so take a look and put ‘em to good use.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1054"><a id="ping"></a>Take it slow and ping your foes</h2><p>This kind of goes without saying, but <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is, uh, a game about sniping. You can go in guns blazing in certain situations, but you’ll generally want to keep a slow and steady pace. Much of your time will be spent planning how to approach a scenario, so you’ll want to keep tabs on where all of the bad guys are walking around.</p><p>To do this, you can break out your binoculars or simply aim down your sniper’s sight with the reticle on an enemy. Train your sights on them and let the small bar above their head fill up, which will then leave a ping on them for you so that you know where they are at all times. This can make a world of difference when you’re ready to infiltrate populated areas—though be prepared to take quick (and quiet) action against any random enemies you may have overlooked.</p><h2 id="h1055"><a id="noise"></a>Use noise to your advantage</h2><p>There are a variety of ways in which you can mask the sound of your sniper. You’ll come across generators you can sabotage to make noise, or even use the sound of thunder on a rainy night. You can tell when your sniper shots will be masked by looking for a wavy noise indicator at the very top of your screen. Plan to pop noggins when this is on your screen and you’ll be less likely to attract the attention of other soldiers in the area.</p><h2 id="h1056"><a id="axis"></a>Turn off Axis Invasions if you want a solo experience</h2><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> features a mechanic that allows another real person to infiltrate your game and try to kill you (similar to invasions in <em>Dark Souls</em>). Luckily, <strong>if that’s not your jam, you can turn off this feature in the settings under the “Game” tab</strong>. The first option here is “Allow Axis Invasions,” and you can switch it on or off, or you can select to have invasions happen exclusively when you invite someone.</p><h2 id="h1057"><a id="yellow"></a>Never pass up yellow items</h2><p>As you play through levels, you’ll come across items that glow yellow when you’re nearby. These are often things like Satchel Charges, Crowbars, Bolt Cutters, useful keys, or even objective-related items. You should always pick up these items, as they’re always there for a good reason. If you pass up a Satchel Charge and then reach an objective that needs one, it’s going to be a pain in the ass to trace your steps back to where it was. Be proactive, dammit!</p><h2 id="h1058"><a id="health"></a>Buy health upgrades ASAP</h2><p>Make sure to snag the two Health Boost skills. Getting shot hurts like hell in <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em>, so you’ll need all the cushion you can get on your health bar. Additionally, grab the Speedy Recovery skill to ensure that your health regenerates rapidly after you’ve taken a hit or two. You’ll be happy you did when you find yourself in the game’s most hectic shootouts.</p><hr><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is available now for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As a result, some people are camping outside Micro Centers despite cold weather, rain, and the retailer discouraging the behavior, all for a chance to buy a new, powerful GPU. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On January 30 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nvidia-nvda-ai-graphics-card-microsoft-stock-record-1851610332?_gl=1*1aipxgr*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczODA4OTc3My4xNTQuMS4xNzM4MDkwNzk0LjI4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-nvda-ai-graphics-card-microsoft-stock-record-1851610332?_gl=1*1aipxgr*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczODA4OTc3My4xNTQuMS4xNzM4MDkwNzk0LjI4LjAuMA..">Nvidia</a></span> will begin selling both the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-50-series-everything-we-know-so-far/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-50-series-everything-we-know-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 RTX 5090 GPU</a></span> and the slightly-less-powerful-but-still-beefy $1,000 RTX 5080 GPU.

<p>On the surface, Medieval Dynasty looks like the type of pump-and-dump indie game that studios toss out to earn a quick buck before moving on to the next project. But that’s utterly incorrect in this case, as developer Render Cube continues to impress with content update after update. The most recent release, Medieval Dynasty update 2.3, allows us to paint buildings, construct house presets, stack items, and so much more!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-medieval-dynasty-update-2-3">What’s New in Medieval Dynasty Update 2.3?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Right, so the house presets, economy tab, and item stacking are excellent additions that will make life in Medieval Dynasty ten times easier. But let’s be honest, we’re all here for the ability to paint our structures. We can have a brightly-colored town, ready to catch a trader’s eye or perhaps a wolf. It’s likely the latter.</p>

<li><strong>House Presets</strong></li>



<li><strong>Economy Summary Tab</strong></li>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-fixed"><strong>Fixed</strong></h3>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/throne-and-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-582820">Throne and Liberty</a>, the free-to-play MMORPG from Korean developer NCSOFT and publisher Amazon, is set to receive its first major content update on March 6 when its Wilds of Talandre expansion arrives. The update will overhaul some of the game's existing systems while additionally adding all new ones like Artifacts.</p><p dir="ltr">As the name of the expansion implies and as detailed in a <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/wilds-of-talandre-announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the update will add the new zone of Talandre. There the game's story will continue as players progress their characters to the new level cap of 55, all the while participating in new world events and field dungeons.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIXmI-iiyew" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uIXmI-iiyew" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are big changes coming to Throne and Liberty's endgame too, with the update set to introduce a new activity in the form of Solo Dungeons. These are intended as a way to ease players into more difficult endgame group content. Those looking for a true endgame challenge will be able to tackle new 3-Star difficulty dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of systems, Throne and Liberty's current Weapon Mastery mechanic will be getting revamped. Details are still light for now, but Amazon states that it will add "another layer of personalization" to progressing weapons, allowing players to alter or empower specific skills. Current Weapon Mastery levels will be converted into experience points in the new system.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Weapon Mastery changes, a new Artifact system is also being introduced. In what sounds similar to tier sets from other MMOs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>, acquiring sets of Artifact gear will activate bonuses by equipping two, four, and six pieces of the same set. Two pieces of each set consist of a Solar Stone and Lunar Stone, which grant an active skill and passive skill respectively. This new type of gear can only be acquired from Abyss Dungeons in the Talandre region or from Nebula Island, a new time-restricted area that features hourly events and periodic field bosses.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/throne-and-liberty-launches-to-big-concurrent-player-numbers-but-not-as-big-as-new-world-or-lost-ark/1100-6526849/" data-ref-id="1100-6526849">Throne and Liberty launched in October 2024 to big concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>, even if they were smaller compared to Amazon's previous MMO launches for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-ark/" data-ref-id="5000-533053">Lost Ark</a>.

It takes the character back to a high school setting in a modern age but an alternate universe from that in the MCU.

<p>Nintendo remains one of the largest and most popular gaming companies in the world. Known for its Mario, Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon franchises, Nintendo has become a household name over the last 40+ years. That’s why Nintendo’s quarterly earnings reports are closely watched by analysts, investors, and consumers alike.</p>



<p>It’s important to know when the next earnings report is, what time it starts, and how you can follow it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into Nintendo’s financial health, performance from its hardware and games, and general outlooks for the months ahead.</p>



<p>What is Nintendo’s current focus on the heels of recent game releases and the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement? Are there any concerns to address? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-nintendo-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Nintendo Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> is currently scheduled to deliver its third quarter (Q3) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2025 on Tuesday, February 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to why the company is releasing its third quarter earnings in February, Nintendo’s fiscal calendar runs from April 1-March 31. Their third quarter runs from October 1-December 31, meaning the latest call will include information from the holiday sales season.</p>



<p>The company’s quarters are structured as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Q1: April 1 – June 30</li>



<li>Q2: July 1 – September 30</li>



<li>Q3: October 1 – December 31</li>



<li>Q4: January 1 – March 31</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-next-nintendo-earnings-report-start-time">Next Nintendo Earnings Report Start Time</h2>



<p>The next Nintendo earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes in Japan on February 4, 2025. For those in the United States, that would put it somewhere between 2am and 5am ET.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-access-to-nintendo-s-earnings-report">How To Access To Nintendo’s Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to read Nintendo’s quarterly earnings report, you can do so via the company’s website. You have to simply do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Investor Relations page</a></li>



<li>Under “What’s New” there will be the option to select the “Nine Months Financial Results…” from the list. There will be options to view presentation material and view the Q&amp;A summary. Just select which material you want to view.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-nintendo">What To Expect From Nintendo</h2>



<p>In its upcoming earnings call, Nintendo is likely to mention the Nintendo Switch 2, which was revealed in January. The call comes before the full Nintendo Direct presentation for the new console, so specific information on the system might be scarce. We’re also likely to get updates on Nintendo game sales totals for titles like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and more. Lastly, Nintendo will give an updated forecast for its year-end and fourth quarter financials.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-nintendo-earnings-report">The Last Nintendo Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When Nintendo last reported its quarterly earnings, it announced that the Nintendo Switch had sold 146.04 million units in its lifespan. It was also revealed, however, that general revenue was down to $1.82 billion year-over-year, marking a a 19.8% decline. Regarding its games, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom sold 2.58 million copies in just four days of sales while Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD sold 1.57 million copies during the quarter.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-earnings-calls">What Are Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

                <p>One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> most famous pieces of cut content, the Karazhan Crypts, is finally playable today as dungeon. The new piece of endgame content is part of WoW's more experimental <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">Season of Discovery</a> servers. </p><p dir="ltr">WoW is filled with unused areas or places that were never fully fleshed out, and vanilla WoW's Karazhan Crypts are one of them. It's a dark, moody area below the tower of Karazhan (which itself wouldn't actually become a raid until the game's first expansion) in the original version of WoW that has long captured the imagination of players. Now, as part of a new content phase for WoW Classic's current seasonal servers, the Karazhan Crypts have been transformed into a five-man dungeon for players to explore.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLT6rP4L-Pc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rLT6rP4L-Pc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As detailed by WoW Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLT6rP4L-Pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WillIE</a> (in partnership with Blizzard), the dungeon itself is unlike others players may be used to. Inspired by classic dungeon-crawling RPGs, the Karazhan Crypts are shrouded in a darkness that can only be dispelled with a magical torch. There's no mini-map to rely on, so players will need to stick together as they explore the dark reaches of the crypt and encounter new horrors. In keeping with the "discovery" aspect of the season, players will want to keep an eye out for secrets inside the dungeon that may aid their adventuring party.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a dungeon designed for players who have already acquired some endgame gear, and the new loot found within the crypts will be comparable to gear earned from raids like Blackwing Lair and the Temple of Ahn' Qiraj. Because of how powerful the gear found in the dungeon is, the Karazhan Crypts will be on a 24-hour lockout, allowing players to run it once per day.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard originally teased the addition of the Karazhan Crypts back when Season of Discovery was first announced at BlizzCon 2023. However, it's not the first new dungeon added to vanilla WoW as part of the season. Blizzard previously added Demon Fall Canyon, another mostly unused area of the game's world, as a dungeon--one where players face off against the phantom of Grommash Hellscream himself.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the new dungeon, Season of Discovery's new content phase additionally revamps its infamous Naxxramas raid. Blizzard is already teasing another new piece of endgame content as well in the form of what looks to be a Scarlet Crusade-themed raid, though players will have to wait for more details.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the modern version of WoW, its next big <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">update will be focused on the goblins of Undermine</a>, all while Blizzard works on the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing feature</a> announced to be coming as part of the game's next expansion.</p>

            <p>
Following a bit of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-eagerly-awaited-patch-8-out-now-on-ps5-but-larian-says-it-shouldnt-be">false start</a> yesterday, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Patch 8 stress test is now officially underway on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, giving select participants the opportunity to explore a range of new features ahead of its full release - with split-screen co-op support for Xbox Series S being the surprise (and long-awaited) inclusion.
</p>
<p>
Developer Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-new-subclasses-cross-play-and-more-next-year">detailed Baldur's Gate 3's Patch 8</a> back in November, promising 12 new sub-classes, cross-play, new camera features, and more. At the time, it revealed it would holding a closed stress test ahead of a full launch - in order to help it "catch things before they can become an issue" - with registrations having been open since then.
</p>
<p>
And now, the first wave of invites has gone out to successful applicants, and Patch 8's stress test is live. Larian covers some key details relating to the release in an <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-33-patch-8-stress-test-now-live_134">accompanying blog post</a>, providing notes on the use of mods during cross-play, as well as instructions on requesting additional keys for participants wishing to explore cross-play with friends not yet in the test.

<p>
The big surprise, though, is confirmation that Patch 8 will also finally introduce split-screen co-op to Xbox Series S after an extremely long wait. The feature has proven to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-screen-is-a-must-for-baldurs-gate-3-on-xbox-series-s-says-larian">bit of a headache</a> for Larian, and was initially blamed for Baldur's Gate 3's delayed release on Xbox back in 2023, as the studio struggled to optimise it sufficiently for Microsoft's lower-spec console. In the end, Series S split-screen was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-drops-series-s-split-screen-as-solution-to-bring-baldurs-gate-3-to-xbox-this-year">dropped completely</a> and wasn't included when the game finally launched for Xbox Series X/S in December 2023.
</p><p>
And it seemed like that was that. But now - more than 12 months later - Larian has confirmed the feature has made the cut for Patch 8, meaning it's just squeaked into Baldur's Gate 3's very last content update. There's not much more to report on its inclusion, however, with Larian simply noting stress test participants on Xbox can try it out early starting today.
</p>
<p>
Larian hasn't yet said how long it expects the stress test to last before Patch 8's full release, but Baldur's Gate 3 players eager to get involved can <a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register">still register their interest</a> on its website.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-perfect-video-game-run-won%E2%80%99t-solve-my-problems.1094067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/long-dark-dlc-perfect<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the Aftermath newsletter last week, I wrote about the tragic end of a recent run I was on in <em>The Long Dark</em>, my favorite survival game. I almost immediately started a new run, determined to do everything better–no, <em>perfectly–</em>this time. Stop me if you’ve learned this life lesson already, but trying to do everything perfectly isn’t much fun at all.</p><p>In the survival sandbox of <a href="https://www.thelongdark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Long Dark</em>,</a> you’re given a huge, snowy world to survive in as long as possible, and how you go about doing that is up to you. As I’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written before</a>, despite hundreds of hours in the game, my runs have never lasted very long. My last run was only about 35 in-game days, but it was solid: I had good gear, had crafted a bow and a ton of arrows, and was well on my way to getting to check out the recently-added safehouse customization when I lost it all due to bad luck and panic. Lessons learned, I thought, promptly starting again.</p><p>I hit the wrong button when starting my new run, because I spawned in the game’s remote DLC maps instead of the main map that I intended to. It wasn’t my ideal place to start a run, but it did mean I was well set up to check out the narrative that the DLC added, which I’ve never pursued in earnest. I decided to embrace my mistake and make that my plan, focusing on trekking across the game’s world repairing the required transmitters and finding their related bunkers.</p><p>I’m ashamed to admit I almost immediately took to (let’s call it what it is) cheating by looking up guides to the locations. When I learned that one might take me back into the path of the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lgk4aeeg4223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cougar</a> that ended my previous run, I became fixated on the idea of completing that part of the story before the cougar spawned. This wasn’t hard–in the difficulty I’m playing on, I had plenty of time–but it stressed me out a lot. I beelined across the game’s world, grabbing what I could get on my way. This single-minded focus led to a couple mistakes, wearing way too heavy clothes and missing places where I could have grabbed some good loot, including some of the items needed to repair the transmitters. This latter mistake slowed me down once I realized it, but once I repaired the necessary transmitter, I raced toward the bunker. I panicked when I got lost in a transition mine, and I fell through thin ice several times as I split my attention between the radio required to locate the bunker and glancing around wildly for extra-dangerous <a href="https://thelongdark.fandom.com/wiki/Aurora" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aurora</a> predators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, my character is in that bunker, well before the cougar has spawned. I know where the other transmitters and their bunkers are because I’ve watched unnecessary hours of YouTube videos and pored over player-made maps. I keep running over my plan in my head: I’ll drop my collected gear at my favorite base, hit the next transmitter early in the morning so I can be right where the next bunker is when the aurora starts, then hit the last transmitter and bunker on my way to another good looting spot. Closing out this part of the DLC will require going back to an area I don’t terribly want to trek to, and I’m torn between locking in the ending so I can pursue the next part of the DLC on a different save if I die, and trusting myself to survive long enough to let it happen naturally.</p><p>Logging out for the night with my character safely ensconced in the bunker, I realized I was feeling distinctly stressed out and <em>weird</em> about the run, and about a game that I really love. In many ways, <em>The Long Dark</em> is a game about fucking up, about embracing impermanence and coming to peace with seeing your hard work vanish in an instant. For the decade I’ve been playing the game, I’ve never been too attached to a run, but now that I’m trying to play it “right,” I find myself feeling like I’m not playing it right at all. I’m afraid to take risks or encounter wildlife, feel like exploring is just wasted time, and trying to optimize every choice and path in ways that seem to come naturally to players far more skilled than me, but which loses the feeling of free-flowing adventure that I like best about the game, even when it leads to disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It has of course occurred to me that I got <em>really into</em> this game again around the recent election and its subsequent horrors. <em>The Long Dark</em> is a wilderness full of unpredictable dangers, which certainly fits the current vibe, and an empty world far away from people, which certainly fits with my desire to fade away into the woods when things in my life get tough. I’m sure a therapist would point out that my fixation on getting everything in a video game to go exactly my way stands in contrast to the helplessness of the current administration’s <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/01/trump-transgender-executive-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacks on trans people</a> like me. This is all one big exercise in sublimation and avoidance, though at least it’s one aimed at a video game I really like instead of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-play-games-sober-1839509936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more destructive directions</a> I used to favor.</p><p>But I feel like I’m ruining my favorite game for myself by playing it this way; my approach feels like it’s against both the spirit of the game and the way I most like to play it. I’m making myself a little crazy in a way that I at least had the self-awareness to realize is not entirely about a video game, and I have enough stress in my life to not need to make myself stressed about a video game, of all things, too.&nbsp;</p><p>While I don’t tend to go in on the idea of video games as escapism, I want to hold that it’s OK for me to distract myself from the ongoing onslaught of horrors. But if I’m going to use a game in that way, I want to make sure I’m not just making myself feel worse. I want games to feel fun and joyous, or at least the good kind of stressful. I don’t want my run to be about control and perfection; I want to explore more of <em>The Long Dark</em>’s maps and mess around with mechanics I haven’t engaged with much, to see what happens when I play around in one of my favorite video game worlds. And games need to be just one way I find an outlet for my feelings, instead of hanging them all on the perfect run.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-phoenix-labs-layoffs-studio-closure-far-cry-dauntless"><h3>Another Big Day For Layoffs In Another Big Year For Layoffs</h3></a><p>Ubisoft is closing its third studio in two months, and Phoenix Labs is bidding farewell to "the majority" of its workforce</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/quartz-ai-articles-go-media"><h3>G/O Media Is Publishing AI Slop Again</h3></a><p>News site Quartz is publishing a whole lot of AI-generated articles</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Microsoft’s Phil Spencer has given a new interview and explained that Xbox exclusives are a thing of the past as they no longer make financial sense. <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1883243143342231655">Destin Legarie</a> asked Phil if Starfield, one of 2023’s big Xbox exclusive games would be “staying put” and after a few moments Phil replied with a firm “No.”</p>
<p>“There’s no specific game… this kinda goes back to my red line answer, there’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place, where it would find players, where we would have business success for us.” He then adds “To keep games off other platforms, that’s not a path for us.”</p>


<p>The statements come almost exactly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/">a year after Microsoft’s presentation i</a>n which they announced the first four games that would be coming to PlayStation and Nintendo, during which they specifically stated Starfield was not coming to other consoles, so a lot has changed in the last year.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/"> Rumours suggest</a> Flight Simulator, Hellblade 2, and the Halo Collection will be coming to PlayStation sometime this year.</p>
<p>Two reliable sources – NateTheHate and Windows Central’s Jez Corden – have been posting about the games in question.</p>
<p>“So, games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025 beyond the obvious include Flight Simulator, which will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/07/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>&nbsp;will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” states Nate on his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">podcast.</a></p>
<p>Jez has confirmed he had also heard about Flight Simulator and Halo, and<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo">&nbsp;adds</a>&nbsp;“I’ve heard that also Hellblade 2, Age of Mythology, and potentially Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition are all also slated for PlayStation 5 this year, although I’m unsure if that includes the Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>

			<p>Today, CCP Games shared their 2025 roadmap for the space MMO EVE Online during a Directors' stream. During this stream, it was announced that there will be two major expansions released, as well as the return of a fan-favorite in-game event, such as the EVE Fanfest 2025. This particular event will take place on May 1-3 at Reykjavik's Harpa Concert Hall. For those who want to watch the Directors' Stream from today, it is available to watch on the official CCP Games <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ccp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ccpgames" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> YouTube</a> Channel.</p>

<p>Diving into the roadmap for EVE Online,<a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-receives-revenant-expansion-bringing-new-ships-dens-and-more-customizations/"> the Revenant storyline</a> will continue to play out across Q1 as the tensions continue to rise between the Deathless and the Drifters. This will then carry players over to the next expansion for EVE Online, which is set to release in Summer 2025, with a focus on empowering the players, offering new enhanced tools for customization and content creation.</p>
<p>"This year, we're putting even more power in the hands of our capsuleers," said Snorri Arnason, Game Director for EVE Online. "From customizing sovereign space to crafting missions that spark new alliances, the 2025 roadmap is all about letting players create and shape their own moments, their own stories, and ultimately being part of the history books of New Eden itself."</p>
<p>Aside from the summer expansion, as mentioned earlier, fan-favorite events will be making a return to EVE Online. This includes events such as Capsuleer Day, Crimson Harvest, and Winter Nexus. The second expansion for EVE Online is set to release in the Winter of 2025. There haven't been many details about this expansion yet, as more details for the Summer expansion will be yet to come.</p>
<p>For those interested, tickets for EVE Fanfest 2025 are on sale but are nearly sold out. Those who want to attend can purchase tickets from <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/eve-fanfest-2025-tickets-716031949837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eventbrite</a>, with the price starting at $35. However, for those who want the full experience of Fanfest, the Festival Pass will cost you $295, which includes access to the party at the Top of the World, exclusive in-game content, an EVE Fanfest 2025 t-shirt, and a goodie bag.</p>
<p>"2025 will be monumental for EVE Online. We've listened to player feedback to refine our development process and create high-quality expansions that empower capsuleers. Join us in New Eden to experience a year filled with characters to meet, alliances to forge - or break - and thrilling stories to uncover. It's a year you don't want to miss!" says Bergur Finnbogason, EVE Online's Creative Director.</p>
