			<p><strong>Season 2</strong> of <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> is finally live after an unexpected month-long delay, something that, according to <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-delay-should-remain-isolated-case/">won't happen again</a>. The new season went live with the introduction of the new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map, several new weapons, and the introduction of a new limited-time mode featuring a new gameplay mechanic, <strong>VL-7</strong> hallucinogenic gas.</p>



<p>The new season's arrival has driven the game's highest concurrent player count on Steam so far in February 2026, with the game currently sitting at <strong><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#1m">90,265 players</a></strong> at the time of this writing. If the concurrent count is able to break <strong>100K</strong>, it'll be the first time that's happened for the game in over a month, since the last time it reached above 100K was back on <strong>January 11, 2026.</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you want an overview of everything coming in Season 2, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/">check out my full breakdown of the new content in the pipeline here</a>. I also got the chance to spend a couple of hours with some of the new content at a press preview event last week ahead of launch, and you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/">read my impressions of what I played here</a>.</p>



<p>While the introduction of a new map, the new VL-7 Strike limited-time mode, new weapons and vehicles are all welcome additions, as I noted in my preview, what will likely be more welcome by players are the changes to progression pacing with regard to how quickly players can move through the battle pass. </p>



<p>Part of why so many players dropped off from the game after the launch of Season 1 and REDSEC, besides the slow pace at which new content was delivered, was how much of a slog it felt to try and work through the battle pass. Hopefully, these changes (which you can see in the notes below) are able to make working through the rewards for this season more engaging than they were for Season 1.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re midway through another week and grinding hard for that weekend. Today? We start as we always do, with an NYT Connections puzzle. If you’ve just woken up or are halfway through your day and hitting today’s challenge, be sure to scroll down and check out today’s NYT Connections hints and answers.</p>



<p>I’ve got the best NYT Connections solutions you’re looking for today.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-18">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 18)</h2>

<li>FEATHER</li>

<li>TEASE</li>



<li>BANTAM</li>



<li>TOPICAL</li>



<li>CURL</li>



<li>SOUR</li>



<li>WICKED</li>



<li>LEGHORN</li>



<li>SHAVING</li>



<li>CRIMP</li>



<li>FREE-RANGE</li>



<li>RAD</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Words you might associate with hair design</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Words you might have used to describe something cool back in the day</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Words you might use to label a chicken</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words associated with cream of all kinds</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 18:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>It's tennis, again, but with a Fever Racket gimmick that gives the whole thing a fun party twist. With a 38-character roster — the biggest in series history to date, no less — and 30 different rackets to try out, there's an impressive amount of variety on display here, and we can see it cropping up at its fair share of game nights down the line.</p>
<p>At least, that's what the wonderful PJ O'Reilly thought. "The adventure mode is a letdown, and solo players don't have a ton of options," he wrote in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">our review</a>, "but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come".</p><div><figure data-videoid="R703wKSF5X4" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytR703wKSF5X4" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8b0932jngkmq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>We'd wager that a fair few of you lovely lot have been getting to grips with Mario Tennis Fever over the past few days, so we thought it only fair to throw this review open to a doubles match and let you have your say about the game, too.</p>
<p>You can share your Fever review score by filling out the poll below. And don't worry if you're mid-rally and not set on a definitive ranking at the moment, you can leave a score now and then come back to change it down the line, if you'd like!</p>

        <p>ARE YOU READY TO GET HYPER in a few months/years</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-scape">Hyper Scape</a>? I acknowledge that this might come across as a tad mean, but in this ridiculously fast-paced world we find in, it can genuinely be hard to remember one failed live service game from the next. For a refresher, this was Ubisoft's attempt at a battle royale game back in 2020, though it didn't pan out as it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-battle-royale-hyper-scape-will-shut-down-this-april">shut down only a couple of years later</a>. Well, anyway, it's back! Sort of, not quite, but it might soon, or actually probably eventually, will be thanks to the efforts of a group of people hoping to revive it.
</p>
<p>
Over on Zitter, a user by the name of Fiirce shared a clip playing a very sparsely populated version of the games (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-battle-royale-shooter-hyper-scape-gets-fan-revival-project">Eurogamer</a>). The post refers to it as Hyper Scape Revival, though I'm not sure if that'll be the official name of this rebirth. For now, the game is only currently playable singleplayer, and it'll apparently be a while before a multiplayer version is available, with the post noting it could take months or even years. Sorry to say that if you've got any interest in playing it, you'll have to hold out, as it's just being tested privately right now.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hyperscape Revival.<br>Game feels exactly as I left it (perfect).<br>Singleplayer works for now, will be awhile before anything multiplayer works (could be months or even years). Early alpha/private for now.<br>Reach out to me if you have reverse engineering experience and want to help. <a href="https://t.co/EnzhADUTfW">pic.twitter.com/EnzhADUTfW</a></p>— Fiirce (@fiirce) <a href="https://twitter.com/fiirce/status/2023452799439434111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
I never played a lick of Hyper Scape myself, primarily because I'm not a shooter guy, but also because aesthetically I found it to be quite dull (and honestly likely a notable factor as to why it didn't really take off). That isn't to say it didn't put an interesting spin on the genre, instead of the classic enclosing circle, different sections of the map would disappear, which certainly makes for some big changes in terms of the spatial experience of it all.
</p>
<p>
I'm also just always enthused by the reclamation of a game like this. Whether Ubisoft will do anything or not is obviously up in the air, but I reckon they're a bit too busy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">trying to lay off a bunch of staff</a> (and dealing with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">massive strike</a>).

<p>The Highguard website is experiencing issues and is currently unavailable. </p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment’s latest shooter, Highguard, has not been experiencing the smoothest launch, with player counts dwindling as the days go by. The developers recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a>, with “most of the team” affected. Now the website has been affected as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-website-unavailable">Highguard Website Unavailable </h2>



<p>At the time of writing, if you head over to the Highguard <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/2023814755904090520" rel="nofollow">Wario64</a> on Twitter), you will see that the site is down and has been for some time. The error pop-up states “SITE UNAVAILABLE. This site is currently unavailable. Please contact <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5e2d2b2e2e312c2a1e3d313a3b2a36372c2a272a2931703d3133">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> for assistance.” No other information was revealed, and the developers have not provided any clarity yet. </p>



<p>Highguard developers recently released a big update for the title, in the hopes of bringing more players to the game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-episode-2-adds-ranked-mode-new-heroes-and-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Episode 2 </a>features new heroes, a ranked 3v3 competitive playlist where players can climb through 7 ranks, a new map, and additional quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes. However, this addition has not helped bring up the concurrent numbers.</p>



<p>Several factors could have led to Highguard’s failure, including the Game Awards 2025 finale moment, the social media blackout, and more. Interested readers can check out a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-failed-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full guide</a> on it here. </p>







<p>In other news, a tech artist who worked on Highguard has reflected on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/laid-off-highguard-tech-artist-reflects-on-games-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the highs and lows of the game’s development and launch</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-5v5-raid-mode-added-permanently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5v5 Raid Mode</a> has been made permanent.

Once a peaceful place, Slumberland has been besieged by the mysterious Oblivion, which threatens to destroy this precious world and its inhabitants. It is now up to you to push back and stop the Oblivion from spreading, consuming Slumberland and anything within it as it grows.</p><p>While Nemo is sound asleep, you’ll be able to explore the many domains that make up Slumberland, each with its unique characteristics, inhabitants, and collectibles to discover. As you progress, you’ll also meet a unique cast of characters ready to guide you through the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,893 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and work together to prevent Slumberland’s destruction! But beware: this cute dream world is not as safe as it once was.

As you explore Slumberland, you’ll find Nemo’s favorite Toys, each of which will grant you a new ability to help you avoid hazards, defeat enemies, and even find new pathways through Slumberland! Make sure to keep an eye out for Nemo’s Pajamas, Little Buddies, and other collectibles, which will make your journey through Slumberland a little more fun!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Primarily developed by DIE SOFT founder Dave Mauro, <em>Little Nemo and the Guardians of Slumberland</em> draws heavily from its <a title="Platforms > NES [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/nes">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>-era ancestors. The game’s revamped gameplay is designed with approachability and accessibility in mind, but can also scale up to appeal to more experienced Metroidvania veterans. Commenting on the game approaching its release date, Dave said: “It’s been so exciting to work with a character and setting I’ve always been a bit obsessed with, and I can’t wait for players to finally get to see what I’ve been working on all these years”.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>A lush, hand-animated world, composed of many distinct thematic domains, all seamlessly connected.</li><li>Defeat challenging bosses, discover collectibles, and unlock new abilities to progress.</li><li>An original soundtrack composed entirely by Peter Berkman of Anamanaguchi.</li><li>Tight and responsive controls for retro-inspired platforming <a title="Genres > Action [3,413 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</li><li>Designed with approachable and accessible baseline experience, that can be ranked up for more skilled players.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PC Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Little Nemo - PC Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FvCqVL0BOCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/little-nemo-and-the-guardians-of-slumberland-launches-march-31-for-pc-later-in-2026-for-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[World of Warcraft Is by Far the Most Played Game of Old-School FPS Guru John Romero: “I Lived in That Game for 5 Years”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-most-played-game-john-romero/</link>
            <guid>1438531</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Here's something we weren't really expecting to read: <strong>John Romero</strong>, the man behind some of the greatest old-school first-person shooter games (<strong>Wolfenstein 3D</strong>, <strong>Doom</strong>, <strong>Quake</strong>), revealed that his most-played game of all time is <strong>Blizzard's World of Warcraft</strong>. That's about <strong>as far from the games he's most renowned for as you could imagine</strong>, being an MMORPG with stylized visuals and tab-targeting combat. And yet, Romero himself <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/doom-co-creator-john-romero-adores-ghost-recon-and-has-over-3-000-hours-in-world-of-warcraft-god-i-lived-in-that-game-every-day-for-five-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told PC Gamer</a> that <strong>he lived in Azeroth for five years</strong>:</p>



<p><em>It's World of Warcraft. I have probably 3,000-plus hours in WoW. God, I lived in that game every day for five years. Six hours usually, every day. And then weekends were as long as I could stay awake. I was making an MMO at the time, and studying that game was really important to me as far as "Why do I want to do this? Why am I putting up with this? What are you thinking about second to second while you're doing this?"</em></p>



<p><em>I was in a raiding guild. You name it, I did so much stuff. I have five main characters with all the gear of different classes. And I had 10 characters total. When you start a new character, you're starting the game from the beginning, but I knew how to optimise burning through. I could get to level six in half an hour.</em></p>



<p><em>It's always important to look at those successful games and the systems that are in them as a battle-tested system. The way that they implemented this has been played by millions of people, and they have kept it for years. It works. That's really important for design to just look at those examples. Not that you would directly copy anything, but that you understand why it was done that way and how it works.</em></p>



<p>The MMORPG John Romero mentioned working on was never revealed, though it was likely during his time at <strong>Slipgate Ironworks</strong>, between <strong>2005</strong> and late <strong>2010</strong>, which fits the five-year timeline and also coincides with <strong>World of Warcraft's heyday</strong>. We only know it was based on an original IP. The game designer is also credited with a Special Thanks for the free-to-play MMO <strong>Marvel Super Hero Squad Online</strong>, which was launched in 2011 by Gazillion Entertainment. </p>



<p>Romero recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-romero-talking-companies-finish-game-funded-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>he's talking with other companies to continue developing his next game</strong> after <strong>Microsoft pulled out as a funder</strong>. He then <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-have-never-played-a-game-like-this-before-doom-creator-john-romero-compares-next-game-to-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that it's a very unique game that will be innovative in a similar way to what <strong>FromSoftware's Elden Ring</strong> did for open world games.</p>



<p>As for World of Warcraft, Blizzard recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the roadmap toward the launch of the game's eleventh expansion pack, <strong>Midnight</strong>.</p>

              <p>Clickout Media is a group that buys up gaming sites and then forces them to host endless unmarked advertorial content for gambling sites and casinos. Now the owner of <em>The Escapist</em>, <em>Adventure Gamers</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Esports Insider&nbsp;</em>is, according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clickout-media-owner-of-the-escapist-pivots-to-ai-holds-mass-layoffs/">reporting by&nbsp;<em>Insider Gaming</em></a>, going to “pivot to AI,” and of course that means firing swathes of staff and demolishing the remains of all the sites it’s ruined.</p> <p>“Sad to say that my role at <em>The Escapist</em> is up for redundancy,” wrote that site’s&nbsp;contributing editor Lloyd Coombes on BlueSky. On LinkedIn he added, “<span><span dir="ltr">that means a lot of things that I’m still not quite getting my head around.” Coombes is just one of many people who are losing their jobs as a result of ClickOut’s ridiculous folly. <em>Insider Gaming</em> reports, “It was said that Clickout Media will be maintaining a skeleton crew of ‘AI Editors.'”</span></span></p>   <p>“That’s me and my team gone from&nbsp;<em>VideoGamer</em>,” says Cat Bussell. “Very sad day. I’ll probably do a bigger post on this later on down the line. Still reeling.”</p>   <p>It seems that all these sites might be completely wiped out with so many job losses, all to be replaced by the illusion of AI.</p>

 <p>ClickOut is a peculiarly shy company, describing itself as a “PR and marketing agency” despite its acquisition of gaming sites, and focus on crypto and web 3. It’s so shy, in fact, that it keeps its company’s name off the sites it buys, and goes out of its way to hide its ownership, as we discovered last year when the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/adventure-gamers-forums-gambling-ads-jack-allin-1851784764">bought the beloved&nbsp;<em>Adventure Gamers</em></a> and reduced it to shilling for online casinos. The site is almost abandoned now, after 27 years of passionate adventure gaming coverage, with the last couple of stories from mid-2025 sitting ghost-like at the top above “reviews” of online slot machines.</p> <p>The same is true on&nbsp;<em>The Escapist</em>, a site that’s been through many iterations from its highbrow beginnings as an online magazine, through its grim pro-GamerGate era, to its most recent form as a solid, well-written gaming news site from people who genuinely care. The staff has demonstrated a special knack for covering lesser-known games among the big hitters, albeit one that is constantly undermined by the enforced inclusion of “guides” for online gambling that all read suspiciously like a robot might have helped. The same is true all over again on <em>Esports Insider</em>, which continues to put out solid journalism about the esports world, in between wildly incongruous articles about stock prices of betting firms. And then there’s the esteemed <em>VideoGamer</em>, which has battled on despite being plagued with casino ad shite.</p>

 <p>It’s not just gaming sites to which ClickOut commits this vandalism.&nbsp;<em>ReadWriteWeb</em> was once a web tech site, launched in 2003 and well-respected, but now it’s just a site pushing sports betting, casinos and poker. It also spent last year <a href="https://pokerindustrypro.com/news/article/222041-cardplayer-pokerscout-pokerstrategy-clickout-finixio">buying many, many poker sites</a>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.igbaffiliate.com/en/articles/mergers-and-acquisitions/clickout-media-buys-gambling-insider-for-up-to-14-million/"><em>Gambling Insider</em></a>.</p>

 <p>We’re not able to confirm how many people have lost their jobs today, because as&nbsp;<em>Insider Gaming</em> reports, those affected have been required to sign NDAs in order to ensure they receive their severance. We’ve reached out to ClickOut, but based on previous experience, their shyness seems to prevent them from replying to emails, too.</p> <p>We wish all the best to everyone affected, in a continuingly grim era for games journalists.</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[We Should Use Social Media The Same Way Manga Authors Write About Their Week]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/weekly-shonen-jump-author-comments-social-media-sucks/</link>
            <guid>1438519</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I’ve long believed that <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitter-elon-musk-grok-antisemitic-mechahitler/"><u>social media is a suck</u></a>, and if I didn’t have to use it for my job, I wouldn’t. If it isn’t showing you long paragraphs of hot garbage cosplaying as Socrates from folks who should know better than to put screenshots of discourse on your timeline, <a href="https://aftermath.site/social-media-tiktok-instagram-notifications/"><u>it’s some other bullshit</u></a>. But what doesn’t suck—and honestly feels downright aspirational—is mangaka author comments, which should be the blueprint for how to use social media.</p><p>Back in the day, when Borders bookstores were still around, you could flip to the inside cover of a manga volume and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/15syrck/those_cute_little_notes_that_manga_authors_do_at/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>read an anecdotal paragraph from creators</u></a>, like<a href="https://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/akira-toriyama-tankobon-introductions/?ref=aftermath.site"><u> <em>Dragon Ball</em>’s Akira Toriyama</u></a> writing about spoiling his kids and trying not to get bored making manga. While you can still read lengthier ramblings today, like<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChainsawMan/comments/12r1ira/tatsuki_fujimotos_author_comment_from_his_second/?ref=aftermath.site"><u> <em>Chainsaw Man</em> creator Tatsuki Fujimoto</u></a> recollecting how he ate his girlfriend’s pet fish instead of telling her he killed it, you can also read what a collective of mangaka has to say about their weeks like a curated, pseudo social media feed.&nbsp;</p><p>In the modern digital age, authors’ comments are still going strong, preserved online in blog posts where Weekly Shonen Jump’s rotating roster of creators drop diary entries with the same energy as NBA players in a post‑game interview—hands on their hips while on the court, still catching their breath, saying whatever stray thought about their week pops into their heads. Shonen Jump’s author comments, stylized as <a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/tagged/1806/author-comments?ref=aftermath.site"><u>mangaka musings</u></a>, are exactly that: a collection of off‑the‑cuff messages from creators published in Weekly Shonen Jump, giving fans a quick peek into their day‑to‑day lives.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Valid. </span><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-07-21-2024?ref=aftermath.site"><span>(Shonen Jump)</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes, author comments are about the chapter they slaved away on in the meat grinder that is weekly manga production, <a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-08-04-2024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>congratulating a creator for finishing their series</u></a>, or sharing updates about a live-action or anime adaptation. But more often than not, it’s just them posting about random occurrences in their lives and their thoughts about them. Those thoughts can range from <em>One Piece</em> creator Eiichiro Oda praising a <a href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon/"><u>very bad variety show</u></a> as “<a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-10-26-2025?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the pinnacle of human achievement</u></a>,” <em>Sakamoto Days</em>’<em> </em>creator updating readers on <a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-11-30-2025?ref=aftermath.site"><u>his progress in <em>Nightreign</em></u></a>, everyone’s obsession with butter caramel Pringles, or the emotional arcs of their procurement and piecemeal <a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/web_pages/2038/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>consumption of choco eggs</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The beauty of the grab-bag randomness of mangaka musings is that they’re oh so brief. They’re unfiltered, shower thoughts-level of relatable, and they paint enough of a picture that you feel better having taken the time to read them. Here are a handful of authors’ comments I like that would go triple platinum as social media posts:</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-11-03-2025?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>(Image: Shonen Jump)</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-11-09-2025?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-02-01-2026?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-09-21-2025?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-09-07-2025?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-07-27-2025?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-12-08-2024?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-12-01-2024?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-09-08-2024?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-09-08-2024?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, a lot of these comments read like exasperated asides blurted out because they had to write something on top of drawing 21 pages of their ongoing manga for reader enjoyment. But it's that exact “I’m not gonna hold you” brevity that makes them worth checking out every week. Sometimes it’s just nice to see what someone found worth mentioning, no matter how superfluous it is.</p><p>Manga author notes should be the aspiration for how we use social media, because the smallest, most offhand thing is more human than any algorithm-optimized screed rewarding ragebaiting, forced discourse, and low-effort engagement farming sludge we doomscroll past on the daily. So next time you’re about to full-send a post, think to yourself: Do I sound like a manga author comment? If not, delete that shit expeditiously.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I think that with a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a>, you'd be well within your right to have an eyebrow pre-raised considering its online, sort of free-to-play (depending on where you live) predecessor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a> regarding the like of microtransactions. I know I certainly have! At a glance Crimson Desert certainly looks like it could fall into similar pitfalls if only based on vibes alone. However! Developer Pearl Abyss would quite like you to know that, in that regard at least, you have nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">Dropped Frames show</a> (ta, <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217">Okami13_</a>), marketing director at Pearly Abyss America Will Powers explained, "I can say that definitively: there is not a cosmetic cash shop. This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and you enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions. It’s a monetisation model. If you do free-to-play then you need to make up the revenue in a different way. This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Full stop."
</p>
<p>
This is, admittedly, an annoying thing to have to be thankful for. I sure would like it if games weren't designed to exploit the most exploitable of us! Still, it's something, even if this doesn't totally rule out other bits of, admittedly still annoying but slightly less so, DLC, expansions and the like.
</p>
<p>
Last month, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game got a bit more of a lengthier look-in which quite honestly befuddled me at points. It's obviously very much a medieval fantasy setting, but it's just so realistic looking that the flashy particle effects, literal mechs, and just straight up dragons feel like they don't contrast as well as they potentially might in a more stylised setting. Ah well, at least you only have to pay for it all once!

              <p><span>According to Rémi Verschelde, project manager of Godot Engine and co-founder of the platform’s financial backer W4 Games, the never-ending wave of “AI slop” pull requests on Godot’s GitHub is becoming “increasingly draining and demoralizing” for its maintainers, to the point that over 4,600 pull requests are currently open on the engine’s GitHub page.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/godot-co-founder-says-ai-slop-pull-requests-have-become-overwhelming"><i><span>Game Developer</span></i></a><span>, Verschelde’s comment on Bluesky was made in response to a post by Adriaan de Jongh, the developer and publisher of the 2017 indie puzzle hit </span><i><span>Hidden Folks</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adriaan.games/post/3mexoxyaui22x"><span>which stated</span></a><span> that Godot’s GitHub has been overrun with countless undisclosed AI-generated pull requests. “Changes often make no sense, descriptions are extremely verbose, users don’t understand their own changes…It’s a total shitshow.”</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz/app.bsky.feed.post/3meyerixvhs2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifnwjboai3ml34oyyl7f2o3d7dtktxqmqrbt5hepzzs4xebfw2qea"> <p lang="en">Honestly, AI slop PRs are becoming increasingly draining and demoralizing for #Godot maintainers.</p> <p>If you want to help, more funding so we can pay more maintainers to deal with the slop (on top of everything we do already) is the only viable solution I can think of:</p> <p>fund.godotengine.org</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz?ref_src=embed">Rémi Verschelde (@akien.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz/post/3meyerixvhs2p?ref_src=embed">2026-02-16T15:33:57.699Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akien.bsky.social/post/3meyerixvhs2p"><span>In reply</span></a><span>, Verschelde noted that the problem has become such an issue that Godot’s GitHub maintainers are being forced to “second guess every [pull request] from new contributors, multiple times per day.” Although he stated that Godot prides itself on “being welcoming to new contributors,” Verschelde also doesn’t see a way out of the situation, beyond further donations to help pay more maintainers. “Maintainers spend a lot of time assisting new contributors to help them get PRs in a mergeable state. I don’t know how long we can keep it up.”</span></p>

 <p><span>A cursory glance at the </span><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"><span>closed pull requests</span></a><span> on Godot’s GitHub page proves that this isn’t an exaggeration, as dozens of pull requests have been denied or reported as spam by Godot’s maintainers within the past month alone, with comments left by maintainers pointing out AI-written code appearing on a daily basis. Godot has been used to ship a bunch of hit indie games over the last few years like <em>Brotato</em> and <em>Until Then</em> and is a valuable alternative to proprietary game engines like Unity, which have been <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-promises-deluge-of-new-games-prompted-into-existence-by-ai-as-its-stock-tanks-2000669483">rolling out their own genAI tools</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While Verschelde stated that paying more maintainers would be the simplest option, he also stated that Godot may have to raise “the barrier to entry” for its contributors instead. When quizzed about the possibility of automating the process, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akien.bsky.social/post/3meyf4t77ds2p"><span>he replied</span></a><span> that it “seems horribly ironic to have to run an AI on our CI to detect AI slop.” </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chetsucks.com/post/3mextjgn2g22i"><span>Chet Faliszek</span></a><span>, writer for several Valve titles including </span><i><span>Left 4 Dead</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Portal 2</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Half-Life 2: Episode One</span></i><span>, believes that the onus to fix the system should be on GitHub instead. “Really is just exhausting to watch all this playout and github promoting this, not fighting it.”</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-star-wars-trailer-martin-scorsese-clone-wars-embo-2000669728</link>
            <guid>1438489</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Disney and Lucasfilm released the latest trailer for <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>, the first new <em>Star Wars</em> movie since <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> hit theaters back in 2019, and it includes everything I want from a movie set in this famous galaxy: eierd aliens, sci-fi action, deep cut references, and a voice cameo from famed director Martin Scorsese.</p> <p>The upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> flick stars Pedro Pascal as fan-favorite bounty hunter Din Djarin alongside his faithful little buddy Grogu, aka Baby Yoda. Set after the events of the original trilogy and the <em>Mandalorian</em> TV series, this new movie, which hits theaters on May 22, is set to tie up plot threads involving the remnants of the Empire trying to destroy the New Republic. It will also likely provide more answers about Grogu, a member of Yoda’s species. Here’s the trailer:</p>

   <p>And yes, that shopkeeper alien we see at the start who gets spooked when asked to provide information about a Hutt is voiced by the one and only Martin Scorsese, the director behind films like <em>Goodfellas</em> and <em>The Wolf of Wall Street.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/martin-scorsese-joinins-star-wars-universe/">Disney confirmed as much with <em>Polygon</em></a>. I can’t wait to see how angry online commenters who can’t stop yelling about the famous director’s MCU comments will react to him appearing in what looks to be a big, dumb, super-expensive <em>Star Wars</em> summer blockbuster.</p> <p>As for the rest of the trailer, I’m super into all the weird, goofy aliens and monsters that appear in it. The fact that a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mantellian_Savrip">Mantellian Savrip</a> shows up at the very end of the trailer as the big monster alien Mando and Grogu fight in the city made me giggle a little, I have to admit. This is an alien that first appeared as one of the holochess pieces in the very first <em>Star Wars</em> movie. Cool to see it here in the flesh. <a href="https://x.com/sw_holocron/status/2023761695026577621">Meanwhile, seeing Embo</a>, a bounty hunter from the<em> Clone Wars</em> animated series, pop up was fun, as was seeing Zeb from <em>Rebels</em> show up again after first appearing in live action back in the original <em>Mando</em> show on Disney+.</p>

 <p>Will all these silly cameos and references be enough in and of themselves to make<em> Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> a good movie? Nope. But at least this thing seems like a big movie, and I’m happy about that. <em>Star Wars</em> belongs in theaters, even when it’s bad, and I’m happy that after a few years away, we are finally getting a new cinematic <em>Star Wars</em> adventure. Let’s just hope it’s halfway decent when it arrives in May.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem’s game length could stop you from buying the game—don’t lie, it’s because you’re too scared. If you are legitimately concerned about how long Capcom’s latest entry is, this guide should provide clarity.</p>



<p>Previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> games have always had a decent length to them, with some being way longer than others. The RE speedruns are legendary, with players mopping up the main story in one brief sitting. If this is putting you off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, let’s take a look at what you can expect.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-resident-evil-requiem">How Many Hours To Beat Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Say Grace. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There have been conflicting reports about Resident Evil Requiem’s game length, but based on sources, you should expect around 10-16 hours of main-game content, with completionist save files expected to clock in around 30-40 hours.</strong></p>



<p>Reports have been circling about the game’s length, but truth be told, no one has an <em>exact </em>bearing on Requiem’s game length yet.</p>



<p>Three voices have managed to give a ballpark region for the game’s runtime: The director, the producer, and long-time leaker Dusk Golem.</p>



<p>Initially, it was suggested by the game’s producer that Requiem would be comparable to Resident Evil 4 in terms of game length. Everyone’s mileage varies, but the fourth main game is up there with one of the longest runtimes for main content. It’s amazing how much extra time is added for having crazy chainsaw people cut Leon’s head off.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-explains-leons-ruthless-anger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Director Talks Leon’s ‘Ruthless Anger’</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This gave everyone hope that Resident Evil 9 would also be a meaty adventure. Since then, the game’s director has come out and said the horror title’s length is hard to gauge. Finally, Dusk Golem—who provided details on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-embargo-date/" id="177337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem’s review embargo date</a>—gave information on what they knew:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve heard myself it’s longer than Village, but a bit shorter than RE:4.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Village’s game length (particularly for a first-time playthrough) is around the 10-hour mark. So, even if Requiem finds a healthy middle ground, the first playthrough should be around 12-14 hours, with a wider margin of 10-16 hours capturing everything—not too shabby.</p>



<p>Obviously, the details are more hit and miss than the original Resident Evil’s dialogue. The expected game length mark shouldn’t be too far short if it is.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/3)-The producer claims the game is "roughly" the length of RE:4, though the director stepped in to say that estimating game time is hard, so to just expect a "Resident Evil" amount of content.<br>-Separately, I've heard myself it's longer than Village, but a bit shorter than RE:4</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2020691307052859637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-does-resident-evil-9-compare-to-other-resident-evil-games">How Does Resident Evil 9 Compare To Other Resident Evil Games?</h2>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem’s game length sounds like it’s more in keeping with recent Resident Evil games, rather than the earlier entries, which were very short in comparison.</strong></p>



<p>You get indie horror games nowadays that are longer than the original Resident Evil trilogy entries! Resi 4 really advanced the series and gave players a long and winding adventure. It’s been fairly consistent ever since.</p>

</ul>



<p>According to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HowLongToBeat</a> (which aggregates playthrough from hundreds and thousands of players), here’s the average playtime for every mainline Resident Evil game—and we’re using the remakes where applicable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is bringing plenty of changes to the popular Universe Mode.</p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/universe-and-community-creations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> feature on WWE 2K26 showcased the wide variety of changes coming to Universe Mode. The name of the game is control in WWE 2K26, and this year’s Universe Mode provides even more options for players to meticulously manipulate the in-game sandbox while also allowing for set-it-and-forget-it options for those who just want to kick back and watch a simulated Universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-re-a-wizard-wwe">You’re a Wizard, WWE</h2>



<p>This year’s WWE Universe Mode features a new Universe Wizard that lets players choose which weekly shows and PLEs to feature, assign Superstars to each show and their champions, and set the calendar start month. Players can choose an existing show, such as WWE Monday Night Raw. However, they can also either import a show they downloaded or start from scratch with a brand-new creation.</p>



<p>Players can edit details for default shows like Raw and SmackDown, including rosters, championships, and divisions. Each show supports up to eight titles across men’s and women’s divisions, including tag team and intergender titles, plus two Money in the Bank briefcases.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-more-customization-options-in-universe-mode-for-wwe-2k26">More Customization Options in Universe Mode for WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 expands Universe mode with new match setup options, including enhanced settings and sliders. Players can now adjust matchmaking sliders to fine-tune match card sorting, scoring, and bonuses for title matches, rivalries, and match types. </p>



<p>For those who want to start from scratch, there are settings to remove all default rivalry options and start with a blank canvas.</p>











<p>Promo options are also updated. This year, players have even more control over the outcome of Universe Mode promos. When challenging a rival to a match, the challenger can now directly select the match stipulations. Players can take the direction of their promos in new avenues, including babyface and heel turns.</p>



<p>There are also customization options for wrestlers’ attire for weekly shows, pay-per-view events, and WrestleMania. Once again, allowing even more customization options.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/valves-steam-deck-intermittently-out-of-stock-as-ram-shortage-drags-on/</link>
            <guid>1438474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Earlier this month, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/ram-shortage-delays-valves-steam-machine-desktop-and-steam-frame-headset/">announced</a> it was delaying the release of its new Steam Machine desktop and Steam Frame VR headset due to memory and storage shortages that have been cascading across the PC industry since late 2025. But those shortages are also coming for products that have already launched.</p>
<p>Valve had added a note to its Steam Deck page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">noting</a> that the device would be “out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.” None of Valve’s three listed Steam Deck configurations are currently available to buy, nor are any of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished">certified refurbished Steam Deck configurations</a> that Valve sometimes offers.</p>
<p>Valve hasn’t announced any price increases for the Deck, at least not yet—the 512GB OLED model is still listed at $549 and the 1TB version at $649. But the basic 256GB LCD model has been formally discontinued now that it has sold out, increasing the Deck’s de facto starting price from $399 to $549. Valve <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/344310/valve-discontinues-steam-deck-lcd-oled-versions-remain#g344310-2">announced in December</a> that it was ending production on the LCD version of the Deck and that it wouldn’t be restocked once it sold out.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck’s hardware is four years old this month, and faster hardware with better chips and higher-resolution screens have been released in the years since. But those Ryzen Z1 and Z2 chips aren’t always dramatically faster than the Deck’s semi-custom AMD chip; many of those handhelds are also considerably more expensive than the OLED Deck’s $549 starting price. When it’s in stock, the Deck still offers compelling performance and specs for the price.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/</link>
            <guid>1438459</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie's</strong> upcoming first-person extraction shooter, <strong>Marathon</strong>, is out on PS5 and PC in a little more than two weeks' time from the time of this writing. Despite it having a rough road to launch, now that we're so close to it, the game looks more impressive than ever, and its new 'Death Awaits' trailer ahead of its <strong>open preview server slam test</strong> next weekend is the latest example of just how solid it looks.</p>



<p>The server slam test will give Bungie the chance to let the servers get pushed to their limit right ahead of launch, as the test will take place from <strong>February 26 to March 2</strong>. Marathon arrives on PC and PS5 three days later, on <strong>March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Looking back on Marathon's journey, how it looks is not the only impressive thing about it; it's also impressive to see the buzz around the game. It was always going to have an uphill battle, coming in as the game that had to shoulder Bungie's future hopes while its marquee franchise, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-revenue-way-below-projections-layoffs-playstation-restructuring/">Destiny</a></strong>, continued to flounder.  </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DEATH AWAITS | Marathon Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Marathon lost its <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/">game director amidst a scandal </a>near the beginning of its production. It's suffered through <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/">more than one round of layoffs at Bungie</a>. It had a massive scandal regarding the game's whole artistic foundation and aesthetic being <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">ripped from another artist without permission</a>. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed</a>, ad even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">believed to be dead</a> by some of its biggest doubters. </p>



<p>Its closed, NDA-protected beta tests <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-leaked-closed-technical-test-bungie/">kept leaking gameplay like crazy</a>, and the last major public beta test <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-upset-was-to-arc-raiders-benefit-embark-studios/">wasn't as well-received as Bungie would've hoped</a>, even providing a solid sounding board for other games to do better.</p>



<p>Now, though, as we sit days away from launch, even though it's still far too early to say Marathon has the ability to 'save Bungie,' it looks clear that this won't be a flop. Marathon has the chance to start off strong and grow into another strong title in Bungie's portfolio.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 76’s Next Cryptid is Bigfoot, and He’s Coming March 3rd]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-bigfoot-coming-soon/</link>
            <guid>1438453</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419">Bethesda Game Studios</a> has unveiled the next <strong>cryptid </strong>coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout-76/" id="438">Fallout 76</a>, and it’s none other than the infamous <strong>Bigfoot</strong>. The mythical manbeast will find his way into Appalachia and the world of Fallout 76 from March 3rd, with the arrival of the Backwoods update and an all-new season.</p>



<p>The Fallout 76 cryptid range has expanded over the years to accommodate the likes of the Wendigo, the Grafton Monster, and, of course, Mothman.</p>











<p>In a very short teaser trailer posted on social media, Bethesda Game Studios shared a found footage perspective of someone filming the elusive Bigfoot. The shady, conspiracy-laden character has appeared in all kinds of media, usually as an easter egg in games, but now, he’s coming to Fallout 76, and he’s going to be very real.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Backwoods update is the next major patch to hit Fallout 76, and from what we know, it looks like it’s going to be themed around the great outdoors, hunting, and spotting Bigfoot. The creature will most likely form a new mini-boss character, much like the Sheepsquatch, one of the game’s more ferocious and terrifying cryptids.</p>



<p>Fallout 76 remains immensely popular following the conclusion of the second season of the Fallout television show. Bethesda Game Studios has big things in store for the post-apocalyptic MMORPG, and in the next bout of updates, it will focus on making the base offering much more attractive.</p>
