			<p>Today, Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-march-dragon-age-the-veilguard-sonic-colors-ultimate-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the PS Plus lineup for the month of March, and the highlight is undoubtedly Dragon Age: The Veilguard. BioWare's game launched only four months ago. It is rare that a triple-A game of this importance joins a subscription service like PS Plus (or Xbox Game Pass) this early after the release.</p>
<p>However, as reported in previous coverage, the game didn't sell nearly as well as the publisher had hoped. By the end of 2024, it had sold 1.5 million copies, about half of what Electronic Arts had estimated before launch. That is despite positive critic reviews, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including mine</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPG with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>The underwhelming commercial performance of Dragon Age: The Veilguard definitely played a factor in EA's decision to sign a deal with Sony. BioWare itself was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to some layoffs and other people were reassigned to different studios within EA</a>. As a result, the studio now has less than a hundred employees, though the plan is still to go forward with the new Mass Effect project.</p>
<p>Besides Dragon Age: The Veilguard, PlayStation Plus subscribers will also get the following games in March:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-colors-ultimate-new-sonic-team-game-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> (PlayStation 4)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a> (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5)</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of the games will be available for PS Plus subscribers to download and add to their collection between March 4 and March 31.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dark Deity 2 | Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Dark Deity 2 is a tactical turn-based RPG inspired by games like Fire Emblem. In particular, its combat is very reminiscent of the classic Fire Emblem games on Game Boy, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones/" data-ref-id="5000-21040">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a>. Combat units are scattered across the battlefield, and when they engage in battle with enemies, they're whisked away to a separate screen to duke it out.</p><p>There are a total of 20 playable characters across 45 different branching classes, each with unique abilities, passive effects, and tactical roles. The game also has a large degree of variability, which includes a built-in randomizer and campaign customization options that can shuffle up character recruitment order and difficulty level, as well as experience and gold sliders.</p><p>A demo is available on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446600/Dark_Deity_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Deity 2's Steam page</a>, which lets players experience the game's first four chapters. Neither the developer nor publisher has revealed whether Dark Deity 2 will come other platforms. The first game also received a Switch release, so it's possible that the sequel will too.</p>

            <p>
Tetris Forever, last year's excellent interactive history of the classic block-dropping puzzler, has added two more games plucked from the series' past as part of its "biggest-ever update".
</p>
<p>
Tetris Forever, if you're unfamiliar, follows the format of developer Digital Eclipse's previous (and consistently superb) interactive documentary experiences - Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/llamasoft-the-jeff-minter-story">Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</a>, and The Making of Karateka - combining archive material, new interviews, and playable games into one fascinating whole.
</p>
<p>
At launch, it featured 15 games - ranging from a recreation of the original Tetris on Electronika 60 to Digital Eclipse's new Tetris Time Warp - and additional versions, including Welltris, have been added since then. And now the roster is expanding further, this time adding MS-DOS versions of Spectrum Holobyte's 1991 Super Tetris and 1988's Tetris (AcademySoft) v. 3.12.
</p>

<p>
Super Tetris, Digital Eclipse notes, was an early attempt at creating a Tetris "sequel", requiring players to earn bombs and clear a Matrix already half full at the start. Tetris (AcademySoft) v. 3.12, meanwhile, is the final version of Tetris created within the Soviet Union, and includes a Phantom mode featuring invisible O-Tetriminos.
</p>
<p>
Alongside its two new games, Tetris Forever's latest update brings enhancements to Tetris Time Warp. Its single-player modes now run to Level 30 instead of the previous Level 15, for instance, while multiplayer mode's Time Warp Tetriminos have gained the new Shield power. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, its single-player 1989 Mode now lets players turn off "modern gameplay" for a more historically accurate experience (and its possible to reduce Matrix rows down from 20 to 18), and there's the new 40-Line Challenge, tasking players with clearing 40 lines as quickly as possible. That's on top of a much-expanded Tetris Time Warp options mode, enabling far greater customisation of visuals, sounds, and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there are adjustments to the Electronika 60 version of Tetris to make it "even more historically accurate", and "many other minor tweaks, bug fixes, and enhancements." All this is available now across all platforms as part of Tetris Forever's latest free update.
</p>
<p>
And if you've even a passing interest in the history and legacy of Tetris, Digital Eclipse's Tetris Forever is well worth your time. Christian Donlan called it a "gorgeous documentary compilation" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tetris-forever-review">four star review</a> last year.

<p>Marvel Rivals is very slowly and tentatively moving towards establishing an esports scene, but more and more organizations are already looking to set up shop. A handful of prestigious legacy organizations are in the process of signing rosters, and more could be on the way as bigger Marvel Rivals tournaments spring up.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-esports-organizations-are-in-marvel-rivals">Which Esports Organizations are in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>On February 26, Fnatic became the latest esports organization to <a href="https://x.com/FNATIC/status/1894796444390830146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enter</a> Marvel Rivals, signing a roster to compete in the upcoming EMEA Invitational. The six-person team consists of a handful of former Overwatch pros and a former Fortnite World Cup participant. Fnatic is a globally recognized esports organization, famous for its Swedish CS:GO dynasty and from earning over a half dozen trophies in European League of Legends.</p>



<p>Fnatic are by no means the only prestigious organization to jump right in to Marvel Rivals. OG, the European organization built on winning Dota 2’s The International twice, <a href="https://x.com/OGesports/status/1894792288699580668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> their Marvel Rivals roster hours before Fnatic did. Virtus.pro <a href="https://virtus.pro/en/articles/virtuspro-otkryvayut-sostav-po-marvel-rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed</a> a decorated roster of Overwatch League veterans on February 19. All three of those organizations, alongside Twisted Minds, Team Peps, Luminosity, DUSTY, and the ECSTATIC roster, have been invited to the EMEA Invitational.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Several other organizations are currently considering Marvel Rivals rosters. Sentinels, one of the most globally recognized and successful brands in VALORANT, <a href="https://x.com/robmooreEsports/status/1892336173928108123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> it would participate in Marvel Rivals. CEO Rob Moore said he sees “tremendous potential” in the competitive Marvel Rivals scene, and opened the gates for virtually anyone to try out. Sentinels will in all likelihood compete in North America. 100 Thieves, another prominent organization based in North America, has also <a href="https://x.com/100Thieves/status/1894809669660713006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> its interest. The invites for the North American Invitational have not been sent out yet.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has seemingly achieved sustainable popularity, maintaining a presence at the top of the Steam player charts since the game released. The team at NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has prioritized a “coexisting” between casual and competitive play</a>. Back in January, the game’s director said they are taking a lot of references from games that have thriving casual and competitive player pools.</p>



<p>What organizations do you want to see enter Marvel Rivals next? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>Razer has unveiled the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05297ER3-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-new-razer-blade-18-has-a-unique-dual-mode-display-and-rtx-50-series-gpu%2F1100-6529726%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blade 18 (2025)</a>, its most powerful gaming laptop to date. Like the recently announced Blade 16, the new 18-inch Razer laptop utilizes the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-Series GPUs. Both of Razer's new high-end gaming laptops are available to preorder now and expected to release on April 30. The Blade 18 starts at $3,200, while the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05287EN3-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-new-razer-blade-18-has-a-unique-dual-mode-display-and-rtx-50-series-gpu%2F1100-6529726%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blade 16</a> retails for $2,800 and up.</p><hr><p>Preorders for the Blade 18 come with the Laptop Stand Chroma ($130 value) and the X-Ray Chroma Skin ($65 value). If you preorder the Blade 16, you'll get Razer's USB-C Dock ($120 value) and the X-Ray Chroma Skin ($60 value).</p><p>The Blade 18 has a unique dual-mode display that supports 3840 x 2400 UHD+ resolution with a 240Hz refresh rate. Alternatively, the screen can render images at 1920 x 1200 FHD+ resolution with a blistering 480Hz refresh rate.</p><h2>Razer Blade 18 (2025)</h2><h3>Starting at $3,200</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4450719" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4450719"></a><figcaption>Razer Blade 18 (2025)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg"></figure><p>With the option to customize the Razer Blade 18 with up to an RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, it should be ready to handle anything you throw at it. The RTX 5070 Ti comes standard, while upgrading to the RTX 5080 costs an extra $500 and the RTX 5090 costs $1,300. All GPUs are paired to an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX (5.4GHz) yet the chassis remains slim at just 21.99mm thick. You’ll also get to pick your SSD size, ranging from 1TB to 4TB. The same goes for memory, with options for 32GB or 64GB models.</p><p>Beyond all the power, one of the most intriguing features of the Blade 18 is its new display. Razer says it’s the “world’s first” 18-inch dual-mode display, allowing you to run games with a UHD+ resolution of 3840x2400 and 240Hz refresh rate or FHD+ resolution of 1920x1200 and 440Hz refresh rate. That gives you the flexibility to choose whichever option is best for your current needs (resolution or speed), making the Blade suitable for all sorts of tasks.</p><p>Cooling the unit is a three-fan system that should quickly dissipate any accumulated heat, while the keyboard has been redesigned with new scissor switches featuring a 35% increase in travel distance compared to the outgoing model. There’s also a 10-key numpad and dual-LED backlighting per key.</p><p>Combined with a six-speaker THX system and a 5MP webcam, it’s clear Razer has built the Blade 18 to battle with the most premium gaming laptops on the market.</p><p>If you prefer AMD processors, the Razer Blade 16 comes with the new Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU. You can pair AMD's high-end CPU with one of the RTX 50-Series graphics cards. The Blade 16 has a 1600p QHD+ OLED display capable of 240Hz refresh rates. You're missing out on the dual-mode display tech, but you're getting an OLED screen instead.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-gallery-card-seemingly-teases-hellfire-gala-theme-and-characters-for-season-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Keen-eyed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> players have spotted an in-game reference that seems to suggest that Season 2’s theme and characters will revolve around the classic Marvel comics storyline, the Hellfire Gala.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Information on what NetEase Games could be planning for its next seasonal content drop was first spotted and shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1iy4eu3/season_2_is_hellfire_gala_confirmed_in_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>by Reddit user DynamiteDynamo10</u></a>. Their post includes a screenshot of the "Plans Within Plans" Gallery Card included in the in-game event page in Season 1, containing dialog and story details tied to the current season. It’s a lengthy entry in what is already a game brimming with lore, but what’s interesting is how it ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, if you will excuse me, Doom has a gala to attend,” the post concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not exactly an all-out reveal that Season 2 will follow a story set around Marvel’s well-known gala event, but it is at least a suspicious mention that you’ll need to dig to find. Meanwhile, other players are using Doctor Doom’s gala reference as fuel to the fire that are the rumors that X-Men regular Emma Frost will soon join Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seemingly leaked Emma Frost voice lines were <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1893535638214922567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared online by X0XLeak</u></a> this past weekend, kicking off speculation that the diamond-skinned character could be added sooner rather than later. She also happens to play a part in the original Hellfire Gala storyline along with a laundry list of other Marvel icons. Voice lines like this are suspicious on their own, so coupled with the reference to the gala, these details have some players already plotting out how Emma Frost could break apart the current Marvel Rivals meta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the development makes sense for many, others are saying the reference isn’t enough to confirm which Marvel names will join the Marvel Rivals roster in Season 2. If the next content drop, which is expected to arrive mid-April, is truly set to add content themed around the Hellfire Gala, then the Gallery Card is the first time NetEase has said anything official on the matter. So, even if we assume Season 2 centers around the Hellfire Gala, the story could include Emma Frost or go a different path completely.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, so many other players have spent the entirety of Marvel Rivals Season 1’s vampire-themed romp expecting to see Blade join as the next playable character following multiple in-game appearances. Some have suggested that this could mean we see the Daywalker join for one half of the season while Emma joins in another, while others theorize that Emma may not join until Season 3. At the least, NetEase has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-promises-a-new-hero-every-month-and-a-half">it plans to deliver at least one new character every half-season</a>, so Season 2 is sure to surprise players one way or another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these details are based purely on speculation; we won’t know what NetEase has planned for at least another few weeks. Until the team has more to share about the future of Marvel Rivals, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-just-made-a-classic-moon-knight-meme-feel-a-little-more-real">how it chose to include a reference to an infamous Moon Knight meme</a> as part of its mid-season update.

    <p><span>Plus major updates to Tetris Time Warp.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Digital Eclipse [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/digital-eclipse">Digital Eclipse</a> have released the biggest free update for <em><a title="Games > Tetris Forever [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tetris-forever">Tetris Forever</a></em> yet, which includes major updates for <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> and adds new classic MS-DOS games <em>Super Tetris</em> and <em>Tetris</em> version 3.12 by AcademySoft. <span id="more-946775"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features of the <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> Update</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Blast Off to Level 30</strong> – The single-player modes in <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, which previously topped out at Level 15, now go all the way to Level 30! Can you handle even higher speeds of play? Starting at Level 20, the Time Warp Tetrimino piece will no longer feature the golden-colored Tetrimino, so you won’t be able to create Matrix-clearing cascades. And starting on Level 28, the lockdown speed of Tetriminos will greatly increase.</li><li><strong>Time Warp Shield</strong> – In <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>‘s <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [450 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> mode, the Time Warp Tetriminos now have a new power – Shield! <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>r a line including a Time Warp Tetrimino while the Shield design is showing, and you’ll earn a Shield that will stop other players from sending you into a Time Warp. It disappears after being used once.</li><li><strong>1989 Mode Upgrades</strong> – Enjoy playing <em>Tetris</em> with black-and-white graphics and <a title="Companies > chiptune" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/chiptune">chiptune</a> sounds? 1989 Mode, a single-player mode found within <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, now has a variety of fixes and new options. You can choose to turn off “Modern Gameplay” and experience more historically accurate gameplay. You can also optionally choose to play the game with 18 rows in the Matrix, as opposed to the modern-day setting of 20 rows.</li><li><strong>Take the 40-Line Challenge</strong> – Celebrate <em>Tetris</em>‘ 40th anniversary by trying to clear 40 lines as quickly as you can. Playable in both Modern and 1989 modes.</li><li><strong>Options, Options, Options</strong> – A vastly expanded Options menu lets you customize the visuals, sounds, and gameplay in <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> to your liking. Turn individual graphic effects on or off, and tweak your gameplay with new options like the Initial Hold and Initial Rotation systems, Diagonals, and more.</li></ul><p>Many other bug fixes, tweaks, and minor changes to all modes to improve the <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> experience.</p><p><strong>New MS-DOS Games Added to <em>Tetris Forever</em></strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong><em>Super Tetris</em></strong> – Released by Spectrum Holobyte in 1991, this was an early attempt at creating a “sequel” to <em>Tetris</em>. The gameplay is quite different — the Matrix is half-full of garbage when a game begins, and players can earn and use Bombs to clear out the spaces and find power-ups buried in the garbage. It includes Cooperative and Competitive multiplayer modes, in which two players play in the same Matrix!</li><li><strong><em>Tetris</em> (AcademySoft) v. 3.12</strong> – A historically important inclusion, this is the final version of <em>Tetris</em> created within the Soviet Union in the Academy of Sciences, ported from Alexey Pajitnov’s original Pascal code by Vadim Gerasimov. Dating to 1988, it is notable for its inclusion of Phantom mode, in which all O-Tetriminos (square-shaped pieces) are invisible!</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Updates</strong></p><ul><li>The gameplay behaviors in the recreation of the Electronika 60 version of <em>Tetris</em> have been updated to be even more historically accurate to the original version.</li><li>Now includes language support for Korean and Traditional Chinese.</li><li>Many other minor tweaks, bug fixes, and enhancements have been made to improve the gameplay experience.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Tetris Forever</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,751 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,807 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,699 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,469 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180240/Tetris_Forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tetris_forever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Jeff Bezos Presents: The News]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jeff-bezos-presents-the-news.1119705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This morning, Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos shared a new direction for the paper’s opinion section, both with staff and, for some reason, with all of <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>: from now on, the opinion section will “be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We'll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.” As a result, opinion section editor David Shipley is out, and I am losing my fucking mind.</p><p>In a message so unhinged I literally had to check with people that it wasn’t an elaborate hack, Bezos writes&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.</p><p>I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical — it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity….</p><p>I’m confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America. I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion. I’m excited for us together to fill that void.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Bezos writes that he offered Shipley, who became head of the opinion section in 2022, the opportunity to oversee this new direction, and Shipley declined. In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3lj3nxy42b22a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo to staff</a> from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/06/07/will-lewis-washington-post-00162341" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embattled</a> WaPo CEO Will Lewis, Lewis thanks Bezos for “clearly and succinctly spelling out what we stand for at The Washington Post, and I will be so very proud for The Post to be known for its two key pillars: our belief in free markets and personal liberties.”</p><p>I would argue that The Washington Post (former employer of Nathan and me) is known for, you know, <em>news</em>, though lately has become known for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2023/10/10/washington-post-staff-buyouts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buyouts</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/business/media/washington-post-president-endorsement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kissing Trump’s ass</a>, with Bezos joining other billionaire <a href="https://aftermath.site/zuckerberg-meta-policy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech moguls</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5251508/la-times-owner-soon-shiong-rfk-jr-opinion-op-ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newspaper owners</a> in securing his own bag over the paper’s credibility. While Bezos’ ownership of The Post gives him, in the most basic sense, the right to shape some of its strategy as he sees fit, so blatantly spelling out his own priorities and commanding his writers to take them up feels like a massive overstep of his power, and yet another clear signal that <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/trump-administration-says-it-will-take-control-of-white-house-press-pool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the free press is crumbling</a> in the face of our new, incredibly stupid regime.</p><p>Legacy outlets like The Post and The New York Times have long held up the fact that their opinion pages are siloed and separate from their news coverage as an excuse to throw all kinds of toxic spaghetti at the wall. While it is true that news and opinion are separate sections, as someone who’s worked at both digital outlets and The Post, I’ve always found this a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lj3nhfj6zc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flimsy</a> justification. Readers raised on digital news are used to their outlets eschewing some of the stodgier legacy practices of “<a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/a-test-of-the-news-wesley-lowery-objectivity.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">objectivity</a>” and “<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/V/bo29172094.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the view from nowhere,</a>” gravitating toward writers and sites with strong voices who don’t seek to erase their own humanity in pursuit of the news. Sites like those of my Gawker peers, or our colleagues at independent outlets today, are popular because we write like real people who live in the real world, because we don’t feel professionally bound to put our brains and hearts aside in fealty to some neutral “both sides.” That doesn’t mean we don’t hold to journalistic values of truth, fairness, and humanity in our coverage and reporting, but we know the news doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Our sites run “opinion” pieces, but we don’t have opinion sections; we don’t need a special space in which to showcase our values, because they undergird all of our coverage.&nbsp;</p><p>This helps readers trust us, but it also means the younger ones might not be familiar with the structure of newspapers that make hard distinctions between “opinion” and “news.” You could correctly call this a kind of media illiteracy, but I think it also speaks to changing reader expectations, and to the fact that, as much as journalists (myself included) would like to pretend otherwise, most readers aren’t interested in the nitty-gritty structure of a paper and the different journalistic practices, rules, and ethics that go into its sections. Readers want to know what’s going on and want help making sense of it from writers they trust. They won’t see an outlet do hard-hitting, vital investigations and then run <a href="https://glaad.org/the-new-york-times-bias-continues-to-endanger-transgender-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screeds against trans people</a> as fundamentally different things; they will see the whole outlet as morally bankrupt and untrustworthy, and they’ll go get their news elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>That doesn’t mean there isn’t room for a variety of opinions on an outlet’s page, but that an outlet without a consistent moral center, whatever the personal politics of its writers or owner, will alienate readers today. There’s no world where The Post’s opinion section can be the personal mouthpiece of Bezos and his concepts of the “free market” and “personal liberties” and still have readers trust its news output. Whatever the revamped opinion section will be, it will irreparably devalue all the good work The Post’s writers and reporters do in the eyes of readers.</p><p>In his memo to staff, Lewis wrote,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I am very excited about this new clarity and transparency, and cannot wait to see it brought to life in our opinion section. Every day. This is not about siding with any political party. This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper. Doing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It is indeed transparency into what the paper stands for: Jeff Bezos, and by extension his oligarch cohort, want to be The Washington Post now, and the role of the everyday people who read the paper and support it with their money is to be force-fed the contents of Bezos' head. The “America” and “Americans” Lewis cites aren’t readers the paper respects and serves; they’re grist for the mill of Bezos and his buddies. Even if Bezos never touches the news section, readers will see his hands all over it. This is “News by Jeff” now, no matter how many “opinion” banners the paper slaps up.  &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wheel-world-demo"><h3>I Need To Stop Playing The Wheel World Demo And Fix My Bike</h3></a><p>If only real-life wrenching were as fun as it is in the game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down"><h3>Fuck WB</h3></a><p>Another all-time great studio sacrificed at the altar of Line Go Up</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
