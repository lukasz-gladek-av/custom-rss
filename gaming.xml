		<p>Project Cloud Games and Perp Games have confirmed that the action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/watch-over-eight-minutes-of-the-relic-first-guardian-gameplay/">The Relic: First Guardian gameplay</a> will be launching on May 26th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. To announce this release date, a new trailer has been released which appears to show another boss that players will have to try and take on as they try to piece together The Relic: First Guardian’s story.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Relic: First Guardian - 'A New Fate' Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCifOcNbp98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Relic: First Guardian is set in the world of Arsiltus which was sucked up by the void following the great relic’s destruction. The goal is to find the pieces of the broken relic across the Arsiltus while dealing with the dangers that now plague it since falling into the void, with the hope being that finding the relic pieces will save Arsiltus and close the void.</p>
<p>Players do not level up in the game but equipping runes and items, and crafting tools to help is what will determine success in each mission. Every single weapon, of which there are five types, and armour piece is unique with each one having its own story behind it, along with a specific vow that the previous owner made. These pieces can be found and used against the 70 bosses that make up the challenge of The Relic: First Guardian, with each again having its own unique backstory. Players will also have access to 12 skill trees allowing for a range of playstyles.</p>

As <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-technology-inc-reports-results-first-quarter-fiscal-2026">part of its earnings report</a> released on Wednesday, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said “tight industry conditions” across DRAM and NAND flash memory are expected to “persist through and beyond” 2026 as AI drives up demand.</p><p>With the AI boom in full swing, Micron is making more money than ever as companies like OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and Google fill their data centers with powerful chips that come packaged with high-bandwidth memory (HBM).

That leaves fewer resources for the DRAM in products we use every day, like PCs, smartphones, smart TVs, and even cars.

Micron also expects to start production at a new manufacturing facility in Idaho in 2027, followed by a new plant in New York in 2030.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/847344/micron-ram-memory-shortage-2026-earnings]]></content:encoded>

              <p>If you like watching your favorite shows and movies wherever you go, a streaming stick is a veritable must-have. You can use it on just about any TV, and cue up all the streaming services you have in one place, all with one device. It brings popular streaming apps together in one place and turns almost any TV into a smart TV without taking up space or adding clutter. and in the case of the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD, it’s super easy to use. Plus, it gives you access to Amazon’s library as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">If that sounds like something you need to add to your travel arsenal, or just want an easy way to devour content at home, it’s just $19 at Amazon right now, down from its usual price of $35.</a> That’s a discount of $16 and 46% off. For a streaming device that covers most major platforms and includes a voice remote, an entry fee of less than $20 is pretty generous.

<p>You can even use the Alexa Voice Remote to search with your voice. And honestly, since sometimes typing things in on a small remote can be annoying, that’s one of the most useful parts of the experience. Instead of typing with on screen keyboards, you can press the microphone button and say what you want to watch instead of taking the time to search for each letter. That makes it especially useful if you’re letting kids have free rein of the streamer, because they can just say their favorite show or movie and find it instead of fumbling with the remote.</p>

<p>The memory shortage is hitting the GPU market. A new report suggest Nvidia is preparing to cut down on production of its GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>According to Chinese outlet <a href="http://www.boardchannels.com.cn/thread-130069-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BoBantang</a> via <a href="https://benchlife.info/nvidia-will-adjust-geforce-rtx-50-suppy-due-gddr7-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benchlife</a>, Nvidia is looking to reduce supply of the latest series of cards by as much as 30-40% compared to the first half of 2025. The report adds that this is being done due to the memory shortage for GDDR6 and GDDR7 RAM. Across the industry, this shortage has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumer prices skyrocket</a> as AI companies buy up all of the available supply.</p>







<p>In addition to the original report, Benchlife adds that various AIC partners and suppliers have told the outlet that the first cards to likely be cut back are the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060Ti 16GB.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Nvidia hasn’t confirmed or denied the report. Insider Gaming has made attempts to contact Nvidia for an official statement on the matter, but, so far, all requests have gone unanswered. Should one come, it will be added to this story. </p>

<p>RV There Yet? is a co-op game where players are travelling in their RV back from a vacation, but run into all sorts of issues on Route 65. Players need to find ways to survive this route and get their RV across challenge terrain, sometimes needing to winch it or jump it across gaps and up heights when there is road to follow. The RV does get damaged so finding scrap in the wild is also essential to keep it moving, lest you get trapped on Route 65 and never make it home.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has published its year-in-review <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/year-in-review-2025-to-date">report for January to November 2025</a> for the global video games market, a year marked by the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, and engagement-driven growth on PC, beating out consoles and mobile. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">After yesterday's news from Circana</a> outlining how November 2025 was one of the worst months for US physical game sales and hardware sales in 30 years, Newzoo's report on the global industry is a reminder that, at least on the consumer side, things are still trending in a positive direction. Issues like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">tariffs, the rising cost of living</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/after-dell-acer-asus-have-surrendered-to-memory-shortages/">now memory shortages</a> could have more of an impact in 2026, but as of the end of 2025, Newzoo expects the global games market to rise 7.5% compared to 2024 when all the 2025 numbers are tallied.</p>



<p>That's an increase to <strong>$197 billion</strong>, with mobile games expected to grow to  <strong>$108 billion (a 7.7%</strong> <strong>increase)</strong>, console gaming expected to hit <strong>$45 billion (a 4.2% increase), </strong>and PC gaming expected to grow to <strong>$43 billion (a 10.4% increase)</strong>. The PC and mobile growth is what exceeded Newzoo's expectations, and the key drivers behind the expected growth getting to just shy of $200B, though, if growth continues in the way Newzoo predicts, the industry will be far past $200B by next year.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-6.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Newzoo expects mobile to remain strong due to its stock of ol'reliable titles from publishers like Tencent and Century Games and the momentum perpetuated by new hits, much like how the console industry is kept up by the routine and habits of console gamers going back to major franchises each year, growth on PC is a bit more interesting. </p>



<p>That's exemplified in the top 10 games on PC by revenue for the year. Some of the games are major franchises, but none of them are free-to-play titles, and all of them are games that were released in 2025. "<em>The 2025 outcome reflects players spending more deeply within games and ecosystems they already value, rather than growth being driven by a sudden expansion of the player base</em>," said principal market analyst, Michiel Buijsman.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Two of the top 10 are indie titles, and three of the top 10 are brand new games not based on a pre-existing franchise on PC, which Newzoo says is "<em>reflecting a broad appetite for varied experiences</em>" and <em>"PC's relative openness to new IP and system-driven design</em>." It's also further signs that, while console games may take centre stage more often as far as what hits the mainstream, PC is still where the core industry is. </p>



<p>On console, the top 10 does clear one of the same bars that the PC list clears, which is that they're all games released in 2025, but none of them are indie titles or new franchises. They're all major franchises, and half the list are even annual releases. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-2.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>EA is the winningest publisher with nearly half the list in its portfolio, though perhaps the most impressive inclusion is Pokemon Legends Z-A, which made it despite only being available on one platform.</p>



<p>Both of those lists are tallied by revenue, whereas the engagement lists (tallied by monthy active users) for PC and console are a different story. Only one of the titles in the top 10 on PC isn't based on a pre-existing franchise, while all of the games on the console list for the top 10 games by MAUs are major franchises.</p>



<p>As a side note, the top 10 console games by MAUs is in fact the only list in Newzoo's report where Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 makes the top 10. Battlefield 6 is still in that top 10, and made it on every the revenue and MAU list for both PC and consoles. It's still early of course, but at this point it feels safe to call it: Battlefield beat Call of Duty in 2025, and there's practically no question about it.</p>

</figure>



<p>Lastly, the final key points from Newzoo's report, as it looks back at 2025 and towards the future to 2026, is that indie games were a huge factor in this year's industry conversation, largely due to successes like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which capped off its stellar year by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">winning a record number of awards at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year</a>. </p>



<p>And as we look ahead, 2025's most significant moves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">like EA moving to privatize</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's opening of Vantage Studios</a> mean that the industry is going through a massive shift. "<em>The EA deal reflects a broader structual shift toward ownership concentration and tighter portfolio management,</em>" said Manu Rosier, director of market intelligence at Newzoo.</p>



<p>"<em>A smaller number of companies now control a larger share of the industry's most influential IP, while platforms increasingly shape which games are funded, distributed, and scaled</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune Awakening Chapter 3 Brings ‘Bigger, Better’ Endgame, New Content and Lots More, Says Funcom]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-chapter-3-brings-bigger-better-endgame-new-content-and-more/</link>
            <guid>1387168</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom has unveiled Dune Awakening Chapter 3, an upcoming update for its survival crafting game set in the world based on Frank Herbert's novels and Denis Villeneuve's movies.</p>



<p>Dune Awakening launched in June 2025 on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling one million copies in a couple of weeks</a> and becoming Funcom's fastest-selling game release to date. However, it was quickly evident that there wasn't enough content, and a lot of players left the game after a short while.</p>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, Game Director Joel Bylos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-2025-qa-we-just-need-to-keep-working-and-solve-the-problems-we-have-one-of-the-best-survival-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told me</a> the team wasn't worried, as the core is among the best games in the genre and it just needed more content and fixes. Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a>, that's exactly what Funcom plans to add to Dune Awakening, starting with Chapter 3.</p>



<p>First and foremost, the developers aim to deliver a 'bigger, better' endgame, powered by a comprehensive redesign of the Tier 6 experience. Players will find deeper progression choices and more meaningful advancement paths, thanks to specializations dedicated to Crafting, Gathering, Exploring, Combat, and Sabotage. This will allow non‑combat focused players to progress endgame content without forced PvP or dungeon raiding.</p>



<p>The Landraad system, Dune Awakening's server-wide political system where player guilds align with the Great Houses (Atreides, Harkonnen), complete weekly tasks, and vote on decrees that affect everyone on the server, has reportedly been remade from scratch and now features new repeatable missions, expanded reward tiers, and stronger incentives for participation. The Faction ranks progression has been extended, too. There will be new contracts specific to each faction's objectives (Atreides, Harkonnen, independent groups). </p>



<p>A completely new Augmentation Station is being introduced as an upgrade path for late‑game gear customization. Players will be able to attach powerful augments to Unique Tier 6 gear to customize their playstyle further. On the PvE side, Funcom is adding five brand-new overland 'challenge sites', including 'The Broodworks'. Completing these areas provides faction progress, increases Landsraad contribution, and grants Specialization XP. Furthermore, Dune Awakening Chapter 3 will introduce five new Testing Stations. These are repeatable, dungeon-like content featuring boss fights, increasing difficulty and appropriately valuable rewards. </p>



<p>The story is going forward, too. The player's narrative journey will continue with the introduction of unexpected allies, fighting through the Neo Carthag dueling ring, and delving deeper into the mystery of the player character's origins. When it comes to combat, the Rapier is being fully reworked, and a new 'Pyrocket' melee weapon (dual-wielded knives) will be available with the update.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside Dune Awakening Chapter 3, Funcom will launch the paid Raiders of the Broken Lands DLC, which can be purchased for $9.99 (but is included with the $24.99 Season Pass). Its additions are cosmetic-only: 73 new building pieces and 17 decorations inspired by the Imperium's Smugglers, a dedicated stillsuit set, a light and heavy armor set, weapon variants, swatches, and emotes.</p>



<p>The game is available at a 35% discount, the largest one yet since launch, in the Steam Winter Sale that starts today. Funcom did not share a timeframe for Chapter 3 and the Raiders of the Broken Lands DLC, but more details should be released in early 2026. Later next year, the game is supposed to launch on consoles as well.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="382">Amazon is currently offering a significant discount on <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6483/">the 2025 Apple MacBook Air with the M4 chip, bringing the price down to $949 from its usual $1,119.</a> This 21% reduction translates to a savings of $250, making it one of the best deals available for this model since its release earlier this year. For anyone seeking a powerful yet lightweight laptop, this offer is hard to beat.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6483/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="384" data-end="408"><strong data-start="384" data-end="408">Everyday Performance</strong></h2>
<p data-start="410" data-end="999">The 15.3-inch 2025 MacBook Air continues to be a top pick for users who value portability without compromising on performance. Weighing just 3.3 pounds and maintaining a sleek, slim design, this model upholds the Air’s tradition of ultra-light form while delivering performance on par with larger devices. Despite its compact size, Apple has equipped it with a 10-core CPU, an optional 10-core GPU, and support for up to 24GB of memory. With the new M4 chip, this MacBook Air offers speeds up to twice as fast as the M1-era model and up to 23 times faster than Intel-powered versions.</p>
<p data-start="1001" data-end="1291">Apple designed the M4 chip with Apple Intelligence in mind, optimizing the system for task management, efficient processing, and the ability to handle intensive workflows.

<p data-start="1293" data-end="1780">For users who work on the go, the MacBook Air’s battery life is a standout feature.

Its 12MP front-facing camera, capable of 1080p video resolution, makes it an excellent choice for virtual meetings, online classes, or video calls with loved ones. The built-in three-microphone array ensures clear audio, so you don’t need external equipment to be heard clearly.</p>


<p data-start="1782" data-end="2222">The fully backlit keyboard makes it easy to type in low-light conditions, while Touch ID offers quick and secure access to the laptop. On the sides, there are two Thunderbolt ports for fast data transfer and peripheral connectivity. The MagSafe charging port ensures your power cable remains securely attached but detaches safely if pulled. Apple has also kept the headphone jack—great for anyone who still prefers wired audio devices.</p>
<p data-start="2224" data-end="2430">For those fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem, the MacBook Air offers seamless features like AirDrop, iMessage syncing, and Handoff, allowing for smooth transitions between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>
<p data-start="2432" data-end="2790"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6483/">The MacBook Air is available in several configurations, all of which are currently discounted. The 256GB model, priced at $949, offers a $250 savings</a>. The 512GB model is priced at $1,149, also reflecting a $250 reduction. For those needing more memory, the 24GB RAM and 512GB storage configuration has dropped by $250, bringing it down to $1,349 from $1,599.</p>
<p data-start="2792" data-end="3057" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The MacBook Air is also available in four stylish colors: sky blue, silver, starlight, and midnight. With its impressive performance, ultra-portable design, and generous discounts, the 2025 MacBook Air is a standout option for anyone in the market for a new laptop—especially right now while its $250 off.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dying Light 2’s New Winter Update Includes Beastly ‘Evolving’ Bundle]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-winter-update-evolving-bundle/</link>
            <guid>1387156</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Techland is pushing out the first major update for Dying Light 2: Stay Human for some time. Now that Dying Light: The Beast is in the open and doing well, the team has reverted to focus more on the live-service Dying Light 2, which was released back in 2022. The new winter update is dubbed ‘Winter Tales: Gifts from Above 2025’, and it comes with some neat content.</p>



<p>This fresh update also boasts a new bundle called <strong>The Evolving Bundle</strong>. It’s an interactive set that gets better once you’ve bought it, with the various items in the set <em>evolving </em>and taking on new forms.</p>







<h2 id="h-winter-has-come-to-villedor">Winter Has Come to Villedor</h2>



<p>The festive theme lands in Villedor once a year, blanketing the map in challenges, exclusive rewards, and seasonal activities.</p>



<p>In a new press release published by Techland, the return of <strong>Baka </strong>was highlighted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Baka is back in the Villedor</strong>&nbsp;with a set of new bounties for players to complete, progressing with him will unlock items in his shop based on the level players are at. These items can be bought with Candies collected from killing seasonal zombie enemies – including Naughty Biters, Naughty Bolters, Naughty Virals, Uncle Snow, and Ice Spitters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you complete enough challenges, you’ll get your ‘Letter to Santa’ from Baka, which triggers a special airdrop guarded by fearsome enemies.</p>



<p>From today, December 18, community goals are being kick-started to allow players access to even more gear. Here’s the spread of challenges coming up:</p>



<ul>
<li>December 18 – December 23 – Week 1: Kill Naughty Biters – rewards include the Glacier Shank Knife and Snow Season Ornament Charm</li>



<li>December 23 – December 30 – Week 2: Kill Naughty Virals – rewards include The Guiding Star Mace and Gift Season Ornament Charm.&nbsp;</li>



<li>December 30 – January 8 – Week 3: Kill Uncle Snow – rewards include the Fractal Frost Axe&nbsp;and New Year’s Ornament Charm.</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the more unique elements of the Winter Update in Dying Light 2: Stay Human is the new <strong>Evolving Bundle</strong>. This has been dubbed ‘the first of its kind’, suggesting that more are coming, and this is why it’s so important for fans of the franchise:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The first bundle of that kind is the&nbsp;<strong>Night Wolf Evolving Bundle</strong>&nbsp;which evolves into the Crimson Werewolf set as players progress through a four-part questline. This way players can acquire two versions of a powerful rifle, an outfit, six gear pieces, and a paraglider skin. The bundle also contains the Wolf’s Claws melee weapon and an exclusive grappling hook variant.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As you play the new questline, you’ll see your weapons and equipment evolving before your eyes, which is a super neat touch.</p>



<p>This announcement was made in addition to the team at Techland highlighting big discounts across the Dying Light franchise, which includes Dying Light: The Beast being up to 20% off right now.</p>

            <p>The first episode of Fallout's second season debuted yesterday, and within its hour or so run time solved one of the biggest cut content mysteries from New Vegas, which had been left unanswered for 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for Fallout season two episode one below.</strong></p>

<p>Along with introducing some new faces, the second season of Fallout also reunites us with the likes of Lucy and The Ghoul, who left together at the end of season one on the trail of disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean. Hank, meanwhile, was last seen fleeing towards a ruined New Vegas in his pinched Brotherhood of Steel Power Armour.</p>
<p>And, that brings us to the first episode of season two, with Lucy and The Ghoul following the bloody trail Hank has left in his wake. This includes a little stop off at Vault 24, a cut location from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. We only know about this place because players discovered a Vault 24 jumpsuit tucked away in New Vegas' game files, which could only be found using console commands</p><p>Now, as I am sure you are aware if you have read this far, many of the vaults in Fallout - both the show and the games - were set up to conduct experiments and such within. This has included the TV show's Vault 4, which experimented with mutants, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s Vault 63, which was set up by Vault-Tec's Hugo Stolz and his wife as a research facility for various technologies that would help with setting up post-War societies. There was also that poor chap that got put into Vault 77 totally on his own save for some puppets.</p>
<p>So, what was tucked away in Fallout: New Vegas' Vault 24? For a long time it seemed likely we would never know, but, thanks to Amazon's show, we now have an answer. And that answer is… communists! When Lucy and The Ghoul step into the vault, which is now derelict and covered in vegetation, they come across skeletons strapped down in front of a propaganda video, which when they were alive would have been brainwashing the poor chaps.</p>
<p>These aren't the only skeletons that were left to rot in the vault. Lucy and The Ghoul find many more strapped down within Vault 24, with pseudo-Soviet gear about the place. "These are Americans," Lucy realises, "and the Vault turned them into communists."</p>
<p>This seems like a pretty odd thing for the Vault-Tec heads to have done, but to be fair, when did they ever do anything that couldn't be labelled as pretty odd? (Again, that poor man with the puppets). On further exploration, Lucy and The Ghoul come across someone alive down there. A Wastelander with a chip in his head like the one House used at the start of the episode, which allowed him to control a goon's mind, is sitting strapped down and clearly not of sound mind.</p><p>This mind controlling chip is what Hank went into the vault to get a hold of, though it still needs some work to perfect, as so far the only people we have seen with the chips in their heads have not lived very long… that's probably a plot thread for another episode.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. After 15 years, we now know what's in Vault 24.</p>

<p>The second season of Amazon's Fallout is releasing on a weekly basis, with the final episode airing in February of next year.</p>
<p>The team is already hard at work on season three, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">with the next series being written as we speak</a>. Filming is then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-will-begin-filming-summer-2026-as-showrunners-want-to-get-series-back-on-air-as-soon-as-we-can">expected to begin in summer 2026</a>, Fallout series executive producer Jonathan Nolan said earlier this month.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-does-final-price-cut-of-year-on-xbox-controllers-nearly-50-off-and-makes-sonys-look-overpriced-2000654527</link>
            <guid>1387111</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">cut the price of its 2025 Xbox wireless controller on Amazon to $38</a>, which is the lowest price ever for hardware that just came out. That’s a $26 discount off the $64 list price, and here’s the best part: it’s a lot cheaper than Sony’s DualSense (currently selling for $54, down from $74). Yes, these controllers were made for different consoles, but if you play games on your PC or on more than one device, this price makes the Xbox controller the clear choice. Just so you know, Amazon’s shipping estimates say that the package <strong>won’t arrive until after Christmas</strong>, so this is better for treating yourself than for giving as a last-minute gift.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Important for More Than Just Gaming</h2>
<p>The 2025 Xbox controller has some smart changes that make long gaming sessions feel less like finger workouts and more like natural extensions of your hands. Microsoft changed the shape of the geometry by adding sculpted surfaces that fit your grip better which may seem like a small change, but after holding the thing for three hours straight during a marathon session, you’ll see how big of a difference it makes. The hybrid D-pad gives you choices based on the game you’re playing and it has the accuracy of separate buttons and the smooth motion of a disc-style pad. The triggers, bumpers, and back case now have textured grips on them, so your controller won’t turn into a bar of soap when your hands get sweaty during intense moments.</p>
<p>With two AA batteries, the battery life can last up to 40 hours so you can play for weeks without needing to change them. That’s a lot better than controllers with built-in rechargeable batteries that wear out over time and make you play while connected to a cable. You have to carry extra batteries, but honestly, it only takes five seconds to change AAs instead of waiting hours for a charge and if you don’t like disposable batteries, you can also get rechargeable AA packs.</p>



<p>The new Share button is easy to find on the controller face and lets you take screenshots and recordings without having to search through menus or remember button combinations. This feature works directly with Xbox’s capture system, which makes making content feel less like a chore and more like something you’ll actually use. Streaming to friends or social media becomes something that everyone can do, not just people who make content for a living.</p>



<p>You can connect to almost any device you own: Xbox Wireless technology works right away with Xbox Series X, Series S, and Xbox One consoles while <strong>Bluetooth works with Windows PCs, Android phones, iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, Smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong>. The pairing button makes it easy to switch between devices in seconds, so you can go from playing games on your console to playing games on your phone without having to go through settings menus. The 3.5mm headset jack works with any wired headphones or gaming headset you already have, so you don’t have to deal with proprietary adapters.</p>
<p>The Xbox Accessories app lets you change the functions of buttons to fit your playstyle or meet your accessibility needs. Players of racing games can change the functions of the back buttons to work with paddle shifters, and players of fighting games can move the functions of the face buttons around to make combos faster. You can use the app on Xbox consoles and Windows PCs.</p>
<p>Here’s the truth: A brand-new 2025 controller with a 40-hour battery life, compatibility with all devices, and ergonomic improvements for $38 is a great deal. Third-party controllers that are similar often skimp on build quality or don’t have official firmware support. On the other hand, first-party controllers from competitors are usually between $50 and $70, even when they’re on sale.</p>

                <p>Blizzard Entertainment president Johanna Faries has said fans of the Diablo and Warcraft company can look forward to what she hopes will be Blizzard's "biggest year yet" in 2026.</p><p>2026 marks the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and Faries<a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/blizzard-entertainment-president-blizzcon-2026-preview-1236610214/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> told Variety</a> that the company has a "bold vision" for what's coming next.</p><p>"The teams across Blizzard entirely, as an organization, are gearing up for what we hope to be the biggest year yet for Blizzard, and we take that statement very seriously," Faries said. "And it's all part of this new, bold vision for the future."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpaz0etTqJw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gpaz0etTqJw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Faries went on to say that Blizzard's teams "are cooking on major swings" for its major franchises, some of which will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2026-tickets-go-on-sale-soon-heres-how-much-theyll-cost/1100-6535959/" data-ref-id="1100-6535959">discussed at BlizzCon 2026 in September of next year.</a></p><p>"I think we just have a tremendous amount of pride in what's going to come forward, not just at BlizzCon, but even in the run up to BlizzCon here. So all hands on deck, but it's a very exciting time," she said.</p><p>Finally, Faries said she wants Blizzard to be the "best gaming and entertainment company in the world," and what the company shows at BlizzCon next year aims to "really reflect that ambition in a bigger way."</p><p>"I have total confidence that the teams are going to come very, very big, both with the heart and soul of what I think our core-most fans long for in a BlizzCon, but also bringing some very new things to the table," she said.</p><p>Faries worked at the NFL for nearly 12 years before joining Activision to work on the Call of Duty series, rising to the rank of Call of Duty general manager. In February 2024, she <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-new-president-previously-oversaw-call-of-duty/1100-6520673/" data-ref-id="1100-6520673">became the president of Blizzard, replacing Mike Ybarra.</a></p><p>Officially speaking, Blizzard has said it has "major" reveals for the BlizzCon opening ceremony. Beyond that, the convention will see the return of the Blizzard Arcade, developer panels, and hands-on gameplay sessions for games like World of Warcraft, Diablo IV, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal. Presumably, these titles will have new content revealed for them, explaining their presence on the show floor.</p><p>In the semi-near future, Diablo IV's new expansion, Lord of Hatred, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-lord-of-hatred-brings-back-everyones-favorite-hot-mom-amazons-and-lorath/1100-6536976/" data-ref-id="1100-6536976">coming in April 2026 with everyone's favorite "hot mom."</a> World of Warcraft's new expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">Midnight</a>, is coming in March 2026.</p><p>2026 also marks the 10th anniversary of Overwatch, and Blizzard no doubt has some surprises in store.

                <p>Actor Neil Newbon, who voiced Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3, has shared his thoughts on artificial intelligence in gaming, and he didn't mince words.</p><p>"Fuck AI in performance," Newbon told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/baldurs-gate-3/astarion-neil-newbon-ai-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>.</p><p>He's talking about using artificial voice lines for games, like how Embark's The Finals and Arc Raiders do. For Arc Raiders, the studio hired human actors to record voice lines and then used AI systems to have their voices say lots of other things. Newbon pointed out that Arc Raiders has been a major commercial success, and he suggested that Embark bring back the actors to "redo the lines."</p><p>"Maybe go back to those actors you paid however much money to clone their voices; maybe get them in the booth and re-record that stuff. Just saying. You've got the money now, spread the wealth," he said.</p><p>"I don't think there's a justification for taking people's jobs away," he added. "I don't really think it's legitimate. If you're going to not record the lines in the first place and just use AI to take somebody's voice and manipulate it however the hell you want, that's a problem."</p><p>"Most actors, notoriously, are not rich. Most of us struggle [for] our entire career," he said.</p><p>Embark has not disclosed the names of the voice performers in Arc Raiders, nor do we know their level of compensation. But Newbon said most actors are "not rich" and "struggle for our entire career."</p><p>Beyond all of this, Newbon said AI-created voice lines, as they exist today, simply sound "boring."</p><p>"It's dull as hell. I don't <em>believe</em> it; it takes me out of the immersion. People are saying it helps the immersion because it's reactive. It takes me out of the experience because I just hear something that doesn't sound like a human being in jeopardy, or in combat, or excitement, or whatever emotion you're supposed to be aiming for," he said.</p><p>Next up for Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian is a new Divinity game. The company's CEO, Swen Vincke, recently discussed how the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">uses AI technologies in early-stage development efforts</a>, but promised that nothing AI-created will appear in the final product. His comments caused a stir, prompting Vincke to respond, saying Larian is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">hiring more people, not fewer</a>, and that AI is used to explore possibilities and not for actual production.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If a workstation refresh is what you’re after, Amazon is making the upgrade easy. The retailer is offering some great discounts on multiple tech gadgets, PCs, laptops, tablets, headphones, and more. Those looking to grab a mini PC should consider the Kamrui Hyper H2, which is currently sitting at $510.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/">That’s after a nice 38% discount, but that’s not the only offer here</a>. Using the code <em><strong>JEG1HLJI7VJK</strong></em> at checkout can save you an additional 10%, which brings the total down even further. Moreover, shipping is free, so there are no extra charges to worry about. Just note the discount is listed as a limited-time one at Amazon, which means it’s likely going to wrap up soon. We suggest acting fast to grab it before that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Small But Mighty</h2>
<p>This mini PC is compact; so much so that it fits in the palm of your hand. At just 5.04 x 5.04 x 1.63 inches, it’s a fraction of the size of a traditional desktop, which makes it easy to fit into a tighter space. In fact, it can even be mounted behind your PC or under the desk for a cleaner, minimal look.</p>
<p>Don’t let the size fool you, though. The PC packs a muscular, 10-core 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor, capable of hitting speeds up to 4.9GHz. It’s made for heavy-duty, resource-intensive tasks, and offers 25–40% higher performance than the R7-8745HS (8C/16T) and i7-1280P processors. The 13th Gen hybrid architecture here distributes workloads efficiently, which results in better response times and a smoother operation, regardless of the job at hand. Pair all this with the massive 32GB RAM, and you’ve got yourself a machine that can support all your multitasking needs. You will be able to use a bunch of programs at the same time, jump through a ton of tabs across multiple browsers, take conference calls, stream while gaming, and more; all without a hint of lag.</p>



<p>There’s a built-in 1TB SSD to help you store all your important data, from work documents, to media content, research papers, and even a few games, in a single place. SSDs are also much faster than their traditional counterparts, so you’ll enjoy better boot and transfer times just as well. Note that the memory and the storage capacities are expandable up to 64GB and 4TB, respectively. You can easily upgrade the system as your needs grow. Those who prefer working with a multi monitor setup will appreciate how the mini PC supports three-screen 4k displays with its HDMI, DP 1.4, and USB4 ports. The USB4 port delivers up to 40Gbps transfer speed, as well, plus provides 15W of power delivery to charge smaller devices or accessories. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, 2.5GbE LAN, and a range of additional ports to create a full-fledged productive setup.</p>
<p>But despite all the power, the PC keeps things quite calm and cool as it works. That’s thanks to an upgraded silent centrifugal fan, dual copper heat pipes, and a dual-fin module. The all-copper structure improves the overall thermal conductivity and increases airflow by 35%. Translation? Exceptional performance even when you’re juggling heavy creative workloads on a busy day.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to grab a power mini PC that offers strong performance but doesn’t break the bank, the Kamrui Hyper H2 mini gaming PC is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/">Don’t forget to use the discounted code <strong><em>JEG1HLJI7VJK</em></strong> at checkout to maximize your savings!</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fifa-new-game-netflix-2026-world-cup-delphi-interactive-2000654568</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>FIFA </em>is coming back as a Netflix exclusive. I mean, not really <em>FIFA</em> per se. That franchise is now called <em>EA Sports FC</em> after soccer’s international governing body failed to get EA to keep paying for the licensing rights. This new<em> FIFA</em>, which will only be playable on the Netflix app, will likely be something very different. FIFA and Netflix promise it’s coming next year in time for the 2026 World Cup, but as of right now it’s not even really clear who’s actually going to develop this new soccer game.</p> <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/fifa-mens-world-cup-2026-game-on-netflix">Yesterday’s press release</a> points to Delphi Interactive as the publisher and developer. It’s only real credit up to this point is getting the licensing rights to James Bond for IO Interactive’s upcoming <em>007 First Light</em> game. The Beverly Hills-based outfit bills itself as building “AAA games based on the most desirable IP franchises in the world,” but only has 14 people associated with the company on LinkedIn.</p>

 <p>One of those is CEO <span><span dir="ltr"></span></span></p>

 <p>So who at Delphi actually knows about games? Well, the company did hire <a href="https://www.nordiskgames.com/">Nordisk Games</a> founder Mikkel Weider, who Daugaard previously lauded for having “essentially blitz-scaled Nordisk Games from one employee to 1,300 in just a few years.” Is that what’s going on here? An army of hundreds of developers and outsource teams, working for years in complete secrecy on what FIFA hopes will be the most popular sim soccer game in the world?</p>

 <p>From the outside at least, Delphi Interactive appears to be a financial instrument for hashing out deals. What does it mean to be an AAA publisher with no obvious development experience?&nbsp;“In the era of digital game distribution, we believe that if you have access to a beloved global intellectual property, and you have access to capital to develop and market games, and you have access to the best independent development talent, you can actually make a successful AAA game outside of what we now lovingly refer to as the ’publisher industrial complex’ that has sort of traditionally oligopolized the AAA space,” Daugaard <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/delphi-interactive-nordisk-games-mikkel-weider-strictly-business-1236192058/">told <em>Variety</em></a> last year. So there’s that, I guess?</p>

 <p>One possibility is that Netflix, FIFA, and Delphi Interactive will outsource most of the actual making of this new game to studios abroad, likely in cheaper labor markets where armies of developers can brute-force something into existence in record time. Or maybe the plan is to take a soccer sim that’s already in existence and reskin it with FIFA logos and the likenesses of international stars. “Stay tuned for more details soon,” Daugaard wrote this week.</p>

 <p>It doesn’t help instill confidence that the other two groups involved don’t have great track records. After throwing itself into gaming, including trying to make its own internal blockbuster studio with seasoned industry talent, Netflix has retreated into simple party games and branded cash-ins of its popular streaming franchises. FIFA, meanwhile, remains one of the grimiest international operators out there. It recently invented a fake peace prize to appease President Donald Trump ahead of the World Cup. It’ll be much harder to fake an alternative to <em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p> <p>Delphi Interactive and FIFA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
