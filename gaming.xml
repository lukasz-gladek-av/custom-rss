  <p id="YPTMO6"><strong>Salvation’s Edge</strong> is the raid for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841367/destiny-2-showcase-2023-final-shape-announcement-trailer-summary"><em>The Final Shape</em></a> expansion, and it sees you and your Fireteam of Guardians storm The Witness’ Monolith inside The Pale Heart of The Traveler. You’ll need to charge energy, take down an overly familiar face once again, and do some geometry if you actually want to kill The Witness. </p>
<p id="91HiHn">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/23611953/power-level-cap-powerful-pinnacle-gear">recommended power level</a> for the raid in 1945, but due to the Fireteam Power system, you’ll be all set as long as one of your teammates has 1950 power or higher. Finally, note that at least one of your Fireteam members must complete the campaign and the “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24172688/still-hunt-quest-wild-card">Wild Card</a>” quest in order to start the raid.</p>
<p id="ELr95K">In this<em> Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> guide, I’ll walk you through every step of the Salvation’s Edge raid, including how to complete each encounter, find both secret chests, and beat The Witness boss fight.</p>

<hr id="LFQMKD">
<h2 id="7VeWYp"><strong>Salvation’s Edge raid walkthrough steps and mechanics</strong></h2>
<p id="7iQHrO">There are five encounters in Salvation’s Edge raid, with each getting you closer to the singular goal of <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion: defeating The Witness. Here’s a quick summary of the encounters:</p>
<ul>
<li id="3XjDJQ">
<strong>Substratum:</strong> Fight through a maze to collect and bank Resonance to unlock the rest of The Witness’ Monolith</li>
<li id="lxzanW">
<strong>Dissipation:</strong> Fight the Herald of Finality — a Disciple version of Taniks. </li>
<li id="ubnvab">
<strong>Repository:</strong> Race through three rooms that grow in complexity, dunking Resonance along the way.</li>
<li id="LWeguF">
<strong>Verity:</strong> Free your fellow Guardians from the shadow realm by doing a lot of math.</li>
<li id="Y3VzQy">
<strong>The Witness:</strong> Defeat The Witness and its hands to make it vulnerable ahead of the final mission.</li>
</ul>
<p id="SvWvsv">Before we break down the individual encounters, it’s worth explaining the central mechanics for the first three: <strong>Substratum</strong>, <strong>Dissipation</strong>, and <strong>Repository</strong>. (Verity and The Witness boss fight lean on mostly fresh mechanics, so I’ll run through those when we get there.)</p>
<p id="zyLzgN">The first three encounters use a charging plate, some wires, Resonance, and conduits. All of them work in tandem, and you need to have a deep understanding of each to find success here.</p>

<p id="EYjctC">Every one of these encounters has between three and four pairs of <strong>plates</strong>, and the pairs are connected to each other with a <strong>wire</strong>.</p>
<p id="KMVQoQ">When you unblock these plates — usually by killing a boss enemy of some kind — one of them will begin to glow. By stepping on a glowing plate, you’ll send the energy inside of it to its pair via the wire. If you or an ally then step on the receiving plate <em>after </em>the energy arrives (it’ll start to glow) and <em>before </em>it fizzles out (the glow disappears), you’ll rebound the energy back to the original plate again and <strong>spawn Resonance</strong> nearby.</p>

<p id="JrzTFc">Gaining <strong>Resonance buffs</strong> based on shapes is the central mechanic in Salvation’s Edge, and you’ll use it the entire raid — even in the last two encounters, although it behaves a bit differently there. In the first encounter, the only Resonance that spawns comes in a triangle shape (<strong>Pyramidal Resonance</strong>). In encounter two, you’ll also gain access to ones shaped like a circle (<strong>Spherical Resonance</strong>), and encounter three adds squares (<strong>Hexahedron Resonance</strong>). </p>
<p id="NtlqSf">You can use Resonance for a couple of different things. First, you need it to interact with conduits, and second you need it to regain time at the end of each phase. </p>

<p id="pNKrUs">Sometimes, charging plates will have <strong>conduits </strong>next to them, which can either be awake or dormant. When dormant, you’ll need to supply energy to the system, which is the same thing that also awakens the plate. When a conduit is awake, you’ll see a shape in it (triangle, circle, or square) which denotes what kind of Resonance you need to activate it. Activating multiple conduits is how you spawn the <strong>Resonance bank</strong>, which you need to interact with in order to progress to the next phase of the fight. </p>
<p id="Nypcdp">Activating a conduit is a delicate process, and you need to do some things in order first:</p>
<ol>
<li id="WLhAG7">Have a Fireteam member step on the plate not connected to the conduit, which will send energy via the wire to the conduit plate</li>
<li id="qHtMFn">Shoot the conduit while you have the proper Resonance shape buff</li>
<li id="ybrX2u">Step on the plate near the conduit once the energy arrives to lock it in place</li>
</ol>
<p id="cxJui2">If you do this properly, the conduit will expand and <strong>glow bright gold</strong>, and the person who shot the conduit will <strong>lose one stack of Resonance</strong>. However, locking the conduit will cause all the Resonance created by that plate pair to disappear. So make sure you and your teammates pick up the extra Resonance (no more than three or you’ll die) first.</p>
<p id="sIytv7">Once you’ve filled three conduits full of energy, the bank will appear under The Witness’ time bomb.</p>

<p id="sLHn1V">Every encounter in this raid features a <strong>timer</strong>, which you can see<strong> </strong>at the top of your screen. If you do not complete the encounter before the timer ends, you’ll die and have to restart the encounter. But because The Witness doesn’t play fair, the timer is never long enough to complete the encounter, so you’ll need to extend or reset it. In the first three encounters, you’ll use the bank for that.</p>
<p id="8f9CMf">Once you respawn the bank, you need to take all the excess Radiance you collected before locking the conduits and put it into the bank. When you deposit your Resonance, the timer will gain additional time.</p>
<p id="ZHVllx">Keep all of these things in mind as you adventure through The Witness’ Monolith.</p>

<p id="1sC78V">Substratum takes place in a 9x9 grid, where each grid is a different room. </p>
<p id="kp25An">In the middle of the room, you’ll see a triangle (Resonance) floating above the ground. Grab it and put it into the bank — the box right in front of you. With the Resonance banked, one of The Witness’ many hands will spawn in the center room.

<p id="eMPzN8">This is where you’ll want to split into two groups of three for the rest of the fight. <strong>Pick a lead player for each team</strong> and have the other players in their squad follow them wherever they go. Deal with the Supplicants and direct one team go into the first Supplicant room and the second team to go into the other.</p>
<p id="hlNmo9">With the party split, you’ll need to work your way through multiple rooms together, as each room is connected to adjacent rooms by a door. </p>
<p id="GTRrYn">In the first room you enter, you’ll just find some Vex, so take them out and quickly move to the next open room. Here, you’ll find a <strong>Quantum Minotaur</strong> and a bunch of other Vex. Kill them all. When the Minotaur dies in your room, it will send a <strong>Vex Hydra</strong> to the other team’s second room. When the other team kills <em>that</em> Quantum Minotaur, it will send a Vex Hydra to your team’s second room. Killing the Vex Hydras will open doors for your teammates. </p>

<p id="7IlvfU">Repeat what you did at the start of the encounter and send your teams into the doors that open, minding the Supplicants. But this time, one side will eventually run into an open conduit or a lit-up plate. The team with the charged plate and open conduit should start bouncing their energy back and forth and making Resonance while the other team kills enemies and their Champion.</p>
<p id="Itfjwr">While the team with the plate starts on Resonance generation, the other team should return to the middle and kill the second Tormentor that just spawned. This will charge another conduit-and-plate pair. That team should then generate their own Resonance.</p>

<p id="03n5qP">As the teams generate Resonance, some will appear in each room, while more appear in the central chamber. The two plate players should keep the energy bouncing back and forth until they get a prompt that <strong>all the Resonance has been spawned </strong>or the timer is getting low — under a minute or so. The non-plate holder in each team should collect some Resonance from the central chamber and help out the plate players when Subjugators appear in their rooms.</p>
<p id="5vUnom">Once both teams are ready — everyone has gathered three Resonance max or as many as they can, permitting time — send the energy through the wires and lock both conduits by having a player with Resonance shoot it and then step on the nearby plate once it’s been filled with energy. </p>

<p id="u4DQiR">If you do this correctly, you’ll lock in your conduit. If both teams lock both conduits before the timer expires, a big Subjugator<strong> </strong>will spawn in the central room. Work as a team to kill it, which will in turn spawn the bank. Deposit all your Resonance to extend the timer. If you insert enough, you’ll get up to four minutes and 15 seconds total on your clock — the same as the encounter starts with. If you don’t get the max, that’s ok, but you’ll need to go fast. </p>
<p id="Lkmf0B"><strong>Repeat this entire process until you’ve done it three times</strong>. If you’re struggling with time on the third go-around, bounce the plates fewer times and don’t worry about generating or collecting as much Resonance. Just spawn the bank and deposit whatever you have as quickly as possible. </p>

<p id="CuZrgk">Now it’s time for the first boss fight, the <strong>Herald of Finality</strong> — or, as many old-hat Destiny players may know him, <strong>Taniks</strong>.</p>
<p id="wuN6yv">For this boss fight, you’ll be in close quarters, so you should bring a sword. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2020/11/23/21590451/destiny-2-lost-lament-exotic-sword-quest-dead-exo-banshees-wail">The Lament</a> works pretty good if you have one, but you can also use Falling Guillotine or anything else. If you’re not using an Exotic sword, and you have a player in your Fireteam with an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24172105/ergo-sum-how-to-get-unlock-perks">Ergo Sum</a> sword with <strong>Wolfpack Rounds</strong> on it, pair it with Legendary swords that match the weekly burn on Salvation’s Edge for some potent damage.</p>
<p id="56j0y6">The idea here is very similar to the first encounter, but this time you’ll be splitting into<strong> three groups of two</strong> and dealing with a boss instead. Send each team to one of the three areas of the map: middle (where you spawn), left (with the big tower), and right.</p>

<p id="fWGMLn">To start the fight, break the big <strong>Taken Blight</strong> in the middle of the room. This will spawn Taniks, Herald of Finality, into the center of the arena. Taniks will hang out down there and wait for you for the entire fight, and your goal is to deposit Resonance in a bank so you can break his immunity shield and fight him for real.</p>
<p id="yF7shL">However, the bank disappears when the fight begins, and you’ll need to work to get it back. </p>
<p id="EcPRxY">Have everyone start on their respective sides and clear the first three waves of enemies. The third wave will spawn with a boss-level Taken enemy called a <strong>Trammel</strong>. The middle will get a Taken Phalanx, the left will get a Taken Wizard, and the right will get a Taken Ogre. Kill the Trammel to fill the architecture with energy — i.e., charge the plates and open the conduit. That said, the conduit will display a jumbled-up symbol, rather than the clean pyramid you previously saw. Ignore it for now.</p>
<p id="PEq7Dl">Sometime during all this, three members of your Fireteam — one per side — will get summoned by Taniks to the middle of the arena and will receive the “<strong>Call to Reckoning</strong>” buff.</p>

<p id="L7gvFO">Once you kill the Trammel on your side, you or whoever was called by the Herald should jump into his arena and start <strong>shooting his forehead</strong>. It’s worth noting here that all players with “Call to Reckoning” should jump in and damage Taniks, otherwise the Blights seem to spawn slower or not at all.</p>
<p id="GceDD9">After you’ve dealt a bit of damage, Tanik’s weakspot will start to glow, and he’ll summon a Taken Blight somewhere in the arena to shield himself. These can spawn on the sides where you’re stationed or in the arena with the boss. Have all the players look around and shoot the Blights. When the shield on Taniks’ head disappears, keep shooting until it pops. You’ll then get a debuff called “<strong>Stolen Favor</strong>.”</p>
<p id="sDlGjQ">Jump out of the pit and head back to your side. If you look at the conduit, you’ll see one of two shapes: a triangle and a circle. This denotes which Resonance buff — Pyramidal or Spherical Resonance — you or your partner needs to have when you shoot the conduit to activate it. </p>

<p id="XeAI6L">Once you’re back on your side with “Stolen Favor” and have called out what your conduit needs, take one of the plates on your side and have your friend take the other. The plate furthest from Taniks always starts with the energy after you kill the Trammel, while the plate closer to Taniks has the conduit.</p>
<p id="oqAjgd">Repeat what you did in the first encounter, being careful to take down the nasty Stasis enemies and Taken Knights as quickly as possible. After every bounce of the plates, you’ll spawn a <strong>Pyramidal Resonance</strong> on one side of the arena and a <strong>Spherical Resonance</strong> on the other.</p>

<p id="5QCxet">For the back plate player: It doesn’t matter what Resonance type you pick up, as long as you leave at least one of the Resonance your side needs available for your friend.</p>
<p id="hXEBdr">However, if you’re the front plate player, you need to be very cautious with what you grab. A great tip here is to grab the opposite Resonance type that your conduit symbol is. This will give you one stack of the wrong Resonance, but you can then pick up the correct Resonance next to convert your one stack of wrong Resonance into two stacks of the correct Resonance. </p>
<p id="vNT34x">There’s one more thing worth knowing about this section. If you miss a plate after the first bounce — as in you let the energy fizzle — the Trammel on your side will spawn again and lock your conduit. You can kill the Trammel, but by doing so you’ll <strong>reset your conduit</strong>, meaning it might have a different symbol then last time. You’ll need to check it again to be sure.</p>
<p id="cfUUKX">Once you’ve collected all the Resonance you need, lock the conduits and the bank will spawn over by the edge of Taniks’ arena, by the ticking bomb and The Witness’ hand. It’s time to get ready for damage.</p>

<p id="Kot55T">Now that you’ve banked all your Resonance and regained some time, it’s time to kick Taniks’ ass. Run into the now-glowing arena and beat on him with your swords. Make sure Warlocks use <strong>Well of Radiance</strong> or <strong>Song of Flame</strong> to keep you all safe. A healing turret from the <strong>Speaker’s Mask Exotic</strong> is amazing here as well.</p>
<p id="s1AzIZ">Keep beating on Taniks until he goes immune. When that happens, jump out of the arena and repeat everything you just did. </p>

<p id="wTrQ4G">When you deal enough damage to him that he reaches the final portion of his health bar, Taniks will go into a final stand. He’ll briefly become immune, so stop trying to damage him and preserve your ammo. He’ll summon the other three Trammel bosses to assist him, but don’t get distracted. These villains weren’t threatening on the very difficult Contest version of the raid, so they shouldn’t even touch you. Just ignore them and swing at Taniks until he dies. </p>

<p id="uRmZlY">If you’ve made it this far into Salvation’s Edge, you already know everything you need to do for Repository.</p>
<p id="oyIbmB">Much like the second encounter, the arena here is broken up into three sides, each with their own plate ecosystem. Assign the teams of two to a side of the room: left, middle, and right. Each team will be responsible for killing a <strong>Tormentor</strong>, a <strong>Subjugator</strong>, and a bunch of other enemies on their side. They’ll also need to <strong>spawn Resonance</strong>, collect excess Resonance, and lock a conduit. </p>
<p id="PyJ4dU">To start the fight, pick up the square Resonance — <strong>Hexahedron Resonance</strong> — in the middle of the room and bank it in the nearby bank. This will spawn three Tormentors, one at the end of each plate. Work with your teammate to kill it, and have your allies do the same. Whichever team member gets the killing blow on the Tormentor will gain the “<strong>Stolen Favor</strong>” buff from the last encounter. This will allow you to see what kind of Resonance each conduit needs you to use to shoot it. It will also cause energy to flow into the architecture. </p>

<p id="2jZapx">Send the player without Stolen Favor back to the home plate — closest to the door — which will be ready to send energy. Then stand on the plate near the conduit with Stolen Favor. Bounce the energy back and forth to spawn either circle, triangle, or square Resonance. Each Resonance type will spawn in a quadrant of the room, so coordinate with your team where the one you need is.</p>
<p id="EWZsvo">Once you’ve bounced three or four times, you’ll have plenty of Resonance on the floor. Let the plate energy fizzle out and run around to collect the Resonance you need. Any of your teammates without Stolen Favor should stay away from Resonance until all of the buffed players have what they need. Once you have three of your Resonance and you’ve allowed time for your allies to pick up any excess shapes, kill the Subjugator near your conduit and <strong>lock the conduit in place</strong>.</p>
<p id="5BIsHk">Once you’ve locked all three conduits, the bank will appear in the middle of the room — alongside some deadly turrets. Bank to get some time back, open the door ahead of you, and spawn an <strong>Unstoppable Champion</strong>. Deal with the enemies and soldier forth. </p>
<p id="SkZrce">You have to do this three times in three rooms that get more elaborate with each run. Here’s a quick breakdown of the rooms:</p>
<h3 id="5vbA0n"><strong>How to clear the first room </strong></h3>
<p id="j5Izbn">In the first room, each side’s plate flows in a straight line, and it’s pretty open, so burning down enemies is easy. Just follow the instructions above to burn through this room as quickly as possible.</p>

<p id="0HmY2b">The third room is very hectic. Not only are there pits everywhere, but three Tormentors spawn all together in the front. The wires are also crossed here, with <strong>left side’s conduit being the middle plate</strong>, <strong>middle conduit’s being the right plate</strong>, and <strong>right conduit’s being the left plate</strong>.</p>
<p id="5Ywlox">Don’t worry about excess Resonance here, as you won’t need it anymore. Just get the shape you need and complete the conduits as quickly as possible. Once you’re done, bank your Resonance for the third time and defeat the Unstoppable Champion. The door in the back will then open up and you’ll find your loot in a nearby chest.</p>

<p id="bZMCIB">Before you do anything else, your Fireteam needs to do a <strong>drip check</strong>. That sounds like a joke, but it actually isn’t. Being able to distinguish not only your fellow Guardians from one another but also their Ghosts is crucial to completing this encounter. </p>
<p id="sJIxJI">You’ll notice six Guardian statues near where you spawn in, all of whom are <strong>decimated </strong>and have been Final Shape-ized. If you look closely, you’ll see that all of these statues represent a member of your Fireteam, and are wearing the same armor set as the real player.</p>
<p id="foUkFP">Have every member of your Fireteam <strong>change up their look</strong> and then write it down IRL (a notepad, Discord, Instagram DMs, you get the point). Next, make sure each player puts on a <strong>distinct Ghost Shell</strong>. Write it down next to their name. You need both pieces of information readily accessible to you at all times.</p>
<p id="EcJGeg">At two points per phase — so six times a fight — some or most of your Fireteam will get <strong>decimated </strong>by The Witness. This will kill them (kind of) and they’ll be frozen in place. If they’re in the shadow realm, their Ghosts will appear in the light realm with the rest of their allies. And if they’re already in the light realm — which happens during the intermission phase — their Ghosts will just appear near their bodies. </p>

<p id="3r1oO8">Any Guardians on your Fireteam who aren’t decimated will need to grab these Ghosts and run back to the statues at the start of the room, but all of the statues of decimated players will be missing. However, the decimated players can <strong>spectate </strong>through the eyes of non-decimated teammates. Through this spectate feature, each decimated player will be able to see one missing statue — although never their own — and can relay that information to allies so they can match the correct Ghost with the correct Guardian.</p>
<p id="O71ss2">When paired back up with their Guardian’s statue, the Ghost can resurrect their decimated Guardian (without using a rez token).</p>
<p id="e0DODQ">Here’s a quick example of how that works in practice:</p>
<ol>
<li id="o5jTXV">You and your Fireteam are going about your business and working on the puzzle to free your allies.</li>
<li id="wYUGs9">The three Guardians trapped inside the shadow realm get decimated.</li>
<li id="JtUlS2">The three Guardians’ Ghost Shells appear in the light realm.</li>
<li id="wvxErO">Each member in the light realm team takes a look at the Ghost they grab, checks their notes on the Guardian fashion. You call out, “Bunny Ghost Shell goes with dino Titan, can anyone see dino Titan?” </li>
<li id="WJIDtb">Holding the bunny Ghost Shell, you run back to the statues alongside the other three light realm members, who have all grabbed Ghosts and made similar calls (“Trials Ghost goes with sword Hunter, anyone see it?” or “shark Ghost goes with Root of Nightmares Warlock, where are they?”)</li>
<li id="FNXua7">The decimated players look through the eyes of their teammates and call out the glowing statue they see and where it is. The dino Titan might say “Root of Nightmares Warlock is three,” meaning they can see that their ally who owns the shark Ghost is on the third podium from the left.</li>
<li id="XJfg6e">The Guardian holding the shark Ghost dunks it in the third podium, resurrecting the Root of Nightmares Warlock.</li>
<li id="1TTyJr">Following the same train of thought, the rest of the decimated Guardians are reunited with their Ghosts and regain control of their bodies.</li>
</ol>
<p id="U2i710">You'll need to do this each phase as your players trapped in the shadow realm try to escape, and you’ll need to do it on a much larger scale during the intermission phase later.</p>

<p id="PP4VaN">When you start the encounter by hitting the “<strong>free Guardian</strong>” prompt on one of the statues, three random players will be sucked into the shadow realm. As previously mentioned, these three Guardians will all be in three solo instances of the normal arena, and will need to fend for themselves. </p>
<p id="dTTmgi">While your shadow realm teammates won’t be able to see each other, they’ll all be able to see <strong>three statues</strong> around the center stage of the room, one on the left, one in the middle, and one on the right. These statues are of the three shadow realm Guardians, and each is holding a <strong>shadowy shape</strong>. If you’re in the shadow realm, you’ll need to relay what shapes you’re seeing to your teammates.</p>
<p id="GpQBOn">For example, if the left shadow has a square, the middle shadow has a circle, and the right shadow has a triangle, you’d call out “SCT” to your allies for “square, circle, triangle,” left to right.</p>
<p id="OgPuf4">Once you’ve done that, you want to become lord of your statue’s shape and horde them in your room.</p>

<p id="BzpRlC">Look up at the big screen at the back of your room in the shadow realm. You’ll see it swap between two shapes with a little loading spiral in-between. This tells you which shapes are in your room, currently in possession of the two <strong>Hive Knights</strong> roaming around. If the two shapes on the wall match the two shapes on your statue, you’re golden. If not — which is far more likely — you’ll need to do some trading<strong> </strong>first.</p>
<p id="bEBydL">Kill your Knights and pick up any shapes that don’t match your statue. So if your room has a square and a circle, and you’re the square Guardian, kill Knights until you find a circle and pick it up. Then run over to the circle Guardian statue and tell them you’re about to give them their shape. They should have one of yours as well. Wait for them to say they’re ready to trade and do a countdown. This isn’t technically mandatory, but shapes can get lost in some kind of limbo if players are too far ahead or behind each other, so it’s best to time it out while you’re getting a grip on the fight. </p>
<p id="7AMh2R">It’s also important to only pick up and dunk one shape at a time, as picking up two will create a 3D object. Dunking a 3D object in a Guardian will despawn all your shapes and send them back to the Knights in your room. This isn’t helpful in progressing the fight, but it’s a great way to reset yourself if you accidentally pick up the wrong shape.</p>
<p id="Kxmajo">Keep trading with your fellow shadow players until everyone has their own shapes. You should only need two or three trades for this, if you need any at all. Once all three of you have become lords of your shapes, it’s time to share. The ultimate goal of the shadow realm is to collect the two shapes that your statue <em>isn’t </em>holding. So if you’re lord of the squares, you need to give away your squares before getting a circle and a triangle to escape. </p>

<p id="AQAxap">Now it’s time to do the same thing you did before with the trading. This time, grab one of your shapes and call that you’re ready for a trade. This, again, isn’t mandatory, but helpful for organizing new players. Agree on a trade partner and approach their statue. Do a countdown and then trade them. You should see the screen in the back of your room change. Repeat this until you have the shapes you need and your allies all have the shapes they need. </p>
<p id="MwsRe2">When everyone is ready, kill the Knights and grab both shapes at once this time, which will result in getting a new buff that’s a combination of the two shapes currently in your possession. With your 3D shape buff, run to the back of the room — which is normally blocked off by a barrier that looks like shattered glass. As long as your allies in the light realm are done dissecting the 3D shapes outside, you should all be able to walk through and join your friends.</p>
<p id="qfl78b">One final thing to keep in mind here is that the Witness will hit you with <strong>Catatonic Detonation</strong> during the shape-trade game. If you have a shape in your possession when this happens, it’ll still be there when you get resurrected. But try to be conscious where you die, as it’s very possible to be attacked by Ogres and Knights the moment you regain control of your body. If you die in the shadow realm, someone else will be sent in to replace you.</p>

<p id="KHkE1H">When the encounter starts, and three players get pulled into the shadow realm, the encounter will leave three others in the light realm. Here, divide yourselves into two enemy slayers and a single <strong>dissector</strong>. Keep in mind that because the teams sent in are random, you’ll need to call an audible on this, meaning that at least four people on your team need to understand how dissecting works in order to proceed.</p>

<p id="1sCLEz">When your allies go in, your job as an outside player is to help them escape. To do this, you need to create the same 3D objects for their statues that they’re collecting in the shadow realm.</p>
<p id="pknkhT">As enemies start to spawn into the room, the three statues at the front of the light realm arena will transform into the three Guardians trapped inside. You’ll also see that each of those statues are holding a 3D object, which are a combination of two of the shape buffs we’ve been dealing with all raid. Let’s go over the terminology on those before we go any further here:</p>
<ul>
<li id="KOSbO3">Cube (square + square)</li>
<li id="fDBEbd">Sphere (circle + circle)</li>
<li id="yACHEf">Pyramid (triangle + triangle)</li>
<li id="WGWm8b">Cylinder (circle + square)</li>
<li id="wIwtmy">Cone (circle + triangle)</li>
<li id="nCNgH6">Prism (triangle + square)</li>
</ul>
<p id="3FUPBY">As these shapes appear, your allies inside will call out the order of shadow shapes they see in their realm from left to right. These will be the simple shapes and not the 3D ones. For example, your teammates might call “circle, square, triangle,” which is them telling you who is lord of what shape and what order they appear in. </p>
<p id="KlAnxF">With that information, it’s time to get to work. You need to dissect the pre-existing 3D objects in each statue’s hand to remove all shapes that they are lord of from the 3D object. In the example above, circle is the left-side call. If their light realm statue has a sphere, cylinder, or prism — all 3D shapes with a circle in it — you need to remove a circle from that shape or your teammate won’t be able to get out, even if they get the key.</p>

<p id="SwpH98">To do this, you need to dunk some shapes. Kill the Knights that spawn in the room — there are three in the light realm, and each drops one shape. Following the example above, take the circle and drop it into the left-most statue so you can <strong>dissect a circle from that 3D object</strong>. This will cause the left side statue to glow, meaning it’s ready for dissection. To complete the dissection, however, you’ll need to dunk a different shape in one of the other two statues. This will cause the two shapes you dunked to <strong>trade places</strong>, removing them from their original 3D object and adding them to the other. Note that you can’t dunk a shape into a statue where that shape isn’t present, so it won’t let you dunk a circle in a statue holding a cube.</p>
<p id="XzkYOm">The most efficient way to do this is to dunk the first of each of the three shapes in the order your team called, left to right. So in the “circle, square, triangle” example, dunk a circle left, then a square middle, and a triangle right. Doing this will guarantee that you pull at least one shape out of the left and middle statue, and it’ll prepare the right statue for the next dissection.</p>

<p id="7SXkvK">Whenever you run out of Knights — as in you kill all three of them — two <strong>Unstoppable Ogres </strong>will spawn on the left and right sides of the arena. Help kill these if you’re the dissector, but they should really be the job of your bodyguards, the other two players in the room. Once they’re dead, three more Knights will spawn. You can perform this loop in perpetuity.</p>
<p id="IfKsAf">Once you spawn your second set of Knights, look to see what shape your right statue still needs and go dunk it in the other incomplete 3D object. Most of the time you can complete the 3D objects you need in just these two dissections, so you should be good at this point.</p>
<p id="Qt8t3i">To check your work and make sure your teammates are ready to come out, go through the original call and make sure those shapes do not appear in the 3D objects you’ve listed. </p>
<p id="ETv9Te">As a dissector, focusing on these shapes should be your only job. The only exception here — other than helping stun Ogres if you have time — is to help reunite Ghosts with Guardians when your shadow realm teammates get decimated.</p>
<p id="Ak33gq">Here’s a <strong>complex example</strong>.<strong> </strong>Your team calls STC — <strong>square</strong>, <strong>triangle</strong>, <strong>circle</strong>. Your starting 3D objects are:</p>
<ul>
<li id="Dkvymc">
<strong>Cube </strong>(square + square)</li>
<li id="9IjL0g">
<strong>Pyramid </strong>(triangle + triangle)</li>
<li id="QtZezE">
<strong>Sphere </strong>(circle + circle)</li>
</ul>
<p id="bCtZA2">This would be your exact order of operations:</p>
<ol>
<li id="CoSaue">Dunk square in the left statue</li>
<li id="E9sphS">Dunk triangle in the middle statue</li>
<li id="p9xehf">Verify that both left and middle change to prisms</li>
<li id="A2ondP">Dunk circle right</li>
<li id="QSlIAZ">Kill Unstoppable Ogres</li>
<li id="nhheke">Make sure you don’t need to revive decimated allies</li>
<li id="KGZjHG">Dunk square left</li>
<li id="m7qooy">Verify that left changes to a cone, and right changes to a cylinder</li>
<li id="TjBo1Y">Dunk triangle in middle</li>
<li id="5BBdC6">Dunk circle on right</li>
<li id="R5ZFUk">Verify that middle changes to a cylinder and right changes to a prism</li>
<li id="zLxsen">Double check that your objects read: cone (no square), cylinder (no triangle), prism (no circle)</li>

<p id="84PmbI">Once you finally reunite your Fireteam, the timer for the current phase will disappear, signaling that it’s time to run to the back of the room and prepare for an onslaught. Two Unstoppable Ogres will spawn on either side of the room (and, if you’re unlucky on timing, you could get two in the back of the room around the same time). Wipe out all of the enemies and then spread out in the spawn area.</p>
<p id="MVB1NC">The Witness will proceed to decimate five of the six members of your fireteam, <strong>freezing all but one</strong> of you in place. If you’re the one alive, wait for your allies to tell you the first Guardian they see, and then pick up their Ghost and match it. Once you revive them, work together to keep resurrecting your allies. You only have a minute to do this, but that should be plenty of time with the help of your teammates. </p>
<p id="r074DW">When everyone is unfrozen, repeat this entire process two more times for a total of three phases. After the final revive on the third phase, you’ll get some sweet loot, the hole in the middle of the room will become an elevator, and you’ll finally be ready to confront The Witness. </p>

<p id="NjgDMl">To start the fight, you just need to run up close to The Witness. But don’t do that just yet, as we should talk about how you want to set your team up first. The Witness has a <em>lot</em> of health in this raid, so you’ll need to do a bunch of damage if you want to kill it. It also has a pretty tight window for a final stand, so you need burst damage.</p>
<p id="hqZHb5">Hunters are obviously the class of choice here, as they offer the highest burst damage in the game. Pair <strong>Celestial Nighthawk</strong> with <strong>Marksman Golden Gun</strong> and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24172688/still-hunt-quest-wild-card"><strong>Still Hunt</strong></a> sniper rifle to chain shots over and over again on The Witness. </p>
<p id="Pwg1oa">For the other two classes, your options are a bit more limited. You can use precision weapons like linear fusion rifles, but you’ll need to move around a lot during the boss fight, so I recommend <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24172104/microcosm-how-to-get"><strong>Microcosm</strong></a>, the heavy trace rifle from <em>The Final Shape</em>. This thing not only deals a lot of damage, it also deals even <em>more</em> damage after you cast your Super. So Warlocks should be on <strong>Well of Radiance</strong> or <strong>Song of Flame</strong>, and Titans can just use <strong>Twilight Arsenal</strong> or another quick Super.</p>
<p id="hRFiAa">Other than that, you want a machine gun if possible to deal with all the enemies, and a weapon like a pulse rifle that can deal with targets at range.</p>

<p id="wNNxTH">As the encounter starts, you’ll notice The Witness has six little buttons on its jacket. These are the protective glyphs keeping its weak spot sealed away. If you want to damage The Witness — the entire point of this fight — you’ll need to get rid of those buttons. And to break the buttons, you’ll need the <strong>Glyphbreaker </strong>buff.</p>
<p id="WP6uk7">First, split your team into two groups of three: Glyphbreaker players and enemy slayer players. </p>
<p id="Zq190T">The enemy slayer players should split up so one of them is on the left, one is on the right, and the other switches between the two sides as needed. The primary threats here are the <strong>Subjugators</strong>, but they only spawn in occasionally, so be prepared for them. The more common threats are the <strong>Screebs</strong>, which will blow up you and your teammates if you don’t kill them immediately. Focus on keeping the field clear for your hand team and wait for damage to start. </p>
<p id="kjcDhb">For the Glyphbreaker players, you shouldn’t really worry about killing enemies unless you have downtime. Instead, your job is to deal with The Witness’ many hands that you’ve been unable to damage this entire raid. Now their time has come, as you can use their power against them. </p>
<p id="o9z21h">There are three kinds of hands in this encounter, and you should assign each Glyphbreaker player to each hand type just to keep it simple:</p>
<ul>
<li id="HBfmnA">
<strong>Down hand</strong>, which comes down from the ceiling, gives the Pyramidal Resonance buff, and shoots the triangle bomb from the first encounter.</li>
<li id="gvhdxP">
<strong>Up hand</strong>, which comes from the floor, gives the Spherical Resonance buff, and shoots the circular airstrike from the second encounter.</li>
<li id="qse9YC">
<strong>Wall hand</strong>, which comes out of the wall, gives the Hexahedron Resonance buff, and shoots a beam across the arena from the third encounter.</li>
</ul>

<p id="eDZC92">Each player will start the phase by locating their hand type and standing in the area that their hand is targeting — i.e., stand in the circle for the up hand before the attack hits. While inside, shoot the <strong>Resonance bangle</strong> on your hand. This will cause it to pop, revealing a green (Pyramidal Resonance), red (Hexahedron Resonance), or yellow (Spherical Resonance) bangle underneath. This tells you which buff you need to destroy this hand.</p>
<p id="LGxNlj">Now that you know your symbol, quickly find the hand that can give you the buff you need. So, if you shoot wall hand and see that you need the Pyramidal buff, go stand in the attack area of the down hand for a brief moment. After a second or two, you’ll gain the Pyramidal Resonance buff. Take that buff back to your own hand, stand in its attack aura, and immediately shoot the bangle. If done properly, you’ll destroy the hand and gain the <strong>Glyphbreaker </strong>buff.</p>
<p id="jtDX5U">However, there are a few things you need to know about this phase:</p>
<ol>
<li id="6n4pW2">Standing in your own hand too long can get you a stack of its buff, which you don’t want, so be quick when checking the bangle.</li>
<li id="o3SQu8">If you take too long and your hand leaves and re-enters somewhere else in the arena, its bangle will change and you’ll need to start again, so you have to be quick. You can reset the hand’s timer by having an enemy slayer player shoot the Resonance bangle like you did earlier, but doing this too many times can cause The Witness to summon more hands.</li>
<li id="q4XLMG">Only stand in an enemy hand’s attack aura to get the buff if they’re not about to attack. These attacks can kill you if you’re in them when they go off, so the idea is to quickly dip in, get the buff, and get out before the attack happens.</li>
<li id="OEUVKX">Destroying a hand will give you a stack of that hand’s buff, and you can’t ever have more than three Resonance at once. That means that you need someone else to shoot your hand for you if you already have three Resonance.</li>
<li id="zda80j">Stacking your Resonance too high can drastically alter the flow of the fight, so be deliberate with your movements and be careful not to stand in another attack by accident or you’ll override your buff and gain another stack.</li>
<li id="NyReXh">Destroying a hand can trigger a trap from The Witness, which I’ll explain more in the next section.</li>
</ol>

<p id="uP3Ssc">When all three players have Glyphbreaker, jump over to the root platform together and each destroy a button. You can do this while anywhere in the arena, but popping a glyph on the platform will cleanse your buffs and give you a fresh start. If any of your allies accidentally have some Resonance on them, have them join you on the cleansing plate. </p>
<p id="ss7XVB">Repeat this entire process again and destroy all six glyphs. When the sixth glyph pops, you and your team will enter the damage phase, so make sure everyone is ready and the enemies on the sides are mostly dead.</p>

<p id="2Zq66i">As mentioned, once per phase — as in once per every six glyphs popped — The Witness will devise a <strong>trap </strong>for you when you destroy one of its hands and gain Glyphbreaker. This can’t happen on the first or sixth hand broken, though. </p>
<p id="cVsXpA">The moment you break the hand, you’ll see a prompt that says “<strong>The Witness tests you</strong>.” The moment you pop a hand, you have to check to see if you got the prompt or not, as the last hand destroyed is the key to foiling The Witness here. If you pop two hands too close together, you can make it hard to tell what the solution will be. </p>
<p id="kIMDNU">Determine the hand type that spawned the test and then have your Glyphbreaker players look to the middle of the room. This mechanic — like dissection — is easier the fewer people you have messing with it, so limit it to three players. In front of The Witness, you’ll see a bunch of Resonance crystals floating in mid-air. You need to create a shape — square, circle, or triangle — that matches the hand type that was just destroyed.</p>

<p id="rdvjTl">Check out the great map from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MacticsG1">Mactics</a> above for the shapes you’re trying to make.</p>
<p id="tYHUta">Here’s a quick example. If you break the wall hand and it spawns the trap, you’ll need to destroy all of the Resonance crystals that aren’t part of the square shape. If you shoot any of the wrong symbols, you’ll get killed by the trap, so be very careful. When the remaining crystals are in the shape of a square, leave them alone. If you get the correct shape, you’ll get a prompt that says “The Witness’ trap is foiled.” </p>
<p id="8oMqen">However, foiling The Witness’ trap doesn’t mean you’re safe. When the trap ends, The Witness will rear back and push its hands forward, creating a shockwave that travels along the entire arena. This will kill anyone touching the ground, so the entire Fireteam needs to jump. The tell here is when The Witness’ eyes glow and you hear a noise akin to a sword getting drawn. Jump when you see that and don’t touch the ground until after the attack ends.</p>

<p id="6R42Mt">There’s a rhythm to the damage phase you’ll need to get used to. If you have a player with a keen eye — or one that’s using <strong>Divinity </strong>and can get a wider picture of the battlefield — have them give the team callouts on where to go and how to move.</p>
<p id="HjJ5rz">The Witness’ crit spot is the glowing slit in its chest, and it’ll open up once the platform reaches its max height. As soon as it opens, start shooting, but keep an eye on The Witness’ <strong>hands and eyes</strong>. It will shoot massive beams that cover half of the platform at a time, so you’ll need to shift left to right as you go. It’ll also do the wipe mechanic from the trap and shine its eyes, so you’ll need to be ready to jump as well. Sometimes it’ll even do both at once, which is pretty tough to avoid. <strong>Healing grenades </strong>are amazingly effective for this, as you can throw one at your feet if you get clipped by a beam and still survive.</p>

<p id="IvC32s">The Witness will tire for a few seconds after it attacks three or four times. During this very short downtime, all you need to focus on is damage. Before long, The Witness will be at it again, slinging beams and blowing up the floor. The old MMO adage “<strong>dead DPS is zero DPS</strong>” is very apt here, so play your life above everything else. </p>
<p id="llbSm0">Eventually, The Witness will look annoyed and do a slow rear back to slam the plate down. Jump off the back and immediately start killing enemies or The Witness will kill you. Repeat this entire process until you reach the final stand, but keep in mind that you only have three phases to do this, so you need to hit hard when you get the chance.</p>
<p id="eUFBSm">For the <strong>final stand</strong>, The Witness will briefly become immune. Its chest will open back up, allowing you to continue damage, and it will keep slinging attacks at you. After 15 to 20 seconds, it will kill everyone unless you kill it first, so push as hard as you can and use everything you’ve got. </p>
<p id="HsIqyS">If you manage to “kill” the Witness, it will retreat and give you a very big loot chest as your reward. Now it’s time to chase the boss down with some fellow Guardians in the campaign’s final mission, “Excision.”</p>

                <p>An unofficial database of Epic Games Store game listings known as EpicDB has evidently leaked some upcoming PC ports of major games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/">The Last Of Us Part 2</a>. The leak also appeared to reveal information about other unreleased games.</p><p dir="ltr">By pilfering Epic Games Store files, leakers uncovered a Sony Interactive Entertainment game listed under the code name "Utah," and are claiming it's a PC port for The Last of Us Part 2. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-2-pc-is-reportedly-complete-despite-no-official-announcement/1100-6523959/">PC port is reportedly already complete</a>, but no release date has been announced--possibly as a result of Naughty Dog wanting to wait to launch the PC version of the game alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-will-be-shorter-than-season-1-but-more-seasons-could-be-on-the-way/1100-6523975/">the release of Season 2 of The Last Of Us television series</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1800703429456834638" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">EpicDB (a SteamDB equivalent) launched and appears to be leaking many unannounced projects under codenames <a href="https://t.co/5UwhvaEoZ1" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/5UwhvaEoZ1</a><br>Some of the listings include <br>-FFXVI (Skobeloff)<br>-FFIX Remake (Momo) with a Tetra Master Starter Pack &amp; Thief's Knives bonus <br>-Turok from Saber<br>-The… <a href="https://t.co/cIqiF2wZUp" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/cIqiF2wZUp</a></p>  — Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1800703429456834638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The database also reportedly leaked an upcoming PC port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption/">Red Dead Redemption</a>, though an employee at Dealabs Magazine has suggested that the suspected Red Dead Redemption 2 PC port--codenamed "Selma" in the leak--<a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1800868355571921225" rel="nofollow ">isn't legitimate</a>. The leak also suggests that Rockstar's long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/">GTA 6</a> will be coming to PC as well--possibly right at launch, though Take-Two has not offered any hint of this in promotional material.</p><p dir="ltr">Other interesting titles included in the leak include a project called "Momo," which is thought to be a remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-ix/">Final Fantasy IX</a>, and a project entitled "Skobeloff," which is reportedly a PC port of 2023's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/">Final Fantasy XVI</a>--a conclusion leakers came to due to preorder bonus information included in the database. The latter was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-version-is-in-final-stage-of-optimization/1100-6521748/">reported to be in the final stages of optimization</a> back in March, lending credence to the theory that "Skobeloff" is indeed the game's upcoming PC port.</p><p dir="ltr">But unfortunately for leak-lovers, EpicDB--which works similarly to <a href="https://steamdb.info/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>--has already <a href="https://epicdb.org/" rel="nofollow ">been taken offline</a>, and Epic Games has made moves to prevent similar leaks from happening again in the future.</p><p>"We released an update tonight so third-party tools can't surface any new unpublished product titles from the Epic Games Store catalogue," an Epic Games spokesperson said (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-database-appears-to-list-dozens-of-upcoming-pc-games-including-turok" rel="nofollow ">via Eurogamer</a>).</p><p>As such, we're unlikely to see similar leaks from Epic for any more big games. However, we'll know in due time if the information has already been leaked ends up being accurate.</p>

<p data-characters="320" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You are floating in space, and all around you are meters and numbers. A derelict hunk of spacecraft, left behind and abandoned, could be the key to the Cryo you need to stay ahead of your past. But right now, you’re staring at pips, bars, meters, and dice, all of which are telling you one thing: you might be screwed.</p> <p data-characters="528" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">Because right now, you’ve got a die that could make or break this gig. You’ll either crack the last security measure needed to break through or start up some new calamity to deal with as the space hulk continues to tear apart in the vacuum. So, you push. You exert your body, stressing it a bit further than you should, just to try and bump that low-roll die a little higher. The tension in that moment is <em>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</em>, to me. It’s the push to risk it, just to stay ahead of the ever-rising tide.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gzA9--gmfNw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">The original <em>Citizen Sleeper </em>was a fantastic meld of tabletop and virtual ideas. Sleepers, for those who missed the first game, are digitized human souls within artificial bodies. Before, you were on the run from corporate interests who wanted their “property” back; here, you’re a Sleeper again, but now on the run with a friend named Serafin, after trying to rewire your body and free you from servitude.</p>
 <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">At its outset, <em>Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>feels much like the first. Each cycle, you can roll a new set of dice based on how much energy you have. Then, you slot those die into an activity—exploring a part of a station, talking to some locals, doing an odd job, etc.—to see whether you get a positive, neutral, or negative outcome. A higher roll, like a five, may offer nothing but good or neutral outcomes, while a one or two could have you rolling on a 50-50 chance to either go neutral or take a negative result.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="832" data-injectable="true">This resource management forms the core of <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> and its sequel, and it still works well. Landing on the remote space station of Hexport, you and Serafin spend a few cycles just getting to know the lay of the land. You know you have heat on your tail, measured by a different clock, counting down towards impending doom. So in case you were wondering why you’d even take a roll on a one or two, that’s why: the clocks are always counting, and sometimes a risky roll could save you from a different clock’s countdown.</p>
 <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false">Both games have you trying to outrun your past, in your own way. Where <em>Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>puts a surprising new spin on things is in its newfound drive of crews.</p> <figure data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-space-cowboy" data-injectable="false">Space cowboy</h2> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">In my time with a preview build of <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, I was able to pull off two different jobs; contract offers where I’d take my ship out to some part of the system, complete the work, and return for, hopefully, some rewards. Where the first game mostly took place on or around Erlin’s Eye, this one lets you use your ship to actually move around the space in each system, adding in considerations like supplies and fuel.</p>
 <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">Taking on a job will mean putting together a crew, too. In one gig, my crew was essentially laid out for me, while another optional one let me bring along a character I’d grown to know while exploring the space station. It was a neat way to tie in the choices I’d made thus far. More than just having a familiar face I could rely on, <em>Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>lets some of those faces join your adventuring party, at least temporarily, to tackle these difficult jobs.</p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">And let me tell you, the jobs are tough. In one, I was trying to pick apart a ship, dismantling it while searching for a data core I needed to barter for some special-order parts. At all times, I was surrounded by different meters. Clocks and progress bars showed me how far I’d dug into the ship, but also how close I was to breaking it all apart.</p> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">For each bad roll, and even some neutral ones, I risked tripping some sort of security system, or a haphazard cut creating a new gash in the wreckage, becoming an even greater danger down the road if not dealt with ASAP. I had to think carefully about how I wanted to assign each die, because both my own character and my chosen teammates (Serafin and a young hacker named Juni) had their own strengths and weaknesses. We were particularly adept at prying into technical systems, for instance, but had to rely on Serafin for any physical work.</p>
 <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Each character has their own stress meters too, eventually leading to them burning out on the job if I overworked them. But the player does have one trump card: the ability to “push.” Each turn, depending on what kind of Sleeper I was playing, I could “push” to try and put my thumb on the scales of luck. For my chosen archetype, that meant accruing one point of stress to re-roll my lowest numbered die. A gamble, for sure; but when the difference between a successful gig and a shattered hunk of space junk was just a few pips, I took that chance.</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">I’m curious to see how those jobs play out over time, and how <em>Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>keeps the tension as your own Sleeper gains better tools and abilities over time. But in those two gigs, each one felt like a victory on razor-thin margins in the best ways.</p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CitizenSleeper2Story.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Jump Over The Age</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">What really works, though, is how <em>Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>then brings it all back home. Each job had its own wind-down, where a climax would be reached, decisions would be made, and relationships affected. Some were as simple as recognizing another’s diligent work. Others were huge complications at the eleventh hour, forcing me to make a hard choice in the moment without any assurances that I could still come out ahead.</p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">Where <em>Citizen Sleeper 1 </em>felt like trying to stay ahead of the constantly accruing costs and debts of life on the Eye, <em>Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>feels like trying to keep ahead of a tidal wave. You could ride the chaos or be swallowed up by it at any moment.</p> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="752" data-injectable="true">Yet where community gave me a solid basis on Erlin’s Eye, here it was the growing group dynamics and comradery that kept me going in <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>. The locations don’t feel quite so distinct, compared to the Eye, but it gives more room for people and their unique situations to shine through. I already dig characters like Juni, Nia, and Serafin, and can’t wait to learn more about their histories, situations, and how they might accompany my Sleeper on their starward journey towards freedom.</p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false"><em>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector </em>keeps a lot of what made the first game exceptional, and adds a few more wrinkles in the process. It’s a different format, one that might even seem a bit overwhelming at first. But if the target stays centered on these excellent heists and characters, then I could see the potential for lightning to strike twice for Jump Over the Age.</p> <p data-characters="66" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="false"><em>Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>is aiming for early 2025 on PC, PS5, and Switch.</p>

<p data-characters="174" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Fatal Fury</em> is back and fans could not be more excited to return to South Town and see —after multiple crossovers— Terry Bogard and Rock Howard back in the leading roles. </p> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false">But with the exception of the duo, which characters are set to be featured in the game’s main roster? Here are all the characters confirmed to be present in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/fatal-fury/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fatal Fury City of the Wolves</a></em>. </p> <h2 id="h-all-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-confirmed-characters" data-injectable="false">All Fatal Fury City of the Wolves confirmed characters</h2> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">Apart from Terry and Rock, B. Jenet, Preecha, Vox Reaper, Marco Rodrigues, Hotaru Futaba, and Tizoc are confirmed to be part of the <em>Fatal Fury City of the Wolves</em> main roster. You can check out an overview of each of them, as well as their trailers below.</p>
 <h2 id="h-rock-howard" data-injectable="false">Rock Howard</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via SNK Corporation</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">Terry’s protegee and Geese Howard’s son, <em>City of the Wolves</em> marks Rock’s second outing as the series’ co-protagonist. Like in<em> Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em>, Rock seems to be a rushdown character capable of excelling by both keeping opponents in check and closing the distance fast. As you can see below, he still retains his original moves, as well as the ones learned from Terry and inherited through his blood. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW｜ROCK｜TERRY｜HOTARU｜TIZOC｜PREECHA" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydRUmigKzJM?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-terry-bogard" data-injectable="false">Terry Bogard</h2> <figure data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via SNK Corporation</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">It wouldn’t be a <em>Fatal Fury</em> title without the Hungry Wolf, am I right? Not much is known about Terry’s story within the game, except for the fact that he spent years fighting after he and his disciple went their separate ways in the previous entry. Terry did not receive a focused trailer. Instead, his official showcase can be seen in the trailer featured in our Rock entry. The trailer also stars Preecha, Hotaru Futaba, and Tizoc.</p>
 <h2 id="h-preecha" data-injectable="false">Preecha</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via SNK Corporation</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">Making her debut in the franchise, Preecha is both a talented scientist and Joe Higashi’s pupil. She makes use of an adapted form of Muay Thai in combat and as we could expect, seems to play similarly to how her master does. You can check out her gameplay in the trailer featured within the Rock section. </p>
 <h2 id="h-hotaru-futaba" data-injectable="false">Hotaru Futaba</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via SNK Corporation</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">One of the best characters among the<em> Mark of the Wolves</em> roster, Hotaru Futaba returns. According to her official summary, her goal in the game is to once and for all get her older brother back. As their stories are deeply intertwined, her summary all but confirms Gato as part of the game’s main roster. Like with Terry and Preecha, you can check out Hortaru’s moveset in the trailer under the Rock entry. </p>
 <h2 id="h-tizoc" data-injectable="false">Tizoc</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via SNK Corporation</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true">A soon-to-be main for many of the King and Zangief players we all love to face, Tizoc also makes his return in <em>CoTW</em>. Now back into the ring for good, The Griffen Mask joins the newly announced KOF tournament to lift the spirits of one of his fans. To see a glimpse of his moveset, go to the trailer featured in our Rock entry. </p>
 <h2 id="h-marco-rodrigues" data-injectable="false">Marco Rodrigues</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via SNK Corporation</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><em>City of the Wolves</em> marks Marco’s first appearance in any SNK game since 2006’s <em>SNK Vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash DS</em>. Once more making use of Kyokugen Karate, the Brazilian sensei enters the new KOF tournament in the hopes of both recovering his stolen Dojo sign and spreading the word about his fighting style. </p>

Jenet</h2> <figure data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via SNK Corporation</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">A fan favorite since her debut in <em>Mark of the Wolves</em>, it was clear that B. Jenet would return on <em>CoTW</em>. This time, the captain of the Lillien Knights joins the KOF tournament for a chance to face both Grant and Kai again. As you can see in the trailer below, she seems to have access to most of her previous moves. But she won’t be limited to them, as showcased by the counter that took the internet by storm since her reveal.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="FATAL FURY: CotW ｜B.

 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">An assassin for hire, who is taken under Grant’s wing after failing to kill <em>Mark of the Wolves</em>‘ villain Kain R. Heinlein, Vox Reaper features what I can only call a caffeine-infused version of his master’s playstyle. His motivation in the game seems to be to both honor Grant’s wishes and see Kai’s ambitions fulfilled.</p> <figure data-current-count="649" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="FATAL FURY: CotW ｜VOX REAPER" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rRHPunjhqGM?start=30&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>

<p data-characters="419" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If there’s one thing Capcom fans haven’t been quiet about over the years, it’s their desire for a new entry in the <em>Dino Crisis </em>series. Capcom hasn’t outright dashed these hopes either, and even included it as an option in a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/recent-capcom-survey-once-again-pokes-the-dino-crisis-interest-bear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent survey</a> that covered a ton of burning questions. Naturally, fans delivered, choosing <em>Dino Crisis </em>as the title they’d most like to see get a sequel or new game.</p> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Before we get into a breakdown of <a href="https://captown.capcom.com/en/super_elections/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the results</a>, let’s poke that <em>Dino Crisis </em>bear again. Capcom’s 1999 PlayStation slice of dinosaur horror garnered 80,769 votes to be named the “Capcom game series that you would like to see get a sequel or a new game.” <em>Mega Man </em>came in second, and <em>Devil May Cry </em>came in third.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true">While <em>Dino Crisis </em>made a deep impression on the global top 10, Japan opted for <em>Ace Attorney </em>as its most-wanted sequel with a little over 14,000 votes. Some of Capcom’s <em>other</em> notably dormant series got some love, too. <em>Darkstalkers </em>came in sixth place globally, followed by <em>Okami </em>and <em>Onimusha</em>. <em>Breath of Fire </em>sits at the bottom of the top 10 around the world, but Japan deemed it worthy of sixth place overall.&nbsp;It’s worth noting that these options were all provided. </p>
 <h2 id="h-remade-in-the-shade" data-injectable="false"><strong>Remade in the shade</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">There are many good takeaways in this poll, and it’s so fun to sift through in general. For instance, when you factor in the age ranges for most-wanted sequels, the youngest demographic wants more <em>Devil May Cry</em>. Conversely, the mid-range of people in the 30s and 40s want <em>Dino Crisis</em>, while the real veterans of the console wars in the 50s and 60s just want to jam some <em>Darkstalkers</em>.&nbsp;Let them eat. </p>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">Outside of the love for <em>Dino Crisis</em>, fans let Capcom know which games they’d like to see “completely remade with the latest technology, including character design and story direction.” Third place went to <em>Breath of Fire I, II, and III</em>, while the original <em>Onimusha </em>trilogy placed second. With 87,706 votes scattered about, first place ended up being a grab bag of games, from the first three <em>Mega Man </em>entries to <em>Rival Schools</em>, <em>Final Fight</em>, <em>Ace Attorney</em>, and the <em>Gargoyle’s Quest </em>games.</p>
 <h2 id="h-everybody-loves-dante" data-injectable="false"><strong>Everybody loves Dante</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">According to Capcom Town, over 250,000 votes were cast during the latest Capcom Super Election. A cavalcade of mostly-male voters (82 percent versus 14 percent female and 4 percent “other”) came through, predominantly in their 20s and 30s. The United States took the cake for votes cast out of the 220 countries that participated. Over 71,000 votes came from the U.S., with Japan coming in second at nearly 53,000.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="685" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">The real winner in all of this was undoubtedly <em>Devil May Cry </em>star Dante. The results for the first question, “Which of the following Capcom games do you like the best?,” saw <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-devil-may-cry-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devil May Cry 5</a></em> on top, with <em>Dino Crisis </em>and <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>coming in second and third, respectively. Dante also narrowly beat out Leon S. Kennedy as the favorite Capcom character, with the silver fox wearing the crown both in Japan and around the world. Women sided with Leon for the most part, but still placed Dante in second. As for the top women of Capcom, <em>Resident Evil</em>‘s Jill Valentine led the global list, and <em>Street Fighter</em>‘s Chun-Li was Japan’s true World Warrior.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">When it comes to Capcom, it looks like fans want more of their favorite games and characters to mount a comeback. In the “complaints” department, 103,331 people said they wish Capcom would “Reboot previous IPs!” Considering the fact that the top three for “What was the first Capcom game you played?” turned out to be <em>Mega Man</em> (1), <em>Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</em> (2), and <em>Resident Evil </em>(3), I think it’s safe to say The Olds came out in droves to let their voices be heard. </p>
 <p data-characters="75" data-current-count="75" data-injectable="false">Now get on it, Capcom. Give us the <em>Dino Crisis </em>game we so desperately need.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/lego-fortnite-will-soon-add-both-cozy-mode-and-an-expert-mode-with-permadeath/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=lego-fortnite-will-soon-add-both-cozy-mode-and-an-expert-mode-with-permadeath<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="410" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Epic Games is adding two new difficulty modes to their <em>Lego Fortnite</em> game, with the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-v30-10-adds-cozy-mode-and-expert-mode">v30.10 update</a>. The update is set to arrive on June 13, 2024, and will offer players more variety in gameplay. The new Cozy and Expert mode feature different game settings; where the Cozy mode is built for casual players who are new to survival games, the Expert mode is for seasonal survival game players who like a challenge.</p> <h2 id="h-getting-cozy" data-injectable="false">Getting Cozy</h2> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">In the Cozy mode, players can create a world and be accompanied by Slumber, “a friendly face” who will guide the player through their journey into the new world. The default Cozy mode settings ensure that all enemies are set at easy difficulty, and players do not have to worry about survival settings such as hunger, temperature, stamina, friendly damage, and more, as they are disabled. However, players can turn any of these settings on or off, based on their preferences.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-now-for-the-experts" data-injectable="false">Now, for the Experts</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">As for the Expert mode, the Storm-Wild creatures will deal more damage, move faster, and have more health. The Expert mode also enables the permadeath mode. This means that if a player dies in a world set on Expert mode, they will lose all progress. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">However, if players have the new Totem of Return equipped, they will respawn back at their bed with their backpack. To gain the Totem of Return in <em>Lego Fortnite</em>, players have to unlock its recipe first by adding a Storm Core to the inventory. Players can get Storm Cores from Storm-Wild enemies.</p> <p data-characters="58" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">Here are all the Storm-Wild enemies players can encounter:</p> <ul data-found-items="19" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="1113" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0">Storm-Wild Blaster</li> <li data-index="1">Storm-Wild Bone Wolf</li> <li data-index="2">Storm-Wild Brute</li> <li data-index="3">Storm-Wild Frost Brute</li> <li data-index="4">Storm-Wild Frost Roller</li> <li data-index="5">Storm-Wild Frost Scorpion</li> <li data-index="6">Storm-Wild Frost Wolf</li> <li data-index="7">Storm-Wild Hermit Crab</li> <li data-index="8">Storm-Wild Sand Brute</li> <li data-index="9" data-injectable="true">Storm-Wild Sand Roller</li>
 <li data-index="10">Storm-Wild Sand Scorpion</li> <li data-index="11">Storm-Wild Sand Spider</li> <li data-index="12">Storm-Wild Sand Wolf</li> <li data-index="13">Storm-Wild Scorpion</li> <li data-index="14">Storm-Wild Skeleton</li> <li data-index="15">Storm-Wild Scoundrels</li> <li data-index="16">Storm-Wild Spider</li> <li data-index="17">Storm-Wild Stone Roller</li> <li data-index="18">Storm-Wild Wild Wolf</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="false">While <em>Lego Fortnite</em> settings on the Cozy mode can be altered at will, the same is not the case for the Expert mode. All settings on the Expert mode cannot be changed, with all enemies including Storm-Wild enemies set on hard difficulty, and all survival aspects such as hunger, stamina, temperature, and permadeath are turned on by default.</p>

While the statement only says that they’re dropping the actor for “various reasons,” it most likely has to do with reporting by Shūkan Bunshun that alleged the actor had a four-and-a-half year affair with a much younger fan.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Toru Furuya <a href="https://x.com/torushome/status/1793117084354072797">posted a message</a> on Twitter back in May to apologize to fans. In his statement, he confirmed the affair with the fan, who was reportedly 37 years younger than him, as well as the fact that he, at one point, struck her. He also reportedly coerced the woman into getting an abortion after she became pregnant.</p> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">Following the reporting, many companies chose to distance from the actor, with the Showroom streaming service <a href="https://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/news/202405240000428.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping his program</a> and his appearance at Momocon 2024 <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2024-05-22/voice-actor-toru-furuya-no-longer-appearing-at-momocon-2024-following-of-his-4-year-affair-with-fan/.211069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being canceled</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Toru Furuya is a prolific voice actor, with roles going back to the ‘60s. He’s lent his voice to characters such as Yamcha from <em>Dragon Ball</em>, Amuro Ray in <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em>, and Tuxedo Mask in <em>Sailor Moon</em>. He also, for a time, voiced Mario in the anime movie <em>Super Mario Bros: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!</em>, as well as various commercials.</p> <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="false">Atlus has stated that they’ll announce who is filling the role in July. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is slated to be released on October 11, 2024.</p>

		<p>Marc Meyer, President of Oxide Games, announced on the Official Xbox Podcast that the 4X grand strategy game, Ara: History Untold, will be released on September 24th. Additionally, it will be accessible on PC Game Pass from day one. Ara: History Untold will be sold on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2021880/Ara_History_Untold/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ara-history-untold/9pddrvkpf6kg">Microsoft Store</a> too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ara: History Untold Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rydV9OxFzwA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ara: History Untold has a living world where life can be observed from planes flying in the sky, to kids playing in playgrounds, and wildlife roaming the natural habitats. In each new game, the world of Ara: History Untold will be randomly generated. The aim in Ara: History Untold is to become the most powerful and prestigious country, which can be done through multiple means. There is the classic way of conquest to expand territory and exerting military power, to being an economic or religious powerhouse. Your nation can even gain Prestige as a nation that leads as a beacon of hope.</p>
<p>In the podcast, Marc Meyer said, “<em>Each of the leaders has sort of this unique hero trait that that sets them apart from everyone else. They’ve got these set of traits that they share with each other and they kind of dictate a little bit of the underlying pieces of their personality and they dictate how they’re going to get along with each other… It lets us have a huge variety in the different leaders that we offer and so that playing each one of them is very different. As your nation grows, and as you gather people, you’ll gain claims that will let you take over pieces of land and grow your empire and find new places to build and new resources to exploit. And so, it’s all this self-fulfilling system where you grow so that you can grow more, and you can get more land and you can get more resources. And then you take those resources, and you refine them through our crafting system to produce amenities that will improve the quality of life of your people.”</em></p>

<p>Meyer also spoke about how multiplayer works in Ara: History Untold. The game will use a simultaneous turns, where everyone submits their move at the same time. The game will then resolve the moves at the same time, instead of completing one action at a time for each player. This is seen as a fairer way because it means all players have a chance at claims, regardless of if they submit first or last.</p>

For folks looking to do everything, the creative director suggested between 50 to 60 hours. </p><p>“For a guy with a family and a job, it’s still a fair amount of time,” Gerighty told <em>VGC</em>, “But it’s not <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> epic, 200 hours’ worth of gameplay. So that allows us to really focus on the detail, it allows us to focus, maybe with a smaller team, on executing something that is manageable.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894">In <em>Kotaku’s </em>hands-on preview of <em>Outlaws</em></a></span>, Alyssa Mercante noted the amount of detail on display in the game, explaining that she sometimes just wanted to stop playing and look around the incredibly dense <em>Star Wars</em> locales in the game’s SGF demo.

It’s not possible, animation said, it’s not possible in terms of the scope. So, OK, we can live without that, we’ll do without it, there’s plenty of other things that we can explore,” said Gerighty. <br></p><p>But, the director also explained that sometimes plans change and you end up making stuff you never intended to when you first started development. </p><p> “All of the mini-games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-video-game-arcade-canon-ubisoft-gamer-1851531170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-video-game-arcade-canon-ubisoft-gamer-1851531170">[like Sabacc and the arcade games</a></span>] that we have...none of those were planned originally, so those were added during the development, so there’s a little bit of give and take.”</p><p>  <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> launches  August 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="257" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Aksys Games has announced that the next installment of their <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fitness-boxing/">Fitness Boxing</a></em> series is coming West this Fall. Previously announced for Japan, <em>Fitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku</em> is a version of <em>Fitness Boxing</em> that features <em>Hatsune Miku</em>, if that wasn’t clear.</p> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">If you’re unfamiliar, <em>Fitness Boxing</em> is an alleged exercise game where you perform various boxing punches in time to pop music instrumentals. If you’re unfamiliar with <em>Hatsune Miku</em>, she’s a Vocaloid voicebank that broke free from her software prison to become a full-fledged pop star. If you’re unfamiliar with Vocaloid, it’s a voice synthesizer so you can experience what it’s like to control a computerized voice before they control us.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Fit Boxing feat. 初音ミク -ミクといっしょにエクササイズ- [Nintendo Direct&nbsp;2023.9.14]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLV7C14B_80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">It’s not a terribly weird mix when you consider that <em>Hatsune Miku</em> is a music… thing and <em>Fitness Boxing</em> is a rhythm game. However, she’s not what I think of when I think about fitness or boxing. We last saw <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-download-fitness-boxing-fist-of-the-north-star/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fitness Boxing: Fist of the North Star</a></em>, and while that’s a license that isn’t focused on boxing, it is at least fighting-adjacent. Punches are often thrown.</p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false"><em>Fitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku </em>will set you up to train with Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin, Kagamine Len, and Megurine Luka, with Lin and Evan from the core <em>Fitness Boxing</em> series joining as instructors. I don’t know who any of these people are.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-was-the-dragon-age-veilguard-reveal-trailer-like-that.899739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-reveal-trailer-bad-bowie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I know that a new video game is more than just its initial trailer. And I know that a game that’s been in development for as long as the new <em>Dragon Age</em> is bound to be compared to the imagined, perfect version of it in my mind. And I know that, as a fan of <em>Dragon Age</em>, as long as I get to kill Solas I will be fine. But still the question remains: why did the reveal trailer for <em>Dragon Age: Veilguard</em> suck so bad?</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4F3N4Lxw4_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Veilguard</em> having a weird and bad trailer is part of the long legacy of EA not knowing how the fuck to market their own games. <em>Dragon Age</em> has been the victim of this before—for whatever reason, a 2009 trailer for <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrFSKkQRW8A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“This Is The New Shit” by Marilyn Manson</a>. It was a bizarre choice for a dark fantasy game at the time, and now gives the game the stink of being associated with an artist who has been <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/marilyn-manson-sued-sexual-assault-minor-1234670671/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credibly accused of sexual assault by multiple women</a>, including in <a href="https://people.com/marilyn-manson-settles-lawsuit-over-sexual-assault-and-abuse-allegations-before-trial-begins-8303153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one case assaulting a minor</a>.</p><p>Given what I know about <em>Dragon Age</em>’s fanbase (this game has broken up more than one real life friendship that I know of because someone played <em>Inquisition</em> and then fell in love with Solas and got very defensive about their new parasocial relationship with a fictional bald elf who committed genocide and wants to do it again), licensing a David Bowie song for this new trailer seems, at first, like a better choice. But the pieces just don’t come together. While I think that the art style looks much better in the gameplay video, combined with the Whedonesque quips, it comes off like <em>Dragon Age</em> with all the rough edges sanded off.&nbsp;</p><p>As a player, those rough edges—the places where the characters are alienated by your choices as a player, or where the lore doesn’t quite make sense so you get <em>more</em> lore to make it all sort of congeal, or where the writing humanizes characters who would otherwise be irredeemable—those things are <em>Dragon Age</em> to me. Not necessarily darkness and grittiness, like a Marilyn Manson song choice suggests, but a sense of a world that is much bigger than simply good and evil, light and dark.</p><p>Most frustrating is this really weird cover of one of David Bowie’s best songs ever. It’s “Heroes” interpreted as an unironic arena rock song rather than a melancholic longing for the idea of heroism that the singer knows doesn’t actually exist. It is such a wrongheaded rendition of the song that it honestly feels disrespectful of the dead. Worse than that, it does a poor job of setting the tone of what the wildly different and much better gameplay reveal trailer shows: this is a game where one of the members of your party has to stop their old friend from ending the world. The original version of the song would have matched that tone handily!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Gameplay Reveal" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The gameplay trailer does actually show all the things I wanted to see. It is much darker in tone and also in its color palate. The dramatic lighting does a lot of work to highlight the sharp edges in the stylized art, bringing it closer to <em>Dishonored</em> than <em>Overwatch</em>. It also demonstrates the central conflict of the story in a much better way, and in a way that makes the stakes much clearer. You aren’t just getting a team together for some generic purpose. You’re in the final act of a conflict that has been brewing for centuries, and the way you navigate it will be reflected in the world and characters.</p><p><em>Dragon Age</em> is a series that differentiates itself from the glut of dark fantasy slop in its specifics. The <em>Veilguard</em> reveal trailer doesn’t really show you any of that—I’m happy to know that it’s there, but I wish EA had a better understanding of the game they’re trying to sell.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sigma-ruined-ninja-gaiden-2-ninja-gaiden-sigma-2-so-a-modder-is-fixing-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ninja Gaiden</em> for Xbox is one of the greatest games ever made. When it came out in 2004 it was a jaw-dropping HD showpiece for the console. Mechanically, it is a work of art that turned basic actions in a space into a ballet of violence. Few games since have felt as good, and one of the few that does was the follow-up <em>Ninja Gaiden II </em>for the Xbox 360. Of course, <em>II</em> was not initially perfect: the game was badly optimized, brutally difficult, unbalanced and about a third too long. As a result it was not received as well as the first game. So when it came time to port <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> to other platforms like the PS3 with <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em>, Team Ninja radically changed the game. That is the version you can buy on Steam, and a <em>lot </em>of diehard fans dislike it. One modder has spent years building modding tools to right the wrongs of <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NGII | how to smartly use delimbs" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjhN2jaKWV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The delimb system and obliteration techniques are key to the flow of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em>.</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Ninja Gaiden II </em>&nbsp;features many radical changes from its predecessor. Both games are unforgiving character action games, but <em>Ninja Gaiden II </em>introduced several key mechanics that changed the way it is supposed to be played, starting with delimbing. Foes in the game can have limbs severed but still fight. A delimbed foe is easy to finish with a move called an Obliteration Technique. Delmibed foes can also be tactically spaced, but those foes are prone to far riskier moves, oftentimes throwing themselves at you in explosive, self-destructive attacks. Furthermore, the overall balance of the game shifted between <em>I</em> and <em>II</em>. <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>is a more defensive game, one that rewards cautious action, while <em>Ninja Gaiden II </em>is far more aggressive, rewarding a player who presses their advantage. What’s more, <em>Ninja Gaiden II </em>downright throws enemies at you, often too many for the Xbox 360 to handle.&nbsp;</p><p>This poor performance is no longer an issue thanks to emulation and backwards compatibility. The original version of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> will run like butter on a Series X thanks to the fantastic job Microsoft did with backwards compatibility (you can still purchase and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-ii/BSCSRTX27ZH3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download it here</a>, as well as the best version of the first game, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-black/C17KKS83S9GS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ninja Gaiden Black</em></a>), but that version is exclusively limited to the Xbox ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This fight is boring. Credit: Tecmo Koei</figcaption></figure><p>The re-release of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em>, dubbed <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2,</em> is a very different situation. It was first introduced on the PS3, and so many changes were made to compensate that they threw the baby out with the bathwater. Mission structure was retooled and optimized, and one very mediocre boss was replaced. The lighting was tweaked. Several bosses were added, like a big Buddha statue and The Statue of Liberty. These fights are mindless and awful, and both bosses devolve into the player slashing at their hands until they die. New weapons and side missions with other characters were added; these side characters have very interesting movesets, but the missions themselves add nothing to the overall experience. The worst change, however, is that <em>Sigma 2</em> radically reduces the number of enemies on the screen and makes them far less aggressive. The rate at which your weapons delimb enemies is also radically reduced, completely altering weapon balance and flow. Instead of managing a swarm of murderous foes, you are instead dealing with a few somewhat spongey enemies. For all of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em>’s flaws, and there are many, that is seen by many hardcore fans (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/96ot09/comment/e4256ff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but not all</a>) as<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1580780/discussions/0/3112531165377352543/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an unforgivable slight</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 2 &amp; NINJA GAIDEN SIGMA 2 : COMPARISON OF CHAPTER 11 to 14" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDAiYc_sy8A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A comparison of the two releases.</figcaption></figure></div><h4><strong>Undoing the damage.</strong></h4><p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/ninjagaidenmastercollection/mods/292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Black</em></a> is an in-development overhaul of the <em>Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection</em> version of <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 </em>by modder Fiend Busa. It’s an attempt to undo the changes done in the remastering process in the most readily available version of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to the mod, Fiend Busa had no substantial history with modding. “As soon as [<em>Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection</em>] was released for PC - I was learning as I was going the entire way,” he told me via Discord.&nbsp;</p><p>Busa has been working on it for more than three years, dissecting the code daily trying to figure out how it works and teaching himself Assembly in the process. For a while the mod ran on<a href="https://cheatengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Cheat Engine</a>, but as of the last month that is no longer the case, and the newest version of the mod is in Alpha. It adds back respawns previously removed, and makes many under the hood tweaks. As of this writing, the current version of the mod is only playtested on the ultra hard Master Ninja difficulty, but in the coming weeks it will be ported to other difficulties in the game.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Fiend Busa dissected the game by hand over a period of years dissecting how it works. For the recently added UI changes, he used GPT-4 to write the code. Credit: Tecmo Koei</figcaption></figure><p>“In terms of feel, the big one is micro stuttering,” Busa said when I asked about the changes between the vanilla and <em>Sigma</em> versions of the game “In <em>Sigma 2</em>, when you perform certain actions such as Izuna drop, OT, delimb an enemy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4HKw7Hqqd0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game purposely freezes the frame</a> (I assume this was to give added "oomph"). There are some slight differences in attacks but I won't get into that too much as most casual players will not notice it.”</p><p>“The other complaint I hear a lot is regarding AI aggression, where <em>NG2</em> enemies are more aggressive than <em>NGS2</em>. For [the] majority of the enemies they behave exactly the same and the difference comes in grab speeds, if enemies can grab you on block etc. There are changes to attack properties and such, but these changes only the pro players will notice them (and can be modified pretty easily).”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NGS2B - Quick Run of 0.9" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b9SHEAmtVaM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Fiend Busa regularly streams the development progress of the mod on his YouTube channel. Here is a quick look at version 0.9.</figcaption></figure></div><p>“The third biggest one is delimb,” he said. “Each enemy is essentially assigned a ‘delimb resistance value.’ What it seems like they did in <em>Sigma 2 </em>was for certain enemies they basically upped the delimb resistance by 50% (i.e., [Incendiary Shuriken] Ninja) and then <em>Sigma 2 </em>decided to also add additional properties to certain moves that would bypass the resistance so even if you set the delimbs to very high certain moves such as (scythe wall throw) would ignore it.”</p><p>I asked how he was getting the mod to run as close to the original game as possible. “Most [of] the stuff in <em>Sigma 2</em> [is] just ‘disabled’ so the majority of it is debugging and ‘enabling.’ Certain stuff is a bit more complex as it's not 1:1 so I would end up hooking into multiple functions to get it working exactly how I want and as close to <em>NG2 </em>as possible.”&nbsp;</p><p>For the spawns, Fiend Busa wrote his own custom spawn system and simply played the original game in the 360 emulator <a href="https://xenia.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xenia</a>. “I essentially just run through Xenia to note down the amount of enemies spawning per battle, enemy type, and deleted battles and punch those into my spawn system.” In some cases, like in the area around the Buddha statue fight, Busa added enemies to make the game harder than it originally was.</p><figure><figcaption>Some of the additions from <em>Sigma 2</em>, like the side characters, are good and may be integrated into the mod at a later date. Credit: Tecmo Koei</figcaption></figure><p>Busa sees possibilities outside of simply returning <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em> to its original state. Down the line, he wants to make the additional content an on/off toggle, and he believes that the spawn system could be used to add custom difficulties to the game, potentially adding fiend variants of the side characters as enemies.</p><h4><strong>Enter the Ninja&nbsp;</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>Gore is a hallmark of Ninja Gaiden II that was patched out in Sigma 2. Above: Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Black. Credit: Tecmo Koei</figcaption></figure><p>While writing this article, the only difficulty in <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Black </em>with the spawns fully enabled was the ultra hard “Master Ninja” mode. Unlocking this mode requires beating the game on the hard difficulty, called “Mentor,” so I decided to make a go of that on the original <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em>. It was a cake walk. Enemies were easy to space and slightly tedious, save for an occasional one hit insta-kill that would come out of nowhere. I got 60 percent of the way through the game on Mentor before Busa just gave me his save file. I loaded it up (noting the timer had been maxed out), started a new Master Ninja save, and immediately got my shit rocked. The game had become merciless.&nbsp;</p><p>“The core gameplay seems to reward aggressive playstyle as the more aggressive you are, enemies will back down,” Busa explained. “Next time you hop in, if you see an enemy coming your way from afar, just lightly tap an enemy close by and you'll see it'll back off (most of the time).”</p><p>With<em> Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Black </em>enabled, all of the systems immediately complemented each other better. The flow of combat was faster, room for error was shaved down to mere frames, and even when I knew exactly what to do I never felt complacent. More foes meant more possibilities to account for, but the higher delimb rate meant I was constantly decapitating enemies, the beheading animation of an Obliteration Technique giving me brief and precious windows of invulnerability. My conscious mind receded to the background and gave way to that familiar <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>flow as the game dared me to push harder, faster, and forward. In a word, It felt “correct.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NGS2B - Quick Global Ray Tracing Comparison (SSRTGI)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VCuILyg76oM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A test of Screen Space Ray Traced Global Illumination applied to the game.</figcaption></figure></div><h4><strong>The Return Of The Ninja</strong></h4><p>If you’re wondering why I care so much about granular changes between multiple versions of a game from 2008, it’s because few games have ever matched it, including ones developed by Team Ninja themselves. It can be tempting to attribute this to the messy departure of director Tomonobu Itagaki, but the reality is that games are not made by single people, and Team Ninja still makes solid games with tight combat after Itagaki left to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Third" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Devil’s Third</em></a>. Team Ninja’s games still have unparalleled combat. <em>Stranger of Paradise, </em>while a train wreck, is still the most interesting single-player <em>Final Fantasy</em> game since <em>Lightning Returns. </em>But<em> </em>their output often feels tethered to chasing the success of <em>Nioh,</em> and they all are burdened by comically complicated inventory systems. Though their games approach greatness, none of them, save for the totally rehauled <em>Ninja Gaiden III: Razor’s Edge,</em> have the stripped-to-the-bone clarity of vision and singular flow state of those original two <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>games.</p><p>To play a Team Ninja game today is to see a glimmer of the old games peeking through. I think Team Ninja still has it in them, and Fiend Busa agrees. “[<em>Ninja Gaiden III : Razor’s Edge’s</em>] combat was amazing and they had little time with that!” Perhaps it’s unfair to demand that from them again. But I know that they have that dog in them still. For now I’ll stick with the old games, modding <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em> and banging my head against the unforgiving Master Ninja difficulty until Ryu Hayabusa or his spiritual successor finally returns.<br></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Wccftech recently had the opportunity to get an intimate behind-closed-doors look at <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> with a 30-minute gameplay demonstration from the Director of the title himself, Yuya Tokuda. During this hands-off demo, Capcom showcased a selection of early game content, from departing the main village and venturing out into the wilds with a map size that they’re already touting as over two times larger than previous titles and featuring a seamless transition with no loading from camp to quest.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MHWilds_Balahara_Hunt-01.bmp"></a></figure>

<p>As the player Hunter ventures out from the base camp riding on a Seikret, the new pack animal and mount for Monster Hunter Wilds, both his Palico and the Handler, Alma, tag along as well. Before getting into any combat or hunts proper, Capcom took us to one of the smaller satellite villages where the townsfolk were preparing for an imminent sandstorm. The dialogue is dynamic to inform the player of world events in real-time and they won’t be static in one place either, as villagers will wander around with their own tasks to do. Once again, the localization team is peppering in puns and comedic dialogue to help set the tone of Monster Hunter Wilds. “Cheese and thank you,” so says the local Cheesemonger, thanking the Hunter for their custom.</p>
<p>By being accompanied by a Handler for the first time in Monster Hunter Wilds, players can get a taste for emergent quest design that was introduced in a way through Monster Hunter World’s Investigations. Map markers can lead the players to quest points, but they are just as likely to discover a quest by coming across a monster in the Wilds. The enhanced map is modeled in 3D to showcase different levels of elevation and can also be freely rotated. On the map, players can see the local Upsurges where rare materials or subspecies might be more prevalent. Time of day is also a major focus of the exploration and timelines can be broken down into colored chunks, each representing a different event or opportunity depending on the time of day.</p>
<p>For the quest chosen in our Monster Hunter Wilds presentation, Tokuda-san picked out an Alpha Doshaguma from the map that was nestled within a pack of normal variants. Once a target is selected and tracking begins, Scoutflies once again illuminate a path to the target monster by way of glowing trails. Even along the way towards a quest, players will get notified of other opportunities for hunts, including one popup that mentioned that a Balahara had appeared in the region and showed off a list of possible rewards (including Decorations and jewels going by the icons shown).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MHWilds_Balahara-Hunt-04.bmp"></a></figure>

<p>It appears that players can build mobile camps around the world to prepare while out on patrol, from changing weapons and gear to grilling up a meal for the usual passive stat increases. These camps cost Guild Points to build and aren’t permanent (as the camp was destroyed later on in the demo by a Doshaguma while the player was busy in combat half a mile away). Capcom hasn’t yet mentioned if these mobile camps can be built anywhere or require fixed points as they did in Monster Hunter Rise. The Meat and Kunafa Cheese meal showed off a delicious cheese pull animation and rewarded the player with a 50-minute buff that increased their health and stamina while also providing the Defender Meal (Lo) ability that activated quite often during the following hunt.</p>
<p>After donning a Ghillie Mantle, the hunter snuck up on his target Alpha Doshaguma from the middle of the pack and was greeted with an on-screen prompt to Sneak Attack, dealing significant damage and opening a Wound on the monster as the Quest Start banner popped up to indicate he found the correct target. The Wound system is one of the new mechanics that Capcom wanted to show off during the Monster Hunter Wilds presentation and offers more than just the typical part breaks: these wounds exist as cracks in the monster’s armor, allowing the player hunter to deal with increased damage by focusing on one of these points. Each of the fourteen weapon types in Monster Hunter Wilds features a form of Focus Mode to pinpoint these weakpoints on a given monster. Players can also jump onto and grapple a monster to stab it with their hunting knife, causing little damage compared to a regular weapon but capable of toppling a monster with relative ease. One of the new attacks shown off with the Great Sword was jumping onto a monster, stabbing the sword into it, and running across its back while dragging the sword and dealing a lot of damage in a short period.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Monsters rarely want to stay in one place in Monster Hunter Wilds and will routinely try to escape when getting tired or hungry, or chase the player if they decide to book a hasty retreat. Players can take advantage of these tendencies for monsters to chase by utilizing the local endemic life to trap or damage the monster, such as a bramble bush that can slow and scratch up a large monster or stalactites that can be shot down with a slinger shot to fall onto a passing monster.</p>
<p>Turf Wars are back in Monster Hunter Wilds and just about every other monster has one reason or another to stroll up and pick a fight with both the player and his intended foe. The Balahara, a new monster introduced in Wilds that appears to be a sandy variant of the Almudron, created a quicksand pit to trap the Alpha Doshaguma and deal a modest 300-400 damage, saving the player’s sharpness from having to do a few extra strikes. While the two monsters were wrestling with each other, the sandstorm that the small village was preparing for rolled in, instantly changing the environment to a twilight setting as a weather anomaly struck. Lighting bolts rained down on the field of battle as the Balahara departed, but Alpha Doshaguma remained. The lightning also heralded the apex of the windward plains, which Capcom explained would only show up during one of these storms. The lightning dragon Rey Dau rolled up as another contended and did heavy damage with its lightning attacks, striking the Alpha Doshaguma for some 3,800 damage with a bolt.</p>
<p>Players could reap the rewards of this new kind of turf war and collect a variety of endemic life that would only appear in weather conditions such as this. A large number of Great Thunderbugs, Wiggly Litchi, Vigorslugs, and Sparkflint (perhaps a new type of Slinger Ammo given the icon when picked up) were all gatherable by Seikretback as the hunter darted around to evade lightning bolts and keep his target distracted by the apex wyvern that showed up briefly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MHWilds_Balahara-Hunt-01.bmp"></a></figure>

<p>After the Rey Dau departed and the Alpha Doshaguma was once again on the move, the clock showed 9 minutes had passed out of the full 45-minute duration. At this point in the demo, Tokuda-san fired an SOS flare to bring in 3 NPC support hunters to help even the odds. The Alpha Doshaguma ran into yet another Turf War with the Balahara with two of them latching onto the Doshaguma, one grappling it while the other bit onto the monster. The Alpha Doshaguma was eventually able to break free and grab one of the offending Balahara, ripping its lower jaw before tossing the monster aside. Meanwhile, the player resupplied during the hunt and changed weapons to the Heavy Bowgun. It was still a relatively early-game weapon, featuring the following ammo types: Normal 3, Pierce 1, Spread 1, Sticky 2, and Cluster Bomb 1. There was also a rapid-fire attack on the Heavy Bowgun that didn’t consume any ammo but rather a separate resource gauge. Of the three NPC supports brought in, one brought a Lance, another brought a Hammer, and the third also brought in another Heavy Bowgun and would use that gatling fire ability to try and pin and stun the Alpha Doshaguma in place.</p>
<p>Even during combat, the Hunter was able to fast-travel out and change his primary weapon to a Long Sword. Sometime during this phase, the sandstorm dissipated and the environment entered a phase of abundance called The Plenty that changed up the endemic life once more. A great number of Vigorwasps showed up during this phase. It didn’t take long for the Hunter and squad to chase down the Alpha Doshaguma one last time (a skull icon appears when the target is near death, just like the previous titles) and a variety of LS techniques, including a Crimson Slash that chained from level I to level III with repeated use. Only a few seconds of fighting remained before the Alpha Doshaguma finally succumbed to its injuries, allowing the Hunter to carve up precious resources from its body.</p>
<p>Upon besting the foe, a quest completion popup appeared, and rather than returning to a lobby screen following a successful hunt, players can stay out in the Wilds and hunt down other opportunities. There were various awards and even a nameplate unlocked for quest completion, but Capcom didn’t allow us to look deeper into what those could have been. Instead, they showed off a quick tease of a new monster with three large spikes on its back and harassing it with a large barrel bomb. New for Monster Hunter Wilds, players can tip their barrel bombs over and roll them into the monster rather than always waiting for the target to approach.</p>

<p>Everything shown during the hands-off demonstration for Monster Hunter Wilds felt like a natural evolution from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator">Monster Hunter World</a>. It introduced mechanics and systems that I’ve wanted for a long time including the multiple weapon switching and being able to continue questing in an area even after completing a hunt. If anything, this brief demo only pushed Monster Hunter Wilds to the top of my most anticipated games of 2025. Capcom doesn’t have much else to say on Monster Hunter Wilds beyond a vague 2025 release date and full crossplay across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC (cross-save, however, still doesn’t seem likely).</p>

Systemically, these two games could not be more different. There will undoubtedly be people who are disappointed that <em>Dragon Age </em>is leaning harder into the action RPG subgenre after <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>pulled off the tactical approach so well, but to that I say: Just play <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>again.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7b3ae15a0c176c949f636233123165f4" data-recommend-id="image://7b3ae15a0c176c949f636233123165f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shep smiles as Gale walks by." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shep smiles as Gale walks by." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b3ae15a0c176c949f636233123165f4" data-recommend-id="image://7b3ae15a0c176c949f636233123165f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shep smiles as Gale walks by." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h15342"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>what <em>Dragon Age </em>should be in 2024?

If you played <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>in 2009 and imagined the series a decade and two console generations later, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>is probably a close approximation of what the most pie-in-the-sky version would look like. For Morton, this goes beyond sticking to tactical combat,  also involving its darker tone, as <em>The Veilguard</em>’s quippy dialogue and acrobatic action feel like something out of a modern franchise film.</p><p>Morton asks what <em>Dragon Age</em>’s identity is at this point, but I feel the series has had an identity problem for 15 years. BioWare has maintained that each <em>Dragon Age </em>game is a very specific moment in time for its universe, and that’s why it changes locations, protagonists, and styles each time.

It already is. When you’ve spent ten years waiting for something with an idea of what it would be in your head, if it’s not that thing, you’re bound to be disappointed. But ultimately, <em>The Veilguard </em>is not trying to accomplish the same things <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>did. Its focus on action-based systems means we’re probably not going to get the highly reactive, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-esque spells and problem-solving mechanics. But it does mean we’re going to get what looks like a frenetic action RPG that continues the story we’ve been waiting a decade for. That might not be what you wanted from <em>Dragon Age</em>, but that other game exists.</p><p>We can unpack whether or not <em>The Veilguard </em>accomplishes what it’s setting out to do when it launches in the fall, but if the conversation starts and ends with “I wanted <em>The Veilguard </em>to be this specific thing,” we’re looking at the wrong franchise. After seeing <em>The Veilguard </em>pivot in such a different direction from its predecessor that inspired <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, I’m just not interested in examining it through the lens of this comparison. It’s the least interesting way to dissect art, and now, it feels like a disingenuous way to dissect these two games. We’ve got two cakes that are similar shapes but different flavors. We can eat them both.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Just over two months after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-sells-gearbox-entertainment-to-take-two-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the deal was first announced</a>, Take-Two Interactive and Embracer Group have <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-closes-the-divestment-of-gearbox-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially completed</a> the transfer of Gearbox Entertainment.</p>



<p>“On 28 March 2024, Embracer Group AB (“Embracer”) entered into an agreement to divest Gearbox Entertainment to Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc,” Embracer said in a press release. “All conditions for the transaction have now been fulfilled, and the transaction has been closed today.”</p>



<p>The deal sees Embracer issue 8.32 million B shares at $9.56 (SEK &nbsp;98.78) to settle “certain earnout obligations”. To cover earnout obligations to Lost Boys Interactive, an addition 2.08 million B shares have been issued at a price of $7.66 (SEK 79.30) per share.</p>



<p>As part of the deal, Embracer received $460 million in newly issued shares of Take-Two Interactive.</p>



<p>A reminder that this deal includes Gearbox Software, Gearbox Montreal, and Gearbox Studio Quebec all going to Take-Two Interactive along with the Duke Nukem, Borderlands, and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands franchises, among others.</p>



<p>Embracer retains the former Gearbox Publishing San Francisco, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gearbox-publishings-new-name-is-arc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is now Arc Games</a>.</p>



<p>Shortly after the announcement of the deal back in March, Gearbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gearbox-layoffs-hit-staff-hours-after-being-sold-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hit with layoffs</a> that saw “countless” people lose their jobs.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Palworld Sakurajima Update | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">To opt in to the preview program, players will need to be an Xbox Insider member (which can be done via the Xbox Insider Hub app) and have Palworld (available on Game Pass) as well as the Xbox Insider Hub app installed. Inside the Xbox Insider Hub app, the option to join the Palworld Update Preview should be listed under the Previews section. Players will then install the preview update for Palworld, after which they will be able to play new upcoming features.</p><p dir="ltr">Palworld has proven to be a big hit for Xbox, with more than 10 million players having tried out developer Pocketpair's Pokemon-esque survival game within its first month. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-25-million-players-in-one-month/1100-6521294/" data-ref-id="1100-6521294">Over 25 million players have played Palworld when including PC players via Steam</a>. Palworld is not currently available on PlayStation or Nintendo Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">Not all the attention Palworld has received has been good attention, however. Nintendo issued a statement following the game's massive launch that it would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-says-it-intends-to-investigate-palworld/1100-6520591/" data-ref-id="1100-6520591">investigating the title for copyright infringement</a> in the wake of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-youtuber-behind-pokemon-mod-claims-nintendo-has-come-for-me/1100-6520536/" data-ref-id="1100-6520536">Pokemon mod for Palworld</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-plagiarism-accusations-palworld-ceo-asks-people-to-stop-harassing-devs/1100-6520522/" data-ref-id="1100-6520522">accusations on social media of plagiarism</a> related to Pocketpair allegedly using Pokemon models as a basis for their own creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">Palworld's next major update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-is-getting-a-new-region-and-so-much-more-with-the-sakurajima-update/1100-6524055/" data-ref-id="1100-6524055">the Sakurajima update</a>, is set to arrive on June 27 and will add a new island to explore, new Pal species to collect, expanded building options, a new level cap, and the previously mentioned dedicated servers for Xbox, which are already available for PC players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/monke-simulator-is-a-parkour-game-that-lets-you-go-ape/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=monke-simulator-is-a-parkour-game-that-lets-you-go-ape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="168" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Monke Simulator</em> demo is available as part of Steam’s Next Fest, and if you’re a fan of parkour games or surrealist primate fantasies, you should give it a look.</p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124360/Monke_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monke Simulator</a></em> starts out as so many adventures do: with a group of caged apes being dropped into the heart of a volcano by a small army of drones. After breaking free of your cage, you need to jump, wall run, and dash your way to freedom. From there the game throws you into level after level of unique challenges that, at least in the demo, don’t seem to have any narrative linking them together.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-vine-grind-to-victory" data-injectable="false">Vine grind to victory </h2> <p data-characters="607" data-current-count="907" data-injectable="true">But who needs narrative when you’ve got apelike speed? Maybe these apes were being volcano dumped because of their borderline supernatural powers. Running through levels, you can slide along vines like you’re playing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/former-tony-hawks-pro-skater-devs-reveal-50-player-skateboarding-game-wrekless/">some kind of <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater </em>game</a>, and your super intelligence allows you to use tools like a grappling hook and a banana blaster. Those help you avoid deep trenches of water and break down barriers in your path, but they also let you fight the enemies that are trying to prevent you from getting your next banan (there’s no time for that last syllable in <em>Monke Simulator</em>).&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">I had an absolute blast splattering nasty humans into gore while swinging my way through the half-dozen or so levels featured in the game’s demo. In between levels you can head to a hub area to purchase upgrades and encounter a few zany apes. Tricking out my ape’s toolset gave me a solid motivation to try and earn the maximum rewards for every level. Initially I had some trouble navigating the strange forest landscapes, but once I tapped into my innate ape brain, my runs started flowing more smoothly.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-monke-see-monke-wishlist" data-injectable="false">Monke see, monke wishlist</h2> <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="774" data-injectable="true">I’m a sucker for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/splodey-is-an-explosive-die-and-retry-speedrun-game-available-today/">a good speedrunning game</a>, and <em>Monke Simulator </em>scratched that itch. I laughed out loud more than a few times when running around the various levels. Discovering a stoner monkey hideout in the game’s hub was a highlight, and blowing humans to bits with my handheld banana canon never stopped being funny. The tone is supported by some solid speedrunning mechanics, and I frequently found myself sitting on a single level until I earned my gold medal. </p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">Even the early levels featured in the demo provide a varied set of challenges and multiple paths to explore, plus there’s the upgrade system to encourage you to sharpen your skills. <em>Monke Simulator </em>only has a vague 2024 release window for now, but I’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for when developer Totem Softproducts announces the actual date. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/despite-its-best-in-class-action-selacos-pacing-is-where-it-truly-shines/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=despite-its-best-in-class-action-selacos-pacing-is-where-it-truly-shines<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="364" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You’d be forgiven for playing through the entirety of <em>Selaco’s </em>10-to-12 hour campaign and being surprised to learn that the game was not only incomplete, but only a portion of its intended length. The first episode of <em>Selaco</em> launched recently into Steam early access, but there’s more than one reason to avoid judging this shooter by its box art.</p> <h2 id="h-bringing-mindfulness-to-mayhem" data-injectable="false">Bringing mindfulness to mayhem</h2> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">Lately, I’ve been sort of half-assedly practicing that “dopamine detox” thing you see young adults try: setting screen time limits on your phone, disabling certain apps, or even just reading a book before bed instead of scrolling on my phone. It actually works, by the way; I find my time with screens a lot more engaging than I did before. Well, <em>Selaco</em> is sort of like dopamine detox in shooter form. </p>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">I adore breakneck shooters like <em>ULTRAKILL</em>, <em>Turbo Overkill</em>, <em>DOOM Eternal</em>, and <em>Mullet Madjack</em>. I also find them.. kind of exhausting, after a while. Each encounter in these games demands more than just shooting or even proper positioning: they demand a dance with a death that’s double time, every time. <em>Selaco</em> is more evenly paced, punishing poor play swiftly but giving you plenty of time between shootouts to recoup.</p>
 <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Playing on the second-hardest available option, I was regularly having to restart fights, but it wasn’t ever because I missed a super-bounce or neglected to quick-swap to the correct weapon. It was because I played carelessly. Careless play can get you pretty far in “movement shooters” like those listed above, as long as you’re carelessly moving around at Mach 9. In <em>Selaco</em>, you’re going to want to slow down, reposition, and outwit the worryingly intelligent AI before can deposit lead in your flank.</p>
 <h2 id="h-spacing-the-pacing" data-injectable="false">Spacing the pacing</h2> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">A typical fight in <em>Selaco</em> usually applies pressure (in the form of dudes with guns) from one direction, then expands to fill the gaps. Enemies flow in from set points, but will swiftly move through the available space to get the jump on you, obscured by flying debris, smoke, and dust. Your foes are deadly, tanky, and smart. Your best bet is to lay traps, think ahead, and use your tactical power slide to out-position them. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Altered Orbit Studios.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true">Of course, if a fight goes sideways you’re almost guaranteed a long moment to gather yourself, and some resources, before the next. Rather than smashing from room to room populated with baddies, <em>Selaco’s</em> explorable space is punctuated somewhat sparsely with fights. Some people might call these moments of quiet exploration and light puzzling boring. I call them an exercise in mindfulness.</p>
 <p data-characters="544" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true">There’s a wide range of enemy types to fight, and they evolve in both weaponry and tactics as you progress. Later on, “Squad Leaders” will intelligently command their soldiers while buffing them. If you manage to kill a Squad Leader, their underlings will helplessly scatter, ripe for the gibbing. Shotgun goons will flank so aggressively and so mischievously you’d swear they spawn in right behind you. The only way to stay alive is to peek, kill, and reposition. A dance with death, but more of a waltz than a shuffle.</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-world-worth-getting-lost-in-most-of-the-time" data-injectable="false">A world worth getting lost in.. most of the time</h2> <p data-characters="669" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">The world of <em>Selaco</em> is astoundingly rich in detail (made even more impressive when you remember it’s made in GZDoom), interactive options, cleverly-hidden secrets, and worldbuilding. While there’s no through-line of a story (yet), the environs themselves paint a clear picture of the lives of the crew and citizenry aboard this artificial ecosystem. Birthday parties held in office spaces, arcades with playable machines, and shopping malls complete with interior burger joints are just a few of the spaces you’ll be combing through between engagements. They’re liminal spaces bereft of nostalgia, replaced with an eerie, futuristic loneliness. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Altered Orbit Studios.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="801" data-injectable="true">Getting lost in such spaces is fun, for a time. There were a handful of occasions I was stuck hugging the left wall – a tried-and-true technique I use in corn mazes and the like – just to find where to go next. Green lights help most of the time, but there are a few times when a critical switch or path are just a little <em>too</em> hard to locate. I don’t think there should be a waypoint system or anything, but I think a bit more diegetic highlighting of key details would go a long way.</p>
 <p data-characters="612" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true">If I’m making <em>Selaco</em> sound like a game about wandering liminal spaces punctuated with brief shooter action, it’s because that’s sort of what it is. There’s <em>plenty</em> of shooting to be had and it’s best-in-genre stuff, with satisfying weapons that feel and sound powerful as they shred enemies to bits. The level of viscera and flying debris is enough to make <em>Brutal DOOM</em> blush. But blasting guys is only a piece of the formula, and despite getting turned around a few times I found the interspersed methodical secret hunting and resource gathering just as essential to the experience. </p>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="false">In its current state, <em>Selaco</em> is a no-brainer for anyone who’s in the mood for something a little more <em>Half Life</em> than <em>DOOM</em>. There’s still some headway to be made in terms of storytelling, and I’d love to see some additional bosses and set pieces, but the meditative pace, tight action and incredible attention to detail across its generous runtime were more than enough to win me over.</p>

            <p>It’s been a decade - 10 years! - since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>. It’s fair to assume that you might’ve forgotten what happened during the last Dragon Age game, or some of the specific choices you made back in the misty ages of 2014. Whether you remember or not, this year’s long-awaited sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> should have you covered, with the ability to carry over your story choices from the previous game and get a refresher on what happened last time around.</p>

<p>The Veilguard - which had the objectively better subtitle Dreadwolf <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-dragon-age-game-has-a-new-name-dragon-age-the-veilguard">up until earlier this month</a>, but let’s not dwell on that - recently made a fairly big showing during Summer Game Fest, giving an in-depth look at its high-stakes fantasy drama (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-very-first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-makes-it-look-like-a-fornite-heist-movie">not as Marvel-aping as was feared</a>) that Edwin found to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">happily Mass Effect 2-evoking in tone and properly single-player RPG in form</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator">IGN</a> caught up with director Corinne Busche to ask about some of the specifics of directly following Inquisition’s story - in which the player’s Inquisitor takes a starring role, of course - and how The Veilguard will pick up the various branches of narrative woven by players’ differing choices in its decade-old predecessor.</p>
<p>Busche was upfront in admitting that plenty of players might not even remember Inquisition’s story, revealed that The Veilguard’s character creator will open with an interactive recap that the dev dubbed “Last Time on Dragon Age”.</p>
<p>The refresher will let players remake decisions from Inquisition using a set of tarot cards - Busche assured there’ll be appropriate context to the potentially weighty choices you’re making, so you’re not just ticking a random box and hoping for the best - that then set the stage for The Veilguard to continue certain plotlines and hark back to the last game. Busche also shied away from confirming that every major character from Inquisition would appear in The Veilguard: “I won't say everybody, but yes, some of them.”</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/characters_08AwcGw.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You’ll need to go through the interactive recap whether you’ve still got your Inquisition saves to hand or not, Busche added, saying that the change in technology - again, it’s been 10 years - was significant enough that the team decided to handle the ‘importing’ solely within the new game itself. (That also implies that Dragon Age Keep, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/revisionist-history-dragon-age-keep-launched">Inquisition’s save importer</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Origins</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age II</a>, won’t be used.)</p>
<p>Once you’ve recreated your choices from Inquisition, The Veilguard’s character creation should then let you recreate your hero from the last game too, with Edwin noting that the character creator has been notably expanded with a choice of body shapes, improved hair styles and other visual knobs to play with (speaking of knobs: there’s also a custom bulge size option).</p>
<p>The Veilguard will finally release this autumn, after a decade in the works. Just about enough time to replay Inquisition if you’re after a more in-depth reminder, I’d wager.</p>

Associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois said in a new interview that fans can expect the world map of the Japan-set open-world game to be similar in size that of Assassin's Creed Origins.</p><p>"It's about roughly similar to Origins, so it's smaller than Valhalla in terms of territory," he told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-shadows-japan-is-roughly-similar-in-size-to-egypt-in-origins/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "There is some body of water around Japan, but it's not like [Odyssey's] Greece was, [which was] half water. With Japan that's not the case. We have the coastlines and lake Biwa is a very big lake, but [the map's] roughly the size of Origins."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended 12 Minutes Of Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward</p>
      </div>
<p>The world in Assassin's Creed Shadows is "much more mountainous," Lemay-Comtois went on to say, adding that the team visited Japan to scout the local area.</p><p>Japan is a huge place and Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't cover the whole country, of course, but it does feature major cities like Kyoto and Osaka. The developers spent time considering how much of the world they needed to put between those places to make the game feel credible but also approachable. It wouldn't necessarily be fun for Assassin's Creed Shadows to be realistic in the sense that it would take four days on horseback to get from one place to another, the developer said.</p><p>"So it's kind of a tricky thing to develop, but eventually we find our footing with the types of cities and castles that we want to represent and that’s what justifies the size of our world map," he said.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows releases on November 15 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. An extended gameplay trailer was released during the Ubisoft Forward event this week, highlighting the game's two playable protagonists and their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-showcase-highlights-its-two-very-different-gameplay-styles/1100-6524130/" data-ref-id="1100-6524130">vastly different play styles.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/wordle-uses-manga-as-a-word-some-are-baffled/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordle-uses-manga-as-a-word-some-are-baffled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you did your daily <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wordle</a> </em>this past Monday (June 10), you would have encountered the word manga. To me, this is a common-ish word that I even use when talking to my parents, but to others, this was an affront to the English language.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">If you’re not deeply immersed in geek or Japanese culture, the word might not be familiar to you. It is a category of comic books used to denote that it is stylistically Japanese. While some would argue that only comics that originate from Japan qualify as manga, it has been applied to some works created outside the country but made in a similar style.</p> <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">As writer Dan Nyugen <a href="https://x.com/dancow/status/1800503654761586776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found and compiled</a> on Twitter, some Wordle fans were incensed by the inclusion of the word. “I never heard of this word and is not well known English language,” strained one user.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="true">New York Times Staff Editor Toni Monkovic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/shared/comment/3vjp03?rsrc=cshare&amp;smid=url-share">waded into the comments</a> to try and explain how the word was selected, stating that “MANGA cleared all three hurdles we use to decide what goes in the bot’s dictionary.” He also added that “Manga has around 740 mentions in the NYT since 2000, much more than enough for the bot.&nbsp; But … It’s worth noting that it has only around 75 mentions from 1976 to 2000.” So, if you stopped learning words after Y2K, you might not know it.</p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Obviously, the slew of perturbed comments are skewed to complaints because that’s what people post online. Not many are just going to comment that they thought the word was acceptable. However, the lack of knowledge about it is another reminder that I live in a different world from some people. Most bookstores I frequent now have a section specifically for manga, with graphic novels sometimes mixed in with them.</p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">And yes, the manga is a Japanese loanword. Most languages have a habit of incorporating words from other languages, and English is rife with them. For example, one of <em>Wordle</em>’s previous puzzles was “sushi,” another Japanese loanword. It’s not like they used something more obscure like “ecchi.” I shudder to think of what will happen the day that “anime” shows up in the shuffle.</p>

After recent confirmation that <em>The Boys</em> Season 5 will be the final season, showrunner Eric Kripke has now revealed that he’s actively trying to figure out a way to bring in Jared Padalecki for the show’s next season.</p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">Kripke told <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-boys-season-5-jared-padalecki-cameo-eric-kripke-response/">Screen Rant</a> in a recent interview that he has been texting with Padalecki about this, and he would love for “Jared to come in and do a guest spot on the show.” For those unfamiliar, Jared Padalecki is known for playing Sam Winchester in <em>Supernatural</em>, the TV show directed by Eric Kripke.</p> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="The Boys – Season 4 Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzFXDvC-EwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">There have been several instances of actors from <em>Supernatural</em> appearing in <em>The Boys</em>, with the most obvious example being Jensen Ackles portraying Soldier Boy. Ackles and Padalecki shared the screen in Supernatural as its protagonist brothers for 15 seasons.</p> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">The Boys showrunner added that he wants to bring Padalecki to the show “not just because it’s fun to bring <em>Supernatural</em> characters onto the show, but just because I love working with people I love and if I have an opportunity to bring family back and work with family, I’ll take it and I have a lot of actors from that show who have really become family.”</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">The sentiment can be backed up the appearances we’ve had in <em>The Boys</em> by actors who have previously worked in <em>Supernatural</em>. Christian Keyes, who portayed Michael in <em>Supernatural</em>, was seen as Nathan Franklin in the show. Jim Beaver, who portrays the US Secretary of Defense in <em>The Boys</em> was <em>Supernatural’s</em> Bobby Singer.</p> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">Moreover, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is set to play a crucial role in <em>The Boys</em> Season 4, and the actor has portrayed John Winchester in <em>Supernatural</em>, the father of Dean and Sam Winchester.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Best of Soldier Boy | The Boys | Prime Video" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4zj4ACPGpUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="741" data-injectable="true">So, there is a clear intent from Kripke to find a way for Padalecki to show up in Season 5, but the showrunner said during the interview that the team is in “very early” stages for Season 5, and he does not have “a character in mind quite yet” for Padalecki. He concluded on a hopeful note by adding: “But I’m aiming towards it and I’m just keeping in rough touch with him so that hopefully our schedules do line up.”</p>
 <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="168" data-injectable="false">When suggested if Padalecki could play a character related to Jensen Ackles’ Soldier Boy so that they share the screen once again, Kripke said he liked that idea.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/one-btn-bosses-is-the-most-confident-steam-next-fest-demo-ive-played-so-far/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=one-btn-bosses-is-the-most-confident-steam-next-fest-demo-ive-played-so-far<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s always nice when a game presents a sole conceit and executes on it as promised. That’s exactly what you get with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1910600/ONE_BTN_BOSSES/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>ONE BTN BOSSES</em></a>, a single-screen shooter that, true to its name, has you using a single button to dodge and destroy increasingly complex bosses.</p> <p data-characters="520" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true">Games that don’t demand more than a single input aren’t necessarily anything new. There’s the whole sub-genre that <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-very-beginners-guide-to-vampire-survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire Survivors</a> </em>summoned into wider popularity, in which players need only move their characters around the screen as they automatically attack in an attempt to survive as long as possible. <em>ONE BTN BOSSES </em>doesn’t quite fit into that niche, instead tasking players with pressing a single face button to switch the direction (or another aspect) of their ship along a fixed plane.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">Between the simple and clean gimmick to the overall look, developer Midnight Munchies has delivered one of the most confident demos I’ve played so far during Steam Next Fest.</p> <h2 id="h-just-press-the-button" data-injectable="false"><strong>Just press the button</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true"><em>ONE BTN BOSSES </em>recently appeared as part of a showcase for Outersloth, an indie games fund created by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/among-us-animated-tv-series-in-the-works-at-cbs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Among Us</em></a> developer Innersloth. Prior to that, an earlier version of it could be found floating on various browser game communities like <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/793986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newgrounds</a> dating back to 2021. Now that the team has funding, they can finally build toward the full release. There’s currently no date in place, but what’s available in the demo shows a ton of promise.</p>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">In the few seconds you’re introduced to the concept at hand, you’ll know exactly what to do in this unique spin on the boss rush. As each battle begins, your ship automatically orbits the boss. That “one button” you’ve heard so much about is just there to switch the direction of your orbit. Doing so will kill your momentum, and the faster you move around the boss the faster your ship fires its bullets.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">Survival in <em>ONE BTN BOSSES </em>quickly becomes a game of risk vs. reward. If you can keep your momentum going, you’ll chip away at their health bar that much faster. Sounds easy enough, but are you sure you’ll circle the boss in time to skirt past the incoming wave of missiles? If you’d rather play it safe, you can continuously dodge left and right along the line and take your time. As the difficulty increases, though, it becomes clear that being bold and efficient has its advantages.</p>
 <h2 id="h-mix-it-up" data-injectable="false"><strong>Mix it up</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="803" data-injectable="true">While the demo just outfits you with the basic loadout at first — with at least one more unlocking after — it looks like the final game will have a lot of ways to change up your playstyle. You can customize your ship with different attack and movement upgrades, which even switches up how the button works. If the direction-swapping move isn’t cutting it, you can opt for a dash, or you can fire lasers instead of bullets. Midnight Munchies promises over 100 combinations in the final version.</p>
 <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">All told, there are 50 planned fights as far as handcrafted levels are concerned. You can choose different paths of progression along the way, so if you’re stuck on a particularly tough boss you can always try another route. Beyond the main game, there’s a roguelite-inspired R&amp;D (Rifts &amp; Discoveries) department that tosses randomly-generated bosses into the mix. New power-ups and upgrades can be picked up after fights, offering up a bunch of different playthrough possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-s-next-two-buttons" data-injectable="false"><strong>What’s next? TWO buttons?</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="657" data-current-count="957" data-injectable="true">It’s amazing what a little presentation can do. <em>ONE BTN BOSSES </em>comes out of the gate with the notion that you already get it. It has a sense of humor and its die-and-retry stylings are, at least in the small slice the demo has to share, well handled. I’m most interested in how they plan to make each boss unique without leaning on “more bullets and obstacles.” There are already examples in the demo of different type of lines for your ship that aren’t traditional orbits. One of the fights has you gliding across an angled line that teleports the ship back from one end to the other, like a looping single-screen arcade game.</p>
 <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">You can try <em>ONE BTN BOSSES </em>for yourself right now. If you don’t have time for that, the three-person dev team has been sharing some live-play broadcasts on Steam. One thing’s for sure, by the time this one launches in full, I’m pretty sure I’ll still remember how to play.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Square Enix has confirmed that Visions of Mana will be released on August 29th, and pre-orders are now live across PC and consoles. Visions of Mana was announced in December, making it the first mainline Mana entry in 15 years, and today Square Enix has released more details alongside the game’s release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="Visions of Mana | Launch Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Io4_CfCLlW4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When it comes to the Vision of Mana characters we already know of Val and Hinna. Val is Hinna’s lifelong friend and soul guard, accompanying her on the journey to the Tree of Mana.&nbsp; Additional characters include Careena and her sacred beast companion Ramcoh, Morley of Etaern, the Moonlit Parish, Palamena who is the young Queen of Illystana, Capital of the Deep, and carer of her brother Iain, and Julien who is the custodian of Verdeus Borough. All of these characters, bar Hinna, are playable in the game.</p>
<p>Previously, we were introduced to Pikuls, giant wolf like steeds you can ride to traverse the land at speed. Pikuls are not the only creatures capable of carrying the party though. Vuscavs are turtle like creatures that allow the party to cross the seas, and the legendary Flammie can take to the skies and soar through the air. All three creatures will help you explore and find the secrets of the open world, which is also fraught with dangers.</p>
<p>Combat is a key aspect of Visions of Mana, and it is real time combat. The Ring Menu makes its return to the series, with moves equipped in this menu the only ones that can be used in combat. That will mean switching out moves for others to get the best advantage against the various foes that pose a danger to Hinna, Val, and the rest of the group. Battle parties will consist of three characters, each one with their own skills and abilities that can provide different supports. Characters are not limited and their class can be changed through the use of Elemental Vessels. These vessels can be used for combat and exploration, with the power bestowed by them unlocking new areas in the world. Each class has its own special, elemental attacks, weapons, and moves. You can equip any character with any vessel, allowing for experimentation in combat.</p>

As it turns out, most players on Steam haven’t even progressed far enough in the original game to access the DLC - something publishers Bandai Namco have now issued a friendly FYI about.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with developers FromSoftware’s other Soulsborne games, you probably weren’t expecting a straightforward “pick the DLC from the menu” kind of approach to booting up Shadow of the Erdtree. (<em>Laughs in Artorias of the Abyss</em>.) And rightly so: the upcoming expansion is hidden away behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-you-must-defeat-some-of-elden-rings-toughest-bosses">two of the game’s harder bosses</a>, including one right at the end of one of its more easily missable areas.</p>
<p>Those bosses are Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood. The former is fairly easy to find - if less easy to beat - as he’s the main threat in the vast region of Caelid and one of the five shardbearers you can choose to take down to advance in the main story. (You’ll have to kill at least two, but can fight as many as you like.)</p>
<p>Mohg, meanwhile, is less obvious. Spoilers abound ahead! He’s found in the <span tabindex="0">Mohgwyn Palace</span>, which can only be reached by <span tabindex="0">using a teleporter in the secret Consecrated Snowfield region</span> - accessible by <span tabindex="0">collecting two halves of a secret medallion spread around the rest of the Lands Between</span> and using it to <span tabindex="0">travel on a mysterious lift to the frosty realm</span>. From there, you’ll need to <span tabindex="0">defeat a nearby NPC invader</span> to <span tabindex="0">activate the teleporter</span>. That’s just to get to <span tabindex="0">Mohgwyn Palace</span>, mind - then it’s a case of actually fighting your way through the fairly lengthy level and <span tabindex="0">defeating Mohg himself</span>. Phew! (Luckily, the nearby area is a great place to level up - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psa-please-leave-my-horrible-silver-frog-sons-alone-as-you-grind-for-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">unless you're a frog fan</a>.)</p>

</span></p><p>Given all that, it’s perhaps not all that surprising that almost two-thirds of Elden Ring players on Steam haven’t defeated Mohg, going by Steam achievement stats as spotted by Twitch streamer <a href="https://x.com/CohhCarnage/status/1800313422535364790">Cohh Carnage</a>. Around 38% of players have the achievement for besting the boss, while over 62% don’t have it. Bandai Namco shared the post as a “friendly PSA”, emphasising the need to have bested Mohg in time for the DLC.</p>
<p>As we already know, the entrance to Shadow of the Erdtree’s new area will be the <span tabindex="0">withered arm hanging from the cocoon behind the arena where you fight Mohg</span> - the <span tabindex="0">physical body of DLC-centric character Miquella, brother of Malenia</span>, who appeared in the original teaser for the expansion.</p>
<p>In other words, if you’re hoping to play Shadow of the Erdtree when it releases on June 21st, but are one of that 62%, you’ll need to get a wriggle on and take down Mohg asap. We do know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-more-elden-ring-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree-says-souls-boss-miyazaki">there won't be another Elden Ring DLC</a>, at least, so you've got all the time in the world to get through it. Good luck!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177048/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-set-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="a3JiZZ">Ravensburger’s successful trading card game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-lorcana"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, is getting its fif﻿th set — <em>Shimmering Skies</em> — and it includes lots of top-tier characters you’ll want to collect. The set includes two starter decks with characters like Wreck-it Ralph, Elsa, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175403/new-donald-duck-movie-short-diy-duck">Donald Duck</a>, to name a few. There’s also The Great Illuminary, a new location card set in a “radiant ballroom.”</p>
<p id="aDn5AD"><em>Shimmering Skies</em>, announced Wednesday in a livestream, includes gameplay mechanics that’ll be further explained closer to the release date: Aug. 9 for local game stores and Disney properties, and Aug. 23 for mass market retailers. For now, enjoy these peeks at the new cards.</p>
<p id="mmjt9n"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/14/18095040/ralph-breaks-the-internet-review-wreck-it-ralph-disney"><em>Wreck-it Ralph</em></a> makes its <em>Lorcana</em> debut with several character cards including two Vanellope von Schweetz cards and Ralph himself. The Vanellope von Schweetz, Random Roster Racer card is especially exciting, granting players the ability to rush, aka challenge a turn. There’s also a Donald Duck card, an Elsa rush card, and (most exciting to me) a Kronk card that slates him as head of security. </p>

<p id="E1JNim">As for non-character cards, players will have two new locations and a new action, You’re Welcome, which lets you shuffle the chosen card into your deck and draw two. Locations include the ballroom, mentioned earlier, and Bad-Anon, Villian Support Center where villain characters can work on improving themselves.</p>
<p id="sliWX6">Check out the rest of the new cards below, or browse the previous set, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24141466/disney-lorcana-ursulas-return-madrigal-family-encanto-cards"><em>Ursula’s Return</em></a>, to hold you over while you await the new decks.</p>

  <p id="vSWbMC"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/14/20964705/dontnod-tell-me-why-life-is-strange-xbox-microsoft-release-date"><em>Tell Me Why</em></a>, the other adventure title from the developers of <em>Life is Strange</em>, is currently currently free to download on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1180660/Tell_Me_Why/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=polygon&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fstore%2FproductId%2F9NF83PRZK6K3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?u1=[]pl[p]23940964[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder\u0026id=nOD/rLJHOac\u0026mid=24542\u0026murl=https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NF83PRZK6K3&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:72,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:2,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;u1&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;u1&quot;:&quot;[]pl[p]23940964[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;nOD/rLJHOac&quot;,&quot;mid&quot;:&quot;24542&quot;,&quot;murl&quot;:&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NF83PRZK6K3&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Xbox</a> marketplace. The three-part series launched back in 2020 for $19.99, and while the first part of the trilogy has been free since 2021, Dontnod has made the adventure available in its entirety for free during June in honor of Pride Month for the past couple of years.</p>

<p id="NJB2xc">Focusing largely on how your decisions impact the unfolding narrative, <em>Tell Me Why</em> tells an engaging story while staying light on mechanics. Fans of Telltale’s adventure titles, or Dontnod’s seminal adventure, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/29/7945795/life-is-strange-review-xbox-one-ps4-360-ps3-PC-episode-one"><em>Life is Strange</em></a>, will feel right at home. </p>
<p id="llzrJx">As with previous entries in the Dontnod catalog, the dialogue is occasionally cringe-y and can be a bit heavy-handed in its delivery, but the game still displays a <a href="https://www.tellmewhygame.com/resources/">surprising amount of literacy</a> surrounding the lived experiences of trans people. </p>
<p id="3zJW7p">If you’re a fan of some of Dontnod’s other adventure titles, or you’re just looking for a thoughtful and emotional game to play during Pride Month (or any month, really), you should take a minute to add <em>Tell Me Why</em> to your backlog. </p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24177061/twilight-of-the-gods-zack-snyder-netflix-animated-series</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zack-snyder%E2%80%99s-netflix-animated-series-is-full-of-viking-action-and-sword-fights.899610/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177061/twilight-of-the-gods-zack-snyder-netflix-animated-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9R2Gwg">Zack Snyder’s long-in-development Viking series, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22527795/zack-snyder-twilight-of-the-gods-cast-netflix-anime"><em>Twilight of the Gods</em></a>, finally has a trailer and a release date. The first look at the series is full of Viking violence, and plenty of blood, and the show is set to hit Netflix on Sept. 19. </p>
<p id="hEDvSD"><em>Twilight of the Gods</em> follows Leif, who is saved from a battlefield death by Sigrid, a warrior who he later marries. However, on their wedding night, the pair are attacked by Thor, setting them on a journey through hell and across the many treacherous lands of Norse mythology. </p>
<p id="OOegQG">The trailer is a little lighter on those plot details, but it does have some pretty impressive action. The series is animated by French studio Xilam Animation (<em>Chip ‘n’ Dale: Park Life</em>), and looks reminiscent of shows like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23435354/dragon-prince-mystery-aaravos-season-4-review-netflix"><em>The Dragon Prince</em></a>, with brief flashes of action from series like <em>Samurai Jack</em>. The characters look slick and unique, while the action itself looks beautiful, well-choreographed, and plenty bloody.</p>
<p id="0F1CAp">The series is co-created by Zack Snyder, Jay Oliva (<em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>), and Eric Carrasco (<em>Foundation</em>). Snyder directs the first and last episode, while Oliva, Andrew Tamandl (<em>Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous</em>), Tim Divar (<em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em>), and Dave Hartman (<em>Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire</em>) direct the rest. </p>
