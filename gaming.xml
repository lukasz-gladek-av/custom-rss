                <p>The Onimusha franchise was created in a very different era for gaming, decades before open-world titles and souls-like games were all the rage. Next year, Capcom will revisit the franchise with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gets-new-gameplay-look/1100-6532203/" data-ref-id="1100-6532203">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, and the game's director, Satoru Nihei, wants fans to know that he and his team won't be embracing those modern trends in the new title.</p><p>"Onimusha: Way of The Sword isn't an open-world game, and it certainly isn't a punishing die-and-retry (souls-like) game either," Nihei told <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-not-a-soulslike-and-not-open-world-director-says-instead-it-expands-on-what-the-series-is-known-for/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>. "While there's no doubt seasoned action-game players will be able to enjoy it, our goal was to make a game which gamers who don't consider action games their forte will also have fun playing. In Way of The Sword, our main focus was to express the clashing of blades through the action."</p><p>Nihel went on to explain that Way of the Sword is incorporating new mechanics to make the sword fights feel more realistic. Deflecting allows players to deplete the stamina of bosses, which will eventually allow characters to trigger a Break Issen attack and destroy part of the boss. Nihel also confirmed that the soul-absorption ability will be retained in the new game.</p><p>Producer Akihito Kadowaki recently told GameSpot that Way of the Sword is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/way-of-the-sword-is-not-connected-to-previous-onimusha-games-or-the-netflix-series/1100-6532389/" data-ref-id="1100-6532389">completely unconnected to any of the previous Onimusha games</a>. Instead, players will assume control of Miyamoto Mushashi, a samurai warrior whose likeness is based on the late actor Toshiro Mifune.</p><p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will hit PS5, Xbox Series X‚ùòS, and PC in 2026.</p>

But according to those who initially reported on the project, it's supposedly been moved to release in 2026.</p><p>While lamenting the state of his Fantasy Critic draft on the latest episode of The Last Nintendogs, Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb shares that he's heard the latest God of War title is now due to come out in 2026. No additional information regarding the reasoning for the move or whether it was the release window all along was shared.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Complete God of War Timeline Explained!</p>
      </div>
<p>When first reported, this latest entry in the God of War franchise was described as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/greek-god-of-war-side-story-releasing-this-year-report/1100-6530298/" data-ref-id="1100-6530298">side-story that would take the series back to Greece</a> and that it would release this year. Just before Sony's State of Play, <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1929890398236774904" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a> suggested that the game was smaller in scope than previously thought, while adopting a metroidvania format in 2D, with Grubb seemingly confirming he had heard the same. This would make this new God of War the latest in a trend of established franchises dabbling with the format after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" data-ref-id="5000-590624">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> released to critical acclaim last year.</p><p>Sony has yet to give any official indication it's working on a God of War spin-off or any other follow-up to 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" data-ref-id="5000-519021">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, which Sony Santa Monica has said concluded the Norse Mythology saga. The studio has not revealed what it has been working on since its release either.</p>

                <p>The original Final Fantasy Tactics was a sleeper hit as it was in the shadow of Final Fantasy 7 and the coming Final Fantasy 8. It helped redefine what a tactical RPG should look like and function, and will be getting a complete <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics/">remaster later this year</a>. However, the original game could have looked a lot different if not for art director Hiroshi Minagawa insisting it run at 60fps.</p><p>Having already put his stamp on Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together--the game many fans consider FFT's tonal predecessor--he wanted to improve the visuals even with the technical constraints of its era.</p>

<p>"At first, we wanted something closer to Tactics Ogre in terms of map size and character count. But no matter what we tried, the framerate dropped to 30fps," he said, while talking to the Japanese gaming site, <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250617t/2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Denfaminicogamer</a> (translated via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-original-final-fantasy-tactics-was-built-around-one-non-negotiable-requirement-60-fps/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Automaton Media</a>). He mentioned how he became obsessed with sticking to 60fps, especially after seeing Tobal No.1 playing incredibly smooth at 60fps.</p><p>Minagawa continued, saying he wanted to try to understand why the PlayStation's specs don't allow for that many polygons, but keep it at 60. Working backwards from there, the team took into account things like the size of the map and a design that avoids rounded corners as much as possible. Also, taking Tactics Ogre's party size from 10 and lowering it to five for FFT.</p><p>"Having 10-character parties like in Tactics Ogre felt like too much. Final Fantasy games at the time had parties of four or five, so we figured FFT should be an extension of that. And that just so happened to align perfectly with Minagawa‚Äôs framerate concerns," FFT director Yasumi Matsuno added. "[Final Fantasy Tactics] was a game that could only have been made at that time, on that hardware. Even if we tried to recreate it today, there's no way it would turn out the same."</p><p>Turn-based games such as FFT and Tactics Ogre are usually focused more on the gameplay and customization aspects of your party and less on the actual visual graphics.</p><p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles will be released on September 30 for PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<figure><a title="The House of the Dead 2: Remake 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/829dbc3fb109d/the-house-of-the-dead-2-remake-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Forever Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>An arcade light gun classic is coming out on <strong>7th August 2025</strong> as Forever Entertainment's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">The House of the Dead 2: Remake</a> brings zombies, bullets, and gore to Switch. The game was originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/house-of-the-dead-2-remake-blasts-onto-switch-this-spring">aiming for Spring</a>, but we're a little past that at this point!</p>
<p>Taking on the role as either James Taylor or Gary Stewart, you'll be blasting your way through a city that's been overrun by, well, the dead, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>The remake brings updated graphics and remastered music (and the ability to swap to the old music), but remains pretty faithful to the 1998 original. You can blast through the Classic Campaign, Boss Mode, or a Training Mode either on your own or with a buddy ‚Äî the Gary to your James, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">first remake</a>, this one's being developed by MegaPixel Studio; unfortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-house-of-the-dead-remake">we didn't love our time with the first game</a> back when it launched in 2022, as it was plagued with control and performance issues. Let's hope things are fixed for the sequel, which we have fond memories with on the Dreamcast.</p>

While the visual icon over a fallen party member‚Äôs body shows a trisected circle with one segment filled for each time they‚Äôve been downed, it turns out the actual number of hits it takes to bring them back to their feet scales dramatically with each full bar. (Yes, you revive your teammates by doing damage to them.)</p><p>Anyone who‚Äôs spent a few hours with the multiplayer roguelike intrinsically knows this, but having the math clearly laid out should help discourage anyone from trying to be a hero and getting cooked by a Nightlord in the process:</p><p>As Zullie the Witch explains, attacks done in an effort to revive a teammate are logged completely differently than normal damage against enemies. Each weapon type does a certain base amount of damage‚Äîstarting at 10 for daggers and torches and peaking at 25 for ballistas‚Äîand it takes 40 damage points to fill up the first revive bar. Simple enough, a flurry of quick stabs with a dagger will do it. But the second and third bars are where things get deceivingly devilish. At two bars, the damage required per bar is 45 for a total of 90, and at three bars its 80 each, for a whopping total of 240 damage. </p><p>That would be tough enough on its own, but the extra tricky part comes from how fast the bars refill in-between hits. At one bar, the meter refills at just two damage per second. At two bars, meanwhile, the refill happens at nine damage per second, while at three bars, they‚Äôre refilling at 40 points per second. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs essentially impossible to revive other teammates without an ultimate cooldown ready when you‚Äôre the last one standing. Turning your attention away for even a second to dodge an incoming attack will see almost all of your progress lost. </p><p>So why do many players insist on trying to revive thrice-downed teammates anyway? Psychologically, the fact that our minds are trained by the UI to think linearly while the game is scaling exponentially is no doubt part of it. Another is that no one wants to be the reason their team failed, getting your ass beat while strangers watch powerless to help. Third, it‚Äôs kind of just terrifying to go up against <em>Nightreign</em>‚Äôs tougher bosses with no backup. </p><p>Unless you‚Äôre used to playing solo, the game has a knack for making you think you‚Äôre better than you are because of how easy it is to whale on enemies while they‚Äôre trading off aggro against two other players. Once the odds are evened, the truth has nowhere to hide. As Zullie the Witch has shown, though, your best bet is to just dig in, block, dodge, and take pot shots until your ultimate art is ready. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gamestop-trading-card-game-problems-scalpers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days, GameStop is less a video game store and more a collectibles dealer. As of March, sales of stuff like Funko Pops and Pok√©mon cards nearly match its video game sales, <a href="https://sherwood.news/markets/gamestop-is-on-the-verge-of-selling-more-collectibles-than-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Sherwood News</a>. GameStop announced last year that it became a Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) dealer, meaning it can both buy <a href="https://collectable.com/collectableu/sports-card-grading-101/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graded</a> cards (<a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/56943/gamestop-begins-buying-high-grade-psa-pokemon-magic-the-gathering-yu-gi-oh-cards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something it started before becoming an official PSA dealer</a>) and accept cards to be graded. That‚Äôs on top of the big business of selling trading cards, like wildly popular new Pok√©mon and Magic: The Gathering sets, at retail stores. Trading cards and collectibles helped the company reach its first profitable quarter since 2019, something GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/n2bjm2pd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced during the company‚Äôs yearly annual meeting</a> for stockholders.&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop is looking to expand that part of the business: "We are focusing on trading cards as a natural extension of our existing business," Cohen <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/n2bjm2pd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> at the meeting. "The trading card market ‚Äî whether it's sports, Pok√©mon, or collectibles ‚Äî is aligned with our heritage. It fits our trade-in model, it appeals to our core customer base, and it's deeply embedded in physical retail. Unlike software, it's tactile. Unlike hardware, it has high margin potential. It's a logical expansion."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to GameStop for more information on what this expansion looks like.</p><p>Demand for trading cards, specifically Pok√©mon cards, is exceptionally high. It‚Äôs a boom that started during the COVID-19 pandemic and has continued to stay popular; people are both buying and selling individual cards while camping out for sealed, boxed sets hoping for rare pulls. (Or, simply, to scalp the sealed sets for tons of money.) The Pok√©mon Company <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCG/status/1879574273544622582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1879574273544622582%7Ctwgr%5E3e365562d3c2e6e7d47eb7a33f6eb02fc65790b0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2FPocket-Broke-the-Market-for-Real-PokC3A9mon-Cards%2F4ce3d86d-627a-42c7-877c-a99b97a85e49%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopSIaopMkM1xXR0kGWc5MW90XaPtLn8TgSturadhJuV0KBZTBvO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has apologized several times</a> for not being able to meet the high demand, continuously printing more and more cards. <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/en/aboutus/figures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pok√©mon Company printed 10 billion cards</a> in 2024, it reported in March. The year prior, the company had printed nearly 12 billion cards. The biggest jump in cards was from 2021 to 2022, from almost 4 billion to 9 billion cards printed.&nbsp;</p><p>It makes sense that GameStop, notoriously in the red businesswise, would turn to what‚Äôs making it money right now. But can its retail business handle it? Do workers <em>want</em> to handle it?&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/forums/threads/gamestop-discontinues-pokemon-tcg-preorders-at-stores-and-website.155701/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly no longer offers pre-orders for Pok√©mon cards</a>, a policy that was implemented in February. People can still buy online, but the policy also drives people to retail stores to skip out on the mess of bots trying to secure that stock. This can mean long lines and lots of people at stores on release days. On Reddit, GameStop workers have shared horror stories about the rush of people ‚Äî scalpers, hobbyists, and people looking to buy and sell graded cards ‚Äî coming into the store for trading cards. ‚ÄúTrading cards are killing me,‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1jd39jm/trading_cards_are_killing_me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one person wrote</a>. Asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1jcpa1g/do_gamestop_employees_hate_pokemon_collectors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a thread if GameStop workers hate Pok√©mon collectors</a>, a former worker wrote: ‚ÄúJust because you weren't rude doesn't mean I haven't been literally called slurs for not having pokemon cards in my store, lol. I think most of us are just fuckin tired boss, with no real end in sight unless you dip out on the company.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI have had my life threatened 5 times in 3 weeks over pokemon, a line at my door everyday,‚Äù another person wrote. ‚ÄúI think we are just over it to be honest.‚Äù</p><p>Cohen did, in his annual stockholder speech, address the hard work of retail:</p><blockquote><p>Most important, none of this would be possible without the people doing the actual work, our store employees and warehouse teams. They're the ones listing inventory, sweating on the job, serving customers, processing trade-ins, and keeping the business running.</p><p>They're not wasting time in Zoom meetings, they're not in PowerPoint decks, they're on their feet, every single day working hard and serving customers. They're the backbone of GameStop.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>He posited that ‚Äúexcessive executive pay, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gamestop-ceo-scapegoats-dei-for-company-troubles-2000565613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI initiatives</a> that prioritize image over merit, managers managing to Wall Street's short-term expectations and analysts, and boards handing out free stock like candy to people who would never buy a share themselves‚Äù is normal in corporate America, but that GameStop isn‚Äôt like that. ‚ÄúWe're a company that treats shareholder capital as our own, because it is,‚Äù he said.</p><p>What Cohen did not address is that the increased value of Pok√©mon cards has caused problems for retailers: Target had to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/target-halts-sale-trading-cards-including-pok-mon-over-safety-n1267442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily stop selling trading cards in 2021</a> because people were getting into fights over them.

In Missouri, a 27-year-old man was arrested in March <a href="https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/03/missouri-man-charged-after-hundreds-dollars-pokemon-cards-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and sentenced to six years in prison in May</a> for stealing hundreds of dollars worth of Pok√©mon cards from several stores. In the U.K., <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05x7rnjxno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a man was arrested ‚Äî again, in May ‚Äî for a heist of Pok√©mon cards valued at ¬£250,000</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading card crimes are reportedly up in Japan</a>, too.

But it's a problem that impacts GameStop's workers, one the company needs to address. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23603187/gamestop-robbery-problem-corporate-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Polygon in 2023</a>, workers pointed to GameStop sometimes scheduling one employee to a store for a shift, making certain shops easy targets.</p><p>The details of GameStop‚Äôs further drive into trading cards could exacerbate the problem. <a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop has been closing stores</a> en masse and laying off employees across the country, driving customers to a small subset of understaffed locations ‚Äî <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/gamestop-shares-tank-on-convertible-bond-offering-to-potentially-buy-more-bitcoin.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all while GameStop itself pivots to bitcoin</a>, for some reason.

The game was also accepted into Microsoft's Developer Acceleration Program.</p><p>However, all of this only covered half of what Studio Camelia said it needed to produce Alzara. So it decided to run a Kickstarter campaign to demonstrate to potential investors that Alzara had legs. The team then sought funding from an "industry partner," but it was ultimately unable to secure one.</p><p>"Investors are now operating in a market where taking risks is discouraged, and they can afford to wait before committing to a project in order to reduce risk," the statement said.</p><p>Studio Camelia attended Tokyo Game Show, DICE, and other industry events to meet with partners about raising funding, but "none of them resulted in a contract."</p><p>"We spared no effort and tried to hold on as long as we could," the developer said. "This is part of the harsh reality of the industry. We are creatives, but we need funding to keep creating. Sometimes, even having a promising game concept with proven market interest and a strong team is not enough. Many say that every released game is a miracle, and that couldn't be more true."</p><p>Alzara is now "on an indefinite pause" as the studio undergoes the liquidation process that requires "various legal procedures" that will run for "some time."</p><p>"There is a slim chance that a third party might one day step in and offer to take over the project. If that happens, the game would inevitably take a different direction than what was presented during the campaign, but hopefully for the better!" the studio said.</p><h2><strong>Pre-production demo footage</strong></h2><p>While Alzara may never be released, Studio Camelia released pre-production demo footage of the game, showing it in its non-finished state. The studio said it cannot release the demo itself due to copyright reasons and issues pertaining to the liquidation process.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLV5dIfrX4k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FLV5dIfrX4k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Plenty of games enter development and are never released. The creative process, after all, is a fickle business. Blizzard, for example, says it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-cancels-new-game-in-development-for-two-y/1100-6467418/" data-ref-id="1100-6467418">cancels about half of the games it begins development on.</a> Warner Bros., meanwhile, is reported to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">spent $100 million on a new Wonder Woman game before cancelling it. </a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is a great-looking game, leveraging the ray tracing enhancements that the latest iteration of iDTech affords the blood-soaked shooter. But if you're on PC, then you can unlock the true potential of the engine with the awaited path tracing update, at the expense of a lot of performance.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-path-tracing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">path tracing</a> is an all-encompassing form of ray tracing, which simulates how rays of light bounce off surfaces, that is far more demanding. Objects shoot out more rays and allow those rays to bounce around a scene more than once, leading to far more accurate lighting, better ambient occlusion, and better reflections and surface material approximations. It is, when implemented correctly, a night-and-day difference to standard ray tracing techniques, albeit only afforded by some of the best hardware on the market.</p><p>Path tracing can be transformative in Doom: The Dark Ages, if you find the right scene to do some comparisons, and it's interior spaces seem to benefit the most. Light bounces and illuminates objects in ways that standard ray tracing can't afford, while the contrast between the areas where light is meant to be, and where it definitely shouldn't, are more naturally defined. Digital Foundry has released an extensive look at many of the improvements path tracing affords, which gives you a good idea if the additional visual flair is worth it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR3c9lyV5as" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BR3c9lyV5as" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's because you'll need to give up a lot of performance to take advantage of path tracing, even if you restrict which game objects make use of it. You'll be making heavy use of Nvidia's DLSS or frame generation to keep the action feeling smooth, with <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/pc-gaming/i-tested-the-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-the-difference-is-night-and-day-but-my-gpu-got-hotter-than-hell" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom's Guide</a> stating that performance plummeted by 40% on the RTX 5070Ti used for testing. Your mileage may vary depending on what GPU you're using, but just like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> before it, this isn't a setting you can just turn on and forget about.</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages is another great entry in the modern reinvention of the series, continuing from the strong foundations established with 2016's Doom and Doom Eternal, while taking the action in a wholly new direction. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, we praised this new direction saying, "Doom: The Dark Ages shows that there's still so much fertile ground that this series can explore, and that sometimes smart, measured changes can take the series in surprising new directions and yield some of its finest moments."</p>

The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">spotlight Direct</a> was absolutely jam-packed with DK goodness, revealing some familiar faces, highlighting a bunch of gameplay mechanics and announcing enough collectibles to make even the most tentative completionist break out in a sweat. On top of all that, we've also got a new batch of screenshots ‚Äî like we said, what a day!</p>
<p>The freshly-baked screens cover a lot of the same ground that you will have seen in the Direct, but it's a nice chance to stop for a minute and <em>really</em> soak up some of the details. Scrolling through them got us feeling sufficiently pumped for the game's <strong>17th July</strong> release date, and we thought it would be only fair to share them all with you lovely lot too.</p>
<p>So, let's check out some of these sweet snaps, shall we? Starting with the surprise reveal that started it all: Pauline!</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184093 @ 1750275910 -->
<p>And how about those vistas? Just imagine the punching potential...</p>



<p>Next, let's have a look at the three Bananza Transformations, which will see DK morph into a giant gorilla, a speedy zebra and a flying ostrich, each with its own special abilities:</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184091 @ 1750275910 -->
<p>We've got a handful of gameplay screenshots too, so you can see what exploration and Challenge Courses will look like when treated to some HUD magic:</p>


<p>And we haven't forgotten about you menu fans, either. We'll round things out with a closer look at the in-game map, the DK Art mode, and a handful of shop and Skill Point menus:</p>

<hr>
<p>We're imagine we'll hear a little more from Donkey Kong Bananza before it swings its way to Switch 2 on 17th July, but for now, at least, you can consider us sufficiently hyped!</p>

            <p>
Following last year's slam-dunk <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, the beloved survival horror sequel is being reinterpreted yet again, this time in the form of new movie adaptation Return to Silent Hill. And now, three years after its announcement, it's been given a release date of 23rd June 2026.
</p>
<p>
Return to Silent Hill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-konamis-silent-hill-october-2022-showcase">originally unveiled in 2022</a>, alongside a variety of gaming projects including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-ascension-fails-to-impress-with-greedy-monetisation-and-cluttered-ui">unloved Silent Hill: Ascension</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">masterful Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, and No Code's still-mysterious Silent Hill Townfall.
</p>
<p>
Amid that flurry of gaming news, Return to Silent Hill was perhaps a little lost in the throng, but the key bit of information was that it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-detailed">see Christophe Gans take on directing duties once more</a>. Gans, of course, previously helmed 2006's Sean-Bean-starring original Silent Hill movie, which certainly captured the game series' atmosphere - even if it did all start to fall apart in the last stretch, when it suddenly decided it needed to explain itself in a ham-fisted exposition dump that even some high-velocity barbed wire couldn't save.

Since Return to Silent Hill's initial unveiling, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">War Horse's Jeremy Irvine will star as Silent Hill 2 protagonist James</a>, with Hannah Emily Anderson in the role of his "one true love" Mary (an early leak suggested the two won't be married in this version). More recently, Gans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">insisted his adaptation would be a "faithful" one</a>, although a careful reading of the movie's synopsis does imply some potentially notable changes:

"James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends," reads the official synopsis. "When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognisable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love."

We'll know if Return to Silent Hill does its source material justice when it <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/">hits the big screen</a> on 23rd June next year. However it ends up, Bloober's remake - which has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-passes-another-sales-milestone">sold over 2m copies</a> - is a fine way to experience a bonafide gaming classic. And the studio is about to do it all over again, as it embarks on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-silent-hill-remake-has-been-revealed-during-konami-press-start-showcase">recently announced remake of Silent Hill 1</a>.

			<p>With less than three months until the launch date of Borderlands 4, Gearbox is starting to share a lot more details. Yesterday, the game became <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for pre-order</a>, and fans learned the pricing and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC system requirements</a>. Now, Executive Producer Chris Brock has been <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/borderlands-4-interview-with-chris-brock-producer-and-taylor-clark-senior-writer-1559773/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by Gamereactor. Among other things, he reckons that the new game is more of an evolution for the franchise than its predecessor was when it launched in 2019.</p>
<p><em>The time between Borderlands 2 and Borderlands 3 was about seven years. We had been gone for a while. We wanted to make sure that when we came back it was familiar. When people say it feels like more Borderlands, yeah, that was the goal. We wanted to make more Borderlands. We wanted to evolve, but we didn't want to change the formula so much that it didn't feel familiar.</em></p>
<p><em>But going from Borderlands 3 to Borderlands 4, one of the things we wanted to focus on was the traversal abilities and exploration. And that has led to the series evolving, I would say, more between 3 and 4 than it did between 2 and 3, for sure.</em></p>
<p>In the same interview, Senior Writer Taylor Clark explained why Borderlands 4 will feature a different brand of humor than previous installments.</p>
<p><em>The most important thing for us is to have a tone that feels like it makes sense in the world we're building and in the story we're trying to tell. On Pandora, like the Wild West, the shotgun approach made sense. Because this was a world where anything goes. A world where everything was trying to kill you and corporations were trying to cut each other's throats. And Handsome Jack always looked at you and was talking shit to you. The slightly nastier tone made sense in that world. On a totalitarian, dictatorial planet ruled by this person with an iron fist, it makes less sense.</em></p>
<p><em>It makes less sense to have a tone like that. It wouldn't feel appropriate (like firing jokes from a T-shirt cannon) when we are under a horribly oppressed world. We tried to find the humor. It wouldn't be a Borderlands game without humor.</em></p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is coming on September 12 to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, while the Nintendo Switch 2 version will be released at a later date.</p>

                <p>Warner Bros. Games has announced a major organizational change as it looks to focus on four major franchises going forward: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC.</p><p>Yves Lachance, who was previously the studio head of WB Games Montreal, is now senior vice president of development, with his remit being overseeing the studios working on Harry Potter and Game of Thrones games. Shaun Himmerick, who previously was the boss at NetherRealm, is now senior vice president for development on all new Mortal Kombat and DC games.</p><p>WB Games New York boss Steven Flenory is now senior vice president for central tech and services, a role that sees him overseeing quality assurance, user research, game and publishing technology, and customer service.</p><p>These three executives will report to Warner Bros. Discover boss JB Perrette. In a statement, Perrette said the company is making these changes to "develop long-term franchise roadmaps" for Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC projects.</p><p>"We are very fortunate to have a strong stable of development and technology talent, and Yves, Shaun, and Steven are respected leaders with excellent track records in their areas of expertise. I'm looking forward to working closely with them and the team as we work to make the best games possible for our key franchises," Perrette said.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Variety</a>, this management shakeup did not lead to any layoffs or any executives leaving the company. Former WB Games top boss David Haddad left the company earlier this year, and it remains to be seen if the company is looking for a replacement.</p><p>Earlier this month, WB Discovery said it is breaking apart into two companies: WBD Streaming and Studios and WBD Global Networks. WB Games is part of the Streaming and Studios division, which is run by CEO David Zaslav.</p><p>In terms of upcoming releases, Batman: Arkham Knight developer Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>. WB Games Montreal is reportedly pitching a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">new Game of Thrones title</a>. Avalanche Software is expected to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">Hogwarts Legacy sequel</a>.</p><p>The Mortal Kombat series, meanwhile, is expected to continue from developer NetherRealm. As for other DC projects, studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a>, but not soon. Game of Thrones: Kingsroad launched earlier this year and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-of-thrones-rts-revealed-for-pc/1100-6532166/" data-ref-id="1100-6532166">new Game of Thrones RTS is coming in 2026.</a></p><p>One WB game that is not going forward is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">new Wonder Woman game that the company spent a reported $100 million on before cancelling. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="DK Bananza 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac54d4227a89c/dk-bananza-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have to admit, before the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it"><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza</strong> Direct</a>, I wasn't <em>massively</em> enthusiastic about Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 platformer.</p>
<p>I played about 20 minutes of it at one of the Switch 2 Experience events back in April, and although I was charmed by the aesthetics and the ability to smash up pieces of the environment, I couldn't help but wonder if there was something more - that Nintendo was holding back a little bit.</p>
<p>It turns out I was wrong. It held back a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>This Direct was simply magnificent and my excitement has gone from about 45/100 bananas all the way up to about 98. That's a lot of bananas! Where are the remaining two, you ask? Well, King K. Rool isn't there, but we can't have everything now, can we?</p>

<p>My concern around the playable demo was that the game would amount to little more than smashing through the terrain to find collectibles ('Banandium Gems'). Surely there was more to it, right? Well, yes.</p>
<p>For starters, let's just touch on the wonderful bait and switch regarding Odd Rock and Pauline. We kinda knew something like this was in the works following a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/did-donkey-kong-bananza-key-art-accidentally-leak-a-big-surprise">unfortunate leak</a>, but it's still an incredible move. I honestly couldn't click with Odd Rock from the earlier promotional material, so to learn that DK will instead spend his time with a young Pauline was an absolute delight.</p>
<p>You can keep your depressing father/daughter dynamic, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/last_of_us_part_i">The Last of Us</a> ‚Äì this is much more up my street.</p>

<p>Pauline's not just there for show, either. With special Bananza Powers, she can burst into song and enable DK to transform into completely new forms. Kong Bananza looks absolutely awesome, but I'm sorry, Zebra Bananza? <em>Ostrich Bananza..?!</em> I'm gonna need plushies of those right now, thank you very much.</p>
<p>The transformations grant you extra strength, speed, and the ability to fly, and just these alone make the gameplay look infinitely more varied and compelling than what I saw in the early demo. I've a feeling there might be a few more transformations Nintendo hasn't revealed just yet too. How about Sloth Bananza? <em>Anyone..?</em></p>
<p>Quick glimpses of other gameplay features ‚Äî including the Challenge Course Ruins, the skill tree, and collectible costumes ‚Äî did a lot to boost my excitement too. Side-scrolling levels are back! Rambi is back! And I simply can't wait to experiment with the different clothing and colour options. Who knew that an ice-themed Donkey Kong would look so cool?</p>

<p>And of course, I have to give a shoutout to the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-channels-super-mario-64-energy-with-its-dk-artist-mode">DK Artist mode</a>. As someone who messed around with the 3D menu-screen Mario in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> longer than I care to admit, being able to chip chunks off DK's face or Bowser's hair and create some truly terrifying monstrosities makes me more excited than DK gobbling up a Banandium Gem. It looks absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>It wasn't <em>all</em> for me, admittedly. Chances are I won't go into photo mode too much or jump into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-features-two-player-co-op-and-you-can-even-gameshare-to-switch-1">co-op multiplayer</a>, and there's not a hope in hell I'm buying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-gets-a-new-amiibo-nintendo-details-how-they-work-in-dk-bananza">another amiibo</a>, but I appreciate their inclusion regardless.</p>
<p>I've got to be honest, though: after the incredibly disappointing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-mario-kart-world-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong> Direct</a> in April, which basically just went over everything we already knew and did very little to move my excitement beyond about 70 blue shells out of 100, the DK Direct totally 180-ed me.</p>
<p>I was <em>mildly</em> excited before, but now it's my most anticipated game of the year. Bravo, Nintendo. Just don't tell Samus.</p>

Those who fall in battle hit the ground and can get picked back up, if their teammates wail on them hard enough to knock out the purple bars of their circular dial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm probably not alone in feeling like, sometimes, this mechanic seems to get more arduous as players fall more often. If you fall once, it's only one pip on the bar; but by third death, you've got the whole radius covered in purple, and it can feel quite difficult to chip that much purple bar down while a Nightlord is attacking you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, there are some hidden mechanics that may be helping or hindering your efforts to pick your teammates back up. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZullietheWitch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Zullie the Witch</a> has been on the Elden Ring Nightreign beat, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HUe7JUs8_M" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently put up new video</a> in which they try to understand how revives work. (Thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/you-arent-just-imagining-things-elden-ring-nightreign-player-confirms-its-6x-harder-to-revive-someone-at-3-bars-when-compared-to-1-because-fromsoftwares-ui-is-basically-lying-to-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Zullie's investigation, the first time a player falls in battle, they get one bar at a total of 40 HP. But as they continue to fall, this escalates at a surprising rate, with 45 per bar at second death and a whopping 80 per bar at three, for a grand total of 240 HP total if you're on three bars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitting the player who's downed chips away at those totals, but if they're left alone for 3.5 seconds, the death timer around their dial resumes (unless you're in a Night boss fight) and the gauge starts to refill. The fill time also speeds up as you gain more bars, going from 2-per-second at one bar to 40-per-second at three bars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's a lot of math to say: the more you fall, the harder it gets (exponentially so) to pick you back up. There is some good news though, as penalties gradually wear off over time or whenever one visits a Site of Grace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zullie also highlights some hidden math in how weapons work on the revive bars, too. It's about what you'd expect, compared to regular attacks; giant weapons, like Halberds, Reapers, and Greatswords have more impact on the revive bar than Claws, Daggers, Torches, or Fists on a per-swing basis. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Revenant's Cursed Claws make for uniquely effective revival tools in this regard, as they have the same base numbers as a Greatsword. Revenant mains can effectively play both White Mage and Summoner, I guess?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Zullie's video goes into even more math around the revival numbers, but for the average Elden Ring Nightreign player, the solid takeaways are that higher bars get increasingly harder to clear as Nightfarers fall. Honestly, it makes certain characters like the Revenant even more valuable as teammates, when they have both summons to help out and an ultimate that will pick teammates back up regardless of their bar's status.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We‚Äôve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you‚Äôre wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Absolutely," said guitarist Terry Corso. "We understand that they're trying to bring some new stuff onto these releases, and if you've gotta make cuts, you've gotta make cuts. I don't know why it had to be us, I feel like our song was really good on there and it did really well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I kind of get it, that skating feels a little more punk [and] we're not a punk band," added lead vocalist Dryden Mitchell, "but I think that's what makes a cool soundtrack, is a collection, being different."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the soundtrack's reveal among fans was mixed, with some celebrating the return of tracks by CKY and Iron Maiden, while others said they would miss bands such as Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Zebrahead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 - Before and After Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Responding on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, Hawk has taken personal responsibility for the remake's choice of soundtrack, and said he had deliberately decided to include an element of discovery, as players got to know new tunes as well as old favorites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in THPS3+4 OST," Hawk said. "I'm hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place.
