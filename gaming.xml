            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of games like&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wattam</em>, has revealed the release date for his latest game&nbsp;<em>To a T</em>. It's scheduled to hit Xbox and PC later this year.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>will launch across Xbox Series X|S and PC on May 28th. It sounds as though the Xbox One version, which was apparently revealed back when the game was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/06/annapurna-interactive-uvula-and-keita-takahashi-announce-to-a-t-for-xbox-series-xbox-one-and-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled in 2023</a>, is no longer happening.</p>

<p>Takahashi and his team describe&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>as "a narrative adventure game...with a strong focus on character, interaction, story, and exploration". You will play the role of Teen, a teenager permanently stuck in a T-pose trying to live a normal life. Hey, at least nobody will challenge Teen's dominance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator-teen.jpg?itok=X6bxnQjO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator-teen.jpg?itok=Us_jC-kL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>To a T&nbsp;</em>turns T-posing into a plot element.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll have to help Teen try and live as best they can, controlling them in "a variety of different scenarios" like moving their arm to eat, petting their dog, and more.</p>

<p>As well as helping Teen with their everyday life, you'll also be able to explore the town in which they live, meeting its inhabitants and collecting coins scattered around the streets. <em>To a T</em> will offer a "free mode" that will allow you to explore at your leisure.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll also be able to customize Teen in whatever style you like, purchasing clothing from stores you'll find around town. Don't worry, though; I'm pretty sure you won't need to buy those clothes with real currency.</p>

<p>You can check out the (frankly adorable) release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>right here. It features an original song, "Giraffe Song", sung by none other than&nbsp;<em>Steven Universe</em>'s Rebecca Sugar, as well as exactly the kind of visual style you'd expect from the creator of&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wattam" rel="nofollow"><em>Wattam</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>To a T&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875320/to_a_T/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/to-a-t/9NM6NMBJ7ZK4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on May 28th. It'll also be available as part of Xbox Game Pass on day one, although you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">need to be subscribed</a> to either PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate to play it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date-revealed.1117041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros and NetherRealm Studios have revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s upcoming T-1000 DLC, and it won't be long before you get to slice your opponents apart as Robert Patrick's intimidating automaton.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer showing off the T-1000's moves, the character, who is the latest crossover fighter to appear as part of the game's&nbsp;<em>Khaos Reigns&nbsp;</em>expansion, will be released for owners of that expansion on March 18th and for everyone else on March 25th.</p>

<p>The T-1000 wears his (its?) iconic police officer uniform from&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em>, and since the newer model is a shapeshifter, it can be seen transforming its arms into weapons like blades and Kabal-esque hookswords.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/t-1000-johnny-cage-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=JBwFNUZO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/t-1000-johnny-cage-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=1Xpp0kqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The T-1000 will fit into&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s violent world perfectly.</figcaption></figure><p>During the closing moments of the DLC fighter's teaser trailer, after he's beaten Johnny Cage to a pulp, we see him using his Fatality, in which he uses&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2</em>'s infamous truck to pulverize his opponent before hopping out of the driver's seat and finishing the job with a submachine gun.</p>

<p>It's not just the T-1000, either. The trailer also teases a little of new Kameo fighter Madam Bo, who appears in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s main story mode as the owner of the Fengjian Teahouse and a friend to Raiden and Kung Lao.</p>

<p>In the trailer, she can be seen leapfrogging over the T-1000 to deliver some pretty impressive martial arts moves of her own, so it looks like she'll be a formidable ally.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for the T-1000 right here, with&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>head honcho Ed Boon <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1893814056609263619" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promising</a> that a longer trailer will be on the way "soon".</p>




<p>The T-1000 is just the latest crossover fighter to appear in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. He's preceded by the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-first-look" rel="nofollow">Homelander</a>, DC antihero&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-peacemaker-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Peacemaker</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Invincible</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window" rel="nofollow">Omni-Man</a> (are you sensing a pattern emerging here?).</p>

<p>The game's roster has also been expanded with fighters from previous&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games, including telekinetic ninja <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-ermac-release-date" rel="nofollow">Ermac</a> and Netherrealm sorcerer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-cena-will-voice-peacemaker-in-mortal-kombat-1-while-quan-chi-gets-release-date" rel="nofollow">Quan Chi</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick's single-minded automaton, as well as the upcoming Conan the Barbarian DLC, won't be the only crossover in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>'s future, either; Lin Kuei ninja Sub-Zero recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-lawless-update-chapter-6-season-2" rel="nofollow">found his way into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em></a>, and it's been rumored that his rival Scorpion will be appearing later in the game's newest season as well.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mortal-kombat-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mortal-kombat-1/9N7271QN4SGB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mortal-kombat-1-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. The game's T-1000 DLC launches on March 25th for general players and March 18th for&nbsp;<em>Khaos Reigns&nbsp;</em>owners.</p>

If you plan to go all-in this playstyle, you may want to bring a wand with you too. These have a high attack speed and can build Stun damage on your foes very quickly. Most importantly, of course, is that it rounds out your Wizard vibes.</p><p>Though you can certainly get through the game mixing and matching spells, picking a single element to focus on with a single grimoire can make you ultra-powerful. If you want to go for high damage over time, I recommend choosing fire, because it absolutely slaps in this game.</p><h2 id="h612571"><a id=""></a><strong>Sword and Grimoire</strong></h2><p>Grimoires also pair exceedingly well with a good one-handed weapon like a sword. This allows you to cast spells and beat the hell out of enemies with rapid swings all at once. This Battlemage build can be one of the most rewarding in the game once you learn how to weave all of your attacks together.</p><p>If you decide to go for a fire-focused build, <strong>pick up the quest Dawntreader in Paradis</strong> during the early part of the game. This quest leads you to arguably the best weapon in <em>Avowed</em>, The Last Light of Day, an immensely strong fire sword with one of the most useful enchantments in the game.</p><h2 id="h612572"><a id=""></a><strong>Sword and Pistol</strong></h2><p>If you’re not really feeling the magic thing, maybe you should opt for a sword and pistol combo. The Ranger skill tree has some really great abilities for this playstyle, such as slowing down time for you to line up perfect shots on enemy noggins. When enemies close in, you can beat ‘em down with your sword (or other one-handed weapon of choice).</p><p>Do note, though, that going this route will mean investing fairly equally in the Fighter and Ranger trees to get the most out of the playstyle. As such, you’ll probably want to analyze how you’re approaching fights and make a build that capitalizes just a bit more on one or the other.</p><h2 id="h612573"><a id=""></a><strong>Pistol and Grimoire</strong></h2><p>If you’d like to go for a Bible thumper build, wield a pistol and grimoire. Slinging spells and poppin’ heads is a ranged player’s dream. It might be a good idea to invest in some frost spells if you choose this build, however, as pistols reload a bit slowly.</p><p>As with a Sword and Pistol loadout, opting for this playstyle may stretch your ability points a little thin. But you’re likely to benefit most from leaning more on the Ranger tree, as magic is pretty damn incredible even with limited investment, while pistols require you to level some passive abilities to really shine.</p><h2 id="h612574"><a id=""></a><strong>Wand and Wand</strong></h2><p>Hear me out. You may think dual-wielding is best suited for pistols and one-handed melee weapons, but you might be shocked at how powerful dual wands can be. The rapid attack speed of wands can result in some damn good DPS without the need to line up critical shots as precisely as you would with guns.</p><p>Even more, if you combine two elemental wands, you can rapidly build up status effects on your foes for even more damage. Add in a few magic spells and you’ll be whittling down health bars like you wouldn’t believe.</p><hr><p><em>Avowed</em> is available now on Xbox Series X and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mecha-break-release-window%E2%80%94platforms-everything-we-know.1117032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Mecha Break Release Period is great news to the hundreds of thousands who wishlisted the manic mech title. The beta is proving to be a hit, and the full Mecha Break release could be groundbreaking.</p>



<p>Amazing Seasun Games is an ambitious studio focused on making fun and different games. You only have to look at the difference between Snowbreak Containment Zone—a fully-fledged sci-fi shooter—and Mecha Break to see this. But it’s the latter drawing a lot of eyes in 2025.</p>



<p>Did you know Mecha Break’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-announces-open-beta-and-new-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta</a> hit a monumental <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-beta-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">317,000 concurrent players on its first day</a>? Sleep on it if you dare. Let’s get stuck into the latest on the multiplayer mech shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-mecha-break-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Mecha Break is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A spectacle. Credit to Amazing Seasun Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mecha Break doesn’t have a specific release date, but it’s been confirmed the game is arriving in Spring 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The general release period was confirmed by developer Amazing Seasun Games via an <a href="https://x.com/MechaBREAK/status/1888331963536400723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X post</a>. They let players know: “Mecha BREAK launches Spring 2025!”</p>



<p>I have to think the open beta feedback will have a bearing on launch plans. If there’s a lot to work on, don’t be surprised to see the release window get pushed back. Very rarely are games brought forward, so expect <a href="https://mechabreak.seasungames.com/index/en/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mecha Break</a> to launch in the months of <strong>March, April, or May</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-mecha-break-platforms">Mecha Break Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox Series X|S and PC players can enjoy Mecha Break at release, and the mech shooter is also coming to PlayStation 5 later on.</strong></p>



<p>In the same post concerning the release window, the developer confirmed its initial platforms: “Play on Steam, Windows PC via the Xbox App, and as a console launch exclusive with Xbox Series X|S.” A curious fan quizzed the Mecha Break X page on the status of a PlayStation 5 launch.</p>



<p>If you are on PS5, don’t worry, a future release is on the cards: “<strong>We look forward to bringing Mecha BREAK to PlayStation players later in 2025</strong>.” </p>







<p>It’s disappointing for PlayStation users, but at least a port is coming! Nintendo Switch players must sit this one out for good—unless the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> can handle it.</p>



<hr>



<p>Mecha Break is one of many incredible games scheduled for 2025. From Soulslike titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> to the Devil May Cry-inspired action title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, and FPS royalty with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>. If you do play Mecha Break, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-earn-mecha-break-twitch-drops-all-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get free Twitch Drops</a> for it.</p>

                <p>Asus has announced a new mouse, and while it looks like a casual device that'll appeal to any cottagecore enthusiast with its soft pastel colors, it does have a neat trick up its proverbial sleeve in the form of an oil diffuser. That's right: this mouse has an "internal fragrance compartment" for aromatic oils, perfect for anyone who wants to keep their workstation smelling fresh and not like weeks of accumulated hand-sweat odor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448965-asus-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448965" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448965-asus-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448965"></a><figcaption>Asus Fragrance Mouse</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448965-asus-4.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448966-asus-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448967-asus-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448968-asus-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448969-asus-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448966,1300-4448967,1300-4448968,1300-4448969" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4448966-asus-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4448967-asus-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4448968-asus-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4448969-asus-5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448966-asus-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448967-asus-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448968-asus-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448969-asus-5.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-fragrance-mouse-release/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus says</a> that the removable vial can be washed and refilled with different scents, so you can customize it to your olfactory preferences.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Surgeon Simulator&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>I Am Bread&nbsp;</em>developer Bossa Studios has announced it will lay off an undisclosed number of employees, and that it will restructure its operations to focus on smaller projects.</p>

<p>In a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-games-confirms-layoffs-amid-industry-turmoil-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>), Bossa co-CEO Henrique Olifiers says that the "disruption" brought to the games industry in the past couple of years has seen "treasured studios, teams, and games being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">shut down</a> or significantly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">scaled back</a>".</p>

<p>Olifiers calls this a "fundamental transformation" of the industry and says that Bossa isn't immune to it; his studio has made the "painful decision" to scale itself back, which means "saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues", although he doesn't say how many or in which areas of the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/surgeon-simulator-2-bossa-studios-layoffs.jpg?itok=PYbTtKDg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/surgeon-simulator-2-bossa-studios-layoffs.jpg?itok=o6vevPkx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bossa Studios is to lay off an undisclosed number of employees.</figcaption></figure><p>Olifiers goes on to say that Bossa will be focusing on the upcoming launch of open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, which is currently in "late-stage production". The game does not yet have a release date.</p>

<p>He says that once&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is out and "enjoying live operations", Bossa will "reshape into small teams working independently on novel game ideas", with a view to releasing those games "as early as possible".</p>

<p>In closing, Olifiers says he and his team wish they had "found a way of navigating [industry] turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back [their] teams", but that they "failed" to do so.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time in the last year or so that Bossa has laid off employees. Back in January, the studio said that it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off around a third of its workforce</a>, with Olifiers putting those layoffs down to increasing costs, delayed funding, and the troubles faced by smaller games in the market.</p>

In recent weeks, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow"><em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>studio Night School</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Iron Galaxy</a> reducing staff.</p>

<p>It's not just smaller studios, either; NetEase recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">laid off the entire team</a> responsible for developing&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>in Seattle, despite the fact that the game had 40 million (admittedly not necessarily active) players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">at last count</a>.</p>

But if you want to earn every trophy or achievement in the game, you’ll need to do exactly that.

Hooray!</p><p>By passing through the door, you’ll earn the “Masterclass” trophy or achievement, getting you one step closer to completing everything in <em>Big Helmet Heroes</em>. Just don’t forget to replay Level 10 normally so you can finish breaking all of the cages to rescue all the heroes within!</p><hr><p><em>Big Helmet Heroes</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Corporate gaming giant NetEase are hunting for more jobs to slash among their overseas studios, according to insiders who spoke to Bloomberg and Game File last week. The parent company recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">cut a bunch of US jobs among their Marvels Rivals developers</a> despite the game raking in a big profit. And it now looks like that was just the start of a larger mauling which may hit up to 20 of the company's non-Chinese studios.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"NetEase is actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios—many of the very same ones it announced over the last three years," says Stephen Totilo in a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">report for Game File</a>. "One of Game File’s sources says NetEase plans to divest itself of the majority of its overseas teams, leading to the potential closure of more than a dozen game studios, if they can’t secure new post-NetEase funding." </p>
<p>Among the overseas studios owned by NetEase are French studio Quantic Dream, who were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-have-acquired-quantic-dream">acquired in 2022</a>, and Nagoshi Studio, a venture set-up by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-yakuza-series-director-announces-new-studio-under-netease">a former Yakuza director</a>. The corporate behemoth also own several overseas studios that haven't released a game yet, such as US studio Bulletfarm and Bad Brain Game Studios in Canada, among 16 other studios in various countries. It's not clear which of these studios are on the chopping block. </p>
<p>"[All] studios and projects are in constant review and evaluation," the company told Game File after a request for comment, "and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made throughout that process.” </p>
<p>NetEase are also partial owners of Polish studio Rebel Wolves, the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-the-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-a-trailer-looks-witcherish">recently revealed</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood Of Dawnwalker</a>. But they are minority shareholders, as clarified by co-owner Tomasz Tinc <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomasz-tinc-314a88a_ive-also-read-the-articles-suggesting-that-activity-7299704037124247552-4dpq/">on LinkedIn</a>, who said that Dawnwalker is "fully funded" and not in danger.</p>
<p>"The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues," he said.

</p><p>A pattern of cuts to relatively new NetEase studios has already emerged. As noted by Edwin recently, NetEase have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">pulled funding for Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">split with Jar Of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">laid people off</a> at Liquid Swords. All these studios were recently set up by industry veterans who had worked on game series' like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo">Halo</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a>. </p>
<p>The move is a strategic set of cutbacks envisioned from on-high, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push">Bloomberg</a>, who report that NetEase CEO William Ding has "reasserted his leadership with a series of dramatic decisions over the past year", including hiring a number of 20-something finance graduates to "lead or supervise gaming units", according to the newspaper's sources. </p>
<p>NetEase laid off almost 900 workers from various games subsidiaries over the course of 2023, Bloomberg also notes. But when asked about the status of overseas studios on a conference call last week, Ding responded via translator to say that the company will continue to support "high-quality studios and really master creators.”</p>
<p>“That is our strategy,” he said. “There’s no change on that.”</p>
<p>If you are one of the 448,000 players who played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> at the height of its popularity on Steam, you may be looking at those recently laid off and wondering what counts to Ding as "high-quality". </p>

            <p>A former boss of Amazon Games has detailed why the company couldn't compete with Valve's Steam platform for PC sales.</p>
<p>Ethan Evans was VP of Prime Gaming at Amazon until September 2020, and in a recent post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ethanevansvp_as-vp-of-prime-gaming-at-amazon-we-failed-activity-7295834479036702720-cDmX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAVvKbEB4BSwtr1FhSqcqk72HAWxOtwQlK0">LinkedIn</a> he detailed how Amazon "failed multiple times to disrupt the game platform Steam".</p>
<p>"We were at least 250 times bigger, and we tried everything," he wrote. "But ultimately, Goliath lost."</p>

<p>Amazon tried three times to enter the "online-game-store market", said Evans. The first was by acquiring the small PC games store Reflexive Entertainment and trying to scale it, but this "went nowhere".</p>
<p>The second, after Amazon bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, was to create its own PC games store and utilise the Twitch audience for sales. "Our assumption was that gamers would naturally buy from us because they were already using Twitch," said Evans. "Wrong."</p>
<p>The third effort from Amazon was its Luna streaming service, which competed with Google's own ill-fated Stadia - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stadia-is-shutting-down-in-january">shut down in January 2023</a>. Luna remains live, but Evans admitted neither Amazon nor Google's efforts "gained significant traction". "The whole time, Steam dominated despite being a relatively small company (compared to Amazon and Google)," he said.</p>
<p>So what went wrong? "The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam," said Evans. "It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well."</p>
<p>He continued: "At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.</p>
<p>"We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so. And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either.</p>
<p>"Just because you are big enough to build something doesn't mean people will use it."</p>
<p>Amazon still has its Prime Gaming subscription, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-gets-another-20-games-in-february-including-one-for-xbox">this month includes BioShock 2 Remastered and Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>And after publishing multiple MMORPGs, Amazon Games' next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/king-of-meat-is-a-chaotic-new-amazon-published-game-from-ex-lionhead-and-media-molecule-developers">King of Meat from ex-Lionhead and Media Molecule developers</a>.</p>
<p>Steam, meanwhile, has just seen its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-lands-series-second-biggest-start-on-steam">concurrent player numbers peak once again</a> this month, hitting 39.92 million online users.</p>
<p>Steam's other big competitor, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-has-more-pc-players-than-ever-295-million-in-fact">Epic Games Store, also now has more players than ever</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/moroi-could-be-one-of-the-weirdest-games-of-2025-and-it%E2%80%99s-all-the-better-for-it.1116966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/moroi-demo-preview-one-of-the-weirdest-games-of-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Moroi grabbed my attention when it was announced late in 2024 with its grimdark aesthetic and grotesque characters. Taking its name from a Romanian folk monster (apparently some kind of vampire) the top-down hack and slash action game looked like a spiritual successor to the excellent Van Helsing series. Having now got my grubby hands on a preview demo – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2518410/Moroi/">available now via Steam Next Fest</a> – and spent some time in a Q&amp;A with the developer, I am pleased to report that it is actually so much more than I expected.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moroi | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PeXCOkKuZP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is a clear sense of mystery and deliberate confusion in the world of Moroi. You begin by waking up in a prison cell with no memory of who you are and how you got there. The door to your cell is open and you begin to explore your strange surroundings. During the roughly 30 minutes of the demo I encountered a cast of bizarre characters, some fun combat, and a series of enjoyable – if simple – puzzles.</p>


<p>The graphical style that first caught my attention looks great in the demo build. While the bulk of the demo takes place in a dark prison environment there is a good level of detail and excellent lighting to add to the atmosphere. The star of the show, though, is clearly the character designs. Your own player character looks like a mannequin of sorts (in a manner that begins to be revealed as the game progresses) but NPCs look uncannily similar to the nightmarish cenobites of Clive Barker’s Hellraiser series.</p>


<p>Brief conversations with early NPCs do little to unravel the mysterious nature of your plight, but odd characters such as a self-aware furnace are as quirky as they are unsettling. Perhaps the most important character in the early stages is a talking duck that gives you his teeth to upgrade your weapon and enable you to break through barriers. The fact that such a sentence rolls off in this preview is a testament to how strange the world of Moroi really is.</p>
<p>Puzzles here are mostly generally simple find the correct object affairs, but there are a couple which require you to read the various lore messages you find along the way. Combat is either melee or ranged with the chaingun you find – the latter showing the way that the developer is clearly aiming for fun rather than any kind of realism. The chaingun has no ammo counter but is on a cooldown so there is some strategy involved in either dodging around enemies or switching between weapons during fights. The playthrough I watched during the Q&amp;A presentation made the combat look particularly challenging, but on Normal it feels pitched quite well. Attacking enemies builds up a finisher meter that enables a one hit kill which also heals you so there is a good sense of rhythm to the combat.</p>

<p>About 20 minutes into the demo, your player character is seemingly killed and there is a drastic change in tone and scenery. The tonal whiplash from this moment is my abiding memory of my time with Moroi. It is clearly a game that isn’t afraid to take you in some weird and unexpected directions, reminding me in part of recent classics like Indika or the Zeno Clash series.</p>
<p>If the rest of the game comes close to the strangeness of this 30 minute demo then Moroi should be guaranteed to become a cult classic. With a release date of early 2025 we shouldn’t have too long to wait before checking out the full game.</p>

			<p>Unreal Engine 5 adds complexity in some interesting ways that allow the development of games that may not have been possible before but at a cost on PC that will likely only get mitigated in the future by brute forcing better performance.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>'s Broke Silicon podcast, Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk discussed Unreal Engine 5 at length, highlighting the many issues developers face with the engine but also how it adds complexity in ways that is allowing them to do things that maybe couldn't be done before, but with a base cost that was, at launch, two GPU generations behind in terms of performance, a really unsurprising statement considering we have seen, time and time again, how Unreal Engine 5-powered games don't seem to run well even on top-end hardware. On consoles, things are quite different, according to the developer, as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S have dedicated hardware, such as their IO controllers, that handle data compression and decompression. On PC, on the other hand, there are a lot of data bottlenecks that prevent the process from being smooth, and, as of now, it seems like performance will only get better with the faster interface and CPUs, essentially brute forcing through the issues, getting to the point where latency will be so low and the interface speed so fast that things will get better at least until the next generation of consoles. As such, it may be until the RTX 6000 series when Unreal Engine 5 will run as it should on PC.</p>

<p>Unreal Engine 5 creator Epic is well aware of the performance issues in games powered by their engine and has recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-shader-compilation-systems-prevent-stuttering-not-work-properly/"> outlined</a> what the engine features to mitigate the issues and what they are currently working on to further improve the situation. Some of these systems, however, don't seem to be working properly out-of-the-box, and require developer intervention, so there's definitely more work to be done until shader compilation and other performance issues become a thing of the past in UE5 games.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.5. You can learn more about some of the features it introduces, including the Nanite of lights, MegaLights, by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-megalights-performance-improvements/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Bossa Games, the London-based company behind indie hits <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/surgeon-simulator">Surgeon Simulator</a> and I Am Bread, has announced a second wave of job losses - just a year after it previously shed a third of its staff.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/">statement posted to LinkedIn</a>, company co-founder Henrique Olifers said Bossa had been forced to make "the painful decision to scale back" its size once more.
</p>
<p>
The company will now focus all its efforts on getting its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-todays-humble-games-showcase">open-world airship adventure Lost Skies</a> out the door, before "reshap[ing] into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible".
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how many staff have been impacted by these latest layoffs, though Olifers wrote that the changes meant the studio would be "saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues, truly some of the best people in the industry, who have been part of our journey for a long time".
</p>
<p>
"We wish we had found a way of navigating this turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back or teams," Olifers continued, "but unfortunately we've failed in this endeavour."
</p>
<p>
The co-CEO blamed the action on a "fundamental transformation of the games industry, a reshape of how games are made and by what kinds of teams", though did not elaborate further how Bossa had been affected in particular.
</p>
<p>
At the start of 2024, Bossa was thought to employ around 60 people, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-studios-lets-go-a-third-of-its-staff">layoffs saw 19 jobs lost which Olifers blamed on a "perfect storm of events"</a> at the time: higher development costs, funding delays, and a tougher market for indie games.
</p>
<p>
It's been four years since Bossa last shipped a game - I Am Fish. It remains best known for Surgeon Simulator, which it launched in 2013 and followed up with various other versions for smartphones, Switch and VR.
</p>
<p>
Bossa had previously received funding from NetEase, the Chinese giant that is currently pulling back from many of its gaming studio investments across the globe. 
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tinybuild-acquires-bossa-studios-ips-for-3m">Bossa sold the rights to I Am Bread and Surgeon Simulator</a> to US indie publisher TinyBuild, generating a reported $3m.

			<p>The official PC system requirements for Lost Soul Aside have been revealed, confirming the system configurations that can run the game at different quality settings and with ray tracing.</p>
<p>The system requirements for running the game without ray tracing look reasonable enough for a game launching this year, as players will need either an Intel i7-11700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU and either an RTX 3070 or RX 6800 XT to run the game at the high preset, although with an unknown target resolution and framerate. The requirements unsurprisingly become more demanding with ray tracing, as an RTX 5070 Ti GPU will be required for the Ultra Ray Tracing preset.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-gameplay-is-being-leaked-online-as-early-copies-are-already-in-players-hands.1116930/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-leaked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Early physical copies of Assassin’s Creed Shadows have already found their way in players hands, resulting in early gameplay of the game being streamed and uploaded online.</p>



<p>According to X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/DannyStevens__/with_replies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@DannyStevens__</a>, copies of the game are obtainable via Facebook Marketplace. Insider Gaming were unable to find any copies on Facebook’s UK marketplace, Stevens’ claims were backed up with pictures of the games case, the install screen, and several gameplay photos. Those images have since been deleted.</p>



<p>After searching for the game online further, it seems that Ubisoft is aware of the situation and is currently DMCA striking a lot of the content posted online. Inevitably though, some gameplay and images will fall through the cracks, so be aware if you’re sensitive of spoilers.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-assassins-creed-shadows-free-download-bonus-weapon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – How to Get Assassin’s Creed Shadows Free Download Bonus Weapon</a></strong></p>



<p>It’s unclear on why copies of the game have started to be sold at such as early stage, as typically, physical copies begin leaked around 2-3 days before launch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows was delayed twice</a>, including a recent delay that moved the game from its February 14 release to March 20, so it’s possible that the game had already been printed on masse.</p>



<p>It was said that the second delay was needed to give the game “additional weeks” to implement changes based on feedback received from players during testing.</p>



<p>Marc-Alexis Côté said, “since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us. “Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we’ve already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is scheduled to release on March 20, 2025 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. Ubisoft sources tell Insider Gaming that the company is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confident on its new release date</a>.</p>

Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches officially on March 20, 2025.

Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-insists-assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-are-tracking-solidly-in-line-with-odyssey">Ubisoft insisted that Assassin's Creed Shadows had a strong number of preorders</a> despite its troubled development and promotional period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The struggling publisher said in its latest financial report that "preorders for the game are tracking solidly, in line with those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the second most successful entry of the franchise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained this confidence. "Early previews have been positive, praising its narrative and immersive experience, with both characters playing critical roles in the game’s storyline, as well as the quality and complementarity of the gameplay provided by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-players-wont-be-missing-out-if-they-largely-ignore-one-protagonist"><u>the dual protagonist approach</u></a>,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I want to commend the incredible talent and dedication of the entire Assassin’s Creed’s team, who is working tirelessly to ensure that Shadows delivers on the promise of what is the franchise’s most ambitious entry yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows was originally planned for November before Ubisoft bumped it back to February 14.

            <p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-more-netease-studios-like-quantic-and-grasshopper-at-risk-as-firm-reportedly-seeks-buyers">reports circulated over the weekend that NetEase is allegedly pulling back on its international game investments</a> by "actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios", NetEase-owned Rebel Wolves has reached out to assuage fears, reiterating that NetEase is a minority shareholder.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to LinkedIn, Rebel Wolves' chief publishing officer and co-owner, Tomasz Tinc said he was aware of the "rumoured situation" but said that Rebel Wolves' ownership largely rested in the hands of studio employees.</p>
<p>The company is currently at work on The Blood of Dawnwalker, a project headed up by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, who is also a studio co-owner.</p>

<p>"First and foremost, thank you for all the warm messages and wishes. The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues," Tinc wrote.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of Rebel Wolves' ownership rests in the hands of Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and other studio co-owners, all of whom are employed by Rebel Wolves. NetEase is Rebel Wolves' minority shareholder."</p>
<p>Tinc also confirmed that production of he Blood of Dawnwalker is "fully funded", and it was working alongside the studio's partners and publisher Bandai Namco to "bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to life".</p>
<p>NetEase's backtrack arguably commenced at the end of last year when it cut jobs and/or "paused" productions at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Sword</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese megacorp <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is 2K’s newest golf sequel, and its Xbox Game Pass and status is up in the air—like a well-struck golf shot. That’s why we’re here today to let you know if you need to pay your green fee, or if this one’s on the house.</p>



<p>The golf game market is hotter than it’s ever been. EA Sports PGA Tour is the up-and-coming Pro making a big impression, but the PGA Tour 2K series is the evergreen veteran of the links. Take-Two’s newest golf title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a>—carrying on the company’s trend of biannual releases.</p>



<p>2K’s franchise has a healthy following of fans—myself included—but let’s see if the audience can grow thanks to the Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pga-tour-2k25-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play PGA Tour 2K25 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A warm welcome indeed. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PGA Tour 2K25 isn’t available as a day-one release on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</strong></p>



<p>Consider <a href="https://pgatour.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PGA Tour 2K25</a> a private membership. Not a single PGA Tour 2K25 trailer or prerelease gameplay video has made any mention of the sports title coming to Game Pass. It’s hardly a shock though. Few (if any) sports titles come to Game Pass on day one. I also can’t recall any 2K sports title doing this either.</p>



<p>You must go through each <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pga-tour-2k25-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25 Edition</a> and agonize over which one you want. Each Edition is TaylorMade for a different type of PGA Tour 2K fan. You must consider if you want the base game, extra content on top, or everything and more!</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pga-tour-2k25-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will PGA Tour 2K25 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Historical data suggests PGA Tour 2K25 isn’t coming to Xbox Game Pass later on.</strong></p>



<p>A quick browse of recent history shows neither PGA Tour 2K23 or 2K21 have come to Game Pass. I’m not sure if it has anything to do with it, but you <em>can </em>play EA Sports Tour on Game Pass. There might be some exclusivity rights there, maybe?</p>



<p>Either way, if you’re hoping to play PGA Tour 2K25 through Xbox Game Pass, my advice would be to not sit around in the grandstand and wait for Game Pass to take the first shot.</p>



<hr>



<p>What will you do? Are you prepared to dive into your pocket to try out the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-courses-in-pga-tour-2k25-dlc-courses-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">courses</a> and features? Or will you wait for a sale and bide your time for PGA Tour 2K25?</p>



<p>We also have the Xbox Game Pass status of quite a few other titles for you to check out: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-split-fiction-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-or-ea-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-sniper-elite-resistance-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-coming-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>.</p>

            <p>
Obsidian's fun and colourful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> doesn't sound like a one-and-done effort by the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Avowed arrived last week to a positive reception, and now a Bloomberg interview with the game's director Carrie Patel includes the suggestion we'll see more of the franchise from Obsidian.
</p>
<p>
Asked whether Patel's next project would be something new, the director said that work on more Avowed content - be that for this game, or sequels - was more likely.

<p>
"Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it," Patel said.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian has invested more than six years in Avowed, and longer in its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe. Development on the project began in 2018, two years prior to the company's acquisition by Microsoft. 
</p>
<p>
Initially planned as a multiplayer version of Skyrim with a massive open world, Obsidian ditched the game's online component relatively early on. After Patel came on board to lead the game in 2021, the decision was then made to also switch the game's map from open world to multiple large open zones. The game also ended up leaning further into the Pillars of Eternity universe's lore than initially planned, too.
</p>
<p>
"With any game you think, 'OK, we can't climb every mountain  - which ones are really worth the effort for us?'" Patel said. "We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with open zones, and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player's going from one environment to the next."
</p>
<p>
"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>. "It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."
</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-studio-plans-to-make-its-100th-birthday-by-staying-lean-and-invested">Obsidian said it was planning to still be open for its 100th anniversary</a> - in another 78 years - by staying "lean and invested".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-gets-a-countdown-to-4th-march-reveal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 looks like it’s on the way with an annoucnement on the 4th of March. It’s a reveal date that will only make sense to Americans and their back-to-front way of writing dates, the announcement coming on “03.04.25”, the countdown set to conclude at 3PM GMT / 10AM ET / 7AM PT.</p>
<p>The first teaser came from the appropriately named new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> map, Grind – reported by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577">Charlie Intel</a>. the map features a skatepark as its main area, but also has a skating themed shop, which plays host to a TV screen that proudly proclaims the 03.04.25 date with a THPS style logo.</p>


<p>That imagery has been replicated on the THPS website, which has the date and countdown to an announcement.</p>
<p>This all comes off the back of long-running reports and rumours surrounding a follow up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-thps-ps4-xbox-pc/">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2</a> remake. Following that game’s 2020 release, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/06/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-plans-shelved-after-blizzard-entertainment-absorbed-vicarious-visions-says-tony-hawk">Tony Hawk said</a> that a follow up was planned, but shelved after Vicarious Visions was absorbed into Blizzard Entertainment, rebranded as Blizzard Albany and set to work on the Diablo series.</p>
<p>Rumours about the project were revived recently when skater Tyshawn Jones<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1314"> said in a radio interview</a> that he is set to be in an upcoming <em>Tony Hawk</em> game remaster.</p>
<p>It’s not clear right now who is working on Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4. There’s obviously nothing stopping Blizzard Albany working on this as they still exist within the overarching Activision Blizzard structure, and depending on workloads since the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/">Diablo IV</a> in 2023, and surrounding the Vessels of Hatred DLC last year.</p>

<p>Looking back at THPS 1+2, we awarded the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-thps-ps4-xbox-pc/">a stellar 10/10</a>, saying “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+ 2 is a labour of love and an ode to the series’ glory days. Every inch of the game has been perfectly restored and updated for modern consoles and it’s an absolute delight to play from start to finish. This is a must-buy for skateboarders, gamers and everyone else in between.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-essential-oil-diffusing-fragrance-mouse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>"The cat is the fragrance, Nic," Ollie once told me when I asked the RPS Slack channel for alternatives to my essential oil diffuser, which I can no longer use for fear of my cat getting vanilla scurvy or lavender botulism or whatever else. I contemplated those words last night when she pounced into bed with me, curled up, and serenaded me to slumber with a briney fart. I remembered them again this morning when I learned of the <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-fragrance-mouse-release/">ASUS Fragrance Mouse</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valve-bans-games-that-rely-on-in-game-ads-from-steam-so-no-watch-this-to-continue-playing-stuff-will-be-making-its-way-to-our-pcs/">Percy Gamer</a>.)</p>
<p>The mouse is ergonomic, wireless, and comes in plain or pink ("Iridescent White or Rose Clay"). Its innards house a refillable vial for scent oils. It features "delicate underglow lighting," a sell  that would be easier to make fun of if most gaming hardware wasn't illuminated by a choice of either energy drink piss green or antiseptic gel blue.</p>

<p>Would I use this if I hadn't a cat? Silly question. I would immediately source a cat. Ah, but what if she was theoretically immune to essential oils and also not sick of being used in dangerous hypotheticals as I assume all cats are by now?</p>
<p>A tendency toward anxious agoraphobia has made me someone who spends a lot time cultivating vibes. I would venture that I own more fairy lights, houseplants, IDM playlists and tiny lamps shaped like mushrooms than most people who don't also use Instagram. I owned both a scent diffuser and an apocalypse bunker's worth of Nag Champa before my cat's arrival meant I had to stop using them. I am, on paper, the exact genre of mark that should fall for this.</p>
<p>And yet, I cannot help but view it as an admission of defeat. As PC Gamer deftly note, the fragrance mouse is "the first development in mouse I've seen in some time that wasn't just 'more button". Its very existence feels like a thwarted admission that there are no new ideas left in the world (of mice) and thus ASUS have resorted to just shoving in things that already exist and, I must assume, are much more suited for the task when they don't also have to fight for space with mouse brains.</p>
<p>Why, if we're just doing that, I bet I could source several better ideas from the morass of Monday morning ennui that is the RPS Slack in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>"A mouse encased in a magic ball that somehow attaches itself firmly to any surface, including your own leg, so that you can wield it dexterously enough to play an FPS without needing a desk," says Edwin.</p>
<p>"A mouse with a mouse's tail; it's fairly unobtrusive most of the time but it sometimes displays excitement or affection, wrapping itself around your wrist or wagging like a dog's when you knock someone in Apex," suggests Ollie.</p>
<p>"A vertical mouse for work that changes into a normal mouse when you want to play a precise FPS. A Transformer mouse," adds Brendy.</p><p>

"A mouse with a pencil sharpener in it. Just for the irony", says James.

</p><p>Me? Idk. A…toaster? Little tiny toaster? Makes you little tiny bits of toast that you can nibble on to make you feel better about burning your fingers on your stupid toaster mouse?</p>
<p>I do not hate the fragrance mouse. Benign bewilderment is an entertaining emotion. However, my desk only has room for one scent.</p>
