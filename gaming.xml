<p>With a free demo to come</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Wishfully Studios and Thunderful's cinematic puzzle/platforming sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf</a>, has looked more stunning with every gameplay reveal. Its latest trailer is no exception, of course, but this one comes with a bonus bit of info: a release date.</p>
<p>Yes, it has been revealed that Children of the Leaf will leap onto Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>5th March 2026</strong> — that's just one month away! What's more, the developer has confirmed that a free demo is in the pipeline too, arriving on PC, PlayStation and Xbox on 11th Feb, and on Switch and Switch 2 at a "later date".</p>
<p>The release date trailer showcases even more puzzle platforming in action, with those visuals once again being the star of the show. Previous gameplay showcases have highlighted Lana's cute companion, Mui, and its transforming abilities, and we get to see a little more here, with the little guy taking on the form of a fish and a flying insect, piloting robots, and channelling electrical currents — way to go, Mui!</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's setup and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As greed and power divide the tribes of their home planet, Lana and her loyal companion Mui must stand together against the forces reshaping their world - struggling not just for survival, but for the very soul of their home. Embark on an unforgettable cinematic puzzle journey across Novo, where ancient mysteries and new threats will test your wits, challenge Lana’s unbreakable bond with Mui, and guide her toward her destiny.<br>
Prepare to explore an expanded story, tackle challenging new puzzles, and master evolved companion mechanics - all brought to life by breathtaking hand-painted environments and a sweeping orchestral soundtrack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be excited to see what this one holds when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 next month — hopefully we don't have to wait too long for the demo, either. We had a great time with its predecessor back in 2024, calling it "a treat for the long-suffering cinematic platforming fan" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">our review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Sales in Japan are “Better-Than-Projected,” and It’s Hurting the Switch 2’s Profitability]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-profitability-hurt-by-better-than-projected-switch-2-japan-sales/</link>
            <guid>1428196</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It might be difficult to imagine that increased sales of <strong>Nintendo's</strong> latest hybrid console, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, in any region, let alone its home base of Japan, would actually hurt the console's profitability. But that's exactly what's happening, according to Nintendo president <strong>Shuntaro Furukawa</strong>. In the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf">official translation of its Q&amp;A section</a> from its third-quarter financial report, Furukawa confirmed that the "<em>better-than-projected</em>" sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 in Japan<strong> will negatively impact the Switch 2's operating and gross profit</strong>.</p>



<p>How is that the case? Because the parts Nintendo uses to manufacture the Nintendo Switch 2 are purchased in U.S. dollars. So when players in Japan purchase a Switch 2 with Japanese Yen, a currency that is currently in a downward trend, Nintendo still ends up losing money.</p>



<p>During the Q&amp;A section, an investor asked Furukawa, "<em>Considering that most procurement costs are in U.S. dollars, do I understand correctly that profitability is declining due to the continuing depreciation of the Yen?</em>" They also asked if Furukawa could explain why Switch 2 sales in Japan are doing as well as they are, and the answer, according to Furukawa, lies with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-air-riders/">Kirby Air Riders</a></strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Hardware-related procurement purchases are primarily made in U.S. dollars, so given the current exchange rate environment, the better-than-projected hardware sales in Japan will have a <strong>downward effect on gross profit and operating profit</strong></em>," Furukawa responded. </p>



<p>"<em>The backdrop of hardware sales in Japan trending better than our expectations was the release of Pokémon Legends Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Kirby Air Riders during the holiday season, building on the initial momentum of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware</em>. <em>We believe that users in Japan <strong>saw these titles as an opportunity to transition to Nintendo Switch 2</strong> at a relatively higher rate compared to Nintendo Switch owners outside of Japan.</em>"</p>



<p>This interesting tidbit appeared amidst Furukawa having to answer a flurry of questions about the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">memory shortage</a></strong> that is currently impacting the entire tech industry, and how Nintendo is planning to accommodate it. It's no surprise that investors only really wanted to talk about the memory shortage, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-loses-14-billion-in-value-as-memory-shortage-fears-rise/">especially after <strong>Nintendo lost $14 billion</strong> in share value towards the end of last year</a>, directly due to memory shortage fears. </p>



<p>For now, Furukawa doesn't want to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-president-doesnt-want-to-be-overly-influenced-by-rising-ram-costs-nintendo-switch-2-price-to-remain-stable-for-now/">"<em><strong>overly influenced</strong>" </em></a>by something that could turn out to be a short-term trend, though with recent reports that <a href="https://wccftech.com/memory-suppliers-are-taking-zero-chances-on-losing-in-a-dram-contract/">memory suppliers are taking "<em><strong>zero</strong>" </em>chances of being shortchanged</a>, Furukawa and Nintendo may end up having to increase the price of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For now, that's only one possible outcome, not an inevitability. In the meantime, the Switch 2 is still selling like gangbusters outside of Japan as well, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-17-million-first-switch-best-selling-console/">as the console sold <strong>17.37 million units</strong> in 2025</a>.</p>

<p>Several individuals, including influencer Cyberboi, a number of journalists, and some Build a Rocket Boy employees, will apparently be "served in person, criminal complaints, shortly", with those complaints alleging "espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference".</p><p>Insider Gaming contacted Ritual Network for comment, and the platform told the publication that it is "not involved in the matter". It goes on to say that it's "not aware of any legitimate legal action" brought by Build a Rocket Boy, and that any suggestion it's connected to the aforementioned sabotage is "incorrect".</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy, however, insists that it's on the right track; in a statement, it told Insider Gaming that it has "evidence that there has been a co-ordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage" both the studio and the game, and that it's "taking steps" to address the issue.</p><p>In case you need a reminder, <em>MindsEye </em>launched last year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="090d2e26-517c-4b1d-81d8-0c4c40228804" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">pretty negative reception across the board</a>, seemingly leading to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cc20a09e-a602-4466-a53f-4fb3ccf68d58" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">layoffs at Build a Rocket Boy shortly after the game's launch</a>, as well as publisher IO Interactive seemingly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">pulling back from third-party publishing</a>.</p>

<p>According to Mazin, he's a big fan of Larian's latest entry into the iconic CRPG series; he says he's put "nearly 1000 hours" into the game, and that he's a "devoted fan" not only of <em>Baldur's Gate </em>but of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>in general.</p><p>Although the show will be based on <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, Deadline says it won't draw from the first two games in the series too much, since they're not "official source material", according to the publication.</p><p>With that said, there will be "some commonalities across those games" that also refer to general <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>lore, and those might come into Mazin's new <em>Baldur's Gate </em>show.</p><p>It's worth noting that this is a distinct entity from the upcoming <em>Forgotten Realms </em>TV show, which is being made for Netflix. It's unlikely, therefore, that the two will cross over in any meaningful way, at least not to begin with.</p>
<p><em>Baldur's Gate </em>is just one of the video game franchises getting itself a TV adaptation.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>, the cat breeding roguelike battler from Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, finally saunters out of its litter box with a cheeky smirk next week. It's been a long time coming, but the developers have opted to make players wait for a full release, rather than going the early access route plenty of games opt for nowadays - the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> spring to mind. As a result, McMillen and Glaiel see the way they've gone as no longer being the norm, and have shed more light on their reasons for not picking early access.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are launching a complete game. That is a weird thing now," Glaiel told <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/mewgenics-interview-launch/">The Escapist</a>. "I’m really not a fan of Early Access," McMillen added. "I feel like it originated from people needing money fast. I’m not shitting on people who do early access, but it feels strange to change the experience after people have already finished it."</p>
<p>Glaiel seconded that view, reasoning that: "There’s a handful of situations where it makes sense, like multiplayer stuff. Other than that, I feel like almost anything else would be better." The due do certainly plan to listen to hands-on player feedback in terms of shaping where Mewgenics goes in future, but in the context of gauging what they might add to it via DLC, rather than shaping the base game.</p>
<p>One aspect that's made Mewgenics' route to release a bit unique is that, while waiting until the game's done to let folks try it fir themselves, McMillen has spent hours <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-says-the-big-important-bits-of-mewgenics-are-done-shows-off-50-minutes-of-weird-cat-roguelikery">streaming his own runs through it</a>, something he points to as having been key in keeping up anticipation as the last few years have ticked by. "If we had never shown gameplay, people would be more frustrated that they still can’t play it," he said. "Instead, they are getting spoon-fed, but bit by bit. We have fans who watch and think about what choices they would make, so they’re almost playing the game in their heads. They are desperate for another video – they just want another run."</p><p>In my estimation, Mewgenics' quirky premise and the reputations its developers have cultivated through years of putting together beloved hits like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End Is Nigh have likely put them in a more ideal position than other studios might be to take the approach of making sure Mewgenics is cooked to near perfection before putting it out. They've certainly done a great job over the past couple of years of not being afraid to offer glimpses of their creation on a regular basis, helping abate any fears folks might have about the amount of time it's spent in development.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this Escapist interview, Glaiel admits that the pair "probably could have released the full game in 2021, roughly, and it would have been okay". Instead, they decided their preferred approach was to give themselves space to refine the thing, so it'd be as ready as they wanted for the moggy adventures that await when it comes out on February 10th.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-nintendo-ram-memory-ai-2000666430</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The question on every video game investor and analyst’s lips during the recent Nintendo earnings Q&amp;A was whether the Mario maker will have to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-earnings-switch-2-sales-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-2000665326">raise the price of the Switch 2</a> due to spiking memory prices amid <a href="https://kotaku.com/dell-ces-ai-hardware-llm-gpu-2000657729">AI-fueled shortages</a>. RAM is through the roof and graphics cards are getting delayed, but Nintendo is keeping a cool head through the market turmoil.</p> <p>“We are working to secure stable supplies of memory components by holding discussions from a long-term perspective with our business partners,” president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf">said this week</a>. “As a result, the recent rise in memory prices did not have a significant impact on hardware profitability in the third quarter. In addition, we do not expect any significant impact in the fourth quarter.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “However, if this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability. If the situation deteriorates significantly, we will carefully assess market trends and respond.” As a result, Nintendo confirmed that no decision on raising the price of the $450 Switch 2 has been made yet, but if and when that time comes, it will decide based on things like the “platform’s installed base, sales trends, and the market environment.”</p> <p>Not satisfied with that ambiguity and uncertainty, Q&amp;A members kept grilling Furukawa for more specifics. The company admitted that the recent spike in component prices “exceeds our expectations” but said that it’s been stockpiling inventory and arranging long-term deals to absorb the shocks. Even if prices continue to rise into the summer, Nintendo can put off any painful pricing changes for a bit longer. But not indefinitely.</p>

 <h2>Selling Switch 2 at a profit vs. growing the install base</h2> <p>If push comes to shove, will Nintendo maximize profitability or growing the hardware’s install base? “It is difficult to predict the changes in the external environment that are currently taking place, but I think it is not an appropriate approach to be excessively influenced by short-term trends,” Furukawa said. “The second and third years for Nintendo Switch 2 are very important, and if we can expand the hardware installed base, we can use that as a basis to greatly expand software sales.”</p>

 <p>It certainly sounds like Nintendo is going to do everything in its power to avoid making the Switch 2&nbsp;$500 by this time next year. At the same time, if sales momentum picks up even more after the announcement of a new 3D <em>Mario</em>, <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, or the long-awaited Gen 10 <em>Pokémon</em> games, well, maybe it’ll be in a position to do whatever it wants. Nintendo isn’t rushing to embrace one strategy or another just yet.</p> <p>Who knows what will happen to t<a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">he AI bubble</a> in 12 months, what new tariffs will hit consumers in the U.S., or if the company’s most lucrative sales market will be plunged into an unexpected recession? Predicting any of those things is as much a fool’s errand as trying to guess <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-country-dixie-free-update-switch-2-2000661812">what Nintendo’s next move is these days</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-date-leaks-gameplay/</link>
            <guid>1428172</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="114633">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> (GTA 6) is Rockstar Games’ next mainline GTA release and easily one of the most anticipated video games in years. Rockstar itself has stayed mostly quiet since confirming the game is in development, but reporting, leaks, and publisher comments have steadily filled in the gaps around GTA 6’s setting, release window, and gameplay direction.</p>



<p>This hub is where Insider Gaming keeps everything together—what’s confirmed, what’s been reported, what’s changed, and what still isn’t clear—and it’s updated as new information comes in.</p>







<h2 id="h-latest-gta-6-update">Latest GTA 6 Update </h2>



<p><strong>Latest Update (February 6, 2026)</strong></p>



<p>While details surrounding the game’s features have yet to be officially announced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-marketing-to-start-this-summer-will-have-physical-version/" id="173882">it has been confirmed</a> that the game’s marketing will begin sometime this summer. It was also confirmed that Rockstar is planning to release a physical version of the game. </p>



<p>Also, with generative AI being a heavy talking point in the industry right now, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick said in a recent interview that GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be using GenAI</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-gta-6-stands-right-now">Where GTA 6 Stands Right Now</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Developer: </strong>Rockstar Games</li>



<li><strong>Publisher: </strong>Rockstar Games</li>



<li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</li>



<li><strong>Status: </strong>In Development</li>
</ul>



<p>Rockstar officially announced GTA 6 in December 2023, with the game’s first trailer amassing over 270 million views on the official Rockstar Games YouTube Channel. Beyond that, however, news has been limited. Fans have received one other trailer as well as some information about the game’s location—Leonida (Florida)—and main characters Jason Duval and the franchise’s first female protagonist Lucia Caminos.</p>



<hr>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-release-date-what-we-know">GTA 6 Release Date: What We Know</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-s-confirmed">What’s Confirmed</h3>



<p>Rockstar’s latest release date for GTA 6 is November 19, 2026. That release date announcement came in November 2025, when it was revealed that GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was being delayed</a> from its May 26, 2026 release. This was the third announced release for the game after it was originally announced for a fall 2025 launch. That then turned into the May 2026 release that became November 2026.</p>



<h3>Will GTA 6 Be Delayed Again?</h3>



<p>Rockstar and Take-Two Interactive seem adamant on making sure GTA 6 launches on November 19. However, anything is possible with this franchise, and it won’t be released until the developers feel it’s ready. Should any news or rumors come out about the release date, Insider Gaming will have full details. </p>



<h3 id="h-will-gta-6-come-to-pc">Will GTA 6 Come To PC?</h3>



<p>GTA 6 has only been confirmed for a release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. While it won’t come to PC at first launch, it should be expected on the platform at a later date.  </p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-setting-and-map">GTA 6 Setting and Map</h2>



<p>For the first time in two decades, Grand Theft Auto returns to Vice City in GTA 6. But it’s not just Vice City that players will explore. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-gta-6-location-confirmed-so-far-vice-city-included-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game is set in the state of Leonida</a> (Florida), with multiple locations to visit and learn about. </p>



<p>While Vice City is the main locale, there are five other key places in GTA 6. The settings for Grand Theft Auto 6 include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vice City</strong> – The main location based on Miami, Florida</li>



<li><strong>Leonida Keys</strong> – A tropical archipelago based on the Florida Keys</li>



<li><strong>Grassrivers </strong>– Known as the “untamable jewel”, it’s based on the Florida Everglades</li>



<li><strong>Port Gellhorn</strong> – An area filled with “cheap motels, empty strip malls and shuttered attractions”</li>



<li><strong>Ambrosia – </strong>A town in the middle of Leonida</li>



<li><strong>Mount Kalaga National Park </strong>– Located in the northern part of the state, the park features areas to explore, hunt, and fish.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-how-big-is-the-gta-6-map">How Big Is The GTA 6 Map?</h3>



<p>GTA 6 is set to feature the largest map in the history of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. It’s also expected to be an evolving map that will change overtime, though those reports are unconfirmed as of now. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-gameplay-details">GTA 6 Gameplay Details</h2>



<p>As of February 6, officially gameplay details have yet to be released. All that’s known is that, like past GTA games, it will be an open-world action-adventure game. More details will come as the marketing picks up this summer.</p>



<p>One thing that seems to be confirmed is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-support-will-seemingly-continue-after-gta-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online support</a> will continue after the game’s release. That makes sure that, at least for a little while, longtime players still have something to go to, especially on platforms where the game isn’t launching yet like PC. </p>



<hr>



<h2>Latest GTA 6 Leaks</h2>



<p>With any game as anticipated as the next Grand Theft Auto title, many will look for as much information as possible about the game. That can also lead to leaks making their way out of the studio.</p>



<p>For the most part, however, there hasn’t been much in that sense over the past year or so. Back in 2022 and 2023 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were plenty</a> of leaks from the game, but Rockstar had caught the party responsible. That lead to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hacker-sentenced-for-gta-6-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arion Kurtaj being sentenced</a> for the leaks.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-trailers">GTA 6 Trailers</h2>



<p>There have been two trailers released so far for Grand Theft Auto 6. You can check them both out below.</p>

<h2 id="h-gta-6-screenshots">GTA 6 Screenshots</h2>

            <guid>1428169</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren't a ton of games that I've happily put more than 100 hours into as quickly as I have with Mewgenics. This feline-flavored, turn-based, roguelike tactical RPG takes place on a 10x10 grid, with mostly traditional classes like Fighter, Mage, Hunter, Tank, and Necromancer, among others. What sets it apart, aside from the cutesy macabre art style that slathers its creative zones with blood and poop, is that so many of the skills and attributes that your team will end up with are randomized and for the most part out of your control. That all but ensures no two runs will play out the same way, forcing you to improvise and play the hand you're dealt. Combined with the absolute mountain of content here – so much that I'm still seeing entirely new enemies, skills, mutations, and loot pop up after more than 150 hours – it's been able to draw me back in time and time again by dangling the possibility of an absolutely wild team coming together and bulldozing through the boss who turned my last party into kibble. I still haven't seen the final ending after all that time (this game has several) but I can't imagine I'll be tired of it before I do.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewgenics is a game about cats, but it's not necessarily going to appeal to people who passionately love them because it's a dark comedy that treats them as meat to be put through a grinder. The name itself is a play on eugenics, a morally appalling practice of selective breeding that has historically led to things like forced sterilization to remove undesirable traits from the gene pool, so you know going in that it's going to be a little spicy. If you've played any of Edmund McMillen's previous work (here he's collaborating once again with Tyler Glaiel), such as the infamously difficult Super Meat Boy or the infinitely replayable Binding of Isaac, you'll have a sense of the type of humor to expect. It's delightfully gross and endlessly weird at every turn.</p><p>It's delightfully gross and endlessly weird at every turn.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even knowing that, as a long-time cat owner myself, I was perhaps a bit too conservative with just how unsympathetic and detached you're expected to be. I probably took longer than I should've to unlock crucial upgrades for my house because doing so requires shipping dozens of cats off to live with a set of goofy weirdo NPCs, never to be seen again. One of the most important and flamboyant, Tink, will only take newborn kittens, and in exchange he'll give you tools that provide more information on how to breed more kittens – and he needs a lot, so you have to get accustomed to parting with them right away. Other characters want older cats, mutated cats, injured cats, or cats who've been on runs to specific places in order to improve stores or add new rooms to your house, among other things. Traditionally an RPG like this is about nurturing your characters and developing them until they become more powerful, but Mewgenics requires a different way of thinking: cats with low or unremarkable stats are lost causes who will weigh your squad down, so you're best off spending them like currency and keeping only the picks of various litters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Selectively breeding your cats takes place in the fairly simple house screen, a 2D side view where your cats chaotically mill around while you arrange furniture pieces that you find as loot or buy from a shop, inventory Tetris-style. The goal here is to improve stats like Stimulation and Comfort in order to get your cats in the mood to produce high-quality offspring and improve the chances they'll come out with favorable mutations. Those can be things like a messed-up tail that makes their basic attacks inflict burning, or fur that gives them more health regen when they're wet, or <em>leech eyes</em>, among tons and tons of others that are all represented visually on your increasingly weird-looking cats. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(You also have to clean up cat poop daily to keep your Health stat up by simply clicking on piles of various shapes and sizes. It's a bit of a chore after a while, especially when it gets crowded and you have to move cats out of the way to get to it – somehow, of all the furniture items I've gathered, I've never seen a single litter box.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When everything's arranged to your liking, you hit the End Day button and your cats will choose their own mates based on who's in a room with them, as well as their own genders, orientations (yup, there are gay and bisexual cats), and libedos. Then, out come the kittens after some bizarre cat humping and gooey birth animations that take obvious pleasure in being unsettling. (You can tone that down if you need it to be safe for work.) Optimizing this to produce the most powerful cats possible while also avoiding too much inbreeding (which, as Tink will tell you, isn't cool even though it has the word "breeding" in it because it causes birth defects) is tricky – but you can't really fail at this part because, even if you lose all your cats, you can just start again from scratch using the randomized strays who show up every day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real challenge is in finding the traits you want and ensuring they're passed down to new generations without too many side effects, and that definitely takes some planning. Mewgenics doesn't make it super easy, since there's no way to view all your cats in a list or spreadsheet – you just have to tediously cycle through them one at a time. You do unlock some tools to label them (and view their gnarly family trees), but when you have 40 cats roaming around it can be a pain to find one with the stats and abilities you're looking for when you go to put together a four-cat party (or fewer, if you want to live dangerously and level them up faster) for an adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building your team is another area where Mewgenics is unconventional and unpredictable because when you're picking cats and assigning their classes you can't see what all of their starting abilities will be. You'll get their base stats, mutations, and basic attacks, and sometimes they'll come with a spell or passive ability from one of their parents' classes, but it's not until you lock in their class that you'll learn what you're really working with and if they'll synergize well. Considering that each of the 12 classes has 75 abilities that <em>might </em>pop up (even after all this time I'm still seeing new ones), I get the same thrill from this reveal that I do from picking up my hand in poker or seeing the modifiers on a daily run in Slay the Spire or Monster Train 2: sometimes it's good news and I'm excited to see where it takes me, sometimes it's not and I brace myself for a thrashing and hope for a surprise turnaround if I can survive long enough to level them up and unlock some better skills.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's inconvenient at this stage is that while you can see what items you have available in your house inventory before you set out on an adventure, and after you lock in your classes you're taken to the equipping screen to deck your cats out with up to five pieces of potentially build-defining gear apiece, you cannot see those items when you're actually picking your classes and your starting abilities are first revealed. That might be fine if you have a fantastic memory, but for the rest of us it's frustrating to not be able to check if I have a good piece of gear to boost the stats of my summoned familiars at the exact moment I'm deciding if I should go with an animal-friend Druid or a robot-building Tinkerer, or if I should go with a Fighter or a Tank instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's tricky to keep track of what you have on hand because gear in Mewgenics doesn't last forever. You can expect to get three, maybe four runs out of something before it breaks, and that's assuming you don't wipe and lose everything you took with you and picked up along the way (except for your choice of one item from several that a helpful weirdo saves for you after a failed attempt). If weapons breaking in recent Zeldas rubbed you the wrong way, you probably won't enjoy that aspect of Mewgenics, but I actually do like the way it prevents me from relying too heavily on any one strategy. You can get something incredibly powerful and play with it more than once, without letting that item define every run you'll do from that point on.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking gear on only two or three runs may not sound like much, but that's more than the actual cats get. Another reason you can't count on the tricks you used in the previous run working just as well on the next, even if you use the same classes and gear, is that each cat only gets one adventure in which to level up and develop their skills. (You'll be able to use them in combat one or even two more times during special battles where major monsters attack your house.) That was tough to get my head around at first, because I'm accustomed to my RPG party members sticking around, at least until I get them killed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe this is why you're not allowed to name your own cats, and instead they come pre-named from a pool of (I estimate) a billion different silly possibilities: Mewgenics doesn't want us to get too attached. After a while I stopped paying much attention to their names except to chuckle at them, preferring to think of my squad members as their classes rather than individuals. Only the ones I ended up using as my primary breeding stock really stuck with me. (Man, talking about this game makes you say some weird stuff.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mewgenics - May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you head out to one of the three acts' adventure maps, which are all drawn in a jerkily animated, charmingly childlike style, you start with a single path that then branches off into two, each of which has two completely different stages packed with their own unique sets of enemies – so many you definitely won't see them all even after several runs. You'll definitely want to mouse over them and read their descriptions before diving into battle, because some of them have some extremely nasty tricks up their sleeves – including a few that can instantly and permanently kill a cat or infect it with a parasite that takes up a gear slot. The stakes are already pretty high given your cats are permanently injured every time they get downed, and can be outright killed if their body is destroyed by attacks or eaten by zombies, so you don't want to get surprised if you can help it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each zone is also stocked with multiple bosses that range from powered-up versions of your own classes to huge, nasty monsters with their own creative game-changing mechanics, and one that's basically just an evil Kirby. Yes, a few of them are annoying (I avoid going to Act 1's Boneyard unless a quest demands it because that boss is a total jerk), but on balance they're excellent battles that often make me think differently about how to manage my team's turn order and abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that stands out to me about the structure of Mewgenics' runs – aside from how they can take as long as two hours once you've unlocked all the zones (and some secret ones) – is that unlike most roguelikes, you rarely get to make decisions about the path you take between battles. You mainly get to choose between the default path and a harder one with better loot and one more battle to level up a cat in, and then very occasionally between two types of rewards (usually an equipable item or a piece of furniture for your house). That makes the between-battle encounters feel a little less interesting than in a lot of similar games, especially when the random encounters turn out to be basically a coin flip where you're picking between a red pill or a blue pill, or pushing a button vs pulling a lever without any indication of which will give you a bonus and which will give you a debuff. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are, of course, some more in-depth, multi-stage encounters where you're picking between a set of options in a choose-your-own-adventure story where your chances of success for each one are determined by a cat's stats. However, since the cat whose stats you're working with is chosen randomly, there are two layers of luck involved before you get a shot at a good outcome. It often feels completely random, but that's alright because so much of Mewgenics is doing the best you can with circumstances beyond your control.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During combat, there are so many different things in play that the interactions between cat mutations, passives, spells, gear, environmental modifiers, and enemies can get crazy complex, and figuring out exactly what happened – or predicting what will happen – can be like investigating a crime scene (often with just as much blood splatter). Why did that enemy pingpong between two trash bags, with each bounce doing one point of damage, until it died? How did one of my cats just straight-up eat a boss without me even telling it to move? Or, why did that giant Daddy Shark get to take another move and insta-kill my Cleric when I'd carefully placed him just outside what should've been his projected attack range? (That one stung.) All of those answers are in there somewhere if you know where to look and study the rules carefully. In one of those cases, it was related to – you guessed it – poop. The map does get chaotic when there are a lot of enemies and fire or plants or ice on the screen, but thankfully there's a tactical view that usually clears things up… mostly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, if you think something might work, it will. Water and ice spells and spells will put out fire, water will conduct electricity and zap everything standing in it, that sort of thing. However, sometimes its rules aren't super logical: a couple I've noticed is that robots are susceptible to bleeding, poison, and  parasite infestations, and the Butcher class's innate meat hook weapon can't actually hook meat unless you luck into the right upgrade for it. But again, most of the time it works like you'd expect it to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do love when a powerful team dynamic emerges as you earn new skills (your choice from a random selection of three) or raise one cat's stats after every battle. Recently I had a squad with a Monk who could toss out meat pickups that typically just heal the team, but when combined with a Butcher who can turn all of those meats into minion fly familiars and a Druid who can boost those flys' stats and turn them into killing machines, it became a way to raise an army in a single turn. On another run I had a Cleric whose health regeneration applied to the whole team and an item that let me continually boost that regen multiple times per turn, allowing my Necromancer to run wild with a high-damage attack that also drained half of his own health. There are countless examples like this, and while you won't win the lottery with a great combo every run, they happen more than often enough to make me excited about what might be next.</p><p>While you won't win the lottery with a great combo every run, they happen more than often enough to make me excited about what might be next.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's a little frustrating when I'm planning out my moves in a tough fight where every action matters is that there's no way to access a cat's full character sheet while you're in a battle, so you can't see their list of mutations or all of their equipment's full effects when you need that information the most. It's almost all represented visually on your cats, at least, but you have to remember, for example, what a cat having a second head growing on its butt means. When the rules are changing so dramatically from run to run, I would love to be able to reference all of them at any time.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Games Dan's Put 100+ Hours Into in the Past Decade</h3></p><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/DanStapleton/lists/games-dans-put-100-hours-into-in-the-past-decade" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">As if all of those variables weren't enough, Mewgenics throws yet another curveball at you when it sends you on one of its story or side quests. Those all revolve around a unique and powerful item that changes the rules in a big way and telling you to take it to a specific zone. One of the most memorable gives you a five-second time limit for every action – and if you don't make a move, the AI will take over and move for you. (I was glad I wasn't playing that one on my Steam Deck because the controls there are serviceable, but not nearly as quick as with a mouse and keyboard.) Another shook things up by giving my cats random selections of abilities from every class when they leveled up, creating powerful hybrids that are usually rare. There are tons of these available, though it's kind of a bummer that if you fail a side quest you don't get a second attempt at that unless it randomly comes up again once you've paid enough cats. The story itself is pretty silly and light – don't expect any Hades-style epics here – but good for a few yuks as you do the bidding of an incompetent mad scientist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another area where Mewgenics is truly exceptional is in its sound and music, which are fantastic in both big and subtle ways. It comes with a collection of original and hilarious songs that accompany each level and culminate in major boss battles that are designed to loop for as long as a battle takes, and there are multiple variations on each that include instrumental versions – your cats will even meow along to them sometimes. (My favorite is probably "Where's That Smell Coming From?") And those meows come from a vast selection of different randomly selected voices, including some celebrity cameos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best touches, though, is the crowd sounds. Mainly you'll hear this after beating a battle: there's cheering and clapping with varying enthusiasm based on how quickly you pulled off your win. That's fine, but the best part is the shocked gasps when one of your cats is killed in action. That gets me every time – and trust me, I've heard it a lot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Mewgenics has a fun and surprising approach to the practice of "save-scumming," where you quit out of a battle you've messed up and restart it with knowledge of what not to do. I won't spoil what happens, but there are consequences if you abuse it. Thankfully, you do get some flexibility in case of a power outage or spouse demanding you stop playing that game you've been playing for 150 hours and do the dishes, and it's kind of implicit that you have permission to save-scum once per run – and yes, I use it regularly.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">More than once, I've looked up from playing Mewgenics and realized that it's 1:30AM. It's that kind of tactical turn-based roguelike, where every new run with a new set of mutant feline adventurers is full of potential for something you didn't know could happen, even after dozens of hours of runs. Maybe you'll earn a new ability for a character class you've used many times, or see some new devious enemies that never appeared in a zone before, or you'll get a new piece of gear that completely upends the rules and chaos will ensue. You'll definitely see something hilariously gross. There will almost certainly be times you'll be sent back to your house with your tail between your legs and have to breed a new batch of cats to avenge their mulched predecessors, but you'll do it to the tune of some outstanding original songs.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-review]]></content:encoded>

Better yet, a bundle of two of each deck is reduced, too, which makes each deck around $30, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QK8llB?object_uuid=9e024383-9409-4686-b78c-9247d88374ed&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>a sizeable saving off the list price of at least one deck</u></a>.</p><div id="228493"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228493" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lorwyn Eclipsed - Precon Bundle (x4 Decks, x2 of Each)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Save Big On Lorwyn Eclipsed Precons With This Bundle</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First, the bad news. The Blight Curse deck isn't quite as cheap as we'd like. The precon, which focuses on -1/-1 counters and is helmed by Auntie Ool, is still $50. It's a great deck, admittedly, but you can get it cheaper - sort of.</p></div><div id="228491"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228491" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lorwyn Eclipsed - Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The bundle in question includes two Blight Curse decks and two Dance of the Elements decks, making for an ideal joint purchase for you and a friend who wants one of each deck. It's down to $120.67 now, meaning each deck is around $30 when purchased in this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dance of the Elements itself is discounted, now selling for $35, so factoring that in and the inflated price of Blight Curse, you're getting around $170 of value for your $120</p></div><div id="228490"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228490" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lorwyn Eclipsed - Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what about Dance of the Elements? This five-color deck is all about bringing Elementals into play and using them to dish out big damage. This can be done either with Ashling, the Limitless, or the backup commander Mass of Mysteries. The deck is fun to play, and just like most precons, has the chance to pop off - in my mind, it’s well worth the $30 it costs in this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, I almost wish I’d help out rather than my friend and I preordering both at MSRP…</p></div><div id="229423"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229423" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TMNT Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t expect this kind of bundle for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set, either.

That is until this month, when they, too, are wrapping up.</p>
<p>Shared in a post by the official <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonJP" tabindex="-1">@SplatoonJP</a> X account (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3me6yskwgji2w">@Oatmealdome</a> on Bluesky), Nintendo confirmed that the next Eggstra Work will be the last to feature new job scenarios. While more Eggstra Work shifts will crop up in the future, they will use previous scenarios instead — which should make planning a little easier, at least.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZ3qjATCE2dk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12etkmjhw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As a reminder, the next event runs from <strong>14th-15th February</strong>, and will be held in the Bonerattle Arena.</p>

<p>While Splatoon 3's seasonal Splatfests are still alive and well, even these special events have started reusing old themes from Splatoons past. With Eggstra Work following suit, we guess things really are coming to an end.</p>
<p>We still don't have word of any 'Splatoon 4' just yet. Last year, Nintendo revealed the story-focused spin-off, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, though news on this front has been quiet ever since. Then, late last month, an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">age rating for Splatoon 3</a> <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">on Switch 2</a></em> appeared on the PEGI website, prompting rumours that the series' 2022 entry might be getting the 'Switch 2 Edition' treatment down the line.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Dying Light 2 Didn’t Feature Any of My Designs; I Wouldn’t Work with Techland Again” Says Chris Avellone]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-didnt-feature-my-designs-i-wouldnt-work-with-techland-again-chris-avellone/</link>
            <guid>1428139</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Remember when renowned game writer and designer <strong>Chris Avellone</strong> stood on the stage of <strong>Xbox's E3 2018 showcase</strong> to unveil <strong>Dying Light 2</strong> and its choice and consequence system?</p>



<p>That was the main way developer <strong>Techland</strong> signaled <strong>the shift from the first game's action-adventure genre to an action RPG</strong>. Avellone is famous for having written and/or designed <strong>some of the best Western RPGs</strong>, including Fallout 2, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Neverwinter Nights 2, Fallout: New Vegas, <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a>, <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/tyranny-review-glory-overlord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyranny</a>, and <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/torment-tides-numenera-review-tides-shifted-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Torment: Tides of Numenera</a>.</p>



<p>The goal was to create a narrative sandbox that would respond to the player's choices in meaningful ways. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the end result wasn't that great in this regard</a>, and Techland returned to a linear, non-RPG structure with its more recent game, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a></strong>. </p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://80.lv/articles/chris-avellone-on-writing-making-game-stories-engaging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published today on the website 80 Level</a>, Avellone says <strong>none of his designs made it into the final version of Dying Light 2</strong>. After criticizing the continuous shifting lore at the base of the game and the fact that ideas were only accepted if they came from certain leads, he added that <strong>he wouldn't work with Techland again</strong>.</p>



<p><em>I love designing reactivity in characters, factions, companions, locations, and anything that allows the player to make a mark on the world. So the design of the lore was to create factions that could change over time, had different agendas, had different approaches to the "survival" theme, and the setting was designed to allow for the introduction of new factions and enemies at points in the game based on clear, player-inspired actions.</em></p>



<p><em>That said, none of these designs made it into the game. I recall doing several treatments for a branching, reactive story, but none of them seemed to land, and it became apparent that unless the idea came from particular leads, it wasn't going to gain any traction. Ironically, some of those same leads expressed similar frustrations with trying to build lore and the story, to the point that at least one of them quit the lead role in the later stages (this was after I left). The lore process was also compounded by the fact that there was a rotating queue of writers that seemed to come onto the project and vanish. While I lasted the longest, it made keeping a consistent lore and tone approach difficult.</em></p>



<p><em>Techland and the Dying Light 2 team had great developers in the trenches, some of whom I've worked with on later projects and others who are friends to this day. That said, due to the other difficulties mentioned, I wouldn't work with Techland again.</em></p>



<p>Perhaps the fact that Techland was among the studios that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-accused-of-sexual-harassment-misconduct-several-studios-cut-ties-with-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly cut their ties to Avellone when he was accused of misconduct and sexual harassment</a></strong> is still not insignificant in his viewpoint. Around three years later, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-case-has-been-resolved-sexual-allegation-claims-have-been-retracted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sexual allegation claims made against Avellone were retracted</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Nowadays, the game writer and designer is keeping very busy with four different projects, although the main one is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-joins-republic-games-to-work-on-dark-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the dark fantasy RPG in development at Republic Games</a></strong>. Avellone adds that it's perhaps the project he's enjoyed working on the most so far, and that's saying something given his track record.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-studio-pro-matches-its-black-friday-pricing-at-51-off-now-the-cheapest-anc-headphones-from-apple-2000666197</link>
            <guid>1428130</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Solid headphones that offer a nice blend of quality sound, active noise cancellation, reliable battery life, and a comfortable fit are hard to come by. And even when you do find a pair, these options aren’t exactly the most affordable ones out there. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">Amazon just knocked a whopping 51% off the premium Beats Studio Pro over-ear headphones, which drops their price to $170, down from $350</a>. This discount applies to all color options, including black, deep brown, navy, gray, sandstone, and white – there are plenty of options to choose from. You’re saving an impressive $180 on a pair that’s going to take your listening experience to the next level, but the offer wraps up soon. We highly suggest acting fast to grab yours before the retailer decides to push the price back up (which could be any moment now).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Listening Modes, Multiple Sound Profiles</h2>
<p>This pair features upgraded UltraPlush over-ear cushions with seamless engineered leather to deliver all-day comfort. You can have these on for extended periods without a worry, which makes the pair perfect for long commutes, never-ending meetings, and gaming with friends. The multifunction on-ear controls make it easy to take calls, manage music, switch listening modes, and activate the voice assistant with a single tap on the headphones.</p>
<p>Sound delivery is incredible. Beats has redesigned Studio Pro to be the most powerful and precise over-ear headphones it’s ever made, and that shows. There’s an updated driver with a two-layer diaphragm, refined micro-venting, and 25% stronger magnets to deliver rich, crisp, and balanced sound with zero distortion. The advanced built-in sensors place the sound all around you, letting you experience that theatre-like sound that pulls you in. According to the brand, the spatial audio feature makes it feel like you’re being surrounded by 64 speakers at the same time!</p>



<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; Active Noise Cancelling and Transparency. The former monitors background noise around you, and creates a precisely-tuned filter to cancel it 48,000 times per second. The result? Distraction-free, fully immersive listening, even when you’re in a crowded area. The latter, on the other hand, lets some external sound in, and mixes it with your music. This mode is ideal for when you want to stay aware of what’s happening around, while also enjoying quality audio.</p>
<p>Beats Studio Pro can be connected to your device in multiple ways. You can enjoy wireless connectivity via Class 1 Bluetooth, use the 3.5mm analog input for wired audio sources/in-flight entertainment, or connect it via USB-C for lossless audio. While using USB-C audio, you can also choose between three distinct sound profiles; Beats signature, Entertainment, and Conversation – based on what you require.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as impressive. You’re looking at around 40 hours of listening on a single charge. And when running low, a quick 10-minute Fast Fuel charge offers an additional 4 hours of playback. In short, if you’ve been looking to enjoy better sound on the go, the Beats Studio Pro headphones are the best option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">These typically sit over $300, but you can now grab them for just $170 at Amazon</a>. Grab the pair now to avoid paying the full price later!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Larian Isn’t Involved With The Baldur’s Gate Show, Fans Are Not Happy: ‘I Genuinely Don’t Think Anyone Can Trump Our Writers’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-show-hbo-craig-mazin-larian-swen-vincke-2000666432</link>
            <guid>1428127</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last night, HBO announced what could best be described as a terroristic threat against me, specifically by revealing it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-hbo-show-craig-mazin-last-of-us-2000666189"><span>working on a </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate </span></i><span>TV show</span></a><span> that will take place after </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>and canonize the events of the choice-driven RPG, all while working with </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>showrunner Craig Mazin. The second part of the one-two punch came shortly after, when it was confirmed that Larian Studios, the team behind </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://x.com/i/status/2019563522339082576"><span>won’t be involved in the show at all</span></a><span>. The fans, and maybe even some of the folks at Larian, have been expressing disappointment about all of the above in the hours since.</span></p> <p><span>If you only passively pay attention to </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, the reason this arrangement is possible is because </span><i><span>BG </span></i><span>is a </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </span></i><span>property, and that means Larian doesn’t own the IP, Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast do. The original announcement outlines that the TV show is a collaboration between HBO and Hasbro, so Larian has essentially been excised from the production. Now that the news is out there, members of the studio have put out statements celebrating the fact that </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>reached such “heights” that it’s getting an HBO show, while others are advocating for the writers at the studio that brought these characters to life and are now being handed off to Mazin and the show’s team.</span></p>

 <p><span>Larian CEO Swen Vincke posted a lengthy statement </span><a href="https://x.com/laratlarian/status/2019646146587525143?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q"><span>on his X account</span></a><span> saying that Mazin has reached out to talk to the studio about their thoughts on the show, so it sounds like they may be able to weigh in at least partially about whatever the series is cooking up. He also says that he’s “eager to find out” which </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>endings and choices HBO picks for the series.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Crazy that a story that started out in a small hotel conference room eventually evolved into a narrative inspiring enough for it to become a HBO series. We worked incredibly hard on making </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> worthy of its legacy. Its characters and narratives are the result of many teams working together and I think I can speak for them all in saying that they’ll think this is cool and hope that what comes next will enjoy the same level of passion. The endings of </span><i><span>BG3</span></i><span> were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures. There’s plenty of directions they could go. I’m eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He’s reached out for a chat so we’ll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts. Crossing fingers that the story we’re cooking up for </span><i><span>Divinity</span></i><span> will eventually grow to the same heights. Certainly putting in the hours.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Michael Douse, the publishing director at Larian, </span><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019572415878070680?s=20"><span>responded to the announcement</span></a><span> by saying he hopes that, despite their not being involved with the show, the </span><i><span>BG3 </span></i><span>writers still get the credit they deserve, and that the characters they wrote are treated with the same respect.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I’ve spent the last 8 to 10 years of my life with the writers &amp; creators of </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> and they’re the most incredible storytellers &amp; creators in the space,” Douse wrote. “Only hope is that they get both the credit deserved &amp; the characters are represented at the same level as the game. I genuinely don’t think anyone can trump our writers. Our stories are built by fierce camaraderie and resolve. I have watched them write and write and write and through respect for audience &amp; material come up with some of the finest shit I have ever played. I hope TV allows for the same thoroughness. Don’t abandon hope, but do expect the world. That’s the job.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>fans are less hopeful, with many rejecting the concept of a non-Larian-led show that picks different endings and choices outright.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bg3 fandom reacting to the TV show announcement (but hey at least we all finally agree on something. ‘Tis rare) <a href="https://t.co/vs7AxpiFtV">pic.twitter.com/vs7AxpiFtV</a></p> <p>— Dragon connoisseur 🐉 (@LadySapphyre) <a href="https://twitter.com/LadySapphyre/status/2019594851675980117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The fact both bg3 fans and bg3 haters really don’t want that show to be made LMFAOO</p> <p>— BULLRIDER (@hotelhosea) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotelhosea/status/2019623553977434468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wyll is gonna have two lines, Astarion is suddenly only used as a sex object, Lae’zel is going to be dressed in a skimpy outfit bc she’s gith, Shadowheart will mention girls being pretty and that’s the queer rep.

<p>Embark Studio’s CEO has revealed the company has two new games in the works after ARC Raiders. </p>



<p>Recently, we were informed about the ARC Raiders’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-budget-was-75-million-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported budget</a> and the amount of profit it was able to make, thanks to those costs. The CEO has now revealed that he can’t give a specific number, but the reported budget is “not too far off.” When discussing the game’s profitability, the CEO revealed that he had two more games in store for us. </p>







<h2 id="h-embark-has-two-more-games-in-development-after-arc-raiders">Embark Has Two More Games in Development After ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund revealed they were working on “two new games”. Söderlund first stated that the money ARC Raiders is generating has provided the company with financial security and employment stability for the devs. It has also enabled the studio to grow, hire more developers, and further develop ARC Raiders and The Finals. </p>



<p>Söderlund added that the studio has “two new games in development,” which they hope to finish at some point. So, overall, the game’s profitability is a “sigh of relief” for any developer, and Söderlund wants to thank the community for supporting and purchasing the game. Hopefully, that continued profits can help them provide “competitive salaries, good bonuses” for the devs that worked on the game, concluded the CEO. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MindsEye co-CEO Mark Gerhard has alleged in an internal meeting with Build a Rocket Boy employees that they have “caught the guys” who sabotaged MindsEye in an alleged <strong>€</strong>1 million+ campaign.</p>



<p>In the meeting, which took place in late January and was sent to Insider Gaming on the condition that the video not be made public, Gerhard opened the call by saying they “caught the guys who’ve been sabotaging MindsEye.” </p>







<p>He alleged that the company behind the campaign was a “very big American company,” but that “it’s probably not the company you’re thinking of.”</p>



<p>Gerhard alleged that the smear campaign had a budget of over<strong> €1 million spent in 2025</strong>, and was orchestrated by the UK-based company ‘Ritual Network’, who are “a bunch of gangsters”. According to Gerhard, the company has been paying several influencers, including ‘Cyberboi’ (an influencer Gerhard recently threatened with a Cease and Desist via Discord), three journalists, and Build a Rocket Boy employees, to harm MindsEye and Build a Rocket Boy’s reputation.</p>



<p>In the meeting, Gerhard alleges that all of these individuals “will all be served in person, criminal complaints, shortly,” and that the criminal charges are for “espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.”</p>



<p>“Everyone who’s involved has real problems, including the company behind it. This is the start of our comeback,” he said.</p>

<h3 id="h-ritual-network-denies-the-allegations">Ritual Network Denies The Allegations</h3>



<p>Insider Gaming contacted the UK-based company ‘Ritual Network’ for comment about the allegations, to which they replied:</p>



<p><em><strong>“Ritual Network is a creator support platform and is not involved in the matter you referenced. We are not aware of any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims. Any suggestion that Ritual Network is connected to these allegations is incorrect.”</strong></em></p>



<p>When Insider Gaming asked Build a Rocket Boy for comment on the allegations Mark Gerhard made in the meeting, a Build a Rocket Boy spokesperson said:</p>



<p><em><strong>“We don’t comment on leaked internal communications. Sadly, we do have evidence that there has been a coordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage Build A Rocket Boy’s reputation and undermine confidence in MindsEye. We are working with our legal team and taking steps to address this.”</strong></em></p>



<p>Following the allegations made in the meeting, Gerhard went on to say, “The way we win as a business is through the quality of our games, through the love, the passion that we put into MindsEye.”</p>







<h3 id="h-they-are-going-to-put-the-alleged-members-in-mindseye">They Are Going To Put The Alleged Members In Mindseye</h3>



<p>He continued, “Given this has happened to us, I’m gonna own this narrative. We will use these people, these names and these facts for our own fun. We’re gonna put some of these names into our upcoming spy mission.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that MindsEye’s upcoming spy mission will be a reused version of the now-cancelled ‘Hitman’ mission announced in June 2025, as they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separate from IOI Partners as its publisher</a>.</p>



<p>“And let’s have some fun with it,” said Gerhard.. “Let’s tell the community the story before it even plays out in court. So, you know, I think this is not us being the victim. </p>



<p>“We’ve taken a couple of punches. We’ve kept turning the other cheek while we got our house in order. And now it’s time to start judoing this right back at them. And, you know, so let’s have some fun with it. At the end of the day, we’re storytellers, we’re game makers.” </p>



<h3 id="h-they-are-tracking-employees">They Are Tracking Employees</h3>



<p>The meeting then moved to Gerhard explaining why Build a Rocket Boy had recently rolled out an “enhanced cybersecurity software” to employees without their knowledge. Insider Gaming understands that this software is called ‘Teramind’, and according to one source, was rolled out to employees’ PCs without their knowledge. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.teramind.co/" id="https://www.teramind.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Teramind</a> is an employee monitoring and cybersecurity platform that tracks user activity, including keystrokes and screen behaviour, in an attempt to track insider threats.</p>



<p>“It leads me to the next point. You know, I know there’s been a rollout of some enhanced cybersecurity software that I think has caused quite a lot of confusion, upset, perhaps even mistrust,” said Gerhard. </p>



<p>He continued to say that the reason why the cybersecurity measures were rolled out was to “see the IT team periodically try and improve our security measures,” and that he hates “the fact that we even have to monitor in the first place. And, you know, I think it goes without saying that we can trust 99.9% of this business. The problem is it’s the one. It’s the 1%. That is the problem. And, you know, the next 90 days for this business are absolutely critical.”</p>



<p>Gerhard continued that he hopes that the cybersecurity measures can be removed from employees’ computers in the next three months, but he takes “full responsibility” for how the software was rolled out and poorly communicated. </p>



<p>The meeting ended with Mark Gerhard saying that he believes February 4th is a “defining chapter” for the game, as the game will run as a live service. But stressed that the call was to share the “huge news” that those involved in the alleged sabotage campaign were caught and will lawyers “have served them or serve in the process of serving them.”</p>



<p>Gerhard concluded, “you guys will get a fair chance to have your game seen and enjoyed by players without the manipulation that has happened and the criminal behavior that has happened. And yeah, please bear with us guys in terms of the additional cybersecurity controls 10:21 It’s only there because of what we’ve been through. And I want to make sure that I can protect you guys going forward. And no one in the team is able to sabotage your work, your careers and your studio” </p>



<p>Insider Gaming asked Build a Rocket Boy for comment on its cybersecurity measures but received the same response as above.</p>

            <guid>1428115</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>HBO and Craig Mazin, who is currently working on Season 3 of <em>The Last of Us</em>, are adapting <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/baldurs-gate-3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> for TV. According to a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, HBO's Baldur's Gate 3 adaptation will be a continuation of the game, which developer Larian Studios released in 2023 to widespread acclaim, and take place immediately after the event of the game's finale.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Deadline</em> says characters "old and new" will be dealing with the ramifications of the events of Baldur's Gate 3 in this adaptation, which <em>The Last of Us </em>showrunner and co-creator Mazin will write, executive produce, and showrun. Jacqueline Lesko and Cecil O'Connor will also serve as executive producers alongside Hasbro Entertainment's Gabriel Marano, with Chris Perkins, former Head of Story at Hasbro's Wizards of the Coast subsidiary, serving as a consultant. Hasbro, by way of Wizards of the Coast (which own D&amp;D), owns the Baldur's Gate IP.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpAGlgJMYLc?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpAGlgJMYLc?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of Baldur's Gate 3, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of the Coast created," Mazin said to <em>Deadline</em>. "I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can't wait to help bring Baldur's Gate and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can, and I'm deeply grateful to Gabe Marano and his team at Hasbro for entrusting me with this incredibly important property."&nbsp;</p><p><em>Deadline</em> reports that Mazin plans to reach out to the voice cast of Baldur's Gate 3 "with ideas for them to participate in the TV adaptation, if possible," which is something he and <em>The Last of Us</em> co-creator Neil Druckmann (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us games</a>) did in its adaptation. HBO head of drama programming and executive vice president Francesca Orsi told <em>Deadline</em>, "We're thrilled to continue our partnership with Craig Mazin on Baldur's Gate," while Marano told the publication, "The fans have been eagerly awaiting an adaptation of Baldur's Gate, and we could not ask for better partners than HBO and the incomparable Craig Mazin to build this world with."&nbsp;</p><p><em>Game Informer </em>has reached out to Larian Studios for official word about its lack of involvement and will update this story if it learns more, but on X, Larian CEO and Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019648134645957061?s=20">replied</a>, "Not to my knowledge," when asked whether any of the studio's writers are consulting on the show. He also added, "But [Craig Mazin] did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us. From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan, which gives me hope."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/COuJxPaFIZ8?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/COuJxPaFIZ8?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Before that, though, Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143?s=20">posted the following to X as a quote-tweet</a> to <em>Deadline's</em> report:&nbsp;</p><p><em>"Crazy that a story that started out in a small hotel conference room eventually evolved into a narrative inspiring enough for it to become a HBO series. We worked incredibly hard on making Baldur's Gate 3 worthy of its legacy. Its characters and narratives are the result of many teams working together and I think I can speak for them all in saying that they'll think this is cool and hope that what comes next will enjoy the same level of passion. The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures. There's plenty of directions they could go. I'm eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He's reached out for a chat so we'll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts. Crossing fingers that the story we're cooking up for Divinity will eventually grow to the same heights. Certainly putting in the hours."</em></p><p>In response to news of this adaptation, reception online has been... not great. Fans of the series seem disappointed that Mazin is behind the project, likely an alignment of online reception to Season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em>, and upset that the adaptation aims to pick up after the events of Baldur's Gate 3. Notably, there are multiple dozen endings to the game, meaning HBO will likely canonize an ending (or aspects of various endings) to move forward with its storytelling goals; that's somewhat antithetical to the spirit of player freedom and storytelling choices present in the Larian-developed RPG. All that to say, Mazin and HBO have a big lift on their shoulders adapting what is easily one of the most popular games of the last decade, if not all time.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no word on when production of this Baldur's Gate 3 adaptation will begin, but Mazin currently has <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/02/the-third-season-of-the-last-of-us-could-be-its-last-according-to-hbo-ceo">at least one more season of <em>The Last of Us </em>to get out (and it could be the series' last</a>). In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/baldurs-gate-3/a-true-soul-stirrer"><em>Game Informer's </em>review of Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-studios-announces-new-divinity-game">check out the brutal and gory trailer for Larian Studios' next game, Divinity</a>.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A Q&amp;A between shareholders and Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa has been released alongside February's quarterly financial report, in which the topic of rising memory costs was discussed. While the price hikes haven't impacted the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> yet, Furukawa states that might change if the trend continues into the next fiscal year.
</p>
<p>When asked if the rising price of memory has impacted the Switch 2's profitability, and whether this could lead to a price revision for the console, Furukawa responded with the following:</p>
<p>"We do not disclose details regarding individual components, but we can say that we are working to secure stable supplies of memory components by holding discussions from a long term perspective with our business partners. As a result, the recent rise in memory prices did not have a significant impact on hardware profitability in the third quarter. In addition, we do not expect any significant impact in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>"However, if this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability. If the situation deteriorates significantly, we will carefully assess market trends and respond. As for any future change in the price of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, no decision has been made at this time. Any decision to change the price will be determined comprehensively, taking into consideration not only profitability, but also other factors like the platform's installed base, sales trends, and the market environment."</p>

</figure>
<p>Furukawa was also asked if Nintendo will focus on expanding the install-base of the Switch 2 or the console's profitability in the future, given the context of these rising component prices. To this, he responded: "The current rise in memory prices is happening at a pace that exceeds our expectations. In general, the profitability of hardware tends to improve with economies of scale, and we want to continue to reduce costs as much as possible through mass production of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware. With regard to not selling hardware at a loss, what we are focusing on is profitability on a global basis.</p><p>"There are various external factors, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, but looking at the global picture, we have traditionally tried to avoid situations where individual units are sold at a loss as much as possible. It is difficult to predict the changes in the external environment that are currently taking place, but I think it is not an appropriate approach to be excessively influenced by short-term trends. The second and third years for Nintendo Switch 2 are very important, and if we can expand the hardware installed base, we can use that as a basis to greatly expand software sales. We will take this into account when making business decisions and flexibly consider various options."</p>
<p>One shareholder, noticing that inventory of the Switch 2 was higher than usual, asked whether this stocking up on the console was an intentional decision made with the rising cost of memory in-mind. This, it turns out, wasn't the case. Instead, the higher than usual inventory was to get ahead of potential supply issues leading into last year's holiday season.</p>
<p>"Our aim was to begin production as early as possible so that we could secure sufficient inventory at launch," states Furukawa. "Even after the release of Nintendo Switch 2, we worked to expand production capacity to establish a position where we can respond appropriately if demand during the holiday season exceeded projections. As a result of these initiatives, we hold a certain amount of components and products, and these are recorded as inventory. While we currently expect some sort of impact on profitability if the increase in memory prices continues over the long term, we do not anticipate constraints in our production plans due to insufficient supply in the next fiscal year and beyond."</p>
<p>These rising memory prices, caused by the ongoing production strain of AI datacenters and the wider generative AI boom, has resulted in widespread industry shifts as certain components skyrocket in demand.<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/nvidia-is-reportedly-looking-to-cut-gaming-gpu-production-by-up-to-40-percent-in-2026-due-to-vram-supply-issues-but-its-not-as-bad-news-as-you-might-think-not-yet-at-least/"> It was only earlier this year that reports indicated that Nvidia would cut gaming GPU production due to VRAM shortages</a>. Here's hoping things settle down before consoles - the Nintendo Switch 2 included - are seriously impacted.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-tv-4k-streamer-drops-to-new-low-as-amazon-fire-tv-and-roku-streaming-device-deals-heat-up-for-the-super-bowl-2000666210</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your TV doesn’t offer built-in streaming options and you’re looking to cut the cord, a streamer can be a smart investment. Google’s 4K TV streamer is one of the best options out there, and you can now grab it without paying the full price at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/">It typically sits at $80, but you can now snap it up for $100 at the retailer, after a modest 20% drop.</a> The offer applies to both Haze and Porcelain models, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best. Just note that the offer is selling out fast (as you’d expect), so you don’t really have a lot of time left to save. Grab it before the price shoots back up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Popular Streaming Platforms, Plus Live TV Channels</h2>
<p>This streamer sits neatly on your console and comes with a redesigned remote that makes it easy to navigate and access content. It supports voice commands, meaning you can also just speak to find shows, get answers, and control smart home devices.</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy a ton of movies and TV shows from all your services right from your home screen, plus get tailored recommendations based on your viewing habits. Popular streaming apps that come built right in include Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, Apple TV, and more. Note that most of these require a subscription. If you’re looking to cut back on those, the streamer also gets you live TV, with access to over 800 free channels from Pluto TV, Tubi, and more. What’s even better is that if you find an interesting show or movie on your TV, mobile app, or Google, you can quickly add it to your watchlist and stream when you’re ready in just a few clicks. Additionally, casting content from multiple compatible Android and iOS apps on your phone, tablet, or laptop right to your streamer is possible, too.</p>



<p>Then there’s support for 4K HDR and Dolby Vision, which lets you view both the classics and latest releases in great detail with true-to-life colors. You can also connect external speakers that can support Dolby Atmos for 3D sound. The result? An immersive viewing experience that pulls you into whatever’s playing on the screen.</p>
<p>As for performance, Google has packed the streamer with a 22% faster processor and twice the memory of the previous generation. This translates into smoother navigation and faster app switching. Those with smart home devices will also appreciate how this thing doubles as a hub, making it easy to get things done around the house more conveniently. This can include managing lights, checking camera feed, adjusting temperature, etc.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to stream your favorite shows and movies better, the 4K Google TV Streamer is a top option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/">The current 20% discount makes upgrading a lot more affordable, but the offer won’t be around for long</a>. It’s best to place your orders while the discount is still live to avoid last-minute disappointments!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/moon-studios-arpg-no-rest-for-the-wicked-hits-1-5m-copies-sold-two-weeks-after-hitting-1m/</link>
            <guid>1428079</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ori </strong>developer <strong>Moon Studios</strong> took a big swing with <strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong>, choosing to make something outside of its 2D platforming comfort zone and instead direct its talents into making an action RPG. After its <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/">initial early access launch in <strong>May 2024</strong></a>, it was clear that the game had a lot of unrealized potential, and the time to realize that potential as an early access game. </p>



<p>Now, over a year and a half later, during which the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-patch/">has seen more than</a> a <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-breach-update-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-lots-of-content/">few significant updates</a>, the most recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-update-gameplay-trailer-moon-studios/">being <strong>a co-op update</strong> that went live last month</a>, it's starting to realize that potential. A little more than <strong>two weeks</strong> after Moon Studios confirmed that the game had sold over <strong>1 million copies</strong>, the developer gave players another sales milestone update: No Rest for the Wicked has officially sold over <strong>1.5 million copies</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Hey Wicked fans, it's been only <strong>15 days </strong>since our previous 1 million announcement, and already we're happy to make a small correction," </em>the team wrote on the game's Steam page.<em> "Now it's <strong>1.5 million copies sold so far</strong>. We're honestly so happy to see this as a small dev studio doing internal publishing. We want to thank you, our players, for being here with us, whether it's through your amazing support, sharing</em> <em>your love for the game, giving us constructive feedback, patiently waiting for consoles, or cheering us on from the sidelines.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It’s been only 15 days since our 1 million announcement, and we’re incredibly happy to share a small correction:</p><p>We’ve now reached 1.5 MILLION copies sold!</p><p>Thank you all, you’ve been a huge part of this ❤️</p><p>Last day to get 40% off on Steam: <a href="https://t.co/X1teDv5Q4j">https://t.co/X1teDv5Q4j</a> <a href="https://t.co/kc51LM4JRi">pic.twitter.com/kc51LM4JRi</a></p></div>— No Rest for the Wicked (@wickedgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/wickedgame/status/2019078495964459314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This milestone came just as No Rest for the Wicked closed off a sale where the game was discounted by 40%, and also serves as a means of putting down any fears or concerns<a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/"> that the studio is in any kind of trouble</a>.</p>



<p>Two short years ago, months before Moon Studios would release No Rest for the Wicked, analysts were <a href="https://wccftech.com/games-industry-to-become-even-more-concentrated-pure-play-companies-will-be-challenged-but-hits-like-palworld-will-still-occur/">sharing concerns over how concentrated the industry was becoming</a>, and how it would only become more challenging for smaller studios to make an impact. To see an <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/">independent studio that's also publishing its own game</a> find success is a positive sign, one that we'll hopefully see repeated with other developers throughout 2026. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every night for the past several weeks, I'd go to bed thinking about <em>Mewgenics</em>. With my eyes closed and my head on the pillow, my mind wouldn't rest; it would play out scenarios from the game automatically, until, eventually, I finally managed to sleep. Even then, I'd start to dream about <em>Mewgenics. </em>This game has consumed me.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mewgenics</em> is a turn-based, tactical roguelite created by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/edmund-mcmillen" rel="nofollow">Edmund McMillen</a> and Tyler Glaiel. The former is most known for <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> and <em>Super Meat Boy, </em>but they both co-developed the tough-as-nails platformer <em>The End Is Nigh</em> in 2017. The duo is back with this being their largest and most ambitious game yet.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Don't mess with these kitties.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Pick a Collar, Any Collar</h2><p>This is a multi-faceted game with so many different layers, yet they somehow meld together to create something truly special. We have the breeding mechanics from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/pokemon" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon </em></a>series combined with elements from strategy titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-review-timeless-classic" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a> and heck, even <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a><em>. </em>And of course, a good ol' roguelite twist adds even more spice.</p><p>Like any game with McMillen involved, there's a lot more going on than what is initially shown. As you progress throughout <em>Mewgenics</em>, fighting battle after battle and breeding a plethora of super messed up cats, you'll start to see just how deep the rabbit hole goes. If it clicks as it did for me, it will be your life for the next few weeks at the very least.</p><p>But of course, <em>Mewgenics</em> starts out very simple. You're given a group of four cats, and you're tasked with taking them out on runs. Runs start fairly linear by nature, as you're given a path that you must follow (sort of like a linear version of &nbsp;<em>FTL: Faster Than Light)</em>, and each path has a set amount of battles and random events players must engage with.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Battles are the bread and butter of <em>Mewgenics</em>. It's a tactics game first and foremost, and while it has a crude and humorous look to it, the mechanics are no joke. Seriously, this might be the most in-depth, fleshed-out, and rich system I've ever come across in a turn-based tactics title, surpassing even that of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/battle-brothers" rel="nofollow"><em>Battle Brothers</em></a>.</p><p>Before each run, you're able to assign a class collar to your cat. In <em>most</em> instances, you can only have one of a certain class, and that determines their role from the start. Each cat has a set of predetermined stats, with attributes like Intelligence affecting mana regeneration and Luck affecting anything chance-based and random.&nbsp;</p><p>Picking a class gives a few bonus points to certain stats befitting the role, while others might take a hit. From there, it's onward to battle! Fights take place on 10x10 grids filled with obstacles and enemies. There's no elevation to take into consideration here like other tactics games, and honestly, there's already so much complexity to <em>Mewgenics</em> that elevation isn't even needed.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Can't go wrong with Healing Aura, I say!</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>A Talented Group of Felines</h2><p>Part of the depth comes from the breadth of abilities each class is privy to. After each battle, a random cat gains a level-up. You'll be able to choose abilities to use in combat, different passives, and also stat increases. Your choice of abilities, passives, and stats is random, so sometimes you have to make do with what you're given, even if it doesn't seem optimal at first.</p><p>Active abilities are diverse and offer a wide range of benefits. The Cleric class, for instance, has several different types of heals to choose from; one is a single-target spell that can be shot from afar, while another allows you to dash long distances and heal an ally.&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite abilities are attributed to the Druid class, which offers various forms to shapeshift into, if you're lucky enough to be offered those on a level-up. You can turn into a tree that's completely stationary, but offers some support abilities; or, my personal favorite, the stag. The stag tramples over units and displaces them, and you can spend mana to refresh your movement action to keep on tramplin' on.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>With all these abilities and enemies on the screen at once, tactical mode can sometimes help with visibility.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Combine that with a few other spells, like the ability to give your druid's crow companion an extra turn, and there's a great deal of utility and usefulness derived out of a single unit. Throw passives into the mix, and that's where things get truly crazy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Necromancer class is my favorite in this area, as a lot of passives revolve around minions spawning from either the enemies they kill or from the Necromancer themselves. The Necromancer has a few other ways to just go absolutely crazy, though.&nbsp;</p><p>This class's basic attack is a leech that siphons health from enemies every turn. With a combination of passives and abilities, there's a way to multiply this effect and cause catastrophic damage on enemies, with numbers reaching in the hundreds or even thousands.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>We might be in for a world of hurt.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Mind you, most basic enemies don't have a lot of health, with very few reaching upwards of 50. Bosses themselves, while chunky, usually don't have more than several hundred, but this is late in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, <em>Mewgenics</em> is a game you can break, and it encourages you to do so. There is an unprecedented amount of options in this game, in which you're able to absolutely steamroll it if you're lucky enough and build your units right.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to mention the various other ways your cats can become hilariously overpowered. Throughout runs, you'll come across hundreds of different items that affect the behavior of your cats and their abilities. Some items are fairly simple and might give just stat gains, while others have behaviors that can be truly game-changing.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You can't just hoard items as there is a limited amount of space between each run.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Leaky Brain item, for instance, gives your unit a couple of hits in the intelligence stat, but any mana spent is given to adjacent allies. Another item, the Fly Larva, gives your basic ability "rot" and causes flies to spawn from enemies afflicted with it. As I said, there are so many different items, and I haven't even begun to see probably half of them over 100 hours in.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Mewgenics</em> is a game you can break, and it encourages you to do so.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>With each cat having several different equipment slots, you're able to make freaky little cat super soldiers. One of my favorite passives to use in conjunction with weapon items is duel-wield, which allows Fighters to use their weapon twice in succession. As you might imagine, some weapons can have ludicrously good effects, and this makes a huge difference on the battlefield when used twice.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>The Cost of Battle</h2><p>For all that choosing the right abilities, passives, and items does for you, fighting can be brutal in <em>Mewgenics</em>. Each chapter in each of the three acts have different quirks to the environment and their own set of enemies that come with it. These progressively get harder, continually putting on the pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's talk about the Desert, which might just be one of the most brutal areas in <em>Mewgenics</em> due to its scorching hot sun. In most areas, your units regain some health after combat, but because the cats are dehydrated in the desert, they do <em>not</em> regain health after battle. You can mitigate this in a few creative ways, like with water-based abilities, but sometimes that isn't at your disposal.</p><figure role="group">

<p>There are also spiky cacti that can damage your cats if they're knocked into them, but conversely, you can also knock enemies into the cacti for some bonus damage. As I said, each area has its own quirks, and you're constantly challenged to counteract them with ingenuity and incentivized to take advantage of environmental elements, as well.</p><p>Enemies as a whole, though, are so diverse that I continued to see new ones even 80+ hours in. The Boneyard has a bunch of ghostly enemies that can cause fear or inflict leeches, while The Cave has a bunch of spiders that shoot webs. The Sewers have piles of poop that spawn more little poops, and be sure to look out for those rolling turds. The Sewers also has bloodthirsty sharks, because of course.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Enemies as a whole, though, are so diverse that I continued to see new ones even 80+ hours in.</p></blockquote><p>With such a high number of enemies across all these zones, gameplay might feel a little intimidating or even overwhelming at first. Thankfully, each enemy has a handy tooltip that describes their behaviors, so that is definitely recommended.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>The Chaos of <em>Mewgenics</em></h2><p>Let's throw in random events to stir the pot even more during runs. Random events are, by their very nature, random. You might come across a rotten corpse and... it might be moving? It's filled with insects like flies and grubs. You're usually given a few choices, and in this case, you can eat the corpse, loot it, or examine it. Whatever you choose, it's essentially a die roll, so you'd better hope the outcome is good.</p><p>Fail an event, though, and you're in for some trouble. You might get a cursed item, which, in most cases, cannot be removed. You might even get a parasite or a disorder, which drastically affects your cat in typically adverse and unsavory ways.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my cats became obsessed with eating poop, so they'd rush over and eat any poop close to them at the start of their turn. It just goes to show, you shouldn't eat random piles of poop, who'da thunk?&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>One particularly nasty side-effect from an event gave my cat a nasty case of Cordyceps. You know, the fungus made popular by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-part-ii-review" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a><em>? </em>Well, that cat, he was a lost cause, now with a 30 percent chance to be controlled by the AI every turn. It can actually be frustrating to encounter some of these punishing events and can, unfortunately, derail a run before it even begins.</p><blockquote><p>It just goes to show, you shouldn't eat random piles of poop, who'da thunk?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>To lose a run means all of your cats are dead and gone for good, which can be very unfortunate since you'll lose almost all of your food, money, and items gained during that run as well. Plus, you can't breed dead cats, so if you come across a string of unfortunate events, <em>despite</em> your cats being well-built... tough luck.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Everything is fine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I don't disparage <em>Mewgenics</em> for its difficulty, though, as you're able to bounce back fairly quickly. You're given a steady stream of cats, and they breed fast. Food is easy to get during runs, which is needed to feed your cats at home base.&nbsp;</p><p>The best part is, when the randomness of active and passive abilities, items, and events collide, you're met with so many unexpected moments. Abilities and items interact with enemies unpredictably, and there is rarely, if ever, just one way to handle a certain situation or encounter. The unexpected ways in which you can combo all facets of <em>Mewgenic</em>'s gameplay means every run is something to look forward to.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if I lost a run, I'd be ready to jump right back in and learn how I can break the game. The "one more run" mentality has never been stronger in a game for me than <em>Mewgenics</em>, and that's because of all the twists and turns the minute-by-minute gameplay provides.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>What a weird, messed up family.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Breeding!&nbsp;</h2><p>But of course, I've alluded to breeding a few times now, and that is a <em>huge</em> part of <em>Mewgenics</em>. There's a home base that holds all of your cats -- cats from previous runs, and ones that have yet to embark on an adventure.&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth noting that cats from an adventure become retired and can't be used again. Their stats and abilities, however, can become inheritable and are passed on to the next generation. Thus, at the beginning of <em>Mewgenics</em>, it's the weakest your cats will ever be. With enough time and effort, you'll have dozens of badass little kitties ready to take on the world.</p><p>That also means that any mutations you gain from your adventure are often carried over to their offspring. One of my cats gained a mouth mutation, giving them gills instead. That mutation gives a permanent +2 health regeneration while a cat is wet. Another mutation, for the eye for instance, might give +2 intelligence but -1 luck.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>So some mutations can have negative effects on your stats. Even so, I dedicated a sole room in my house to cultivate the most freaky and abominable cats possible, yielding some very intriguing units to use as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>The depth of this mechanic is as complex as you want it to be, depending on what mutations you think are useful. Put these cats in a room together, and they'll breed more and more. Of course, cats don't always get along, so they might also fight each other (and even kill each other) at the end of the day instead of breed.</p><p>By adding certain items to your house, you can stimulate cats to breed more, be less aggressive, or stay healthier so they don't develop disorders like ADHD. Items are gained either through runs or bought via an NPC, and the usefulness of these cannot be understated enough; the items you use to decorate will directly have an impact on the next crop of cats.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Cats fight, and when they do, it can get bloody. Lethal, even.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can also donate any cat you want to any number of NPCs, giving you various benefits. I donated kittens to an NPC to unlock the Gaydar, which, well, determines if cats are straight, bisexual, or gay. It's actually important to know these things because, if a mutation you like ends up on a gay cat, you might be out of luck getting it to spread.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I dedicated a sole room in my house to cultivate the most freaky and abominable cats possible, yielding some very intriguing units to use as a result.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>My only issue with donating cats is that it's pretty slow-going, and some crucial features are locked behind this. The Gaydar was quite useful, but so too was the ability to determine a cat's demeanor. Meaning, for a while, before unlocking this, you'd be grouping aggressive cats with docile ones without really knowing it.</p><p>The house also becomes crowded quite quickly, so it's difficult to sort through all your cats. There really isn't a great way to filter through them, so I wish there was a streamlined way to pick what cats I wanted for a run. Give me a filter so it highlights the cats I need, rather than having to click through each cat one by one.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Mewgenics </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>In case you couldn't tell by the screenshots, <em>Mewgenics</em> has a certain aesthetic to it. It's an acquired taste, but I've grown up with Edmund McMillen's art style through his flash games. He goes for a dirty, nasty, unapologetic cartoonish style that features tons of poop and other unsavory bits. A duo of phallic, white fluid-spewing bosses is the tip of the iceberg here.</p><p>Still, I fell in love with all the freaky cats I made and the creative enemy designs. If <em>Mewgenic</em>'s art style is the only thing putting you off, I encourage you to push through it and discover the sheer amount of depth in its mechanics.</p><figure role="group">

<p>There's a robust soundtrack here, too, and it's surprisingly catchy. There are definitely a few very unlikely, weird songs, but dammit all, I can't get them out of my head. A lot of vocal tracks are here, and if you listen to the lyrics, well... they're definitely something else.&nbsp;</p><p>There are some elements to this game that I've deliberately omitted so that you can be surprised just as I was by what <em>Mewgenics</em> offers; even so, if I got you even a little bit interested, I've done my job. After all, <em>Mewgenics </em>is, no doubt in my mind, one of the best tactics games I've ever played, and with even over a hundred hours put into the game, I'm still finding new things and having more fun than I did when I last played it. More sleepless, feline-filled nights, here I come.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Mewgenics</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the developer over the course of around 100 hours of gameplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From numerous flash games to<em> </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-meat-boy" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Meat Boy</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/binding-of-isaac" rel="nofollow"><em>The Binding of Isaac</em></a>, it's fair to say that developer Edmund McMillen's made an immense impact on the video game industry. So then, it's also fair to say that <em>Mewgenics</em> is shaping up to be another monumental release not just for this critically acclaimed developer, but for games at large.</p><p>To learn more about <em>Mewgenics</em>, which McMillen describes as his "best work," TechRaptor chatted with him about features we can expect in this tactical strategy title, and we also reflect on the game's long developmental journey.</p><h2>The Long Journey of <em>Mewgenics</em></h2><p>If you've followed Edmund McMillen at all in the past, oh, decade, then you've probably heard of <em>Mewgenics</em> at least in passing. Both he and co-developer Tyler Glaiel have made several games since <em>Mewgenics</em>' announcement (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/edmund-mcmillens-end-is-nigh-releases-july-12th" rel="nofollow"><em>The End is Nigh</em></a>, for instance), but this is shaping up to be their biggest title yet.&nbsp;</p><p>"The gameplay loop is essentially breed cats, take them on adventures," said McMillen. "Bring them back, breed them again, and inchworm your way towards a bigger house and a crazier bloodline of cats."</p><p>That's <em>Mewgenics</em> in a nutshell, but there's so much going on under the hood. The very process of cats going on an adventure is highly dangerous; this is, after all, a tactical strategy game, a genre known for its high stakes.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>With that basic understanding of what <em>Mewgenics</em> is, know that it's been through a long and tumultuous developmental cycle. Initially announced in 2012, this one particular game has been on quite the journey.&nbsp;</p><p>"I knew I wanted to make a roguelike," said McMillen, "and I had this idea for a little test, and I wanted to kind of get my feet in the water with roguelike. So before I jumped into <em>Mewgenics</em>, I wanted to make a roguelike game that I thought was going to be really simple, and that was <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>."</p><p>The irony of this statement is that <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> is lauded for its depth, and it's turned into a resounding success. Of course, despite said success, <em>Mewgenics</em> was still on McMillen's mind as he toyed with ideas throughout the years. From his experience developing <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, his intent was to use that knowledge to further develop <em>Mewgenics</em>, though it was still early on.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Yes, breeding is still a core component of <em>Mewgenics</em>.</figcaption>

<p>"So it looked really pleasing, and it was kind of a fun breeding sim," said McMillen, "and outside of that, it was just like collecting furniture to decorate your house with, and then you would use your cats as avatars in minigames, and that was as kind of far as it got, and we did end up working on it for almost two years -- I think it was 18 months, maybe a little under 18 months, and we got as far as showing it at PAX in its barebones form, and shortly after that, it was cancelled out from under me."</p><p>This was all while McMillen worked at the studio he co-founded (and eventually left), Team Meat. McMillen was reluctant to cancel <em>Mewgenics </em>at that time, and it was shelved. Even so, elements from the original <em>Mewgenics </em>were retained. Elements like the vibe and world, characters, and cat breeding are shared between the prototype and the 2026 release.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's still there," said McMillen, "but really, I mean, as you've seen, the meat and potatoes of the game is this sprawling tactical turn-based strategy game, which did not exist in the slightest before."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Some early concepts for gameplay included a <em>Pokemon-</em>style battler, a brawler a la <em>Castle Crashers</em>, and heck, even a <em>Pikmin-</em>like RTS. Even so, the idea of a turn-based strategy game was what both McMillen and Glaiel kept returning to. McMillen says the duo are fans of the genre and connected on having played <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> <em>Advanced</em> when they were younger.&nbsp;</p><p>"I had always wanted to do a game like this, but these kind of games, to make a unique tactical turn-based strategy game... it's a lot of work," said McMillen. "You got to do a lot to go further than what exists there, and going in, we kind of just started playing those old games again and kind of realized that when you go back, your memory fills in a lot of blanks, and there's actually not as much going on as you would think, especially in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-review-timeless-classic" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a> games."</p><figure role="group">

Conversely, <em>Mewgenics</em> follows a more unexpected source of inspiration: <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.</p><p>"There's something appealing about <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> that does work for big brain people, and it's because it's odds. It's odds and averages, and you're always leaning in different ways when you're drafting and whatever else, but there's an element of surprise and, I guess, luck with the card draw aspect of the game that shakes things up just enough to make it so it's not a guarantee that the smartest guy in the room is destroying everybody all the time, and it still feels correct and nice."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Eugenics in <em>Mewgenics</em></h2><p>One of the defining characteristics of <em>Mewgenics</em> are mutations. These can manifest in multiple ways: through random events, from breeding, and other unexpected events. Since breeding is a core part of <em>Mewgenics</em>, you're bound to come across some interesting combinations.</p><p>Florian Himsl, co-creator of <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, is an avid cat breeder in <em>Mewgenics</em>. McMillen recalls the craziest cat he's ever seen in <em>Mewgenics </em>and, of course, this monstrosity belonged to Himsl.&nbsp;</p><p>"It wasn't a cat anymore. It was a turtle with a really long neck that had three sets of eyes. So it was like its mouth had eyes. Its eyes were eyes, and its eyebrows were eyes. And then it had an exposed brain. And then it was like shiny and just like the craziest, craziest stuff. And the cool thing is with those cool visuals come cool abilities. So it wasn't just this, oh, it looks cool. It also had the stats of a turtle. It was very defensive, and all of its eyes gave it dodge chance because it could see in all directions, you know what I mean? So it's bonkers."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>With hundreds of different mutations, players can expect to see new things for many hours to come -- and not just with mutations, but with disorders too. In McMillen's most recent run at the time, he came across a cat with narcolepsy.&nbsp;</p><p>"I designed the disorder, but it's not something I ever got to play with," said McMillen. "And narcolepsy is just simply your cat falls asleep at the end of its turn, but whenever you fall asleep, you gain 10 HP and I think seven mana. So it's this big boost to whatever. And the puzzle here is, OK, that's bad because it's skipping a turn. Like every other turn, he's asleep. But how do I work around this? How can I find a way to wake up my cat?"</p><p>This is where the ingenuity of <em>Mewgenics </em>comes into play, where punishment doesn't mean utter defeat. McMillen's Hunter (a class in <em>Mewgenics) </em>shoots a needle that gives the narcoleptic cat thorns, which damages anything that hits the unit.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"I found ways to basically, when he would wake up, he would just be so, maxed out mana, maxed out HP," said McMillen, "and I could just put him right in the battle, in the middle of all the enemies and all the enemies would attack him, but it doesn't matter because he was never going to die.</p><p>"So while he was sleeping, he's getting pummeled and then he'll wake up and then he'll start barfing -- he had a barf attack -- and he'd have so much mana that he could just puke on everybody and his barf attack was tied to his constitution, so I just drafted around his constitution and that was a lot of fun. So I did it. I had a plan going in and I pivoted mid-run and it worked out for me. And those are the sort of things that as you play for a really long time, you'll really appreciate."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Flash Games and Beyond</h2><p>McMillen and Glaiel both were avid Adobe Flash game developers back in the day. <em>Meat Boy</em> and its subsequent level pack came years before the indie darling that is <em>Super Meat Boy.</em> To that end, we wanted to hear more about McMillen's thoughts on developing for that platform back in its heyday.</p><p>"I do miss the instant gratification of making a small-form, quick game," said McMillen, "and I would like to definitely do that in the future, but I don't even know, the way I think about future stuff is like... right now, who knows if I'll even make another game.</p><p>"I might just work on <em>Mewgenics </em>DLC for the next five years and just kick back and do whatever else. I'm gonna go with whatever moves me and whatever feels right at the time. I'm going to try not to plan and just let it happen."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Though Adobe Flash is technically dead, it still has its uses. You might be surprised to learn that all of McMillen's hand-drawn art in <em>Mewgenics </em>(you can tell it's done by him if it has thick lines), are created in Flash and then exported over.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're just not using the engine at all, it's just Vector art from Flash that's being imported from SWFs, so all the animation and all that stuff, it's all in FLA files, it's all SWF files." He adds: "There are action script calls that we use; we utilize Flash as much as possible, but it's just an art tool for this."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>While writing this article, some interesting news came out: Adobe was <a href="https://community.adobe.com/announcements-539/adobe-animate-end-of-life-and-support-timeline-1548220" rel="nofollow">discontinuing support</a> for Adobe Animate, the program that is essentially Adobe's successor to Flash. This caused quite a bit of uproar amongst game developers utilizing this tool.</p><p>Both McMillen and Glaiel use Animate extensively, so for Adobe to discontinue such a service has massive repercussions. Glaiel's custom engine for <em>Mewgenics</em> ingests the aforementioned SWF files for art assets, which is why it's important to the game; the game does not <em>run</em> on Flash/Animate itself.</p><p>Glaiel was available for comment at the time, so we reached out to him to understand the importance of Adobe Animate, despite the company's insistence on discontinuing support:</p><blockquote><p>"We use Animate (aka Flash) for the art and animation in [Mewgenics]. Flash is more than JUST an animation program, it was a multimedia program, capable of doing a whole lot of things and working in a very unique way that basically has no alternatives. The particular way you can organize assets in it is core to how <em>Mew</em>'s art style functions (piecing together cats out of pieces, heavy use of randomization within art assets, etc, while also exporting to a format that retains the raw vectors and animations instead of flattening it out) which is also core to the main gameplay mechanic of the game (breeding these cat pieces). - Tyler Glaiel&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Later that evening on Feb 3, Adobe decided to roll back its plans to discontinue the product, though it wasn't without great uproar. For now, in a Tweet, Mike Chambers from the Adobe Community team relayed that Animate is now in what is called "<a href="https://x.com/mesh/status/2018812283158470726" rel="nofollow">maintenance mode</a>," implying support will continue, but new features are not planned at this time.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Looking Into Both the Past and Future</h2><p><em>Mewgenics</em> has had quite the journey from its start in 2012, to its cancellation, to its resumed development once more. Now, in 2026, we're finally getting <em>Mewgenics</em>, and a lot has changed for McMillen since then.</p><p>McMillen is a father, and his youngest, a five-year-old daughter, has <em>only</em> known him as working on this game. As for Edmund McMillen as a game designer? He's feeling pretty darn confident about his work, and it took years to get to this point.</p><p>"I think I'm much better at this point," said McMillen. "I got a few failures under my belt, and I think I learned a lot from those failures. I think I grew as a designer and have a better understanding of what to do and what not to do. I've learned a great deal over these years. I think I've discovered how to have fun more with a project and how to entertain myself throughout it.</p><p>"I don't know, that's really the culmination of everything. <em>Mewgenics</em> really is, like, I think it's my best work. It's what I poured most of myself into, which is saying something, because <em>Binding of Isaac</em> was that game for me for so long, but I feel like this has eclipsed that."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/edmund-mcmillen-talks-mewgenics-development-journey-turtle-cats-and-adobe-flash]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Much of the United States experienced one of the worst snowstorms in a minute over the past few weeks. For some regions, it meant piles and piles of snow. For others, it meant one-in-a-lifetime temperatures that had you dripping faucets and praying for the best. </em></p><p><em>And for some, it was both!</em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick experienced different versions of this recent winter sweep, though one thing the both of them had in common was, albeit very different reasons, making the poor decision to decide to try and drive through a blizzard and experiencing consequences.</em></p><p><em>Both wives were upset.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>A few weeks back, you mentioned a good letter series for us might be about preparing for a snowstorm. I virtually nodded, believing that, of course, there’d be much for me to discuss.</p><p>Such as…honestly, I don’t have a good answer. The weather was awful in spurts the past few weeks—piles of snow to manage, one day where the temperature with wind chill was something like negative 40—but outside of some groceries delivered a day in advance, it was pretty normal? We didn’t go to the store and stock up, a la COVID, on supplies like we’d never see daylight again? We get snow in Illinois but it’s rarely of the catastrophic variety. The local and state infrastructure to deal with worse-than-normal inclement weather is such that, so long as you’re not actively trying to drive through a potential death trap while it’s unfolding, you’ll be fine.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the weather that whipped through here was different than yours. By all accounts the snow you were dealing with was more of a pile on. Be honest, Rob. Do you take the threat of a snowstorm not as a warning—but a blessing to be given permission to load up and hibernate?</p><p>There have been moments in the past. A snowstorm knocked out power for longer than 24 hours just after our oldest was born. We stuck it out for a night before getting worried about the thermostat continuing to drop as we entered the second day, deciding to spend the next 24 at my mom’s. Sometime in the midst of that day, my signal that the power came back on was not a notice from the power company, but my phone informing me that I could control my lights again.</p><p>More recently, I was in Wisconsin over Thanksgiving when a mild amount of snow became a concerning amount of snow. Not a major worry for anyone in a well-stocked house, but the parts of Wisconsin I frequent are not near major cities. You’re talking smaller areas with more limited snow responses. Your road <em>will</em> get plowed and salted—but not before the major veins, such as they are, are accounted for first. That might take hours, could take half a day. And if the snow keeps coming down <em>after</em> that plow comes through? Well, again, it’s back to waiting again.</p><p>On this occasion, I had to deliver a check. With a friend or family, you could wait. But in this case, we’d bought something notable from a local and by the tone of their text message, they were hopeful to get that check despite the snow. And so I went out in the snowstorm, hugging the right side of the road and going well below the speed limit. My car has very new all-weather tires, but they are not specifically <em>snow</em> tires. The drive there, where you’re maneuvering up a series of tiny hills that curve around a lake dotted with bajillion dollar houses, was slow but fine.</p><p>What one acutely realizes on the way back is those tiny hills curving around the lake added up and become quite the elevation change on the way <em>down</em>, a descent into a road that has not been well plowed or salted. A road that, as you begin to tap on the break with your all-weather tires, you feel it…slip. It can’t establish a grip with the road. It’s at this moment you look in front of you and realize that, were you to <em>keep</em> slipping, it would be a slow motion wreck off the side of a tiny cliff. Would you survive this tiny cliff? Well, probably so. But would you want to chance the tiny cliff? Probably not. Thankfully, my tires kicked in, I slowed to 5MPH, and made it back.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@zacdurant?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Zac Durant</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>You know, my driving instincts were humbled the day the storm started. MK and I were out at the audio shop listening to a few different DACs, and we were delighted when we saw postcard-perfect snowfall outside the windows. We enjoyed the pure cozy vibes while we listened to the same five music tracks on three different setups, then it was time to go.</p><p>My car has all-wheel drive and good (though damage-prone) all-season tires. It is ridiculously surefooted in most conditions. So I wasn't too troubled by all the fresh, slushy powder that had been dumped on the ground. I even laughed when we saw some Chevy SUV limping down a street after it had <em>clearly </em>just skidded out on the gentlest hill imaginable. We had no such trouble, and while I could feel the traction control working overtime and the car fishtailing ever so slightly, it wasn't alarming. Until we came to a stop sign. I flicked a quick left and hit the gas… and the car <em>completely </em>broke traction. Just slid to the right at like 3 MPH, heading toward a telephone pole. Fortunately the rear quarter panel tapped a snowdrift from the last snow storm and that checked our momentum enough for the car to get back under control.</p><p>I was much more cautious when we reached the turn to get back onto our street. Didn't matter: again the car shimmied and lurched wildly until it came to a halt. It had basically made its entire 90-degree turn by spinning in place.</p><p>MK, who used to drive a lot around rural Michigan, was unsurprised. She was like, "You're used to winter driving, but you're used to doing it on 41 through Wisconsin or driving around Boston where they salt like crazy. You're not used to a place where your roads are low-priority for the plows. You have no idea how bad the roads can really get."&nbsp;</p><p>Which was a generous way of saying, "I forgive you for nearly putting me into a telephone pole you fucking idiot."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If smart sunglasses have been sitting on your tech wish list, this might be the moment to finally make the jump. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7075/">Amazon is currently offering the first-generation Oakley Meta Smart Glasses at a 15% discount, bringing the price down from $449 to $382</a>. That $67 savings makes these futuristic frames far more tempting, especially for anyone hunting for a standout gadget or a gift that feels genuinely different.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7075/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tech and Style Come Together As One</h2>
<p>At first glance, the Oakley Meta Smart Glasses look like classic Oakley eyewear, but there’s a surprising amount of technology packed into the frames. Meta AI is integrated directly into the glasses, working alongside an HD ultra-wide 12MPl camera and built-in five-microphone array. Together, they let you capture photos and videos either by tapping or completely hands-free, using simple voice commands. You can also ask questions about what you’re looking at, save bits of information for later, or scan a QR code just by glancing at it.</p>
<p>Built-in open-ear speakers deliver clear sound without blocking out your surroundings. Spotify, Amazon Music, and Apple Music connect seamlessly, so playlists and podcasts are always within reach. Calls sound natural on both ends. A quick double-tap on the frame lets you switch between your phone’s front camera and the camera in the glasses, giving callers a live view of your perspective. Voice commands also handle calls, texts, and voice messages across apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, keeping your phone in your pocket.</p>



<p>One of the more impressive additions is real-time language translation. Conversations across languages happen naturally, even if you only speak your native tongue. Support currently includes English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Portuguese, with more languages planned. All of this works locally, so Wi-Fi isn’t required to keep the feature running.</p>
<p>Battery life holds up well for daily wear. The glasses last up to eight hours on a single charge, while the included charging case extends total usage to 48 hours. Pairing them with a smartphone unlocks the Meta View app, where photos, videos, voice controls, and system settings are easily managed.</p>
<p>Style hasn’t been overlooked either. Multiple frame colors and lens options, including clear and tinted varieties, help these glasses fit a range of looks. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7075/">With the current Amazon discount dropping the price to $382, the Oakley Meta black frame smart glasses with polarized lenses feel far more accessible.</a> They even might just make for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift for someone who loves both fashion and tech.</p>

<p>A new announcement from Kojima Productions reveals that Hideo Kojima will not be attending the upcoming GDC Festival of Gaming event. </p>



<p>Hideo Kojima has two notable games in the pipeline at the moment: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/physint-new-update-kojima-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>, the title that will blur the lines between traditional game development and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-doesnt-know-if-od-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a>, a horror title he is making with Xbox Game Studios and co-written by Jordan Peele. Many fans have been waiting to hear about both of these games from the man himself. </p>







<h2 id="h-kojima-productions-will-still-attend-gdc-2026">Kojima Productions Will Still Attend GDC 2026</h2>



<p>Kojima Productions has announced via a new post on <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/2019682481327239619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that Hideo Kojima will not be attending GDC 2026. The company stated, “We regret to inform you that Hideo Kojima will no longer be able to attend this year’s GDC Festival of Gaming.” Despite his absence, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/kojima-productions/" id="123">Kojima Productions</a> will still be present at the event, with members of the team scheduled to present throughout the week. Kojima has not shared any reasons for his absence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> shows experienced agent Leon S. Kennedy whiffing every one of his shots — and fans think Nintendo is to blame. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced-updating-live">Nintendo Partner Direct</a> featured a fresh look at the highly-anticipated survival horror title, which features newbie agent Grace Ashcroft alongside veteran zombie fighter Leon S. Kennedy. But watch yesterday's trailer and you'd think Leon was fresh out of the academy, as he is unable to land a single bullet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo showcase included new footage of Leon kicking zombies to the ground, but then firing over their shoulder. At one point he picks up a rifle, then fires at a tree. Leon's even able to miss with a chainsaw, spinning at a zombie only to graze some furniture. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo making Leon miss every shot and attack to keep the show PG is so funny <a href="https://t.co/fknXycULvQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/fknXycULvQ</a></p>— Nin10doland (@nin10doland) <a href="https://twitter.com/nin10doland/status/2019464199219335229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 5, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Online, Leon's sudden lack of fighting prowess has not gone unnoticed, with Nintendo itself believed as being to blame. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo making Leon miss every shot and attack to keep the show PG is so funny," wrote <a href="https://x.com/nin10doland/status/2019464199219335229" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nin10doland</a> in a long thread on social media. "I can feel the frustration from the guy who was recording this game footage," replied NikTek. "How many years of service does Leon have exactly?" added HuhShalien.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Partner Direct broadcast was rated as being for an 18+/Mature audience, though some fans have suggested the footage used here was likely the same seen in the stream's separate Japanese version. In Japan, Resident Evil games are frequently censored, and Nintendo may feel a particular need to keep gore and violence unseen. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Others, meanwhile, noted that this was nothing new for a Nintendo Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They did the same thing with The Great Circle during the boat action shot, where they were shooting the water in front of the enemy boat instead of the actual boat," wrote Donnyboi. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Reminds me of the Hitman trailer when they'd cut right before he'd kill anyone," added RileyEatsGood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is also why the initial reveal for The Duskbloods from FromSoftware looked super underwhelming," concluded VBandit47. "They couldn't show literally ANYTHING that is core to the Soulsborne experience cause they couldn't show any blood. Watch it back, you'll see what I mean lmao."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-2-5-2026-00-02-49-1770383477577.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leon S.

"Grace looks good." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Added High_Flyin_Bird: "Fake Temu Amiibo."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Resident Evil Requiem's director said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/women-in-particular-were-pretty-strict-when-reviewing-his-design-resident-evil-requiem-director-says-hot-uncle-leon-s-kennedy-has-many-fans-at-capcom">the game's female staff members in particular had worked hard to ensure hero Leon S. Kennedy "would make anyone's heart throb."</a>  Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
