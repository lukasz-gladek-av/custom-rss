<p>While it remains to be seen if any game launching this year, such as the highly anticipated <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Marvel's Wolverine</em></strong>, will take full advantage of the system's power, by March<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">,</strong> the system is reportedly getting a much-welcome upgrade that promises to deliver significant image quality and performance improvements, and a few surprises.</p>

The user revealed when the new version of the upscaler will launch, how it will improve the performance of certain games, and more, as summarized below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Update will be available between <strong>January and March</strong>.</li>



<li>Features similar to <strong><em>FSR 4</em></strong> will be implemented on <strong><em>PS5 Pro</em></strong>.</li>



<li>Improved image quality and performance.</li>



<li>Increased frame rates for games that previously sat at <strong>70-80 FPS</strong>.</li>



<li>Higher resolution for classic low-resolution games.</li>



<li>New debugging tools will also be available for developers.</li>

<p>Particularly interesting is also the fact that classic low-resolution games will run at higher resolutions, which could make classic games on the&nbsp;PlayStation Store&nbsp;and&nbsp;more expensive <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation Plus</em></strong> subscriptions more enticing.</p>

            <p>As someone who admittedly struggles to feel at home whenever I try to go back and play the older Elder Scrolls entries, I'm surprised how fun I've found reading through some notes from a D&amp;D game some devs on the series played around the time of Daggerfall's development. Said notes have just been made public following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bethesda-developer-julian-lefay-known-as-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-died">recent death of Julian LeFay</a>, a key figure in the early days of Bethesda, who hosted this freshly unearthed campaign and another more well-known one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/content/julian-lefays-dd-notes">Scans of the notes</a> have been published by the Elder Scrolls lore buffs at long-running wikis the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages and The Imperial Library. "The following documents were recovered from the estate of the late Julian LeFay with great care given to help preserve them by his family and the TES Community," a librarian at the latter wrote. "With the permission of Julian’s family and Bethesda we wish to dedicate this page to Julian Lefay and his impact on The Elder Scrolls and the wider community."</p>
<p>The lore buffs write added that both of these campaigns LeFay ran - dubbed Sumurset and Dwynnen respectively - "helped to shape much of the early lore as the history of Tamriel was being laid out". The Dwynnen one appears to have been known of for a while, but the one set in Sumurset was only discovered via these newly published notes.</p>

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>While the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages folks plan to put up a post at some point this week delving deeper into what the notes mean, they're well worth having a scroll through as is if, like me, you've spent a not insubstantial chunk of your life elder scrolling. Among the masses of character bios you'd expect from any D&amp;D adventure, the hand-drawn maps were among the first things which caught my eye. There's one of the isles of Auridon and Alinor with major cities labelled, and I was surprised how closely it mirrors <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/content/maps-summerset-isles">more modern Elder Scrolls maps</a> of the region, given major tweaks like <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil#cite_note-POT-5">Cyrodill no longer being full of jungle</a> have been worked into the lore in the decades since LeFay's campaign.</p><p>From a character perspective, the notes on Mages Guild founder Vanus Galerion are an intriguing read, with his role as one of the main player characters in this campaign seemingly having set a lot of his backstory in stone. There's one page which simply lays out his origins, with a single handwritten note next to that blurb asking the eternal question: "How about a witch in the wood?" There's also a list of Vanus' mates and where they live, which I'm hopeful no-one hands to would-be mage blackmailers.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a bunch of descriptions of Altmer royals and barons have reminded me how much fun could be had messing with snooty High Elven toffs if a future single-player Elder Scroll was to be set there, as I have with Oblivion's litany of potato-faced Imperial nobles. "Ill-natured and mean-spirited, absolutely everybody hates him," reads the opening line about a baron called Alastor. "He, however, doesn't care since he is very powerful." What a guy. You can almost hear the Dark Brotherhood contract being written up.</p>
<p>Then, there's Deryk. "This baron has a twin sister with whom he constantly wars for possession of the barony. For one hundred years they’ve fought, sometimes he reigns at the end and sometimes she. There is a rather lavish prison on the outskirts of the barony wherein the loser is usually held. For a period of twenty years they jointly ruled, but the result was disastrous." There's a quest you could solve by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccBQZVpVvAE">gently placing buckets</a> over each of their heads so they can no longer detect they're ruling alongside each other.</p>
<p>Even if you're not thinking about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">GTA-sized Turkey Bethesda have had in the oven</a> for ages as you read them, the notes are a really nice way of helping folks remember LeFay's contributions to the series, so it's wonderful to see them being preserved for prosperity like this.</p>

              <p><span>Rockstar Games has just launched the Cfx Marketplace, described as “a curated digital storefront” which will allow a select group of creators “to share and sell” mods for both </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-6-mod-ai-npc-legal-youtube-1850749678"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070"><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II</span></i></a><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Rockstar Games, and by extension its parent company Take-Two Interactive, has a harsh and often litigious relationship with its modding community. Although the developer has never truly been supportive of modding efforts for its games, Rockstar’s laser-focused approach to issuing </span><i><span>GTA</span></i><span>-related takedown notices took root in 2019, following a string of DMCA takedowns for mods on both ModDB and GTA5-Mods.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>As a user on the </span><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/974338-take-two-vs-the-gta-modding-community-2021-ee-edition/#comments"><span>GTA Forums explained</span></a><span>, this new wave of takedown notices was attributed to a change in Rockstar Games’ user agreement in 2019 that banned modding, while the previous 2017 agreement had no such provision. (That previous user agreement has since been “excluded from the wayback machine” and therefore can no longer be found online.)</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659827"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659827">Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span><br> </span><span>Since then, Take-Two’s legal team has been ruthless in their legal pursuits against a string of </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>mods.

Then, in 2023, Rockstar Games revealed </span><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update"><span>that Cfx.re was</span></a><span> “now officially a part of Rockstar Games.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Funnily enough, in 2015, Rockstar Games banned the Rockstar Social Club accounts of several of the members behind FiveM. Rockstar Games then </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-allegedly-bans-modders-for-making-alternative-1723093679"><span>issued an official statement</span></a><span> which explained that the FiveM project “is an unauthorized alternate multiplayer service that contains code designed to facilitate piracy.”</span></p>

 <h2>The <em>GTA</em>&nbsp;mods will be monetized</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rockstar-launches-official-marketplace-for-mods"><span>Earlier this week</span></a><span> on January 12, Cfx announced the </span><a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289"><span>Cfx Marketplace</span></a><span>, which they described as “a curated digital storefront where talented FiveM/RedM creators can share and sell their work.” Although the marketplace is clearly aimed at </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>RDR II</span></i><span> server owners, the official news post states that “there’s something for every server and every player,” including “purchasable props, scripts, maps, and much more.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The marketplace features a handful of mods that are free to download, as well as mods that require a </span><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6187491-onx-eup-police-ems-clothing-pack"><span>$23.99 recurring monthly fee</span></a><span> and bundles that cost </span><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6187491-onx-eup-police-ems-clothing-pack"><span>upwards of $467.99</span></a><span>. For the time being, Cfx has only partnered with a “select group” of modders for its initial launch. It’s also not clear exactly how much of a cut Take-Two Interactive is getting from these purchases.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It could be argued that the creation of the Cfx Marketplace is Rockstar Games’ attempt at providing a space for server owners to find mods that are immune to takedown notices, as, according to commenters on Cfx’s news post, dozens of paid, non-Rockstar-authorized mods have been banned in the past for featuring third-party assets.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The timing is also somewhat suspicious, as this “initial launch” looks a lot like a trial run for a </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></i><span> mod marketplace to me. I’d also be curious to find out exactly how much of a cut, if any, Rockstar Games and Take-Two are getting from these purchases, although said information is seemingly absent from any of the official Cfx Marketplace news posts.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Can You Make Glass in Hytale? Hytale Windows, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-glass-make-windows/</link>
            <guid>1405921</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale is now available in early access, and, despite the similarities with Minecraft, there are some differences, including the process of making Windows and how to get Glass.</p>



<p>The Hypixel Studios title has plenty to discover, but for those who are used to playing Minecraft, it may be difficult to get those approaches out of their heads and learn the new mechanics.</p>



<p>This guide from Insider Gaming will make it easier, though, with a breakdown on Glass in Hytale and how to make Windows.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-make-glass-in-hytale">Can You Make Glass in Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Craft away. Screenshot bt</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although you can create Glass objects in Hytale, you can’t create Glass blocks, or panes of Glass, like you can in Minecraft.</strong></p>



<p>The Minecraft process of gathering Sand and burning it in a furnace will result in Glass Bottles being created. While these are useful for creating items like Health Potions, it won’t give you an item you can use to fill in holes in the side of your base to allow natural light to pass through.</p>



<p>So, while Glass is in Hytale, the whole process works completely differently from Minecraft, but it’s actually much simpler.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-make-windows-in-hytale">How to Make Windows in Hytale</h2>



<p><strong>Windows in Hytale are created by using Stone block or Wood blocks and interacting with the Builder’s Workbench, which shows all the items that the selected block can be turned into.</strong></p>



<p>With a Stone  or Wood block, you can select everything from windows to doors, stairs to trapdoors, without worrying about placement across a crafting grid. Instead, it’s just the one resource you need, which means you can finalize the design of your base much quicker than you can in Minecraft.</p>



<p>The type of Windows you can create depends on the type of Stone or Wood inputted, and there are some big differences. Marble Cobblestone, for example, provide Light Temple Windows, while Softwood Planks provide Crude Windows, so it’s best to gather a variety of different materials and choose the design you like best, particularly as not every Window design even has Glass as part of it.</p>



<p>Not every type of Stone block can be used for Windows, however, as normal Cobblestone, Basalt Cobblestone, and Volcanic Cobblestone are among those that don’t offer a design for Windows when selected in the Builder’s Workbench.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-exclusive-wild-has-reportedly-been-canceled/1100-6495395/">canceled open-world game Wild</a> may get a spiritual successor of sorts from Deus Ex: Human Revolution developer Eidos Montreal. According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/edios-montreal-aaaa-game/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>, the unannounced title is codenamed P11 and features intriguing likenesses to the canned Ubisoft game.</p><p dir="ltr">The report also states that P11 has been in development since 2019, with Unreal Engine 5 powering the project. However, Insider Gaming adds there have been "significant setbacks" for the game. In 2024, Embracer Group <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deus-ex-game-canceled-amid-embracers-ongoing-cost-cutting-report-says/1100-6520668/">canned a Deus Ex game in development and cut 97 people from Eidos Montreal</a>. The layoffs didn't stop there, either. Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-co-developer-eidos-montreal-lays-off-staff-the-latest-cuts-from-embracer/1100-6530502/">another 75 employees lost their jobs</a> at the studio.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As for P11, <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2011272772551614666" rel="nofollow ">an X user named Timur222</a> found that an Eidos Montreal employee on LinkedIn refers to the project as a "AAAA" game. Insider Gaming initially thought that Embracer may have somehow acquired the Wild rights from Ubisoft because this project looks so similar. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-beyond-good-evil-creator-reveals-a-ps4-excl/1100-6421676/">Wild was revealed in 2014</a>, showing players riding a bear and even assuming the control of an eagle and rabbit. The PlayStation exclusive was reportedly canceled in 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">The codename probably just refers to the project being the 11th game for Eidos Montreal. The studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-trailer-shows-first-gameplay-coming-2025/1100-6524087/">currently co-developing Fable</a> with Playground Games and also assisted on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grounded-2-review-little-big-planet/1900-6418390/">Grounded 2</a>. The last game that Eidos Montreal headed development on was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-shot-through-the-heart/1900-6417764/">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a> in 2021.</p>

                <p>Hytale is finally out now in early access following 10 years of development and a cancellation. Like other early-access games, Hytale isn't finished and may contain bugs and other oddities as developer Hypixel updates and improves the game over time. The studio has now <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">outlined</a> what's to come in the immediate future, and more of what's on tap on a longer-term horizon.</p><p>For the "first few months," Hypixel will release updates "quickly and frequently" to address the "backlog of obvious construction sites" that the team wants to address. For anyone just catching up, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-riot-canceled-hytale-and-how-it-came-back-to-life/1100-6537388/" data-ref-id="1100-6537388">Hypixel purchased Hytale from Riot in November 2025</a>, and in the eight weeks since, the team did what it could to get Hytale out, but this also means the team didn't get to every item it wanted to fix or address.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NNh6Dz7YpA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_NNh6Dz7YpA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Looking further out, Hypixel said it plans to release "larger, more bespoke updates" and new features for Hytale. This will include official minigames, with development set to begin on these "in the coming months."

                <p>Rockstar Games has removed a fan-made mission simulating the assassination of Charlie Kirk from its popular online crime sim Grand Theft Auto Online, with the publisher even banning the conservative activist's name to prevent similar missions from appearing.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-online-update-reveals-first-look-at-michael-in-the-grand-theft-auto-universe-since-gta-5-launched-back-in-2013-and-settles-any-lingering-canon-ending-questions" rel="nofollow ">reported by IGN</a>, developer Rockstar North introduced a new feature in the A Safehouse in the Hills update on December 10, allowing GTA Online players to create and share unofficial missions within the game. Not long after the tool was released, however, users began populating the mission directory with recreations of Charlie Kirk's assassination, with one titled "We are Charlie Kirk" being perhaps the most prominent of them.</p><p>Now, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/gta-online-charlie-kirk-assassination-mission-rockstar-1236630176/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a January 13 Variety report</a>, Rockstar Games has removed this and added Kirk's name to its repository of banned words. Sources told Variety that the "profanity filter" the company refers to internally will be renamed to underscore that the tool isn't used only to flag obscenities but also various harmful content, too.</p><p>GameSpot found uploads of the "We are Charlie Kirk" mission circulating on platforms like YouTube and X. If you're familiar with the assassination, then you know how the mission plays out.</p><p>While the "We are Charlie Kirk" mission has been removed from GTA Online, and Variety's sources say other user-generated content related to Kirk is no longer available, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-removes-fan-made-gta-online-charlie-kirk-assassination-mission" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN discovered on January 14</a> that the mission directory reportedly still features objectives recreating Kirk's assassination. A "Charlie Kirk assassination" objective seems to still pop up (maybe because it is written in Korean and made by a South Korean user, per IGN) when you search the directory for "Kirk" in English.</p><p>Rockstar Games has not responded to GameSpot’s request for comment</p><p>Charlie Kirk was a 31-year-old right-wing activist and founder of the youth organizing group Turning Point USA who mobilized for Donald Trump. Known for his inflammatory comments and debate seminars, Kirk was assassinated in Utah on September 10 while speaking about gun violence. His death has raised a furor around free speech, guns, and the nature of repercussions.</p>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">Developer Direct stream from Xbox</a> is happening next week, and with it we'll get a "deep dive" into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>. This is the previously announced next entry in the open-world driving series, which will take us to Japan. However, a surprise may have been spoiled early.</p>
<p>Via user <a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925?s=20">XBOX INFINITE on X/Twitter</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/01/14/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leaks-in-fh5/">Xbox Era</a>), we've received what could be the first look at an in-game promotion of Forza Horizon 6 and its pre-order bonuses. When asked about the screenshot, the user claims they got the pop-up after exiting their garage in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>.</p>

</span> </p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The pop-up is placed on top of new art showcasing one of the stunning environments we can expect to visit during the next Horizon Festival. Pre-orders allegedly include an extra vehicle: "Pre-order now and get a pre-tuned and exclusive Ferrari J50 in Forza Horizon 6!"</p>
<p>There's also the promise of "over 550 real-world cars" at launch and the largest open-world in the series yet, with the Premium Edition adding Early Access (on 15th May, thus making the regular release date 19th May), VIP Membership, Welcome Pack, Car Pass, Time Attack Car Pack, and a post-launch Italian Passion Car Pack plus two Premium Expansions. It's all believable if you've been paying attention to past entries and their DLC offerings.</p><p>Xbox and Playground Games haven't confirmed or denied anything yet, but it wouldn't be the first time an in-game pop-up in previous games has revealed what's next in a series, so I'm personally leaning towards someone having pressed a button way too early. Oops.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 is currently set to release exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC (Xbox and Steam), but a PS5 port at some point is likely, since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-5-ps5-port-tops-5-million-sales-securing-300m-in-additional-sales-for-xbox">its predecessor has already sold over 5m copies on Sony's console</a>.</p>

            <p>Japanese video game developer Cygames has released a new statement regarding its use of AI, after last week announcing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cygames-ai-studio-formed">intention to create an AI-focused subsidiary company</a>, which stirred up a certain amount of discourse.</p>
<p>Writing on social media platform X, the studio - which is known for a variety of popular games including Umamusume: Pretty Derby - apologised for the "concern" it had caused. It added its original announcement was a "simplified" one, which did not address "any of the current problems and social debates" around generative AI.</p>

<p>Cygames stated that art produced via generative AI is not used in its products, and all of its current games have been "crafted from the technical know-how and manual work" of its staff. It furthered that the studio "won't implement generative AI into [its] products without prior notice" to the community.</p>
<p>On the topic of its community, the studio said it holds those of us who love games - including creators and artists - "in the highest regard". Cygames intends to continue honouring free expression while striving to deliver "the best in entertainment", it closed, with another apology to its fans and supporters.</p>

<p>You, of course, don't need me to tell you how rampant the AI discourse in the industry is at the moment. Just this morning, we reported on Hazelight founder Josef Fares' thoughts about the technology, where the developer said he doesn't see AI "taking over", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-and-it-takes-two-director-josef-fares-doesnt-see-ai-taking-over-but-admits-who-knows-what-happens-in-the-future">nor does he see any issue with using AI as long as it isn't generative</a>. Meanwhile, a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">other Japanese studios such as Square Enix</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">Sega have expressed interest in AI use</a>.</p>
<p>As for Cygames, Umamusume: Pretty Derby <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">won the best mobile game award at last year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a></li>
<li>Game Boy - Nintendo Classics</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, I was expecting to see two of these, but how the hell did I spend 34 hours in the NSO Game Boy library? I played a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/marios_picross">Mario's Picross</a> last year (what can I say? It makes me happy!), but surely not <em>that</em> much. Hey ho, welcome to the podium, little guy.</p>
<p>68 hours in Mario Kart World doesn't completely surprise me, given how long I spent searching for those damn <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-all-p-switch-locations">P-Switches</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-all-peach-medallions-and-locations">Peach Medallions</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-all-question-panel-locations">? Panels</a>. Maybe one day I'll be able to come back to it with an open mind and an open heart... but I'll leave it another couple of months.</p>
<p>And finally, the least surprising of them all: Donkey Kong Bananza. It turns out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">reviewing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-walkthrough">guiding</a> a game like this one takes quite a bit of time, and I poured 112 hours into this bad boy to make sure that it was 100% wrapped up. An absolutely sublime reintroduction into the 3D platforming space for the prized primate.</p>
<p>All in all, a somewhat meatier year — though one where I still racked up triple figures on my PS5 with some tasty releases that haven't come our way yet. I put 456 hours into 51 games, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> <em>just</em> missing out on a top-three ranking. Bring on 2026 and another ~500 hours of gaming!</p>

</ul>
<p>Is it really any surprise that my most played game of 2025 is Metroid Prime 4: Beyond? Having written <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> for Retro Studios' latest, along with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/metroid-prime-4-beyond-walkthrough-all-collectibles-tips-and-tricks">100% completion guide campaign</a>, yes, Beyond managed to completely dominate my life for a good few weeks there.</p>
<p>The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy isn't too far behind, mind you. This is still my favourite game of 2025, and to be honest, even with all of the time I put into Prime 4, I'm kinda shocked The Hundred Line didn't bag the top spot. I'm really tempted to play through it again from scratch in 2026, so we'll have to see if it winds up on my top three again this time next year.</p>
<p>Finally, I've been dipping in and out of Street Fighter 6 so often in 2025 that it's just about managed to nab third place. I've been testing and reviewing a whole bunch of arcade controllers for the Switch 2 recently, and SF6 is the go-to game to really put them through their paces. More of the same this year, please!</p>
<p>I also feel compelled to mention that none other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a> <em>just</em> missed out on the top three. Look, I love this game, and I spent so much time in The Mercenaries No Hope mode. I just can't get enough.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a></li>
<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>...well, one of these is <em>not</em> like the others, eh? I'm not sure what happened at the beginning of the year, but I apparently couldn't put down Hello Kitty and friends, which I played for *gulp* <em>173 hours</em>. Was I okay for the first half of 2025? I think so?</p>
<p>Otherwise, my other two games I actually predicted would pop in my 2024 write-up — unsurprising given that Xenoblade Chronicles X is absolutely massive, and I rolled credits at the 112-hour mark. And between reviewing, the DLC, and guiding it, Pokémon Legends: Z-A clocked in at 94 hours. <em>Woof</em>. Some of that is donut farming, idling, and taking screenshots, of course.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was close to the top three at 83 hours, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> is nipping at Hornet's ankles at over 70 hours. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, Donkey Kong Bananza, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> are all around 50 hours.</p>
<p>Overall, a darn good year! 2025 was a <em>much</em> busier year for my Nintendo consoles than 2024 was — I've clocked in 1029 hours between the Switch 1 and Switch 2. I have a feeling that'll slip a little in 2026 for life reasons, but we'll see!</p>

<li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I was mainly channelling the 'Oh crap, I need to finish that before the sequel drops' energy in 2025.</p>
<p>I'd escaped Hades several times before, naturally, I just hadn't gotten to the surface the 10 times needed to get the proper ending. One thing led to another, and yep, another 28 hours on the clock. As for Hollow Knight, I bought it on sale <em>years</em> ago but never got to it. I'm now sitting on 86% completion with 35 hours on the clock, and I imagine the NS2 Edition will encourage me to push that higher.</p>
<p>And sandwiched between those two, there's Bananza, a game I like a <em>little</em> less every time I return, but I've still managed 32 hours and counting. Probably time to call it a day, unless the kids badger me for more "Ooo, banana!" and the Zebra Bananza music.</p>
<p>Bubbling under that, it was a bitty year - 272 hours across 61 games, including a first-play of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> and a big ol' chunk of time with both Mario Kart World and that hot new 2025 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy REROLL</a>.

<p>In all honesty, I didn’t do too much gaming in 2025 due to that age-old excuse of life (and work) getting in the way. Oh… and playing on other platforms, primarily PC (<em>s</em><em>orry</em>!). 2025 began with me starting yet another Stardew save in an attempt to reach Perfection, and even though I’m nowhere near that milestone, it was a nice routine of mine before and after work.</p>
<div><p>Saying that, getting my hands on the Switch 2 gave me a kick up the bum to finally get some games from my backlog completed. I mostly sank my teeth into indies, cosy games and generally games with shorter runtimes. I often got lost in Night City (or found myself recklessly speeding in the outskirts) and creating a new ACNH island just for kicks, whilst abandoning my OG island on my old Switch. Although I’m over 850 hours on ACNH, I’m itching to up them even more now that the update is here.</p><p>

Considering I played a bit of catch-up in December with Pokémon Legends: Z-A and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>, I honestly thought they’d make the cut! I guess they must have been a wee bit behind, so here’s hope for next year’s review. I’m hoping now that I’ve joined the Nintendo Life team, I can get my hours back up and finally have time for games!</p></div>

</ul>
<p>I'm surprisingly happy with how my top three has ended up this year, as it pretty much reflects my actual faves overall for 2025. Just about.</p>
<p>Usually there's a little bit of review time cross-contamination (and XCX is defo there for this reason), but these are all worthy of top three spots in terms of how much I love 'em, too. Hades 2, although I don't adore it <em>quite</em> as much as the OG, is still a masterclass and head and shoulders above most examples of its genre in terms of overall quality of gameplay and narrative.</p>
<p>XCX, I've ranted and raved enough about by now, you can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">check out my 10/10 review</a> if you don't believe me, and The Ivalice Chronicles, well, besides being so far up my street it's moved into my house, it's a wonderfully well-realised and endlessly endearing thing.</p>
<p>What else was up top for me in terms of playtime? Bananza, Mario Kart World and Silksong are all in there, obviously, but so is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/axiom_verge_2">Axiom Verge 2</a> (back on that replay vibe) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity Original Sin 2</a>, which is just one of those games that I'm forever and always mucking about in!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/"><strong>Microsoft</strong> laid off <strong>9,000+</strong> people across the entire company</a>, including its gaming division. The layoffs saw studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"><strong>The Initiative</strong> entirely shut down</a>, while others like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">King</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare</a></strong> were hit by major cuts and project cancellations. At the time of the layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">former and current ZeniMax workers aptly called the cuts "<em>inhumane</em>" and "<em>disgusting</em>,"</a> so it's uplifting to see yet another studio rise up out of these cuts, as former ZeniMax developers have come together to form a new studio, <strong><a href="https://ironrootgames.com/">Ironroot Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Ironroot Games is the second studio to specifically come from former ZeniMax Online workers, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-zenimax-online-devs-form-sackbird-studios-working-original-project/"><strong>Sackbird Studios</strong> was formed in October 2025</a>. The news of the new team comes from an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-zenimax-online-devs-form-ironroot-games-following-traumatising-layoffs">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, where Ironroot Games' chief executive officer and creative director, <strong>Quentin Cobb</strong>, says he is still trying to work through what happened at ZeniMax Online, where he was the studio's principal gameplay designer. Cobb also goes as far as to add the word "<em>traumatic</em>"  to the list of ways to describe the cuts at ZeniMax and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a>.</p>



<p>"<em>I thought it was going well, personally, and it was shaping up,</em>" said Cobb. "<em>A thing that I struggle with is you wrap your identity up into your work. It's tough for that to get flushed down the toilet. I was there for almost five years. It's gone. All gone. It was a shock, and, to be honest, extremely traumatic</em>. <em>There are a lot of people still struggling with the ramifications of what happened that day. Blindsided is an understatement, that's for sure. It was a tough day, something that I'll never forget.</em>"</p>



<p>It's then no surprise that, after an experience like that, Cobb and fellow founding member, <strong>Elaine Gómez</strong>, who also acts as Ironroot Games' principal gameplay designer and studio culture leader, wanted to create their own space to try and avoid going through something like that again. Gómez is one of the few members of Ironroot who doesn't come from ZeniMax layoffs, but instead has their own self-described "<em>traumatizing</em>" triple-A layoff story from their time at <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/">former NetEase-backed studio, <strong>Worlds Untold</strong></a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We didn't see it coming,</em>" Gómez begins. "<em>We were told we were fully funded for the entirety of the number of years that this project was going to be on.</em> <em>We were doing great. We passed our prototype flags with flying colours. Everybody was happy with our work. And then all of a sudden it was like, right before Thanksgiving, 2024, 'Hey, everybody, we're just gonna rip the band-aid off</em>."</p>



<p>Moving forward, part of how Cobb and Gómez are trying to build a better future for themselves and their coworkers starts with Ironroot's foundation as a <strong>developer-owned</strong>, "<em><strong>people-first</strong>"</em> studio. "<em>You're not just a cog in a machine</em>," Gómez says. </p>



<p>"<em>The CEO or the top few people in the team taking a gigantic portion of the revenue, and the team getting scraps, is common practice in corporate America and it's disheartening</em>," Cobb said when discussing how he intends to be incredibly transparent when it comes to how the team is paid and the studio's revenue-sharing structure. "<em>I really feel very strongly that the people who make the game should earn the money that the game makes, period</em>."</p>



<p>As for what the studio is working on, Cobb and Gómez are keeping that under wraps for now. "<em>I'm dying to talk about it,</em>" said Cobb. "<em>But it's just so early now that I don't want to put too many details out there and then have to backtrack or change things.</em>" What they would say is that it is a "<em>personal</em>" game with a small budget.</p>



<p>While work on that first project may be a bit slower due to the studio being a small team and starting with some of its members, like Gómez, only working part-time to begin, it is heartening to see another team come up out of the mass layoffs that have plagued the industry over the last few years. Hopefully, studios like Ironroot Games and Sackbird Studios can help create a better future for the industry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Animal Crossing</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/12/23205240/kirby-dream-buffet-nintendo-wholesome">like Kirby</a>, has come back when it seems like the world needs it most.</p><p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizon</em>s</a> released on the Nintendo Switch. The game instantly became a smash hit, providing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22188452/animal-crossing-new-horizons-coronavirus-pandemic-year-2020">a much-needed place to safely gather with friends</a> amidst the global shutdown of the covid-19 pandemic. In the almost six years since, Nintendo has sporadically kept up with the game, adding seasonal items and content, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727354/animal-crossing-switch-update-date">Happy Home Paradise DLC</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22762709/animal-crossing-2-0-update-released-early-nintendo">the massive 2.0 content</a> update that Nintendo claimed, at the time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ3QC8e1_yg&amp;t=699s">would be the game’s last</a>. But the arrival of the Switch 2 heralds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809975/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-a-big-switch-2-upgrade-in-january">a new update for the game</a> that has fans itching for more opportunities to play with friends, create their dream homes, or return to cozy island life. For some, the series has been a constant part of their lives. “My entire internet experience as a child was just the Animal Crossing forums,” Soleil tells <em>The Verge.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@soleilplaysgames">Soleil is a cozy game YouTube creator</a> and diehard <em>Animal Crossing</em> fan who has been playing the series since its early days on the GameCube. “When I started playing, my neighbor, who I had a crush on, was playing,” she tells <em>The Verge</em>. She has all the games in the series, including Japanese versions that she can only play with the help of Google Translate, and has clocked over 4,000 hours in <em>New Horizons</em> specifically. “It just became more and more of a cute escape,” she said.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption>Some of Soleil’s cute escapes that she made on her island.</figcaption></span></p></section><p>With this third update known as “3.0”, Soleil is hoping for things that make the game as robust as its predecessors. Though Soleil says <em>New Horizons</em> is the best game of the bunch, she always felt like it was released unfinished. “Over the years, [Nintendo] introduced patches which have improved gameplay quite a bit, but it still misses some of the mark of what <em>Animal Crossing</em>, up until now, has been,” she said. The new update is two-fold and may bring the game more in line with her initial expectations.</p><p>On January 15th, Nintendo will launch a paid Switch 2 update that offers exclusive features like mouse controls and 12-player online co-op. The 3.0 update, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/861725/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-early-launch-nintendo-switch">which launched a bit early</a>, is free for both Switch and Switch 2 players offering several quality of life enhancements and new features. Players will finally be able to create multiple items at once, the new Slumber Islands offer yet another place to show off player decoration skills, and, perhaps most importantly, there’s now strafing. (Hell yeah!)</p><p>But one of the things Soleil is really looking for improvement on is the villagers.ons According to Soleil and others, New Horizon villagers are more passive than their counterparts from previous games. “One of the most common complaints over the years among casual and hardcore players is that the villagers are just kind of lifeless,” she said. <em>New Horizons</em>’ 2.0 update addressed some of those issues, bringing villagers closer to the prickly, opinionated residents from earlier games. “I hope that in 3.0 that they’ve tweaked [that] some more,” Soleil said. Better, ruder villagers aren’t her only wish. “I’m really hoping that they add more dialogue [...] more shop upgrades, and the ability to redesign our buildings like we could in <em>New Leaf.</em>“</p><p>But beyond wishes and wants, it’s the little things in 3.0 that excite Soleil the most. “The fairy in a bottle item. Oh my gosh, I literally screamed,” she said. “I loved the Majora’s Mask item in every game, I’m very excited that it’s back.”</p><p>Fernando, <a href="https://allmylinks.com/truefernie">another YouTube gaming creator</a>, is also excited by the prospect of <em>The Legend of Zelda </em>themed items in <em>Animal Crossing</em>. Like Soleil, Fernando has been playing the game since the GameCube era, but says that “I really developed a huge appreciation for [the game] like everybody else during the pandemic.” For Fernando, <em>Animal Crossing</em> brought him to his own new horizons. “I grew up playing mostly shooter games, <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>, that sort of stuff,” he said. “<em>Animal Crossing</em> brought me over to another side of gaming that I wasn’t very familiar with, and I found out how much I really like this type of game.”</p><p>Though he has over 500 hours in the game, he didn’t keep up with it over the years. The DLC, <em>Happy Home Paradise</em>, wasn’t for him and after sporadic check-ins he fell off the game entirely until the 3.0 announcement trailer. “The thing that’s really bringing me back is the collaborations with <em>Zelda,</em>” he said.</p><p>But it’s another kind of collaboration that’s wooing Fernando back as, before the 3.0 update, <em>New Horizons</em> did not allow players to decorate in multiplayer mode. “That’s the thing that I am most excited about,” he said. “Being able to decorate with my wife, and go through our ideal house is going to be just a lot of fun.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption>Some of the rooms in Fernando’s current Animal Crossing house.</figcaption></span></p></section><p>Since it’s his favorite game series, Fernando plans to <em>Zelda</em>-ify both his island and his house. In addition to adding <em>Zelda-</em>themed items, in 3.0 scanning either the Tulin or Mineru Amiibo from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> will allow them to visit your island or even move in. Fernando said he plans to add Tulin to his village but is mildly disappointed that Nintendo didn’t go for the more obvious <em>Zelda</em>-themed villager. “It’s a huge missed opportunity not adding a villager based on Epona.”</p><p>Like Soleil, Fernando felt <em>New Horizons</em>’ villagers were blander than their predecessors. But similarly he has nevertheless grown attached to them. That attachment is causing both Fernando and Soleil issues as 3.0 forces them to confront the biggest decision an <em>Animal Crossing</em> player can make: what to do about their island. With all the fancy new decoration items, AC’s robust community of custom pattern makers, and the sheer wealth of customization options available, it can be tempting to start over from scratch. But with that reset, everything goes away — including the villagers that have come to call a player’s island home.</p><p>“Clay, specifically, he’s like an OG and I love him,” Fernando said. “So I don’t want to see him go.” Soleil is no less fond of her own villagers, but has taken a different perspective. “On this island, I’m a god, I can do whatever I want at any time,” she said. “I can just get them back.”</p><p>For both players, <em>Animal Crossing </em>has been an escape over the years, especially during the pandemic and with 3.0’s release imminent, it seems poised to offer gentle distraction in a time of crisis again. “It’s comfort food for me,” Fernando said. “Especially with everything happening in [the US] specifically.”</p><p>For Soleil though, <em>Animal Crossing</em> is something she reaches for in personal times of stress. “With personal crises, I’m more willing to delve into <em>Animal Crossing</em>,” she said. “But when it comes to things that are harming my community, my friends, I’m much more willing to ignore video games for that.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/861760/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-community-reaction]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Next week, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is set to be one of the main focuses of Xbox’s upcoming Dev Direct Showcase. But thanks to an in-game leak, we don’t have to wait until then to find out when the open-world racer will launch. And thankfully, we’ll be speeding around Japan soon when <em>Horizon 6</em> arrives in May.</p> <p>On January 14, <a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925/photo/1">Xbox Infinite</a>, an Xbox news account based in Saudi Arabia, posted a screenshot on Twitter of what it claims to be an ad for <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> that popped up ahead of schedule. The ad claims that <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658"><em>Forza Horizon 6, </em>which was officially announced in September 2025,</a>&nbsp;will be available to play four days early, on May 15, for those who pre-order the Premium Edition of the game. This implies that <em>Horizon 6</em>‘s actual release date is May 19. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-may-have-been-revealed-early-by-an-in-game-ad/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> that its sources have confirmed this release window as accurate.</p>

 <p>“Discover the breathtaking landscapes of Japan in over 550 real-world cars and become a racing Legend in <em>Forza Horizon’</em>s biggest open world driving adventure yet,” reads text included in the ad. Here’s the list of what else you get for pre-ordering the Premium Edition, according to this leaked promo:</p>

 <blockquote><p>• Early Access – Play 4 days early, starting May 15<br> • VIP Membership<br> • Welcome Pack<br> . Car Pass<br> • Time Attack Car Pack<br> • Italian Passion Car Pack (coming post-launch)<br> • 2 Premium Expansions (coming post-launch)</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011452908550926481">According to Xbox Infinite,</a> the leaked ad appeared as they were playing a different <em>Forza</em> game. <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm if the ad is real, but we’ve seen things like this before, and <em>VGC</em> corroborating the release window seems to verify this is a real leak.</p>

 <p>It also makes sense that it popped up now, just a week before the Dev Direct event. Some wires got crossed, it seems, but we can likely expect the release date and more to be confirmed on January 22 at the showcase. Also expected at the event is <em>Pokémon</em> studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reveals-beast-of-reincarnation-at-xbox-games-showcase">GameFreak’s AAA action RPG </a><em>Beast of Reincarnation,</em> as well as a deep dive into the oft-delayed <em>Fable</em> reboot. <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is launching on Xbox, PC, and Game Pass, with a PS5 port rumored to arrive at a later date.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-multiplayer-one-detail-leak-court-docs-player-count-32-rockstar-2000659780</link>
            <guid>1405855</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve learned a new detail about <em>Grand Theft Auto 6′</em>s multiplayer via the ongoing court case over <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">Rockstar Games’ firing of over two dozen employees</a>, despite the <em>GTA</em> maker’s lawyer trying to keep the info secret.</p> <p>While Rockstar has started to share more information about <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-red-dead-2-2000658151"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a>, launching this November, it has basically said nothing about the upcoming open-world game’s multiplayer mode. Following the massive success of <em>GTA Online, GTA 6</em> will likely feature a similar, possibly bigger, online spin-off. But what that will look like, how it will work, and when to expect it (<em>GTA Online</em> launched a few weeks after <em>GTA V</em>), well, we have no idea. But hey, at least I can confirm to you that <em>GTA 6</em>‘s online mode will support at least 32 players.</p> <p>This new, tiny detail comes from the ongoing court case between Rockstar Games and over two dozen employees it fired back in October 2025. The company claims they were let go after sharing confidential information in a Discord server. The devs and the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain claim it was an act of union-busting. <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-wins-initial-ruling-against-fired-gta-6-devs-we-regret-that-we-were-put-in-a-position-where-dismissals-were-necessary-2000658984">On Monday</a>, an employment tribunal in the UK ruled that Rockstar won’t have to pay fired employees back pay during the case. But during this hearing, as reported by <em><a href="https://youtu.be/dnuipPQDd_w">People Make Games</a>,</em> Rockstar was forced to share some of the messages from the devs, which included a detail about<em> GTA 6′</em>s online mode that Rockstar’s legal spokesperson wasn’t comfortable reading out loud because it was extremely confidential.</p>

  <p>In October, one fired employee sent a message in Discord claiming Rockstar didn’t want more than five people taking time off for any reason, as it made it harder to fill playtest sessions of the online mode with 32 players. “Not sure how that was difficult,” added the developer, as seen in court docs by <em>PMG</em>. Someone else replied: “Sounds like you have multiple studios of QA testers, surely someone can manage to organise a 32 player session and let people have their time off.”</p>

 <p>And that’s it.&nbsp;<span>As I mentioned, it’s not a significant detail and not surprising either, as&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em> currently supports 32 players online (30 players and</span> 2 spectators).&nbsp; And we also don’t know for certain if <em>GTA 6</em>‘s online mode will support exactly 32 players at release, or if other modes, like a possible freeroam mode, might support even more or fewer players. Still, it is a detail about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s barely-talked-about multiplayer mode that Rockstar was apparently so determined to keep hidden that it got nervous about it in court and allegedly fired someone over sharing it in a Discord chat.</p>

              <p><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-you-need-to-know-animal-crossing-kappn-update-switch-2-2000654252"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’</em> 3.0 update</a> is out now—a day earlier than expected for many players. While the free update is out now, the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade is still unavailable, and likely won’t be out until that version’s official release date of January 15.</span></p> <p><span>The reason the 3.0 update dropped early is assumed to be because it’s already January 15 in certain time zones, like New Zealand. The paid Switch 2 upgrade, though, is seemingly tied to timing in different regions; once it hits midnight where you are, it’ll be available for purchase. To access the free update, just update your <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> game from the Switch homepage. Once the game launches, you’ll know the update is live because Isabelle will shout out the new hotel opening.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Animal Crossing: New Horizons Version 3.0 is NOW AVAILABLE for download on Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2! 🎉 🎉 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/ukHHOS1HJC">pic.twitter.com/ukHHOS1HJC</a></p> <p>— Animal Crossing World 🏝️ (@ACWorldBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/ACWorldBlog/status/2011394946977149116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Fans have been prepping for months ahead of the content update, which was announced late last year. The announcement itself was a huge surprise—Nintendo’s 2.0 update was the last major release in 2021, and was widely expected to be the last update for the game. The new update adds a bunch of new content, like the Kapp’n family hotel, located on the pier. </span></p>

 <p><span>But players are also </span><span>excited for quality-of-life updates that make the whole experience better, like bulk crafting and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-3-0-update-prep-restart-island-resetti-2000658987">Resetti clean-up service</a> for quickly resetting portions of the island. The Switch 2 upgrade uses the new console’s hardware capabilities to support mouse controls and larger multiplayer groups.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Though we’re getting further and further away from the release of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>divisive final season</span></a><i><span>, </span></i><span>fan scrutiny, speculation, and criticism only seems to be getting turned up, with one of the latest narratives being that creators the Duffer Brothers used ChatGPT to write the finale that’s got a subset of fans so mad, they’re crossing their fingers for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>a secret finale that will fix it all</span></a><span>. Now the director of the documentary that inadvertently gave rise to these accusations has offered her own comment on them, and although she may have intended to dismiss any such concerns, her words are unlikely to have that effect.</span></p> <p><span>The genAI accusations were born out of a shot in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-documentary-chatgpt-reddit-2000659351"><i><span>One Last Adventure </span></i><span>documentary </span></a><span>about the making of the final season in which some fans believed they saw tabs for the chatbot open in a web browser while the Duffers were working on the script. </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/stranger-things-5-documentary-director-interview-chatgpt-1236472338/"><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a> <span>interviewed documentary director Martina Radwan about the two-hour film, and naturally, the topic of these ChatGPT rumors came up. In the ensuing exchange, Radwan doesn’t confirm or deny the allegations that the Duffers used ChatGPT as a writing tool, but her comments probably won’t help quell the notion.</span></p>

 <p><span>Interviewer Tony Maglio asks Radwan point blank if she’s aware of any ChatGPT use by the Duffers while they were writing the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>season 5 scripts, and she pretty unambiguously says “no.” The lead-up to that answer, though, is…well, let’s just read it.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>Maglio: You’ve got super fans pausing and zooming in on individual frames of your documentary. One allegedly shows one of the Duffers with a ChatGPT tab open on their computer. Did they use ChatGPT in your presence, and if so, what for?</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: I mean, are we even sure they had ChatGPT open?</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: I’m personally not, but the internet seems sure.</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: Well, there’s a lot of chatter where [social media users] are like, “We don’t really know, but we’re assuming.” But to me it’s like, doesn’t everybody have it open, to just do quick research?</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: I do.</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: How can you possibly write a storyline with 19 characters and use ChatGPT, I don’t even understand.</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: I don’t think many fans truly believe the Duffers had gen-AI write their scripts, I think it’s more of an aversion to the use of the technology in general in Hollywood.</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: Again, first of all, nobody has actually proved that it was open. That’s like having your iPhone next to your computer while you’re writing a story. We just use these tools … while multitasking. So there’s a lot going on all the time, every time. What I find heartbreaking is everybody loves the show, and suddenly we need to pick it apart.</span></p> <p><span>Maglio: So just to button-up the topic: You didn’t witness an unethical use of generative-AI in the writers room?</span></p> <p><span>Radwan: No, of course not. I witnessed creative exchanges. I witnessed conversation. People think “writers room” means people are sitting there writing. No, it’s a creative exchange. It’s story development. And, of course, you go places in your creative mind and then you come back [to the script]. I think being in the writers room is such a privilege and such a gift to be able to witness that.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Radwan asking, “Doesn’t everybody have [ChatGPT] open?” has </span><a href="https://x.com/SThingsMeme/status/2011358226487582816?s=20"><span>put off a lot of people</span></a><span>, both in and out of the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>online drama. Because, no, we don’t all have ChatGPT open. I’ve never used the thing, and neither have a lot of people. Some of us don’t need a chatbot to tell them how to write, think, or do their research for them. Radwan is still adamant that she never saw the Duffers using ChatGPT to write the script, but the implication that they were using the tech at all is still just ammunition some can use against a finale they didn’t like.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even if the Duffer Brothers were to look into a camera and swear up and down they didn’t use ChatGPT, I don’t know that it would be enough for some of the more conspiratorial </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans who are now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>taking pretty much any potshot</span></a><span> they can at the show. </span></p>

                <p>Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Arcade Edition will be added to the Apple Arcade game catalog on February 5 alongside a smattering of other new games. This new version of the game will be playable on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and there does not appear to be plans for an Android port at this time.</p><p>Released last February for PC and consoles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review/1900-6418332/" data-ref-id="1900-6418332">Civilization 7</a> is a 4X strategy game where players guide a civilization through several different ages of history. Like the mobile port of Civilization 6, Civilization 7 Arcade Edition's content is comparable to the PC and console versions of the game, so this isn't some sort of radically inferior spin-off.</p><p>The most novel thing about Civilization 7 Arcade Edition is that its UI has been specifically tailored to support touch controls on iPhone and iPad. Currently, the closest you can get to that is using the touchscreen for your cursor on a PC handheld or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sid-meier-civilization-7-preorder-nintendo-switch-2-physical-edition/1100-6531441/" data-ref-id="1100-6531441">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4635268-civilization7mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635268" data-ratio="0.5635838150289" data-width="1384" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4635268-civilization7mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635268"></a><figcaption>Sid Meier's Civilization VII Arcade Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4635268-civilization7mobile.jpg"></figure><p>This port was developed by Behaviour Interactive, the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-and-castlevania-characters-are-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/1100-6535998/" data-ref-id="1100-6535998">Dead by Daylight</a>. It's not the company's first mobile game, as Behaviour Interactive previously developed games like Worms Across Worlds and Fallout Shelter.</p><p>Although it's certainly the most notable game coming to Apple Arcade in the coming weeks, Civilization 7 Arcade Edition isn't the only title coming to Apple's gaming subscription service. The <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/popular-pc-franchise-civilization-comes-to-apple-arcade-on-february-5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> announcing the port highlights several other games and events coming to Apple Arcade soon.</p><p>On February 5, Apple Arcade will also add the retro game collection Retrocade, the rhythm game Felicity's Door, and a microtransaction-and-ad-free version of I Love Hue Too. A Paddington-themed event is also coming to Apple Arcade's Crayola Create and Play+ on January 22, if that's something that tickles your fancy.</p>

At the time of publication, Hytale has around 112,000 viewers <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory?sort=VIEWER_COUNT">on Twitch</a>, putting it only behind games like League of Legends and Grand Theft Auto V. In addition, a massive rumored concurrent-players for Hytale has been making the rounds, though the figure--2.8 million--seems too good to be true. It all stems from a stream posted by Hytale News <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZh2rw5517M&amp;t=21278s">on YouTube</a>. GameSpot has reached out to developer Hypixel Studios about the statistic.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind PUBG holds the Steam record for most concurrent players with over 3.2 million people in January 2018. So, it's seemingly hard to believe Hytale is close to that achievement within 24 hours of release, especially considering you need to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-hytale-editions-price-and-more/1100-6537363/">download the game from the Hytale website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here" rel="nofollow ">A Hytale blog post</a> has stated "demand has exceeded our expectations," reinforcing the strong start for the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, <strong>Loric Games</strong> announced the new early access launch date for its upcoming airship-themed cooperative survival RPG, <strong>Echoes of Elysium</strong>. As you might recall, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-early-access-release-date-loric-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was supposed to be released on December 4</a>, but there was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-gets-last-minute-early-access-delay-to-january-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last-minute delay to January 2026</a>. The new date has now been set for <strong>January 27</strong>, although there's been no info yet on pricing.</p>



<p>Brian Johnson, the CEO and Co-Founder of Loric Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’re taking Echoes of Elysium to Early Access because we want to build this game with our community. Too often, games are built in a vacuum - developers spend years creating something in isolation, only to find the world doesn’t connect with it. We’re a small team, and rather than disappear for years and release something fully formed without player input, we want to build openly alongside our players. Early Access lets us shape Echoes of Elysium together - a survival RPG where the airship truly is your home, and where you survive and thrive in the skies. We know players joining early may encounter bugs as we continue to improve the game, and we want to reward that trust. This is about creating something together.</em></p>

<p>In a recent blog post published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2644050/view/526490645242578962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the game's Steam page</a>, Loric Games noted that early access is being chosen to make the game alongside the community. As such, systems and features will evolve over time based on the fans' feedback. They also showed some improvements to the animations and combat of Echoes of Elysium. Animations have been smoothed out, and physics are now integrated across all player outfits, constructs, and flying constructs, allowing details such as skirts and capes to trail naturally. The result is a more fluid and dynamic movement for both players and enemies. Thanks to an animation import tool, they also added new wrench attack animations. </p>
