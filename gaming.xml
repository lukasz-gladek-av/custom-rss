		<p>Michael Sarnoski, best known for directing A Quiet Place: Day One has signed up for the Death Stranding movie at A24 Productions.</p>
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/death-stranding-movie-michael-sarnoski-a24-1236360094/">Deadline</a> report he will both write and direct the film which “will delve into the game’s mysteries surrounding the ‘Death Stranding’ — a catastrophic series of events that blurred the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead, bringing forth nightmarish creatures into a fragmented world on the brink of collapse.”</p>


<p><em><strong>Spoilers for Death Stranding now follow!</strong></em></p>
<p>Reports suggest that this means the film will be set before the first game so it’s unlikely Norman Reedus would appear as he is the cause of the Death Stranding. Experiments were conducted to study The Beach, and baby BB. The child is accidentally killed and arrives at the Beach, the junction between the worlds of the living and the dead. His sister/mother/extinction entity pal, Amelie, returns BB – aka Sam – back to the world of the living, thus causing Death Stranding.</p>
<p>Although Norman wouldn’t be in the film it does open the doors for the likes of Lindsay Wagner and Mads Mikkelsen to appear in the movie.</p>

<p><em><strong>End of Spoilers!</strong></em></p>
<p>Back in the world of video games Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out June 26th 2025&nbsp; for PlayStation 5. No other versions have been revealed but as the original Death Stranding has also been released on PC and Xbox , as well is getting a “Directors Cut” with additional content, it will probably go multi-platform at some point in the future.</p>

			<p>Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-portal-remote-player-system-update-releases-today-with-cloud-game-streaming-beta-ux-enhancements/">announced</a> a new update for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">PlayStation Portal</a> handheld device, adding a few basic features to the Cloud Streaming beta that PlayStation Plus Premium members can access.</p>
<p>The Cloud Streaming beta was introduced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/">November 2024</a>. At the time, it was just a bare-bones introduction to using the Portal to stream available titles over the cloud instead of directly streaming them from your PS5 console.</p>
<p>Wednesday's update brings a few basic features to the cloud streaming experience, like sorting the available games in the cloud streaming catalog alphabetically, by release date, or how recently they were added to the PS Plus catalog.</p>
<p>You can also now take game captures while playing a game through cloud streaming on your PS Portal, which works the same way it does when taking a screenshot while playing anything on your PS5 or PS Portal.</p>
<p>This update also allows you to pause a cloud-streaming gameplay session, allowing you to put the PlayStation Portal in rest mode with the game paused, though you can't leave the Portal in rest mode for longer than 15 seconds. The cloud streaming session will disconnect once that timer runs out. Similarly, if you've just set your Portal down without pausing the session, after 10 minutes of inactivity, a warning message will appear in the top-right corner of your screen to tell you that the cloud-streaming session will be closed in 60 seconds.</p>
<p>The last two features the update adds are a queue screen you'll be sent to when the streaming server for a game is full. Your wait time will be displayed on the screen, and you'll launch into the game once it's your turn. Lastly, this update adds the ability for you to provide feedback to PlayStation and Sony about the cloud streaming beta through five simple emoticons that let you share your satisfaction with the service from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest.</p>
<p>It's still surprising that the PlayStation Portal didn't support cloud streaming from the jump, but at least we can be glad it's here now. However, the addition of some of these fundamental features still shows the glacial pace at which Sony is adopting cloud streaming despite making a handheld that seems purpose-built for it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/645782/trumps-new-tariffs-leave-small-creators-scrambling<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve ever been to an anime or any fan convention, you know that the place that’s often the busiest is artists alley. There, creators sell their wares ranging from commissioned artwork to stickers, enamel pins, stuffed toys, apparel, food, and more. Often these goods are made with the artist’s own hand. Other times, merchants are resellers, importing goods that are hard to find domestically, like gunpla kits, from markets where they’re more abundant. But with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645215/trump-us-tariffs-china-eu">the Trump tariffs in effect</a>, artists alleys might soon become ghost towns. </p><p><em>The Verge</em> spoke to several fandom and gaming-adjacent small businesses about what they’re doing to prepare for the tariffs which threaten to destroy businesses of all sizes throughout the US.</p><div><p id="stocking-up"><h2>Stocking up</h2></p></div><p>An artist who simply goes by Biggles has been doing art commissions for the last eight years.</p><p>“I love drawing Vtubers and I love the community so much that my husband and I ended up opening our own merch store, <a href="https://vt-horizons.com/">VTHorizons</a>,” Biggles said in an interview on Discord. The store is stocked with merchandise of several Vtubers including Biggles herself who streams in the persona of a funny-looking cat on Twitch. “We do acrylics, glassware, metal bottles, stickers, slate rock coasters, and are planning on adding more items.”</p><p>Biggles sources most of the raw materials for her products from China and according to her, the business is thriving. “This is my dream,” she said. “Creating things is why I wake up every day. The tariffs felt like [they were] crashing something I worked so hard for.”</p><p>A lot of businesses, particularly in the gaming and art communities, source their products from China. In the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/643970/trade-war-consequences-crazy">trade war</a> initiated by President Trump, China now faces a whopping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645215/trump-us-tariffs-china-eu">104 percent tariff</a>. Businesses about to see their costs skyrocket.</p><p>“We’ve already had to shift money from investing in new equipment to stocking up ahead of time these past few months,” said Jasen, a maker of <a href="https://www.mimsysstitches.com/">embroidered goods</a> based in Wisconsin. “But if we were to keep our prices the same, eventually our profit margins would reduce to an unsustainable level since we barely count the labor cost of our time spent making the product, marketing it, and selling it at events as it is.”</p><div><p id="uncertainty-reigns"><h2>Uncertainty reigns</h2></p></div><p>Even though the Trump administration has instituted sweeping tariffs on nearly every other country in the world, none of the businesses I spoke to know what that translates to in actual costs. That uncertainty compounds their anxiety as they have no idea if they’ll be able to reasonably eat costs or if they’ll have to raise prices and by how much. </p><p>Most businesses don’t want to raise prices at all. Their products are already aggressively priced in line with their competitors, and others simply don’t want to place any more burden on their customers who themselves will feel the pain of rising costs in every other aspect of their lives.</p><p>“If prices were to go up across the whole economy no one would have the extra money to spend on our business,” Jasen, the embroiderer, said.</p><div><p id="making-it-in-america"><h2>Making it in America</h2></p></div><p>Businesses I spoke to said that they were either stocking up on supplies as they work out longer term plans, or are working to find suppliers from countries not getting double-whacked by tariffs like China. Part of President Trump’s stated goal for these tariffs is to encourage businesses to buy and produce American, and some of the businesses I spoke to would love nothing more. But more often than not, that avenue is simply unfeasible, if not outright impossible.</p><p>“I’ve always tried to have my products manufactured in the US,” said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vreni.bsky.social">Vreni Stollberger</a>, an illustrator and comics artist who runs a merchandise store for her work. “But there’s a lot of items that you can only get from China. Washi tape, key chains, plush toys, custom apparel, they’re almost impossible to find here and when you do find them, they’re far too expensive to be a viable option.”</p><p>Dustin Holden, whose company <a href="https://makemhz.com/">MakeMHz</a> modifies and updates older video game consoles, is in a similar situation.</p><p>“Even if we redesigned our products to accommodate alternative microcontrollers, power supplies, or analog components,” he said over DM chat. “No domestic equivalents are available.”</p><p>Those who can circumvent the tariffs by bringing production in house are doing so at steep cost and on accelerated timelines. Biggles said it’s costing her tens of thousands of dollars to bring in equipment that’ll let her make her acrylic products at home, a cost she’s not sure she can bear. </p><p>For Tim Zheng, CEO of <a href="https://viteramen.com/">Vite Ramen</a>, an instant noodle company, it doesn’t matter that his business does everything the Trump administration claims it’s trying to achieve, the tariffs still threaten to put him out of business. </p><p>“We make things here,” he wrote in an impassioned email to his customers. “We provide good jobs. We source as much as possible from American suppliers. And yet, we’re still staring down stacks and stacks of price increases across the board.”</p><div><p id="cuts-to-the-heart"><h2>Cuts to the heart</h2></p></div><p>For these business owners, figuring out how they will survive the tariffs is not just a financial imperative. It is emotionally taxing. </p><p>“We have to figure out more ways to get creative while still being creative,” the artist Biggles said. “Right now I’m steaming three days a week for three hours, then all the other days of the week I’m working on merch art, working on private commissions, and now planning shows.”</p><p>For all the business owners I spoke to, the tariffs are more than just a financial and logistical blow, but an existential one as well. The plans they’ve made to expand their businesses are now put on hold, and peoples’ livelihoods have been imperiled for arbitrary reasons beyond their control.</p><p>“I’m scared,” Biggles said. “I’m scared for the [tariffs’] impact and how this will uproot lives.” But there is hope, not in the government reversing its decision but in the communities these businesses have cultivated. </p><p>“I keep at it because as corny as it sounds, nothing in the world is better than drawing a picture that makes someone go ‘hell yeah,’” Stollberger said. “That’s really all I want to do in my life and these goddamn swaggerless [jerks] keep getting in my way!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/neil-newbon-nobody-is-playing-ai-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-%E2%80%98nobody-is-interested-in-playing-a-game-that%E2%80%99s-made-by-ai%E2%80%99-neil-newbon-says.1159461/</guid>

<p>Earlier this year, Neil Newbon revealed the Pixel Pack, a stunning representation of some of the finest talent in gaming. The goal of the Pixel Pack is to better represent actors in games, oppose the arduous rise of AI voice replication, and provide a stalwart figure of inspiration to a community that’s facing many difficulties.</p>



<p>At the BAFTA Games Awards in London, I chatted with Neil Newbon about the Pixel Pack and what’s next for the group, learning more about the impact AI is having on skilled actors and developers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<iframe title="Nobody Wants to Play a Game Made by AI - Neil Newbon at the BAFTA Games Awards" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1x6Ffm_k38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-problem-is-awareness">‘The Problem is Awareness’</h2>



<p>Neil Newbon couldn’t tell me too much about what the Pixel Pack had in the pipeline, but I picked up a nice mission statement for the group:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re deciding how we can use and galvanise the goodwill that we’ve got at the moment and also how to better represent and try to champion actors. A big part of it is really just about the conversation to not use AI to supplement performers, but also on the fact that game actors are <strong>actors</strong>, we’re not just voice actors, and we’re doing as good work as films and television, theatre… </p>



<p>Actually, just to make people aware that some of these incredible, talented people should continue to work. </p>



<p>There’s a lot of talk about AI performers, it’s honestly boring as hell, nobody really wants to use them. I have spoken to many people in the industry, developers as well.</p>



<p>The problem is awareness of this, it’s making people aware that these actors are doing such incredible, sometimes very challenging experiences, in a good way… But they deserve to be honoured.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the chief goals of the Pixel Pack is to show that ‘anybody from any background can enter into games,’ and to accomplish that, the group is made up of a wide variety of professionals, from motion capture artists to voice actors, and from creature performers to performance capture experts.</p>







<p>Neil continued, and our discussion turned more earnestly towards the use of AI for replication and replacement: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think the point is making awareness of it and saying it’s absolutely not cool, that is a big part of the fight, because ultimately, it comes down to the consumer of the games, the player of the games. Are they going to be as satifsifed with really substandard performances, because I personally think that narrative is the same as gameplay now. </p>



<p>Back in the day, the gameplay was the thing, narrative was sort of shoved in there a little bit, not always but a lot of the time. Now, I think that people have the appetite for great narrative as well as great gameplay, but I think that’s a big part of defending against misuse of AI, because people just don’t want it, ultimately. </p>



<p>Some of the people I’ve spoken to, <strong>nobody is interested in playing a game that’s made by AI</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lack of the human element is always key in these debates. There are certain things that AI can’t replicate, such as the natural imperfection of humanity, which Neil said can often lead to ‘happy accidents’ in a creative environment. In his words, ‘You can’t reproduce that, you can’t create that through software – you just <strong>can’t</strong>.’</p>



<p>The Pixel Pack will undoubtedly be making its collective voice heard very soon as these topics continue to thrive in the wider gaming industry.</p>

These codes are for you!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're in need of extra supplies and resources in Go Fishing, you're in the right place. Below, we've put together a list of all the active redeemable codes currently available in Roblox's popular fishing simulator, so you can get back to tracking down big catches with some useful new goodies attached to your belt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/roblox-go-fishing-header-1741919187909.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Active Go Fishing Codes (April 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, you'll find all of the currently active and working Go Fishing codes in April 2025 that you can redeem for free rewards:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>SPRINGTIME</strong> - 10 Luck Potion IV (<strong>NEW!</strong>)</li><li><strong>150KLIKES</strong> - 3 Giant Gifts</li><li><strong>GOFISHING </strong>- Cash</li><li><strong>ONEBAITONEFISH</strong> - Rocket Bait</li><li><strong>FREEBAITS</strong> - 10 Grape Baits</li><li><strong>50KLIKES</strong> - 5 Gold Baits</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Go Fishing Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The following Go Fishing codes have expired and can no longer be redeemed as of April 2025:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>TODAYSPICKS</li><li>MERRYXMAS2024</li><li>CHRISTMAS2024</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem Codes in Go Fishing</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/roblox-go-fishing-redeeming-codes-1741919187908.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To redeem Go Fishing codes, boot up the game and, once you’re in, follow the steps below:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Look at the icons on the left-hand side of the screen. In the row, you'll see one labelled "<strong>Shop</strong>" with a present icon.</li><li>Select the <strong>Shop icon </strong>to open up the storefront.</li><li>In the bottom left-hand corner of the storefront page, you'll see a code bar. Input your code here and then press <strong>claim </strong>to redeem it.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Go Fishing Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If your Go Fishing code isn’t working, it’s likely due to one of two scenarios. The first is that the code was inputted incorrectly. Check the spelling and that the case is correct, then redeem again. You can even copy and paste the codes directly from this article over to Roblox if you want to make sure you’re inputting them correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other possibility is the code has expired or you’ve already used it. In this scenario, you should see an error message pop up below the storefront menu informing you that the code has already been redeemed or is invalid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Go Fishing Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To check whether any new Go Fishing codes have been added, you'll want to become a member of the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gofishing" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Discord server</a>. Once you're in, you can check the <strong>codes channel</strong> to see whether the devs have added any new codes to the game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Go Fishing in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to other major Roblox hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fisch-codes">Fisch</a>, Go Fishing drops you into a large open world ocean with a fishing rod and a simple goal. Catch fish, sell them for money, use that money to upgrade your gear and then catch rarer fish. Along the way, you'll visit a variety of unique islands, buy boats, and scrounge the depths of the ocean for the most elusive catches possible, attempting to cement yourself as the greatest fisher roaming the high seas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.

                <p>Following US president Donald Trump's announcement of massive tariffs on major manufacturing hubs like China, Taiwan, and Vietnam--and dozens of other countries--Razer has removed its new Blade gaming laptops for sale in the US. While they were available to preorder, the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16#notify-me" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">landing page</a> for these laptops only shows a "notify me" option.</p><p>Amazon and Best Buy have also pulled their pages for the new laptops, but if you really need one, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?id=pcat17071&amp;st=razer+blade#&amp;intl=nosplash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy is offering refurbished Razer Blade laptops for now</a>. It's not clear if these will be the only products that Razer no longer sells in the US for now or if they'll return. It's also likely that the prices on goods like this will rise as manufacturers aim to absord the cost of the new tariffs.</p><p>The laptop is available to preorder in other countries currently, but Razer has yet to officially comment on the tariffs (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645276/razer-blade-gaming-laptops-sales-pause-us-tariffs" rel="nofollow ">The Verge)</a>. It's not the only tech giant dealing with the fallout from the Trump administration's "Liberation Day" announcement, as companies like Framework and Micron have also paused sales of some of its devices in the US for now.</p><p>Nintendo has also seemingly been hit hard by the tariffs, as preorders for the company's $450 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2 console</a> were meant to begin on April 9, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">but have since been delayed</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canadians-cant-buy-the-switch-2-this-week-either/1100-6530689/">Nintendo Canada also delayed its Switch preorder window</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/">analysts are predicting a price increase for the Switch 2</a> in the US.</p><p>Another research company is predicting that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-sell-fewer-systems-than-previously-thought-analyst-says/1100-6530681/" data-ref-id="1100-6530681">Switch 2 will sell fewer systems than previously thought</a> due to the tariffs, while the Entertainment Software Association says that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-says-tariffs-will-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-entire-gaming-industry-not-just-nintendo/1100-6530636/" data-ref-id="1100-6530636">there will be a "detrimental impact" on the gaming industry</a> because of them. According to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-tariffs-may-lead-publishers-to-abandon-physical-games-says-analyst/1100-6529858/" data-ref-id="1100-6529858">physical games might also be abandoned</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trumps-new-tariffs-could-lead-to-more-expensive-video-games-expert-says/1100-6528904/" data-ref-id="1100-6528904">prices on games could be increased significantly</a>.</p>

That's the opinion of analyst Jay Defibaugh of Tokyo-based CLSA.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/316d582f-6d7a-4432-a702-be3de4a70c7d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FT</a> that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">adjusted for inflation</a>, the Switch 2 is $50 more expensive than the launch-price of the original Switch ($300), and Nintendo hasn't done enough to position it as a long-term seller.</p><p>"I don't know if it has the innovation, the kind of new design or function, to have the long lasting power as the previous Switch," Defibaugh said.</p><p>The Switch has exceeded 150 million sales, making it the No. 2 best-selling home console of all time, only trailing the PS2. The Switch, like other consoles, benefitted in part from the COVID pandemic when people stayed inside and looked for ways to spend time and money on at-home entertainment.</p><div tabindex="0"

			<p>Titanfall 3, the yet-to-be-announced new entry in the series by Respawn, will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and will feature a wealth of play modes besides an Extraction mode that is said to be the game's main mode.</p>
<p>Earlier today, known Apex Legends leaker Osvaldatore revealed some additional details on the yet-to-be-announced game, revealing it will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and will feature, together with the aforementioned main Extraction mode, a single-player campaign and other play modes, including Team Deathmatch, Control, Arenas and all Titanfall 2 classic modes. Additionally, the game will see the return of characters from Apex Legends and feature a weather system and a live service approach to multiplayer with Battle Passes, which isn't surprising at all for a modern multiplayer game. As for when the game is releasing, the leaker did not say, but as development is almost complete, its release shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>

<p>Titanfall 3 has been<a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-is-in-development-according-to-known-apex-legends-dataminer-rumor/"> rumored</a> to be in development multiple times since the release of the second entry in the series, but the game never actually materialized, making fans believe that the franchise was over and done. Hopes were reignited again<a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-isnt-dead-and-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2025-rumor/"> last week</a> when both Osvaldatore and Yorotsuki, another known Apex Legends leaker, revealed that the game is real and coming. According to the latter, the game will be revealed later this year during The Game Awards 2025 show, but hopefully, it won't take so long to learn if the series is indeed still alive and kicking.</p>

<p>According to a LinkedIn profile, it seems Warner Bros Games has been working on an unannounced IP slated to launch in 2025.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1909871298517360983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hot-on-the-heels-of-its-open-world-wonder-woman-game-cancelation-warner-bros-games-is-apparently-working-on-a-new-unannounced-ip-thats-set-to-launch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Brandon Maraia’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonmaraia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn profile</a> shows him as the Game Design Lead at Warner Bros Games since 2023. Under the ‘Experience’ section of his profile, Maraia states that he has been working as the Manager of Game Design “for a new unannounced IP game” for Warner Bros Games that is “launching in 2025.”</p>



<p>It is hard to tell which unannounced IP Warner Bros Games might be working on, especially after they recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-warner-bros-games-cancels-wonder-woman-shuts-down-multiple-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed multiple studios</a>. In February this year, it was revealed that Monolith Studios, the developers behind the cancelled Shadow of Mordor series and the cancelled Wonder Woman game, were being shut down. Along with Monolith, Player First Games, the developer of the now discontinued title Multiversus, and WB Sand Diego were shut down.</p>



<p>Warner Bros Games recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-canceled-by-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled a highly anticipated DLC</a> for one of their established franchises. It was revealed last month that Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition and DLC were cancelled as part of the “ongoing restructure at the entertainment company’s video game unit.” Also, there were concerns about whether the “amount of content was substantial enough to justify the price.”</p>



<p>Which unannounced IP do you think Warner Bros Games might be working on to release in 2025? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-summer-show-date-2025-the-outer-worlds-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Game Fest organizer Geoff Keighley has revealed the date for this summer's Xbox Games Showcase, and a major upcoming Xbox Game Studios project will be getting some coverage during the show.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1909954474078319008" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the show will air on June 8th, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">two days after</a> Keighley's main Summer Game Fest show. Unlike that presentation, however, Xbox's show will be digital-only, so there's no way to attend it in person, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Xbox's show will be directly followed by an extended presentation for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, which Keighley says will serve as "a deep dive into Obsidian's new RPG". Given that the game is currently scheduled for a 2025 release, I wouldn't be surprised if we got a release date during the show.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-summer-show-gun.jpg?itok=7Eeb8_RU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-summer-show-gun.jpg?itok=VOJspjv6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>will be shown in detail during the upcoming Xbox show.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is promising "a look at upcoming titles from across [its] first-party studios" during the presentation, as well as "incredible new titles from [its] third-party partners across the globe".</p>

<p>The show for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, meanwhile, will "bring you inside the walls of Obsidian Entertainment", and you can expect "new gameplay, details, and developer insights" too. In short, if you've been waiting for more information about Obsidian's new RPG, then Xbox's summer event will have you covered.</p>

<p>According to Xbox, the summer show will be available on several platforms in more than 40 languages, and both British and American Sign Language will be included. You'll also be able to access audio descriptions in English.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fable-xbox-summer-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=42gbWQrC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fable-xbox-summer-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=T5mfThg5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could we see more&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>during the Xbox show?</figcaption></figure><p>Other upcoming Xbox games include the likes of Playground Games'&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">delayed until 2026 back in February</a>. It's possible Xbox will reveal more about the game during the summer show, but don't expect a release date.</p>

<p>We might also hear more about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inxile-clockwork-revolution-xbox-games-showcase" rel="nofollow">inXile's upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution</em></a>, as well as Team Ninja and PlatinumGames'&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em><em>.&nbsp;</em>Rare's&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>, which has essentially been absent from Xbox's slate <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-trailer-shown-at-xbox-games-event" rel="nofollow">since 2020</a>, could also get a reveal, but don't hold out hope for that one.</p>

Some video games aim to pull originality from the ether, and some video games try to accomplish it by theatrically amassing a bunch of rad parallels and sort of crushing them together until the molecular boundaries give way, and a new Element is produced. This is the vibe I get from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/welcome-to-brightville">Welcome To Brightville</a>, a new "emergent immersive sim" that reminds me instantly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thief">Thief</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> and recent soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The setting blends "industrial Victorian architecture, neo-baroque extravagance, and futuristic cyberpunk elements" to produce a "manapunk" world in which magic and machinery jostle together like cats in a bag. It's a heady stew of references, and perhaps not that novel for a dark fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> - people have been slopping the cyber over other literary genres for a while now, and don't get me started on the abundance of -punk derivatives. Still, it rattles and whirrs along convincingly enough in the below announcement trailer.

In Welcome To Brightville you are a spell-slinging automaton roving a city controlled by a villainous AI who looks like a dark elf John Lennon, going by the hologram in the video. The Beatles parallel isn't entirely frivolous, for this is a world defined by music. "Actions are emphasized by the soundtrack, making combat and movement feel fluid and immersive," notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3541250/Welcome_to_Brightville/">the Steam page</a>. "Characters sing, incorporating musical elements into the story." Was that... GlaDOS I heard yodelling through the PA system earlier?
</p>
<p>
Not everybody in Brightville is a crooner - just as well, because as far as I'm concerned, the jury's still out on whether singing NPCs are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stray-gods-the-roleplaying-musical-review">a positive cultural development</a> or the final stroke of decadence that will lead to us wallowing amongst the rats. The fritzing, headless phantoms on the corners don't appear to sing, and nor do the spiderbot sentinels. I can imagine that clockwork Bill Sikes at the end of the trailer grinding out some Gilbert and Sullivan, though.
</p>
<p>
Welcome To Brightville's combat is all about magic, with players casting hexes using either of your twitchy Terminator mitts. "Your arsenal consists of offensive and defensive magical spells that can be combined to create devastating effects and manipulate the environment," the Steam page goes on. "From elemental explosions to intricate spell interactions, combat is fast, dynamic, and highly customizable." 
</p>
<p>
If you're more of an arcane trickster or a bard than a battlemage, you can also make headway via stealth and "manipulation", tinkering with the environment or talking to NPCs with branching storylines. It's hard to build up a picture from the trailer - which makes the game look like an intricately embroidered corridor shooter, I must confess - but it sounds like they have the usual imsim bases covered.
</p>
<p>
The developers are Contrast Games, who are based in Kazakhstan and have previously specialised in porting - this appears to be their first major in-house creation. It's slated for release on PC in 2027. One to watch while you carry the torch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkanes-founder-is-open-to-the-idea-of-making-dishonored-3-just-dont-place-any-bets-on-it-actually-happening">Dishonored 3</a>.

    <div>
        
<p>This Wednesday morning started with a nice surprise for PlayStation fans. Well, at least for some of them.</p>



<p>As highlighted by the X profile <strong><a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN">Genki_JPN</a></strong> (via <a href="https://x.com/chi_m02/status/1909784608733884842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chi_m02</a>), the company has initiated the distribution of animated backgrounds to a select group of users. These backgrounds are associated with various intellectual properties fans cherish, including Demon’s Souls, Days Gone, Ghost of Yotei, Astro Bot, and others.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that these backgrounds are related to the Welcome Page of the dashboard. They do not appear to be full themes like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-classic-themes-are-leaving-but-they-might-return-soon/">classic ones</a> released to celebrate the company’s 25th anniversary.</p>



<p>This feature has been a highly requested addition by PlayStation 5 owners, and indications suggest that PlayStation has finally heeded the desires of its fanbase by enabling the customization, despite some limitations, of the console’s background display.</p>



<p>The situation is a bit weird due to the lack of any official announcement from Sony at the company’s social profiles. Because of this, it remains unconfirmed whether this functionality is currently in a testing phase or if it is a feature that will be made available to all users throughout the course of this week.</p>

(“CDPR Inc.”), a company being a part of the CD PROJEKT Group," a statement on the studio's website reads. "As a result of the merger TMF, in its former legal state (of a separate legal entity) ceased its operations, while CDPR Inc. assumed the rights and obligations of TMF. The merger will not affect the availability or distribution of The Flame in The Flood and Drake Hollow video games, which will continue to be published by CD PROJEKT Group."</p><p>Studio co-founder Damian Isla is also leaving the studio, calling it "the end of the era" in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damian-isla-815a46_well-its-the-end-of-an-era-tucked-away-activity-7315404560620044288-Qazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a> that simultaneously argues that "this is a good and healthy thing for the studio, and it was long-expected." The Molasses Flood was first formed as an independent studio in 2014. In the years that followed, it released the roguelike survival game The Flame in the Flood and the cooperative creature-raising action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/drake-hollow/" data-ref-id="5000-504768">Drake Hollow</a>.</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-announces-ambitious-game-coming-from-newly-acquired-studio/1100-6497318/" data-ref-id="1100-6497318">CD Projekt Red acquired the studio</a>, and we eventually learned that this happened because The Molasses Flood was working on a multiplayer The Witcher game currently referred to as Project Sirius. The studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-game-project-sirius-now-has-a-new-framework-dev-hit-with-layoffs/1100-6514111/" data-ref-id="1100-6514111">experienced layoffs in 2023</a> and is now being fully merged into the company that acquired it three years ago.</p><p>"It breaks down some organizational barriers, and better integrates the TMF team with the rest of the amazing CDPR org," Isla explains in his LinkedIn post. "Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka "the multiplayer Witcher game," of which I was the Design Director for three years). It's going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we've been working on."</p><p>Project Sirius has not yet been publicly unveiled and is separate from<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/"> The Witcher 4</a>. The latter is the first in a new trilogy, developed using Unreal Engine rather than CD Projekt Red's previous and proprietary engine</p>

<p>First reports came in that some prerelease kits were sent to Brazil by mistake instead of <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm </em>ones, but those have managed to remain underwraps. Over the weekend a second leak emerged: the <em>Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy </em>Starter Kit was leaked in Spanish and it can tell us a number of things about the upcoming Universes Beyond set.</p>

<h3>A New Land Subtype</h3>

<p>In the beginner friendly starter decks, we see new dual lands for both Sephiroth and Cloud, producing mana in their colors. These lands follow what we often see in these types of products: they come into play tapped and produce one mana of either type. What’s special is that there is a new land subtype here: City.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-city-lands-spanish.jpg?itok=2SqKAT2X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-city-lands-spanish.jpg?itok=Rc1991sT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Neither of the lands do anything with the type, but in the past this has been used with types like <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=type%3Agate+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gates in MTG">Gates</a>(in <em>Battle For Baldur’s Gate </em>and <em>Foundations</em>), <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=type%3Adesert+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Deserts in MTG">Deserts</a> (most recently in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/outlaws-of-thunder-junction-most-wanted-review-and-upgrade-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Outlaws of Thunder Junction Most Wanted Review and Upgrade Guide"><em>Outlaws of Thunder Junction</em></a>), and several other times. These lands are not among those unique to the starter sets based on their collector numbers (those over 500 like the rares), so they can be expected to be seen in the main set, along with some payoffs for having them.</p>

<h3>Choose A Job: A New Living Weapon Variant</h3>

<p>For the second time we’re seeing a variant on the mechanic <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3A%22living+weapon%22+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Living Weapon cards">Living Weapon</a>, as Choose a Job follows the ground it and <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3A%22For+Mirrodin%22+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="For Mirrodin! cards">For Mirrodin!</a> previously explored, for the first time without any mirrans or phyrexians around. Honoring the job system that has a long legacy in Final Fantasy, each of these equipment represent one job that might be chosen and taught to one of your troops, or in this case a nameless and colorless 1/1 Hero brought with it.</p>

<p>That Hero token is equipped with the equipment which also gives it a creature type, a buff, and maybe an ability. We see what is Warrior’s Blade for example costing 3R, and giving equipped creature +3/+2 and turning it into a Warrior. Meanwhile Samurai Katana is only 2R giving +2/+2, trample, haste and the Samurai creature type. It’s not only red as the White Mage’s Rod shows a non-sword type weapon at 1W, giving equipped creature +1/+1, cleric, and whenever the creature attacks, you gain 1 life.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-equipment_0.jpg?itok=5fgPn1fc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-equipment_0.jpg?itok=XMJecO9X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The equip costs on these are pretty expensive, 5 for Warrior’s Blade, and Samurai Katana, and 3 for White Mage’s Rod. That fits what we’ve seen in the past, as what you are paying for on the front generally is the creature, and then the equip is the cost to move around, rather than a split with most equipment you see. Warrior’s Blade gives you a 4/3 Hero Warrior, Samurai Katana a 3/3 Trample, Haste, Hero Samurai, and White Mage’s Rod a 2/2 Hero Cleric who gains life.</p>

<p>Not all equipment in the set will be Choose A Job either if that concerns you. Ultima Weapon fills the role of a very big equipment without any of that, and is a rare unique to the starter decks. It costs 7, and also equips for 7 but gives +7/+7 to the creature barring it, who when it attacks can destroy target creature an opponent controls.</p>

<h3>Dragoons Represent</h3>

<p>Dragoons have a long history in Final Fantasy, being a common job in it, and the jumping lancer is an iconic part of the series. With Dragoon’s Lance (another Choose A Job equipment) we see that they are reasonably being typed as Knights, as that equipment gives +1/+0, and makes them a Knight. The biggest part here is how they are capturing the Dragoon flavor though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragoons-lance.jpg?itok=gMWitMgx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragoons-lance.jpg?itok=b8lCDoO5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It jumped in at the last chance!</figcaption></figure><p>For this, they are using a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plst/M10-59/jump" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jump">Jump</a> type effect. During your turn, the creature has flying, meaning it can attack from above, but it can’t defend there. It’s a great flavor fit, and one imagines that we’ll see multiple cards with it in the set.</p>

<h3>More 9999 Representation</h3>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/343/jumbo-cactuar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jumbo Cactuar">Jumbo Cactuar</a> got everyone’s attention with it’s ability to get +9999/+0 on attack when it was revealed in the early <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Crossover Brings Classic Art and New Mechanics"><em>Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy </em></a>showing, but it isn’t the only card that’s going to represent it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overkill.jpg?itok=GYoxsS3t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overkill.jpg?itok=vcnS2tWd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sure, it might translate more to Exterminate, but Overkill fits the English FF localizations.</figcaption></figure><p>With what I believe is ‘Overkill’ (translations are divided on this as it’s not just strict translation, but considering also <em>Final Fantasy </em>translations), we see a removal spell that channels this energy. A 2B costed Instant, it gets target creature -0/-9999 until end of turn, killing almost any creature you can find in <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>that has been the beneficiary of an infinite, or near-infinite combo. Like the rest of the non-rares, it is also from the main set, so you can expect to see it running around as an uncommon in Play Boosters too.</p>

<p>There’s even more to be found throughout the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MTGRumors/comments/1jt1xyj/ff_starterkit/?share_id=YeMj8UkrS2dqmlOVPeuDV" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="MTG Rumors Subreddit thread with leaked images and translations">leaked images</a>, including the fact that we’re seeing a fair number of Japanese artists on these, the starter kits will have beautiful full art lands, and there’s rich representation of games across the series.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-roadmap-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-roadmap-for-2025-promises-plenty-of-new-stuff-through-the-year.1159314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed the roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>throughout 2025, and it's got plenty of new stuff to tide you over until 2026, although it's apparently proven controversial among the game's player base.</p>

<p>In a post on the official&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Blizzard says the&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>roadmap will allow you to "experience the spread of Mephisto's influence through new seasonal themes and questlines", continuing the game's overarching "Age of Hatred" theme, which began with its launch back in 2023.</p>

<p>New sets of Powers will come in each quarter of the year, but here's the catch: they won't be permanent additions. Instead, they'll work on Blizzard's so-called "borrowed power" philosophy, whereby you'll be able to unlock certain upgrades but they won't persist between seasons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=IbhZaV7V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=RVJoC8CH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Diablo 4</em>'s roadmap has plenty of stuff for you, but a lot of it is temporary.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'll know if you've been playing&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>for the past few months, witchcraft is the major theme of January through April, which brought new Witchcraft Powers, Occult Gems, and more.</p>

<p>Between April and July, Belial's Return will bring Boss Powers, a new activity, and, perhaps most important of all, an earnable feline pet to keep you company through those long dungeon treks.</p>

<p>Sins of the Horadrim brings Horadric Powers (as you might expect) and Dungeon Escalation, which will allow you to ratchet up the intensity of&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>'s dungeons. Finally, at the end of the year, Infernal Chaos brings changes to the Infernal Hordes mode, as well as new Powers and more.</p>

<p>As you can probably imagine, fans <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/year-of-borrowed-powers-for-diablo-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">don't seem to be happy</a> about&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>'s continuation of the "borrowed powers" system, and there also seems to be some consternation about Blizzard's failure to communicate exactly what the aforementioned Powers will actually add to players' arsenals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-gameplay.jpg?itok=69eR5sGD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-gameplay.jpg?itok=NpsXD0uO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players have reacted with consternation to&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>'s borrowed powers updates.</figcaption></figure><p>Permanent changes are, however, on their way to&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>. They include new quality-of-life improvements, new Lair Bosses, and keyboard and mouse support for console, plus more.</p>

<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/diablo-iv/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/diablo-iv-standard-edition/9n8117tm8jl3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.
