<p>There are a couple of notable additions and changes here, including a new 'pixel perfect' scaling option, and a revamp of the icon for the Switch home menu. Let's be honest, it wasn't exactly the most inspiring design before, now was it?</p>
<p>It's been confirmed that more patches will be released going forward, but this is certainly a good start, hm?</p>
<p>Let's check out the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Icon changed<br>
- Optimizations to address slowdown (more planned)<br>
- Pixel perfect scaling option added<br>
- Button swapping added<br>
- Addressed crash when copying Empty Profile<br>
- Global language setting now saves properly</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="fP9LUp_ViPU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fP9LUp_ViPU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fP9LUp_ViPU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fP9LUp_ViPU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f7b22nkltou&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP9LUp_ViPU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I thought it had been rather quiet round these parts lately. It turns out it's been several months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> creator Hideki Kamiya had a tantrum about anything on social media. What are you steamed up about today, Kamiya-san? Ah, of course, Hideo Kojima. Specifically, Kojima's long-lost horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pt">P.T.</a> - a collaboration with movie-maker Guillermo del Toro which Konami banished from PlayStation Network in 2015, after cancelling Kojima's associated Silent Hills project.</p><!--more-->
<p>That P.T. is one of the finest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> ever made and also, no longer officially available online is one of the better arguments for the wholesale nuking of the games industry. Seriously, if this is how you're going to behave, Konami, let's tear it all down and put the cockroaches in charge. Norman Reedus wept like a seal the night you deleted the storepage. Fortunately, he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">found other work since</a>.</p>
<p>How does Kamiya propose to set the world to rights? By making his own new version of P.T., except that his version wouldn't be a horror game, because Kamiya hates horror, even though he directed the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>. Erm.</p>
<p>One inclines to suspect that this Hideki Kamiya man may not be entirely serious in the things that he says on yonder <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1963791553694220633">TwiX</a>. Here's the full quote, anyway, as translated and passed along by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-should-make-a-new-pt-style-game-or-maybe-i-will-says-bayonetta-and-devil-may-cry-creator-hideki-kamiya">IGN</a>. "[I]f it's impossible to resurrect P.T., Kojima should make a new game in the same style," Kamiya wrote, adding: "if Kojima doesn't do it, maybe I'll give it a go. I hate horror though, so it wouldn't be horror... plus, I have no ideas."</p><p>I'm propagating Kamiya's bullshit because it's an excuse to start a comments thread discussion about P.T. If you never played it, allow me to sum it up the same way I summed it up to some party guests back in 2014, after they had the insolence to defeat me at Scrabble: there is an L-shaped corridor, and all you have to do is exit through the other end. My guests left that night white-faced and falsetto, shortly after getting the initial radio puzzle wrong. That'll learn the bastards to pop a cheeky "Quoth" on a triple-word tile.</p>
<p>P.T. may be long gone, and also, never actually released on PC, but it has spawned many imitators. There are the fullscale fan clones knocked together in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-course-somebody-recreated-pt-in-vr-using-half-life-alyx">the Half-Life: Alyx engine</a> and, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pt-is-even-creepier-as-an-old-macintosh-game">Hypercard</a>, and also, chilly apartment tours like <a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com/app/devotion">Devotion</a> that apply something of the same claustrophobia.</p>
<p>Swivelling back to Kamiya in closing, the absolute best thing that can come of all this foolery is for Kojima to respond to Kamiya on Twitter, so that Kamiya can block him immediately. Kamiya does so love doing that.</p>
<p>Further reading: Philippa Warr's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horror-games-silent-hill-2">very old ruminations about trying to get into horror</a>. Fortunately for Pip, Alice O (also RPS in peace) found a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/qt-is-pt-but-cute-see-and-its-free">cute version of P.T. in 2019</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-car-cloud-gaming-lg-kia-2000624462</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98everything-is-an-xbox%E2%80%99-crusade-is-coming-for-your-car.1292856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft wants to turn your car <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-vr-game-pass-price-handheld-1851784984">into an Xbox, too</a>. Not content just to stream Game Pass to your TV, laptop, or smartphone, it’s also aiming to beam hits like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> directly into your Kia Sportage. Microsoft and LG announced a new partnership on Tuesday to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to over 20 million internet-connected vehicles by 2030. Who’s ready to play <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> in the back of their Uber?</p> <p>“Our work with LG is the latest example of Xbox expanding to new places, building on partnerships that already bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to mobile devices, PCs, and TVs,” Xbox marketing VP Christopher Lee <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/09/xbox-cloud-gaming-vehicles-cars-lg/">said in a blog post</a>.&nbsp;“By adding vehicles to the mix, we’re giving players more choice than ever in how they enjoy their games.”</p>  <p>The initiative only pertains to EVs that support LG’s webOS Automotive Content Platform (ACP) which at this point is primarily Kia and mostly not in the U.S. But LG exec Eun Seok-hyun is promising there will be 20 million of these vehicles on the road&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em> in the next five years. Whether that includes the country where Microsoft is headquartered or not will depend on whether Congress ever revives the electric vehicle tax credit program it recently killed. Otherwise anyone who wants to make their car into an Xbox will have to do it <a href="https://xboxfreedom.com/xbox-360-game-car-installation-2265">the old-fashioned way</a>.</p> <p>Xbox’s recent pivot to being hardware-agnostic comes as it’s developing dedicated gaming OS layers for Windows on PC handhelds and bringing more of its exclusives to PS5 and Switch 2. It’s unclear if that will move the needle much on the overall growth of Game Pass, which hasn’t announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-game-pass-xbox-podcast-date-1851261824">new subscriber numbers in over a year</a>. This new campaign to turn cars into Xboxes comes just as Microsoft announces <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774414/microsoft-return-to-office-policy-announcement">a mandatory return</a> to the office for all employees within a 50-mile radius of its Redmond campus. Now they’ll have something new to do while sitting in traffic, at least eventually.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s home for you? For much of my childhood, the back of a station wagon on the road between wherever the Navy stationed my old man. Then it was Florida. After I escaped, it was a small apartment in New York, then a slightly bigger apartment, and finally, a house. We tend to define ourselves by where we live at any given time, our memories of a time, of who we were, of the people who made those moments memorable, tied with a cord of steel to a specific place, for both good and ill. People fight for their homes. They rebuild after wars, famine, natural disasters. They preserve places, because those places are a part of us. What wouldn’t you do for your home, your community? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I haven’t played a ton of Octopath Traveler 0 yet, but from the jump I know the ideas of home and community were core to Square’s latest entry in the venerated HD-2D series. That’s probably because the first thing I did was build a house. Octopath Traveler 0 is a revenge story. See, your hometown of Wishvale was destroyed, and you’re (understandably) real mad about it, so you set out to get them who wronged you and restore Wishvale to its former glory. That means literally rebuilding the town, so that was the first thing I did.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Octopath Traveler 0 Nintendo Direct July 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Octopath Traveler 0’s townbuilding is honestly pretty neat. <em>[Editor's Note: We have since learned that the size of your town will have </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-platform-specs-reveal-town-size-limitations-on-some-devices">different limitations depending on which platform you're playing on</a><em>.]</em> I’m the kind of guy who spent a lot of his time in Age of Empires building beautiful cities, so it clicked with me immediately. You can build houses and other buildings of different design, assign who’s going to live where, make cobblestone paths, plant flowers and place benches, craft gardens to tend to, and find just the right place for storage crates to hold the lumber and other materials you’ll need to make stuff. There’s also trees, wells, chests, and all kinds of other things, and there’s plenty of freedom to make the town you want.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I appreciated the joy (and serenity) of building a neat little town.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But rebuilding Wishvale is only part of it. You can also do stuff in town, too, like cook food that you can use later and chat with the townspeople, and even upgrade the buildings for additional functionality. It’s pretty neat, and even though I only spent about ten or so minutes with it, I appreciated the joy (and serenity) of building a neat little town.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After that, it was time for a more traditional Octopath experience. My assigned protagonist, who is the only character that can change classes in Octopath Traveler 0, and seven of his closest buddies were in the sandy town of Sunshade looking for a merchant named Ludo. The long and short of it was that we needed a merchant to help us establish trade. After my buddy Phenn put his foot in his mouth and mistook Ludo for some random kid, which went about as well as you’d expect, he turned us down flat. Not because he was still mad, but because Wishvale had been destroyed before. Why do business with a town that couldn’t protect itself?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Ludo made us a deal: if we took out the pack of lizardmen that had been terrorizing the new trade route, he’d consider helping us out. With no other options before us and a love for our town as motivation, my merry band set out to do just that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was only one problem. As we made our way out of Sunshade, I saw a woman hanging out by herself. When I preview a game, I try to play it like I would if I were playing normally. And years of JRPG-playing have taught me that if you see someone, you should chat with them. So we sauntered on over. The woman in question asked to see my protagonist’s ring. A little weird, but okay. After admiring it, she asked if she could keep it. Uh oh. I knew where this was going, but there was no way out of it. I said no, and then she said she’d take it from us anyway. Cue fight.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/octo1-1757372112185.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where I got my first glimpse of Octopath Traveler 0’s combat system. If you’re played the previous two Octopaths, you know how 0 works. Essentially, your job is to find out what attacks your opponent is weak against, use those to wear down their defenses until they break, and then use limited boosts to charge up your attacks and lay on the hurt while they’re vulnerable. It’s a good system, but 0 adds a couple of unique twists on top of that. First, like I said earlier, the protagonist is the only one who can change their class. Everyone else comes with their class, and it doesn’t change. Like Henry Ford said about the Model T, “you can have it in any color you want as long as it’s black.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The other big change is the ability to swap characters from your front to your back line at will. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big change is the ability to swap characters from your front to your back line at will. Characters in the back line can’t attack, but they regain health and skill points every turn. So if someone's taking a beating, it’s probably a good idea to swap them to the back line and let them catch their breath. This required more micromanaging on my part, but when I got the hang of it, it reminded me of getting into a groove when you’re bowling and everything you throw is a strike. You just <em>flow</em>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/octo2-1757372159854.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The other benefit of this system is that, because every character comes with their own boost charges, you have a lot more opportunities for big damage when you finally break someone’s defenses. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. I spent so long on the Woman Who Really Wanted My Ring that I was beginning to worry I wouldn’t have enough time to play the actual demo I’d been sent here to play. But eventually, she went down and I sprinted off to deal with the lizardmen, who were holed up in some nearby ruins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These fights went much more smoothly. After my would-be Ring Thief, a bunch of lizards who walk on two legs wasn’t that big of a deal. Through it all, I was impressed by how fast Octopath managed to feel without ever sacrificing how good its tactical gameplay feels. I was always making interesting decisions, even in more minor fights. And that battle theme had me vibing in my chair as I played.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/octo3-1757372256593.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Then I got to the Lizardmen Leader, who looked like he wandered in out of a Ray Harryhausen joint, and I was like, “Oh.” And man, that fight was tough. He had two minions, a ton of health, and he hit hard. But I stuck to what had gotten me to the dance. I found his weaknesses, exploited them, and when his defense was broken, I hit him with boosted attacks or a flashy Ultimate Technique. I wanted to pour it on as much as I could before he could shore up his defenses again. It wasn’t easy; several of my party members fell, and I had to use my items to bring them back, but he hit the floor just as my demo wrapped. Oh, and we earned the respect of Ludo, who followed up and stepped in to help when things looked bleak. Put one on the board for the good guys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I put my controller down, I was really impressed with Octopath Traveler 0. Its combat feels like a step above its already excellent predecessors, it still has that gorgeous HD-2D look, and the soundtrack is fantastic based on what I’ve heard so far. All of those things are great, and I hope the whole game is as good as the little slice I got to sample, but honestly, the thing that stuck with me was Wishvale. Often, RPGs have enormous stakes. The fate of the world is on your shoulders. Here, I was just trying to rebuild my village and punish the people responsible for what happened to it. I like how much smaller that focus is, how much more intimate. Maybe it doesn’t stay that way. But as far as motivations go, fighting for your home is a good one, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t interested in rebuilding Wishvale when the time comes.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/in-octopath-traveler-0-revenge-is-a-dish-best-served-in-hd-2d]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/see-how-big-silksong-really-is-with-igns-interactive-map.1292838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Silksong's map dwarfs Hollow Knight in comparison.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you thought Hollow Knight's depths were vast, Hollow Knight: Silksong easily surpasses the original game. Team Cherry's long-awaited and highly anticipated sequel takes place in Pharloom, a new location that completely dwarfs the original in scope. We've visualized the difference and built a Silksong interactive map so you can explore it yourself at your own pace without getting completely lost.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Big is Silksong? Map Size Compared to Hollow Knight</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When you first dive into Silksong, its map might not feel much different from Hollow Knight's; both have many locations to discover and plenty of hidden areas and tunnels begging to be explored. But when you look closer, you realize just how dense Silksong is in comparison.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/09/silkmap-vs-hollowmap-1757424043958.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Silksong's map (left) vs. Hollow Knight's map (right)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight features around 15 distinct areas across the Hallownest. By comparison, Silksong's Pharloom features <strong>around 29 distinct areas</strong>, almost doubling the map size. When viewed at the same scale, as shown in our image above, Silksong's map (left) is clearly much denser and taller, with stacked vertical layers and endless sprawling passages and tunnels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More areas means more to do, meaning the larger world of Silksong brings a much longer playtime than Hollow Knight, over 200 enemies, and tougher bosses to defeat. Exploration feels much deeper too, with vertical paths that put your navigation (and jumping) skills to the test. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you enjoyed the sense of discovery in Hollow Knight, Pharloom promises even more out-of-the-way quests and plenty of secrets tucked into hidden corners, though this means it's easier to get lost in, especially when trying to track down collectibles or side quests.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Explore Pharloom With IGN's Silksong Interactive Map</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/hollow-knight-silksong/pharloom"><strong>IGN's Silksong interactive map</strong></a> comes in, an essential companion tool for any player looking to explore the world of Pharloom.

Toggle the Boss filter to see exactly where they are. Hunting down side quests? Switch on the Wish and NPC filters to reveal quest and character locations. If you're tracking down collectibles, we have an entire section for that, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Mask_Shard_(Health_Upgrade)_Locations"><strong>Mask Shards</strong></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Lost_Flea_Locations"><strong>Lost Fleas</strong></a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our built-in checklist system lets you mark off your progress as you play right from the map itself, turning it into a living guide. Finished a quest? Check it off. Unlocked a new Tool or Crest? Mark it as complete. The map automatically updates as you go and saves your progress, so you always know what's next on your adventure through Pharloom.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hollow Knight: Silksong Guides</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While our Silksong interactive map is an indisposable tool for your adventure, it can't answer every burning question you may have.

                <p>Pablo Sanchez fans, rejoice. After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-is-back-but-were-not-sure-exactly-how-yet/1100-6525954/" data-ref-id="1100-6525954">reviving the Backyard Sports name</a> and releasing three games in the quirky and cartoony series, publisher Playground Productions has launched Backyard Football '99 on Steam and mobile platforms. As with the original release, the football game stars a colorful cast of child athletes, along with younger versions of actual NFL legends.</p><p>Real-life players Barry Sanders, Dan Marino, Drew Bledsoe, Jerry Rice, John Elway, Randall Cunningham, and Steve Young are once again in the Backyard Football roster, though this modern remaster notably lacks Brett Favre. Developer Mega Cat Studios ended up replacing Favre with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2J9qBR1erE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original character Chase Downfield</a>, which marks the first time these remasters have introduced a new kid.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVqWQf22CCI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FVqWQf22CCI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While most of the kiddified professional football players are back, the game lacks any imagery or references to the NFL. The original 1999 release of Backyard Football let players use actual NFL team names, logos, and colors. Instead, players can form teams like the Labrador Receivers, the Dirty Socks, or the Ticklish Tornados. Interestingly, Backyard Baseball '01, which was released on Steam in July, includes MLB teams and references.</p><p>But despite being bereft of Brett Favre and any NFL iconography, Backyard Football '99 should still prove to be a familiar and nostalgic romp for those who played the original game on CD-ROM thanks to its faithful visuals and audio.</p><p>"Backyard Football ‘99 made me a football fan for life. From learning plays to managing teams, this game made football accessible, fun, and exciting for all ages," said CEO of Playground Productions Lindsay Barnett in a press release marking the remaster's release. "I am so proud to bring it back in time for football season."</p><p>Next up for Playground Productions and Backyard Sports are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-continues-comeback-with-five-more-titles-on-the-way/1100-6527118/" data-ref-id="1100-6527118">re-releases of Backyard Basketball '01</a> and Backyard Hockey '02, though there are no announced release dates for either title yet.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the continued popularity of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, and how it's leaking out all over various forms of media and pop culture, every day, there's someone experiencing their first game of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. If no one in your group has played before there have been Starter Sets that are a decent place to start, but with the release of <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em>, there's now a <em>best</em> place to start.</p>

<h2>What's In The <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> Box?</h2>

<p>Inside the <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> Box a DM will be able to find:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Four Booklets: 1 for the basic rules (essentially taken from the<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56eebec3-a321-4403-b71c-54e4edf91d0c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow"> 2024 DMG</a>), and three Adventure Booklets (One for the Keep, one for the Borderlands, and one for the Caves of Chaos)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Character sheets for Cleric, Rogue, Wizard, and Fighter from levels 1-3 (including two different sub-class options)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Game Cards for spells, equipment, magic items, NPCs, Monsters, and more</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Tokens to represent players, monsters, and unique terrain</li>
	<li aria-level="1">18 maps including overworld maps as well as battle and dungeon maps</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Handouts related to shopping locations and key NPC interactions</li>
	<li aria-level="1">A set of 11 dice (the core polyhedral set with one extra D20 and three extra D6)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">A pad of Combat Initiative Tracking sheets</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Four plastic ziplock sleeves (for keeping player cards together for extended games)</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-box-contents.jpg?itok=OmS9W7aD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-box-contents.jpg?itok=oXUKgPrA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I was blown away by just how much was in the box. Having learned to play D&amp;D myself with the Mines of Phandelver starter kit I was all too familiar with how much there can be to learn, how information can be spread all throughout the rules and adventure books, and trying to 'prepare' could have you pulling information from all over the place.</p>

<p>Splitting out all of the relevant information among cards, it creates a more component-heavy experience, but splits up the learning and the onus of having that knowledge among all of the players and doesn't just rely on the GM to take on everything.</p>

<p>The best way that I can think to describe it is that by making it more component-heavy, and tweaking things like the character sheet, they've 'board game-ified' Dungeons &amp; Dragons and created an experience that you could just pick up and run on a whim.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-cleric-character-sheet.jpg?itok=wYPSIAOj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-cleric-character-sheet.jpg?itok=DvUXByjZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Including monster and terrain tokens alongside maps feels like a more sensible approach to an official way to start playing as opposed to purchasing a Starter Set and then also picking up something like a Campaign Case. This feels like the evolved form of them all.</p>

<h2>Creating Your Character</h2>

<p>The character sheet for <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> has been completely redesigned to be as beginner-friendly as possible and to work in conjunction with the card system that has been developed.</p>

<p>In front of the player, they'll be able to see each of their abilities and the modifying values (organized by stat and not alphabetically), stats such as speed, initiative, and HP, and their class features. To the right of their sheet, a player also has an indicated space for their species and background cards to be played.</p>

<p>Taking up the center of the card is space for players to place their equipment cards or stack up their spell cards. Within each of these spaces, you'll see recommendations for equipment as well as rules relevant to that space on your player board.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-character-sheet-wizard.jpg?itok=vqOBf1FD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-character-sheet-wizard.jpg?itok=2VlP8DEy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The last part of putting together your character is collecting the required health, ability, and gold tokens to have a visual representation of these components on your board. As a player, you likely won't ever need to pick up a pen to note something or keep track of your stats and abilities.</p>

<p>Placing your starting equipment on your player board, you can immediately understand the capabilities of your character, how to hit something or deal damage, how many uses you have of any ability, and understand how class features, species, and background can all work interchangeably.</p>

<p>Spellcasters have the added bonus of having cards for each of their spells. The back of each card features the full rules for a spell, while the front gives quick information such as the range and area of effect. For spells that call on a cone, or a magical effect in a range centered on the player, there's even a diagram showing you how it will work.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-spell-cards.jpg?itok=dfxh4IqQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-spell-cards.jpg?itok=fnnhyvBy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These spell cards have already been getting pulled out again for my regular home games</figcaption></figure><p>While there will be a learning curve, going from this sheet to a normal character sheet or a digital D&amp;D Beyond sheet, for a beginner with no prior knowledge, this character sheet is clear and approachable.</p>

<p>The only part of this character sheet that I can really fault is the health tokens. Gold, which is spent less frequently, makes the exchange of tokens fun, and the ability tokens moving off or returning to the board is easy enough, but swapping out HP tokens can be a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>I would have loved to have seen some kind of sliding tracker. Letting you move a HP token up and down your maximum health bar for the side of the character sheet you were on. It would have saved some time swapping out a 5hp token for 3hp tokens, only for the character to drink a potion and need more tokens again.</p>

<p>The new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Starter Set puts a party of four and their Dungeon Master in the Borderlands. This is an update of the setting from the 1979 <em>D&amp;D</em> adventure, <em>Keep on the Borderlands</em>. Time has moved on, and it's a good, setting-agnostic location to branch out and explore more of the world after getting comfortable with what's in the book.</p>

<p>In the Keep booklet, you'll have multiple locations for your party to visit in town. These can be roleplay locations, like the chapel or shops, to acquire new goods at. To further assist in shopping, you'll also find handouts for the different items on sale.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-adventure-and-rule-books.jpg?itok=vcFfK_nS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-adventure-and-rule-books.jpg?itok=d83b0jqy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each location has an NPC to meet and an odd job that they might be recruited for. These jobs will test not only players' roleplaying skills, but also prompt them for a variety of skill checks. While simple, these checks serve as a built-in tutorial for what you can do with your different abilities.</p>

<p>The Wilderness book provides you with some random travel encounters. These are a mix of combat and roleplay, and it's also where you'll find the combat tutorials for players. Easing them into gameplay with a combat encounter on the side of a road.</p>

<p>The final book is for a series of caves that each act as a mini-dungeon with a theme. It might be goblins, cultists, spiders, or really any other staple Dungeons &amp; Dragons monster that inhabits them. Each adventure is a short series of rooms with combat and exploration so it's easy to get in and out of with very little notice.</p>

<p>There is definitely a downside to not having a planned and structured adventure like the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a96fb387-895f-4837-9061-7bbd56e12239" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/phandelver-and-below-shattered-obelisk-review-not-quite-sure-what-it-wants-to-be" rel="nofollow"><em>Mines of Phandelver,</em></a> but the upside is that <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> has more than enough content for planned mini-adventures and to teach all of the basics for a party to understand what kind of adventure they might be into before they set out on a larger adventure.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-tutorial-for-dm.jpg?itok=YEBOfBm0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-tutorial-for-dm.jpg?itok=7Z8LUYoZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Dungeon Master Assistance For First Timers</h2>

<p>For a new DM running a game can be a somewhat daunting task. There's a few ways that I think this Starter Set tackles things fantastically.</p>

<p>The first is in the separation of the information across quick to reference cards. You'll reach a new place at the Keep, or a new dungeon, and the book will inform you of exactly what NPC cards, monsters, etc you'll need. You can keep them to the side, all with their relevant information, and you never need to be flipping through a book or trying to determine what to do next.</p>

<p>The other way that these adventures make being a DM easy is by maintaining a bite-sized approach. There isn't any grand story that will take the party from level 1-5, but there's roleplay to perform at the Keep, random encounters to have in the Wilderness, and then a plethora of caves that act as multi-room dungeons.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-random-encounters.jpg?itok=ABgLUbRd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-random-encounters.jpg?itok=JjS5FUTq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Because each encounter or setting has only about a page worth of information no matter where the party goes you'll never need to read much to stay ahead of them.</p>

<p>This bite-sized information also means that each session can be ~2 hours without needing much prep time, and the role of DM can rotate around the table. You might have DM'd for Caves A and G, but that doesn't mean you know what's going on in Cave E when it's your turn to be a player.</p>



<p>This box set is absolutely the way anyone new should be getting into D&amp;D. The massive benefits that this has is a large number of bite-sized adventures, a unique approach to character creation and stat tracking that creates a more casual experience, and the lack of a need to do any major prep.</p>

<p>The only recommendation I'd make for players is organize a different way to track health so that you aren't worrying about moving a whole bunch of health tokens around.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-dungeon-exploration.jpg?itok=yyzrK5jw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-dungeon-exploration.jpg?itok=GOAOBzaY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>By the nature of the shorter adventures and mini-dungeons you won't get the same sweeping narrative as you might in the other Starter Sets or full Adventure Books but by playing <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> with your friends you'll be able to solve the basic questions of finding out who wants to be the longer term Dungeon Master, and what type of adventure/playstyle you're most interested in.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> opens <em>D&amp;D</em> up to being a casual game night endeavor where any group of up to five friends can casually create some characters, and run through a micro-dungeon with next to no prep necessary.</p>

<p>While the cost has increased compared to previous Starter Sets it's well worth it with so many tokens, reference cards, and maps that you can continue to use time and time again.</p>

Golly, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a bit hard, 'ey? I'm not here to feed into that discourse right now, you've probably seen enough of that on Bluesky and in the comments of YouTube videos about the top 10 things you missed in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>. No, instead I'm here to tell you that things could be much, much worse apparently, as it turns out an entire difficulty mode is hidden within the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> for you to unlock.
</p>
<p>
That might be music to the ears of those of you who are struggling a bit with the game (no judgement here, the game's tough). Unfortunately, this one isn't your tune, as the hidden difficulty mode actually makes the game harder, almost impossibly so. It's called Steel Soul mode, and the rules are pretty simple: "No reviving. Death is permanent." Great! Exactly what I want from a game where I've already died 10,000 times.
</p>
<p>
Unlocking the mode is, as discovered by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1n8d1xc/cheat_code_discovery_not_joke/">Reddit user Buttnugtaster</a> (no relation), monumentally easy compared to the rest of the game. All you have to do is head into the Extras menu, then input the following: up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right. You'll get a flash on the screen, and if you try to start a new save file you'll find Steel Soul as an option. I've checked this myself and it does work, and no, I did not start a new save. My experience of this mode will be entirely limited to watching someone inevitably attempt it at Games Done Quick.
</p>
<p>
While there is no easy mode in the game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/teamcherry">Team Cherry</a> did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">outline an upcoming patch earlier today</a> that promises to make a few bits of the game like a couple of boss fights a smidge more forgiving. At least those of us who beat Moorwing already have bragging rights.

<p>Nintendo also accused Genki of "extensive use of Nintendo trademarks" in association with their unlicensed products, a move that "exploit[ed] and appropriate[d] for [Genki] the public goodwill associated with... Nintendo Switch marks."</p>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2069738"><p>
              The Switch 2 mockup Genki showed in a CES video ended up matching very closely with the final console as released.

      </figure>

<p>The lawsuit also dealt in part with conflicting reports that Genki may have had "unauthorized, illegal early access to the Nintendo Switch 2," as Nintendo put it. <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1877968-la-nintendo-switch-2-se-devoile-en-avant-premiere-au-ces-2025.html">Media reports around CES</a> quoted Genki representatives asserting that their 3D-printed case mockup was based on early access to a real Switch 2 console. But the company later publicly backtracked, <a href="https://x.com/GenkiThings/status/1879642103267164639">writing on social media</a> that "we do not own or possess a black market console, as some outlets have suggested."</p>
<p>In their settlement, Nintendo and Genki simply note that "Genki represents and attests that it didn't obtain any unreleased Nintendo property or documents before the system's official reveal."</p>
<p>The public settlement document doesn't go into detail on the confidential "payment in an agreed-upon amount" that Genki will make to Nintendo to put this matter to rest. But the settlement outlines how Genki is barred from referencing Nintendo trademarks or even parody names like "Glitch" and "Glitch 2" in its future marketing. Under the settlement, packaging for Genki accessories also has to "make clear to consumers Genki’s status as an unlicensed accessory manufacturer" and not mimic the color scheme of official Switch 2 hardware.</p>

It's a game in which you upgrade and repair a station wagon that you drive through a very strange stretch of forest roads in the Pacific Northwest, known in the game as the Olympic Exclusion Zone. It's a game that, at different times, gave me feelings of Stalker, The X-Files, and Remedy's Control, with SCP-like weirdnesses lurking on the roads or in the woods. It wasn't exactly a horror game before, but thanks to its upcoming expansion, Whispers in the Woods, it will be one soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Whispers in the Woods is Pacific Drive's upcoming 8- to 12-hour expansion that gives it a haunting overhaul. It's the game's first "true expansion," Ironwood Studios founder and creative director Cassandra Dracott told me, following a number of patches and content updates since the game debuted in February 2024. It'll be playable from within the base game and focuses on a group of "fanatics" who are obsessed with the game's many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pacific-drive-anomalies-enemies-guide/2900-5089/">anomalies</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pacific Drive - Whispers in the Woods Expansion Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Back when I reviewed the game, it definitely creeped me out, so I've always felt like it was a horror game, but I learned that wasn't everyone's experience.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Pacific Drive] is a story about you and your car, and for some people, driving around in the woods is a very scary experience. But we didn't do a lot to intentionally build on that horror. We just wanted to build on the atmosphere," Dracott said. But the team at Ironwood was influenced by "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-pacific-drive-pulls-off-being-unnervingly-spooky-and-relaxingly-chill-all-at-once/1100-6523113/">how scary the game was for some people</a>," leading to them taking this expansion much farther down that path. "And it felt very natural as well. Like, we built a very atmospheric experience [...] Our game is built on the familiar, right? We have this car. It is your car. You have your garage. It's your space, right? And it's very easy to start to question the safety of, like, 'How alone are you right now?'"</p><p dir="ltr">Dracott explained how the expansion adds a gameplay element called Artifacts, which are "mysterious objects that are left behind by this enigmatic group" that build on top of each other to create new experiences with each trip outside of the warm light of your garage.</p><p dir="ltr">"So it could be something like when you jump, your car horn honks, and we tell you what it is right away. But then you may get another one later that says when the car horn honks, your car takes damage, and they're important for the progression of the expansion, so they play a critical role in how you're making your way through the new areas of the DLC. But holding too many of them causes bad things to happen, and can draw the attraction of some less-than-positive things out in the Zone. And so we want to present players with this choice of, 'Which artifact do I take? Which one interacts with the ones that I already have? Is this too many? Do I want to push my luck?'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4563721-witw_screenshot_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563721" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4563721-witw_screenshot_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563721"></a><figcaption>The motives of the expansion's shadowy group will be explored in the horror DLC.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4563721-witw_screenshot_02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The thing about the original game's anomalies is that they could be harmful and disruptive, but they were more or less naturally occurring elements of the game's weird woods. I wondered if, in the expansion, those types of encounters are being altered to reflect something more like a traditional horror game, such as chase sequences or true "enemies," rather than anomalies that may spell doom, but did so without malice or intention.</p><p dir="ltr">"From a high level, we aren't changing up the structure of how we deliver narrative. So, you know, we are introducing new voiced characters into the game, but they are voices, right? Like that is the primary way that we communicate. We're not reinventing the wheel there--pardon the car pun. But, but there is something out there, and what that is and how alone you really are, I think that's something to leave to the players when they get a chance to check it out. But yeah, I think you're picking up on the right questions."</p><p dir="ltr">Given that some players played Pacific Drive like me--already a bit creeped out--Dracott explained how the team sought to lean into a new-ish genre without abandoning the core gameplay "verbs" of Pacific Drive.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've always been fascinated with any horror that takes something that is comfortable and shifts it," Dracott said. "Comfort is the thing you want to mess with when you start to introduce these elements that can make you nervous, make you afraid, make you not expect the thing that may happen. But at the same time, we do want to change up some of the systems, because we want the players to engage with the game slightly differently, but we're pretty careful about that."</p><p dir="ltr">Dracott said a new anomaly called Harvestmen is a good example of how Whispers in the Woods will walk that line between tweaking older systems and building in new ones.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4563722-witw_screenshot_bonus_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563722" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4563722-witw_screenshot_bonus_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563722"></a><figcaption>If, like me, Pacific Drive already creeped you out before, Whispers in the Woods should only be more unnerving.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4563722-witw_screenshot_bonus_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"[Harvestmen] are part of the resource economy in the expansion, and so you <em>have </em>to go and engage with them," she said. "There is no other way to get the resources that they are connected to. We really did want to double down and focus on saying, 'Okay, let's create some anomalies where the player <em>has </em>to go and engage with them.' And so in that sense, we did change [the game's loop]. And that's a positive change because the car is a story generator. 'Did I forget to put it in park? Is it rolling down the hill?' But the anomalies are multiplicative on that. So, 'Is the abductor grabbing my car and pulling it along? Do I have a leech that is making my lights do funny things?' There are all kinds of different ways [it can go]. So by pushing the player towards anomalies directly, we spice that up. We add more opportunities for those stories."</p><p dir="ltr">Dracott left me to consider who those cloaked figures in the trailer may be, and the broader story implications of driving in the Olympic Exclusion Zone with the sudden emergence of threatening cultists, but I'm happy to make sense of that story myself when the expansion releases later this year. Pacific Drive <em>wasn't</em> a horror game, at least not definitively. <em>At least not until now.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In “Planetary Consciousness,” Alan Moore’s introduction to the 2000s DC comic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_(comics)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Planetary</em></a> by Warren Ellis, the legendary author didn’t just herald a new era of comics—he forecasted a shift in their audience. “The underlying human tastes and audience demands on which we built the comic field have altered in the flux of things, within the readership if not within the books themselves. The way people think and see things has moved on. The massive scaffolding of values where the comic field was raised seems now deserted, seems redundant,” he wrote. Moore argued the medium’s evolution had stagnated, stuck in reverence for idols and stories that once redefined the 20th century. While many creators looked backward for answers, Moore praised <em>Planetary </em>as a rare comic book work that embodied the future by daring to interrogate the medium’s mythology while offering a blueprint for what storytelling could become in the new millennium.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, hindsight, as it’s wont to do, complicates legacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Moore’s prolonged endorsement of <em>Planetary</em>—a comic nevertheless worthy of its accolades—sits uneasily beside the controversy surrounding its writer, Warren Ellis. In 2020, Ellis, who’d written for Marvel, DC Comics, and Netflix’s <em>Castlevania </em>series, was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/warren-ellis-responds-to-accusation-backlash-im-at-the-1847173837?utm_source=gizmodo.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> of a myriad of alleged sexual predatory behaviors by a group of<a href="https://somanyofus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 60 people</a>. Although Ellis later <a href="https://gizmodo.com/warren-ellis-accusers-respond-to-his-image-comics-retur-1847159513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned to the comic book industry</a> the following year at Image Comics, the question still lingers: Can we truly separate the art from the artist when the art continues to shape us?</p><p>The conversation has shifted, as Moore predicted: Readers now struggle to separate the art from the artist as formative creatives like <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/neil-gaiman-allegations-controversy-amanda-palmer-sandman-madoc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neil Gaiman</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-64729304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J.K. Rowling</a> spark debates. Former <em>Destiny </em>writer <a href="https://www.atlasincognita.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Barbiere</a> (<em>Five Ghosts</em>) and <a href="https://morganbeem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morgan Beem</a> (<em>Swamp Thing: Twin Branches</em>) confront this tension head-on in their new Image Comics series, <em>The Author Immortal</em>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image Comics</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://imagecomics.com/press-releases/new-ongoing-fantasy-series-the-author-immortal-to-explore-the-legacy-impact-of-storytelling-this-october" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Author Immortal</em></a><em> </em>tells the tale of Hector Ramire, a failed writer who stumbles upon the chance to reboot a formative fantasy children's book as its co-writer after its original author, Vossler, mysteriously disappears. After discovering that the previous author was spirited away into his own fictional world, Hector and his child, Al, are pulled into the book <a href="https://gizmodo.com/studio-mappas-anime-about-making-anime-is-a-surprisingly-refreshing-isekai-2000546889?utm_source=gizmodo.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isekai-style</a>. While figuring a way out, they must reckon with the sprawling world of living characters who don’t want their stories changed.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world where A.I. threatens to hollow out the soul of storytelling, stories are treated as disposable content with the sole purpose of printing infinite money, and formative creators’ fall from grace forces readers to decide if the art is ever truly separate from them. Beem and Barbiere endeavour not to provide a tidy answer, unpacking artistic messiness one issue at a time. Aftermath spoke with Barbiere about how he and Beem went about approaching their new comic and exploring a subject looming over not just comic books, but every facet of creative works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Penning <em>The Author Immortal</em> was a homecoming for Barbiere to the comic book industry after spending his time with games as a lead writer at Skydance Interactive, writing stories for <em>Darksiders Genesis </em>and <em>Ruined King: A League of Legends Story</em>. While writing a story about writing stories isn’t novel, Barbiere found himself compelled to find his own ground with a metafiction comic that moved him like Mike Carey's artist Peter Gross’ Vertigo comic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unwritten" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Unwritten</em></a>—one of his favorite books of all time—had. However, Barbiere didn’t want to settle for making a poor man’s version of <em>The Unwritten</em>, but to put a spotlight on the eroding trust of stories with readers.</p><p>“It really began with what I think is—forgive my grandiose wording—a generational wound around fallen or cancelled authors of my generation. There are certain people, obviously, <a href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J.K. Rowling</a> is the biggest target, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/10/enders-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orson Scott Card</a> was a big one as well for a lot of people, and presently Neil Gaiman,” Barbiere said. “This idea that these works that resonate so deeply with often smaller, queer communities who are typically not serviced by mainstream comics—especially when speaking of Gaiman—but also people who love fantasy and grew up with these books.</p><p>“Seeing the, quite honestly, heel turn and disgusting behavior of a lot of these people has created a huge rift, I think, in trust of fiction for my generation where it’s, ‘Oh my gosh, these books we believed in that we thought were organic and really spoke to the heart. If their writers are turning out to be these people, what does that mean for the work? What does that mean for me?’” Barbiere said.</p><p>Barbiere has no illusions that <em>The</em> <em>Author Immortal</em> will provide a catch-all solution to readers navigating these muddy waters. “The real goal for stories is for human beings to explore scenarios outside themselves to learn. Basically ‘virtual reality.’ It’s supposed to be a safe space where we can explore different feelings, personas—anything that is not real, and learn from it,” Barbiere said. “That really inspired but saddened me, considering how so many things have gone wrong and how little trusted stories are.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image Comics</span></figcaption></figure><p>Barbiere likened this current phenomenon to an <a href="https://comicbook.com/comicbook/news/surprisingly-honest-hobbit-featurette-explains-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article headline</a> in which director Peter Jackson admitted that <em>The Hobbit</em> wasn’t his best work, which Barbiere called readers relishing tearing down the film trilogy as a validation for their distrust of the creator for being inauthentic and commercial. It’s a sentiment Barbiere senses has gotten all the more exacerbated by the pervasiveness of A.I. encroaching upon creative spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>“‘Can I even trust what I’m reading was written by a human?’That general anxiety led me to want to tell a story to reaffirm what stories are for, what they can do for you, how you can believe in them, and how they’re useful,” he said. “But, in doing so, we need to show the negative up front.”&nbsp;</p><p>Barbiere explains that <em>The Author Immortal</em> confronts its charged topics by showing how even a portal fantasy world isn’t immune to the corruption of real-world problems. Within this realm where teethy ink monsters menace on its readership, Hector and his nonbinary teen, Al, grapple with the lingering influence of stories whose narratives continue to shape their lives long after they’ve been bookended.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image comics</span></figcaption></figure><p>This tension crystallizes around Hector’s co-writer on Vossler’s work, a popular author named Miss Luckwell who is a thinly veiled analogue of a cancelled author in the vein of Rowling. Hector’s offer, while a blank check out of poverty, is uncomfortably fraught for Al. Not only does Hector agreeing to work with Luckwell feel like it’s an endorsement of the Rowling-esque character’s invalidation of Al’s queer existence, as Al wastes no time to point out, but Al is named after Alethea, the protagonist of Vossler’s series that Hector is charged with rebooting.</p><p>“Hector is a character who named his kid after a [character]&nbsp; from a novel, and I'm just so taken by the amount of people I know who have named their kids <em>Game of Thrones</em> characters or, God forbid, <em>Harry Potter </em>characters now,” Barbiere said (making me grimace at my own flirting with naming my future child after Petrichor from <em>Saga</em>). “I was so fascinated by this mega fan who grows into an adult and [tries] to share with his kid his love for this thing that he names them after, and just the irony that [Al doesn’t] care.”</p><p>For Al, the whole arrangement is a personal affront and betrayal by their father, forcing them to confront the painful legacy of a story headfirst by being inside of it and proposing changes to its heroes, who don’t want to surrender control.</p><p>“The story explores the idea of what if you’re ready to move on from certain stories, but they’re not done with you yet,” Barbiere said. “I think we’ve got a little blatant in some of the marketing where it’ll be like ‘some stories will kill’ and very intense things like that, but it really does come from that generational anxiety I feel where we can’t trust people who’ve written works that affect us, and what that means for the future of storytelling.”&nbsp;</p><p>Much of the comic’s central tension is embedded in its title—a deliberate double entendre that Barbiere sees as both ironic and provocative. On one hand, it nods to the notion of “the death of the author,” questioning whether a work truly belongs to its creator once it’s released into the world. On the other hand, it interrogates the idea of artistic immortality itself. Can an author ever wholly vanish from their work, or will their presence linger, haunting its narrative, reception, and legacy long after they’ve passed—inversely allowing the author to live forever, even in infamy? Or perhaps a secret third thing where self and work are redefined by Hector and the characters in <em>The Author Immortal</em>, becoming the authors of their own stories.</p><p>No matter what readers take away from <em>The Author Immortal</em>’s title, Barbiere admits it still gives him a chuckle since it reminds him of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kZBJs527-k&amp;pp=ygUTMzAgcm9jayBydXJhbCBqdXJvcg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>30 Rock</em>’s “Rural Juror” gag</a>. He’s also grateful he locked in after a quick SEO search confirmed no one else had claimed it for a comic, so that designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sievish.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sasha Head</a> could make a beautiful logo on the cover of their comic, and letterer<a href="https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/people/27980/hassan-otsmane-elhaou" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou</a> could give the words that encompass its personality life.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image Comics</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the subject of art design, Barbiere and Beem spoke highly of one another, with Barbiere calling Beem's art a constant inspiration and Beem, in turn, praising Barbiere’s ability to write flawed, real characters for her to play around with through her titular, dreamlike watercolor art throughout the comic. After reaching out to Beem, remembering her work on <em>Swamp Thing</em>, Barbiere’s idea for <em>The Author Immortal</em> expanded from a straight fantasy to a tale that more confidently explored a character-focused take on its premise. Along the way, Barbiere recalls answering Beem’s creative prayers coming off Sarah Miller’s YA book <em>You Belong Here</em>, to depart from drawing so many hallways and characters in an otherwise great book and “have some fun with monsters or something crazy.”</p><p>“Morgan's character acting on the page is phenomenal,” Barbiere said. “Some people struggle when they get into [comic book writing] because if they overly visualize, the art can look wrong to them. I love just being surprised and, without sounding narcissistic, so much of Morgan's acting makes me laugh on the page and makes me smile. She really brings it to life. It's been such a joy and inspiration to me. It really does help me find the characters when we see them, and I see their acting and how Morgan renders them, and just the amount of design she's doing on the page.”</p><p>Barbiere notes that many fellow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator_ownership_in_comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creator-owned authors</a> fall into the trap of hastily jumping into action in the first issue trade, rather than allowing the story to develop and unfold naturally. With <em>The Author Immortal</em>, it was paramount for Barbiere to do justice to establishing its characters and world instead of blitzing toward its anime-esque isekai gimmick.&nbsp;</p><p>“There's a version of this book where they get isekai’d on page five and immediately thrust into the fantasy world,” he said. “I wanted to really take our time, set up the characters, but keep it urgent enough that it’s not just like ‘We see 10 years of their lives before we jump in.’”</p><p>Thankfully, <em>The Author Immortal</em>’s first issue being 40 pages, Barbiere says, allows him and Beem to give readers time to understand who the characters are without languishing in a setup before its big cliffhanger grabs readers to its story. Should the series catch fire, Barbiere assures prospective readers he and Beem have issue four already wrapped up to keep the story going for as long as folks want to read it.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m very thankful that we have so much that we don’t even really get to in the first five issues that we’re ready to get to in the next arc—a lot of cool world building and history those first five pages flashing back to Vossler hint at,” Barbiere said. “We hope people are excited to find out about it.”&nbsp;</p><p>In a market flooded with legacy sequels and algorithm-friendly nostalgia, Barbiere and Beem’s book asks a bigger question: Who do stories truly belong to—the author’s catharsis or the reader’s transformation?</p><p>“‘What does it mean to have a story that changes your life?’” Barbiere said. “I think it’s something that people say very casually or talk about in hyperbolic ways, but we want to show characters who that actually happened for, for good and bad, and learn to recontextualize [those stories’ authors] in terms of ‘Am I doing damage with this? Is my obsession with trying to be famous or trying to leave behind work that is going to hopefully live beyond me a good thing or a bad thing? Have I indirectly blessed or cursed someone with it?’ And then, also fictionalizing it: ‘Can this be weaponized through magic? Can this be weaponized through the collective unconscious? What does that look like?’”</p><p>“That's the stuff that drives me as a creator and something that very much has been, I think, on everyone's mind. Looking at some of the modern thoughts on Death of the Author, what does it mean that we have work we want to divorce from creators? Do we abandon it? Do we continue it? What can we take from it? It’s different for every single person,” Barbiere said. “Our book does not offer answers to these difficult questions as much as explore them and, hopefully, characterize them, because it’s not gonna be me finger-wagging at you to act one way or another. But I think having that as the spine of our book and this idea of legacy in the dimension of creative work in children, in terms of how you affect the world you leave behind, is really fascinating.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image Comics</span></figcaption></figure><p>Barbiere hopes that <em>The Author Immortal</em> will prove to be a work that signals a ripple effect, not just for the reader, but for the industry at large, which decides what stories get told and what stories get buried. As a creator who was burned out doing a lot of books, who was scripting video game narratives and comic book tales as dream projects before it all started to homogenize into a mechanical job where he’d have to pitch new ideas every four months, Barbiere said <em>The Author Immortal</em> was an opportunity for him to take a chance on writing something new that endeavors to tell a tale all his own without regurgitating the echoes from those that came before.</p><p>Barbiere compared the experience of writing a metanarrative tale about making art to that of a touring band’s second album, which often reflects the band's experiences on the road and the wildness of their lives. Barbiere hopes <em>The Author Immortal</em> comforts readers afflicted by how they should navigate appreciating or abandoning a work when the faults of their creators overshadow the merit of their creation’s messaging. All the better for it if it catches the eye of lapsed fantasy comic book readers in a sea of big-tent superhero legacy comic series.&nbsp;</p><p>“I hope the book succeeds, but I hope it shows that there's more space here, like that's what I love about working at Image and love a lot about smaller publishers who are taking a chance on genres that didn’t necessarily do as well in the direct market. There were years when people said you can't do sci-fi, you can't do westerns, or you can't do romance, but I think we've hopscotched past that,” Barbiere said. “I'm hoping that we can fill that void and live in that literary fantasy corner that a lot of mainstream books don't have, and certainly, don't do monthly anymore. Remind people that there's an audience for that, and, hopefully, capture some lapsed comic readers who maybe came in with <em>Saga </em>or <em>Monstress </em>back when Image was really bringing things out and give people an opportunity to come in on the ground floor.”</p><p><em>The Author Immortal</em> releases in local comic book shops as well as digital platforms on October 1.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/linda-bae-doona-gkids-james-iha"><h3>Linda Linda Linda Is Good Good Good</h3></a><p>Like a rat, I want to be beautiful, because there’s a kind of beauty that can’t be photographed</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-launch-gta-vi-elden-ring"><h3>All-Consuming Event Releases Like Silksong Are Growing Fewer And Further Between</h3></a><p>"Silksong and then GTA VI coming up are the two big launches that almost feel like the end of the big launch"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/football-manager-26-fm26-sports-interactive-womens-league-wsl-nwsl"><h3>More Sports Games Should Take A Year Off</h3></a><p>It gives you the time to, for example, add around 35,000 new players to a game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser"><h3>10 Months In The Making, Play For Peace Bundle Launches To Raise Money for Palestinian Aid</h3></a><p>‘It was important that our charity's proceeds directly went to Palestinian relief efforts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oxo-rapid-brewer-coffee-espresso-soup-shots"><h3>The OXO Rapid Brewer Is Great For Coffee And Better For ‘Soup’</h3></a><p>The OXO Brew Rapid Brewer is a fantastic portable coffee brewer.

<p>This is the first year that Nintendo has had a Pikmin booth at the event, and it'll also (according to the press release), offer "a variety of special Decor Pikmin seedlings, including a Mario Hat Pikmin and the elusive Fortune Pikmin normally available only near shrines and temples in Japan, which can be collected in app by walking to predefined areas within Trafalgar Square."</p>
<p>As well as the main walking challenge within Pikmin Bloom, the stall itself will also have an AR photobooth, where you get to capture a photo and video with some Pikmin for a digital souvenir. Hooray!</p>
<p>For those taken with the idea, Pikmin Bloom is free to download from both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/pikmin-bloom/id1556357398">Apple App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pikmin&amp;pli=1">Google Play Store</a>, and leading into the London event from 9th-30th September, you can ‘Walk Together with Japan Matsuri’ in a Pikmin Bloom Party Walk in-game.</p>

<p>Oh, and before we go, the most important information! The Pikmin Bloom Special In-App Challenge will take place at the following place and time, so make sure to get to it if you want to take part:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location: London Trafalgar Square, North Terrace</strong></li>
<li><strong>Date: Sunday September 21st, 2025</strong></li>
<li><strong>Time: 10am – 8pm</strong></li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/circana-reveals-best-selling-playstation-games-of-all-time.1292748/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the original PlayStation's 30th anniversary today (for the US release, at the very least), and US sales analysis firm Circana has compiled a list of the brand's best-selling games since 1995 by way of celebration.</p>

<p>As always, we have the ever-reliable Mat Piscatella to thank for sharing this data on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyftys4rhk2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, and the list he's compiled is an interesting one, although you probably won't be too surprised by a lot of the names you see.</p>

<p>Obviously, eternal moneyspinner&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>tops the chart; it is, after all, a release that spans three PlayStation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-ps5-and-xbox-series-details-revealed" rel="nofollow">generations</a>, and given the massive popularity of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>as a franchise (as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" rel="nofollow">previously-reported sales figures</a> for the game),&nbsp;<em>GTA V</em>'s presence probably won't shock you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-v-playstation-top-selling-games-30th-anniversary.jpg?itok=ndeqnTh8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-v-playstation-top-selling-games-30th-anniversary.jpg?itok=FsekQJV6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surprise surprise,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>is PlayStation's best-selling game of all time.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Piscatella's data, there are no games from the original PlayStation era on the top 20 list, and only three were released on the PlayStation 2. Two of those are&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>titles as well, namely&nbsp;<em>San Andreas&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Vice City</em>, while the third is&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em>.</p>

<p>All of the others are PlayStation 3 releases or later. In second place, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare" rel="nofollow">the 2019 version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, with third place going to&nbsp;another Rockstar game in the form of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/red-dead-redemption-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a>.</p>

<p>Places four through six are occupied by&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>releases as well, and blocky sandbox hit&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" rel="nofollow">Minecraft</a>&nbsp;</em>is in seventh. Rounding out the top ten are&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em>, then the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>San Andreas&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero III</em>.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that all of this is based on dollar sales; the unit sales column looks a little different, but there still aren't any original PlayStation games on it, and even fewer PS2 games appear on the unit sales list.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/red-dead-redemption-ii-playstation-top-selling-games.jpg?itok=ezPXSg0o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/red-dead-redemption-ii-playstation-top-selling-games.jpg?itok=i8S4iXog 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rockstar makes several appearances on Circana's PlayStation best-seller list.</figcaption></figure><p>It also happens to be the Sega Dreamcast's 26th birthday today, and to celebrate, Piscatella has compiled <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyfu44xius2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a list</a> of that platform's top 20 best-selling games in the US as well.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, when it comes to dollar sales,<i>&nbsp;Sonic Adventure&nbsp;</i>doesn't top the chart (although it does top the unit sales list). That honor goes to&nbsp;<em>NFL 2K</em>, with successor&nbsp;<em>NFL 2K1&nbsp;</em>taking second place (followed by&nbsp;<em>Sonic Adventure</em>, naturally).</p>

<p>The Dreamcast may be dead, but many of the franchises on Piscatella's list, including&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shenmue</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo" rel="nofollow">even&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em></a>, are still around today. Both lists are well worth a look if you want to take a trip down memory (card) lane.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How much champagne do you charge to the company credit card when <em>GTA 6</em> mercifully shifts out of your release window? Which celebrity will star in <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>? And what game are <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s devs working on next? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>People are buzzing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/">about <em>Jump Space</em></a>, the sci-fi co-op adventure about blowing up spaceships with friends. It comes to Early Access next week and already has an impressive <a href="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1965398533546160523">post-launch roadmap</a> of updates lined up. How many more cool ship games will we get before<em> Starfield</em>‘s <a href="https://nitter.poast.org/StarfieldGame/status/1963980745728229522#m">next expansion arrives</a>?</p> <h2>It was a good day in the Sucker Punch offices when <em>GTA 6</em> delayed</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a> is one of the biggest game releases of the fall, at least now that <em>GTA 6</em> has been delayed to May 2026. Creative director Nate Fox was asked about that moment in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOTS1CkZVg">new rapid-fire interview with <em>MinnMax </em></a>(via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/that-was-a-great-day-ghost-of-yotei-studio-screative%20director%20Nate%20Fox"><em>VGC</em></a>). “When<em> GTA 6</em> was delayed, did the entire studio pop some champagne?” host Ben Hanson asked. “We’re all still hungover. Multi-month hangover,” Fox responded. “That was a great day.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-release-date-gta-6-collector-edition-1851777437"><em>Yotei</em>‘s October 2 release date</a> was announced before Rockstar revealed its delay, locking in its fate one way or the other. Fortune favors the bold. Now lots of games that were waiting to come out until 2026 to escape <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-aaaaa-silksong-next-gen-pc-devolver-digital-2000623190">the<em> GTA 6</em> gravity</a> well are faced with a new conundrum: get out ahead of it or come out later in the year and risk stumbling into a second <em>GTA 6</em> delay?</p> <h2 data-cy="article-headline"><em>Helldivers</em>&nbsp;studio’s next game will have a <em>Destiny</em>-style social hub</h2> <p>But what is it, exactly? Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani seemed to be speaking off the cuff when he responded to a fan in the game’s Discord who requested a place where <em>Helldivers 2</em> players can hang out in between drops. “It’s on the feature list for the next one,” Jorjani teased. What next one? <em>Helldivers</em> 3? Nope.</p>

 <p>“This was about our next game. Not <em>HD3</em>,” he added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nbmucr/comment/nd46h3l/">on Reddit</a>. Some fans are wondering if it’s a nod to the studio’s isometric fantasy multiplayer series <em>Magicka</em>. The studio has already confirmed that its next project, whatever it ends up being, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/15/helldivers-2-studios-next-game-will-be-free-from-playstation-partnership/">won’t be published by Sony</a>.</p> <h2>Fans think <em>GTA 6</em> parody website names have leaked</h2> <p>The open-world blockbuster is still over six months away, but in the meantime players may have some fresh teases to parse. What seem like in-game website names <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065">appear to have been registered</a> as real internet domains by Take-Two back in May. They include what-up.app, rydeme.app, and wipeoutcornskin.com. I don’t know if we’re ready for <em>GTA 6</em> in the post-internet, algorithmic slop phase of lampooning pop culture.</p>

 <h2>Will Johnny Silverhand return in <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>?</h2> <p>Because Keanu Reeves would be happy to do it if CD Projekt Red wants him back. “Absolutely,” he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">told<em> IGN</em></a> when asked about reprising the role. “I’d love to play Johnny Silverhand again.” Effectively a virtual ghost in the first game, there’s no reason Silverhand would need to come back in a sequel, but also nothing precluding it either. <em>Cyberpunk 2</em> is set to return to Night City but <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-orion-night-new-city-chicago-cdpr-1851781566">also take players to a new location</a> likened to “Chicago gone wrong.”</p> <h2>Satoru Iwata laughed when he heard about trying to sell <em>Animal Crossing</em> in America</h2> <p>Veteran Nintendo localizer Leslie Swan <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west">told <em>Time Extension</em></a> that’s how the former president of the company reacted when she told him they were translating the cozy sim. “He just laughed and said, ‘I don’t know how you’re going to do this.’ And it’s true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan,” she said.</p> <p>Long-time producer Takashi Tezuka was not confident either. “[Tezuka] basically said to me, ‘We’d like to have you localize it’ and I said, ‘Sure.’ But then he said, ‘No, Leslie, I’m not sure you understand, it’s going to be difficult.'” Swan recalled. “And I kept having to assure him that we would make it happen.” Decades later, the franchise is now one of the best selling in the world.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031"><em>Silksong</em> is harder than <em>Hollow Knigh</em>t, but is that a problem?</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-memecoin-crypto-web3-2000624006">Tech is beyond parody: even <em>Black Mirror</em> is getting a meme coin</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-digifarm-hands-on-preview-2000624093"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> might be the best JRPG of the fall</a></p> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Lenovo Clears Out Its 4.8-Star Copilot AI Laptop (40GB RAM, 1TB SSD) at 73% Off, You Could Buy Several for the Price of One]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-clears-out-its-4-8-star-copilot-ai-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-at-73-off-you-could-buy-several-for-the-price-of-one-2000624145</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-clears-out-its-4-8-star-copilot-ai-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-at-73-off-you-could-buy-several-for-the-price-of-one.1292736/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re out there looking for a solid laptop that can handle basic, everyday tasks, then Lenovo is a manufacturer worth consideration. Maybe you’re a college student in need of something to build out documents and slideshow presentations for your classes. Maybe you’re a small business owner in need of something to, err, build out documents and slideshow presentations for your clients. Web browsing, email drafting, YouTube video watching. You know, computer stuff! Well, take a look at the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/">Right now, Amazon has it on sale for 73% off. It’s listed at $2,999 but after the discount, the price comes to just $800. That’s a savings of $2,200.</a></p>
<p>Okay, but let’s hold our horses for just a moment. A $2,200 discount on a $2,299 laptop? Sounds too good to be true. So yeah, if we take a look at this items price history, we’ll see this listing has only existed on Amazon since the beginning of August. After about two weeks it dropped to the price it’s at now. It briefly went back up when September hit, but now it’s back down to $800.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>When we take a look at the specs on offer here, you can tell this is not a three thousand dollar machine. Lenovo’s own website has various builds of the IdeaPad Slim 3 in this $600 to $800 range. This listing is trying to trick you into thinking you’re saving a lot more than you are. And that’s a shame because these specs at this price point is a pretty good deal in its own right.</p>
<h2>Deep Dive</h2>
<p>What we have here is a 15.3-inch laptop capable of displaying in 1920 by 1200 HD. The anti-glare non-touch display has 300nits of brightness and a refresh rate of 60Hz. With DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 1.4, you can display on two additional monitors (three displays total including the laptop screen).</p>



<p>It’s got a built-in webcam that can record in 720p HD with a shutter so you can maintain privacy when not in use. For added connectivity, you have two USB-A ports and one USB-C port to transfer data or charge your other devices. Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 are also supported.</p>
<p>The real story is its RAM and storage. <strong>It’s working with 40GB of memory and an SSD containing a full 1TB of storage space</strong>. Great for backing up photos and working with large file types like 4K video.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/">All and all, this Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 is a worthwhile laptop. At $2,999? Heck no. But at $800? Not bad.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
