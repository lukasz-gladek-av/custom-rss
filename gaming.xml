            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/2024/7/1/24190165/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-pc-deal-sale-woot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="pIwII5">For existing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Xbox Game Pass subscribers</a> and newcomers alike, Woot has a deal that will get you over 20% off the usual price. Now through the end of the month — or “until sold out,” per Woot’s page — you can pick up <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836599-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fdigital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836599-13142092?sid=___pl__p_23954206__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026url=https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23954206__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> for $34.49 (23% off the $44.99 list price) or one month for $11.79 (saving 21% off the usual $14.99 price). </p>
<p id="iF5O14">If you wanted to stock up for a full year (ie. buying four three-month codes) that’d set you back around $138, which in turns saves around $42 from the usual price. Put another way, that’s buying 12 months of Game Pass Ultimate for the cost of nine months. Note that there’s a limit of 24 codes per customer, so for those that want to go <em>all out</em>, you can enjoy a discounted Game Pass membership from now until July 2030. Maybe that’s overkill, but we’re not ones to judge.</p>

<p id="a9LhQf">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the top tier of Microsoft’s games subscription service, which allows you unlimited access to a very, very large catalog of games on both Xbox and Windows PC, as well as discounts on titles you want to add to your permanent collection. The Ultimate tier also offers EA Play membership for a selection of that publishers’ catalog, including trials of select games for up to 10 hours each, and access to Xbox Cloud Gaming — perfect for when you’d rather just jump into a game without waiting for a download. Also great if you’d rather play on a not-Xbox device, including mobile and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24187316/xbox-amazon-fire-tv-partnership">(soon) a Fire TV stick</a>.</p>

Looking ahead, you can also check out our recap of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24172090/microsoft-xbox-showcase-june-2024-announcement-reveal">everything announced at the Xbox showcase at Summer Game Fest 2024</a> (Spoiler: Lots of “day one on Game Pass” titles, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24174798/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-cod-direct"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171213/doom-dark-ages-microsoft-xbox-games-showcase-sequel"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-beats-erdtree-final-boss<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Holy crap, my fingers are actually trembling"</h2></div><section><p>The Elden Ring community's favorite folk hero, Let Me Solo Her, has finally completed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, after a streaming marathon spanning multiple days during which he struggled repeatedly against the DLC's final boss.</p><p><strong>Warning: Spoilers for the ending of Shadow of the Erdtree follow below!</strong></p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Final boss is kicking my butt rn <a href="https://t.co/nf4htyip9T" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/nf4htyip9T</a></p>— Let me solo her (@TsuboiKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/TsuboiKlein/status/1806845328932454784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Tsuboi Klein, also known as Let Me Solo Her, has been steadily working his way through the new Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree with the rest of us. Just yesterday, he finally crossed the finish line, defeating Promised Consort Radahn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHhR8K2g3No" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live on stream</a> after something in the vicinity of 74 attempts. Despite being thought of as something of an Elden Ring expert, Let Me Solo Her really struggled with the second coming of Radahn, only defeating him after several hours of attempts spaced out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsn2dDyfVUA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over two days</a>. </p><p>"Holy crap, my fingers are actually trembling right now," he said upon victory. "I'm shaking."</p><p>Let Me Solo Her rose to notoriety by offering his summon sign to players struggling to beat the most difficult boss in the base game, Malenia. Wearing nothing more than a pot on his head, Let Me Solo Her has defeated Malenia hundreds of times now on behalf of others. While it might be natural to expect him to breeze through the DLC with skills like that, it's worth noting that Let Me Solo Her got so good at Malenia by practicing her fight <em>a lot</em>. It took him over 200 attempts just to beat her the first time. So it's only natural he'd get good at Radahn with practice, too. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So is Let Me Solo Her going to master Radahn and help others defeat him now? Probably not just yet. Let Me Solo Her acknowledged at the end of his stream that he had somewhat beelined his way to Radahn and hadn't finished a lot of the other DLC boss fights, so he wants to go back and wrap things up first. He also wants to enjoy the DLC a bit off-stream, too, just for himself. Additionally, he's already been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-rings-let-me-solo-her-is-now-let-me-solo-him-with-dire-consequences-for-messmer-the-impaler">spending his time helping others beat Messmer</a>, another story-required boss fight that many are struggling with. He's even technically rebranded as "Let Me Solo Him" just for that fight. Let Me Solo Her will continue to assist other players with Messmer for a bit longer, he says, before moving on to helping people with Radahn.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I BEAT THE FINAL BOSS LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO <a href="https://t.co/XUxVmAUitB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XUxVmAUitB</a></p>— Let me solo her (@TsuboiKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/TsuboiKlein/status/1807193376594534652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">interviewed Let Me Solo Her</a> two years ago during the height of his fame, and can confirm that he's delightful not just in battle against Malenia and Radahn, but also to speak with. And we <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-hero-let-me-solo-erdtree-dlc-reaction-malenia">caught up with him again</a> ahead of the release of Shadow of the Erdtree to hear his plans for exploring the Land of Shadow.

According to Monaghan, while he played some games from time to time as a kid, it wasn’t something he cared much about, instead preferred to play outside or act on stage. But then he moved to Los Angeles in 2002,3 and a faithful conversation with fellow <em>Lord of the Rings</em> star Elijah Wood changed everything.  </p><p>“I said to my friend Elijah Wood, it sounds like I’m terribly name-dropping right now, I said I’m going to go buy a DVD player, you want to come with me,” said Monaghan. “And Elijah’s like, you should buy PlayStation 2. So I was like all right fine,  but I’m just only going to watch <em>The Sopranos</em> on it and I’m only going to watch this and that and <em>Oz </em>and all these kinds of things. He’s like fine.”</p><p> But then a friend of his brought over a copy of <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em>, Rockstar’s incredibly popular and controversial open-world action game set in Liberty City. And according to Monaghan, he could not “believe that games” had got this advanced. <br></p><p> “I love little things about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-3-rockstar-games-jak-ii-simpsons-hit-and-run-1851217338&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-3-rockstar-games-jak-ii-simpsons-hit-and-run-1851217338"><em>GTA 3</em></a></span><em>, </em>like you can steal any car as opposed to there are certain cars that show you that they’re stealable,” explained the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> actor. “I got really good or I felt like I got really good at driving. You get to that point where everything starts to go really fast. I kind of enjoyed that. But I think [<em>GTA 3 </em>on PS2] was the big turnaround for me where I was like, oh I didn’t realize that games have now got to this point.” </p><p>“The leap was just extraordinary and you know the soundtrack is incredible. All the options were incredible,” said Monaghan. The actor further explained that since then he now includes games as part of his entertainment options alongside movies and TV shows. </p><p>As for the most recent entry in the franchise, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-the-kotaku-review-1324730770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-the-kotaku-review-1324730770">2013's <em>GTA V</em></a></span>, Monaghan has played the game and enjoyed it, even if he felt like Michael—one of the three main playable characters in that installment—was a bit “obnoxious.” He also sometimes enjoyed playing as Trevor, but admitted that he sometimes felt “dirty” after stepping into the lunatic’s shoes, saying he felt like he “needed a shower” afterward. </p><p>As for his all-time favorite gaming experience, it’s not <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-iii-made-just-vibing-in-its-world-incredible-1847929103&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-iii-made-just-vibing-in-its-world-incredible-1847929103"><em>GTA 3</em></a></span><em> </em>but instead <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-the-kotaku-review-5860518&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-the-kotaku-review-5860518">The <em>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</em></a></span> According to Monaghan, he put around 350 hours into the massive open-world RPG on PS3.

That's extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/13/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator">read about my in-depth look at the character creator here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But that feeling doesn't end in the character creator. It also extends to the world – ice mage and private detective companion Neve Gallus has a prosthetic leg, for example – and in the way you can play Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="634b212c-422d-4a18-9263-6e6b527b159f" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Before starting the game proper, a playstyle screen allows players to customize various options affecting how Veilguard plays. Here, you can select difficulty, or playstyle as BioWare calls it, with options like "Storyteller" for those interested more in the story versus the combat, "Adventurer" for an experience that seemingly balances story and combat, and a difficulty called Nightmare – there might be more, but this is all I see during my demo. At any point during Veilguard, you can change the game's difficulty unless you select Nightmare, which is the hardest of difficulties. That's a permanent selection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's another difficulty option called Unbound, though, allowing players to customize their gameplay experience to their liking. You can adjust how wayfinding helps you in-game; there's aim assistance and even an auto-aim option. You can adjust combat timing to make parrying easier or harder, with a balanced, forgiving, and a third harder option. You can change how much damage your enemies do to you, and how much damage you do to enemies by adjusting their health. There's also an option to adjust enemy pressure. And, if you're not interested in death-related setbacks, there's a no-death option you can turn on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"[None of these options] are a cheat," Busche tells me. "It's an option to make sure players of all abilities can show up."&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also says players can look forward to similar accessibility and approachability options you might expect, though I'm unable to pour through Veilguard's other options to confirm exactly what's there.&nbsp;</p>

Simply put: <strong>While $19.99 may seem like a deal for over a hundred hours of content, you’re restricted to how much time you can invest in the game within a month.</strong></p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-subscription-free-trial-download-1851428987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-subscription-free-trial-download-1851428987">How To Get The Most Out Of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> In One Month</a></span><br><strong>Buy <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>As a way more affordable alternative, you should consider jumping into the Free </p><p>Trial.

So, whether it takes you one month or one year, you won’t have to spend anything until you complete the 2017 <em>Stormblood</em> expansion or hit the level cap of 70.

Once you purchase the <em>Starter Edition your </em>account is locked out of the free trial, and into a subscription.</p><p>And if you’re on Xbox, you have an additional cost-saving benefit to choosing the free trial. Game Pass Core, which Xbox requires to play online, is needed for the paid version of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. However, those on the<em> Free Trial </em>bypass the Game Pass requirement and do not need any service or subscription. Since Game Pass Core starts at a monthly rate of $9.99,<em> Free Trial </em>users on Xbox are potentially saving almost $25 per month.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-xbox-open-beta-beginners-guide-1851274862&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-xbox-open-beta-beginners-guide-1851274862">A <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> Beginner’s Guide For Xbox</a></span></p><p>The <em>Free Trial</em> does have some limitations, however. These mostly concern social aspects of the game. <em>Free Trial</em> players can not join Free Companies,<em>FFXIV’s</em> versions of guilds. <strong>They also can not create a party, but are able to join one if they are sent an invite from a player who is on a paid version</strong>. The <em>Free Trial</em> also restricts trading with other players as well as sending in-game letters or participating in PVP or Ultimate Raids.

Well, if you have completed everything the <em>Free Trial </em>has to offer, and are ready to move on to the <em>Shadowbringers</em> expansion, you will need a paid version of the game (ie: the <em>Starter Edition</em>) and the new <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion. Every <em>FFXIV </em>expansion<em> </em>includes all the previous releases. With <em>Shadowbringers </em>and <em>Endwalker</em> now removed from digital storefronts, purchasing <em>Dawntrail </em>is the correct (and only way) to get caught up on the game.</p><p><em>Final Fantasy 14 </em>is one of the most popular MMOs of all time, and for good reason. Between its engrossing story, rewarding character building, and challenging dungeons, there is plenty of content to sink your teeth into. The heart of this experience is available for free as long as you avoid purchasing the<em> Starter Edition</em>. New users need to be aware of this before they even download the game. Once an account gets linked to a paid version like the <em>Starter Edition</em>, it is locked out of the free trial forever (much like this poor writer’s account).</p><p><em>FFXIV </em>players will have plenty of months where they will be paying to fuel their new and exciting hobby. So the longer those payments can be delayed, the better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-final-boss-was-defeated-with-a-saxophone/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Gaming on PC opens a world of new possibilities, with players not only able to alter and change the game but also how they play it. Elden Ring, a highly acclaimed action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware, is one of the best examples of players using alt controllers to play the game, with people beating bloodthirsty bosses with a dance pad, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-streamer-brainwaves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain waves</a>, morse code, and so much more. Interestingly, a player recently beat Shadow of the Erdtree’s final boss with just a saxophone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are living under a rock, you may have missed that some players have had a terrible time with Shadow of the Erdtree, thanks to its incredibly challenging gameplay. This accomplishment is even more commendable as beating the Elden Ring expansion’s final boss is no easy feat. </p>



<p>The man who was able to accomplish this feat is Dr. Doot, a player known for his unique approach to gaming challenges and his love for the saxophone. He has already completed a <a href="https://x.com/DrDeComposing/status/1775115963043807269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no-hit run on Elden Ring </a>with the same instrument.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Everyone was telling me how utterly impossible the Final Boss of Shadow of the Erdtree was going to be. Outrageous moveset, impossible dodges, etc</p><p>…</p><p>It only took me a dozen attempts on the saxophone.</p><p>THE WORLD'S FIRST (afaik) ALT CONTROLLER DLC RUN HAS BEEN DOOTED!🎷 <a href="https://t.co/nUzPmfgsNx">pic.twitter.com/nUzPmfgsNx</a></p></div>— Dr. Doot 🎷 (@DrDeComposing) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDeComposing/status/1807715780345364850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If you see the video embedded above, Dr. Doot’s weapon of choice was an attacking shield, The Carian Thrusting Shield specifically. You can see how Doot uses a bunch of notes on the saxophone to parry each of Radahn’s attacks until he is finally able to vanquish him, and it is a sight to behold. </p>



<p>Doot also provided some data on the shield he used to beat Shadow of the Erdtree’s final boss. Doot scaled The Carian Thrusting Shield’s STR stat by making it heavy and used Deflect Tear along with a Guard Counter Boost talisman to make the weapon “an absolute powerhouse of a tank”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shadow of the Erdtree launched on Friday, June 21 and sold<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 5 million copies </a>within the first three days. </p>

<p>One of the most anticipated movies of 2024 is scheduled to release this month, and it seems Call of Duty might be looking to capitalize on that hype. Deadpool and Wolverine hit theatres on July 26, and we will see the action heroes descending in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Warzone and Warzone Mobile.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/cod-dataminers-think-theyve-found-evidence-of-a-mw3-deadpool-wolverine-collab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dot Esports</a>, a user called <a href="https://x.com/crashfty/status/1806747826413539737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Crashfty</a> recently posted some peculiar videos on X (formerly Twitter) reminiscent of our beloved Merc with a mouth. The videos showcase new finisher moves for Call of Duty, with stock models enacting the scenes. Interestingly, the depicted scenes show a person killing off another in a very goofy and jovial manner, something that Deadpool is very good at. On the other hand, Wolverine hasn’t been hinted at in any of the scenes.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Deadpool &amp; Wolverine | Nice | In Theaters July 26" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3LisZEIK34?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Marvel collaborations are a no-brainer for games, and Fortnite is the biggest example. Moreover, the potential Deadpool and Wolverine collaboration is a significant event, as it not only sees Hugh Jackman return to put the super suit back on but will potentially help with the revival of the recently degrading Marvel Cinematic Universe. Call of Duty’s next seasonal update seems like the best window to introduce this collaboration, as it begins around the same time as the movie’s release date on July 24.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-dutys-fallout-update-goes-live-tomorrow/">Fallout update</a> went live last week. What do you think about Deadpool and Wolverine arriving in Call of Duty games? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-trek-prodigy-season-2-tower-of-god-season-2-and-more-new-tv-this-week.916422/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/2024/7/1/24183180/new-tv-netflix-star-trek-prodigy-tower-god-season-2-nfl-anime<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="yugZzI">If you’re in the States, then this week is July Fourth. If you’re not in the States, then this week is just July 4 — congrats to all who get to mark the day however they are, wherever they are! No surprise, but: I think we should all celebrate by watching TV. Particularly if you’re in for anime, there’s a <em>lot</em> of premieres this week on Crunchyroll, meaning you can roll right through the long (or regular!) weekend with a blitz of new programs. </p>
<p id="Dkcuag">Here’s the best new TV premieres (and just a <em>few</em> of the anime previews) this week. </p>


<hr id="IF1ehv">
<h2 id="fs6TI9"><strong>New shows on Netflix</strong></h2>
<h3 id="jRZLpn"><strong>Star Trek: Prodigy</strong></h3>
<div id="Wb6nvn"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zXh5TLAeJqw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="OHuQK7"><strong>Genre: </strong>Star Trek (animated YA adventures edition)<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 1, with all episodes<br><strong>Showrunner/creator: </strong>Kevin and Dan Hageman<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Brett Gray, Ella Purnell, Jason Mantzoukas, and more</p>
<p id="IlizaR"><em>Prodigy</em> has survived cancellation (read: was in production for season 2 when it got axed by Paramount) and has jumped over to a new network (read: was subsequently picked up by Netflix). That means that if you liked what <em>Prodigy</em> was putting down in season 1, you will probably like it when it makes its way to Netflix. </p>
<h2 id="zr2b1L"><strong>New shows on Max</strong></h2>
<h3 id="46yTmB"><strong>Hard Knocks: Offseason with the New York Giants</strong></h3>
<div id="SPt5ue"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ccDBPrqmKE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="SkYi8h"><strong>Genre: </strong>Docuseries, sports drama<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 2<br><strong>Cast: </strong>The players and staff of the New York Giants</p>
<p id="enGoPW">The New York Giants are entering their 100th season. It’s quite an accomplishment, but they (like all NFL teams) won’t settle for anything less than a Super Bowl slot. Will they get it? Who’s to say — but now we can at least watch what they’re saying during the offseason. </p>
<h2 id="YKj9EM"><strong>New shows on Crunchyroll</strong></h2>
<h3 id="oEPLsj"><strong>Nier: Automata Ver1.1a season 2</strong></h3>
<div id="ITwfSp"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eIMZYgb85xg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="nsCPWJ"><strong>Genre: </strong>Sci-fi action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 5, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>A-1 Pictures</p>
<p id="ffOrD3">Fans of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/12/16754720/nier-automata-best-games-2017"><em>Nier: Automata</em></a>, rejoice: The gorgeous anime adaptation of the hit game is finally making its return this summer with a second season following the first’s protracted and troubled development. Hopefully A-1 Pictures has ironed out all the details for this new season so we won’t be waiting <em>weeks</em> or even <em>months</em> between episodes.</p>
<p id="iNmSxy">The second “cour” (the term for a production block of anime averaging between 10 and 14 episodes) will pick up immediately after the first, with 9S having learned the shocking truth behind Project YoRHa after defeating the alien robots Adam and Eve alongside 2B. We’ll have to wait until July 5 to see just how much <em>Nier: Automata Ver1.1a</em> will diverge from the story of the original game. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>
<h3 id="Ns8Z2k"><strong>Tower of God season 2 </strong></h3>
<div id="8lqkLh"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5H9U6SugSzk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="8GKeWq"><strong>Genre: </strong>Fantasy action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 7, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>The Answer Studio</p>
<p id="SL7UF5">There’s a (in-universe) six-year gap between seasons here, and while we’ll be following up with Bam, Rachel, and the rest of the season 1 crew — along with their rankings! — season 2 is also bringing in some new protagonists. Meet Wangnan and Jyu, who are a little more advanced in the tower’s levels than we’ve seen so far. Time to find out what new challenges this mysterious tower can bring!</p>
<h3 id="9A6Q7J"><strong>My Deer Friend Nokotan</strong></h3>
<div id="Q3VaJ8"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bf4XTzeUBHo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="4YATsO"><strong>Genre: </strong>Slice-of-life comedy<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 7, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>Wit Studio</p>
<p id="mhc8St">Based on the 2019 manga by Oshioshio, <em>My Deer Friend Nokotan</em> is a comedy that centers on the misadventures of Torako Koshi, a former “yankee” (see: delinquent) girl trying to keep up her appearance as a ideal student at her new high school. That becomes significantly more difficult after she saves Noko Shikanoko, a self-described “deer-girl hybrid” who begins to follow Torako around and get up to all sorts of shenanigans.</p>
<p id="jDdkAQ">The trailer looks ridiculous, with realistic CG depictions of deer juxtaposed with Noko’s chibi-like appearance. There’s even a cute callback to the ending of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/25/21265521/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind-studio-ghibli-movie-watch-meaning-manga">1984’s <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em></a>, with Noko being lifted above a marching herd of deer while surrounded by an aura of light. We’ll see how the actual series holds up when it premieres this weekend. <em>—TE</em></p>
<h3 id="pobboo"><strong>Wistoria: Wand and Sword</strong></h3>
<div id="zY5RHO"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNiBiXXeyb8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="IEjowk"><strong>Genre: </strong>Fantasy action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 7, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>Actas, Bandai Namco Pictures</p>
<p id="sCovAx">Based on the fantasy adventure manga by author Fujino Ōmori and illustrator Toshi Aoi, <em>Wistoria: Wand and Sword</em> centers on Will Serfort, a young student who enrolls at a prestigious magic academy with hopes of achieving his dream of becoming one of the most powerful magic users in the world. However, much like <em>My Hero Academia</em>’s Izuku Midoriya or <em>Solo Leveling</em>’s Sung Jin-woo, Will has a critical roadblock: He can’t cast even the simplest of spells to save his own life! </p>
<p id="qm3ivW">That’s not gonna stop him, though, as he descends into the dungeons beneath the school to slay vicious monsters as an alternate way to earn academic credits. He’s like <em>Naruto</em>’s Rock Lee, only instead of being terrifyingly proficient in taijutsu, he’s an absolute beast when it comes to sword fighting.</p>
<p id="HqwaBK">I’m not familiar with the source material myself, but I am intrigued by the fact that Tatsuya Yoshihara, who previously worked as the action director on 2022’s <em>Chainsaw Man</em> and the chief director on the final season of <em>Black Clover</em>, is the director on <em>Wistoria: Wand and Sword</em>. Which means, at the very least, audiences can expect some exquisite action sequences. <em>—TE</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-season-1-patch-notes-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Ahead of its launch on July 2, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/39Z5ARUSNbU1QcQD0yhthI/y1s10-patch-notes">Ubisoft has released</a> the full patch notes for Season 1 of XDefiant. This new season features a new game mode in Capture the Flag, additional factions, maps, weapons, and more.</p>



<p>There’s a lot going into the first season of the game. You can check out everything for yourself below.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-players-launch/">Ubisoft Confirms XDefiant has had 11 Million Players Since Launch</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-full-xdefiant-season-1-patch-notes">Full XDefiant Season 1 Patch Notes</h2>



<h3>Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>Changed the expiration timing of activated Boosters so their lifespan counts down only during match time, when you’re actually playing, rather than all the time, like when you’re folding laundry or whatever.</li>



<li>Lowered the XP threshold for each Battle Pass tier to give Battle Pass progression a little more pep.</li>



<li>Tuned Match Bonus XP rewards:&nbsp;MVP and Victory went from 2,000 to 1,000 XP.&nbsp;Draw went from 1,000 to 500.&nbsp;Completion doubled from 2,000 to 4,000 to encourage player&nbsp;stick-to-itiveness.</li>



<li>Answered a community ask to add a headshot icon to the Killfeed because it feels good to rub it in.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Factions</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the GSK faction and their no-nonsense announcer: HQ.
<ul>
<li>These elite Team Rainbow operators from Germany’s Border Protection Command&nbsp;specialize in crowd control and securing territory.&nbsp;They can deploy electrified barbed wire for area denial, counter incoming enemy devices with their Active Defense System, and dazzle multiple foes with flash charges mounted on their G52-Tactical Shield ultra.&nbsp;Call them&nbsp;Grenzschutzkommando because it’s fun and also accurate.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Increased the cooldown of Echelon’s Intel Suit from 30 to 40 seconds.</li>



<li>Tuned the cooldown of the Phantoms’ Mag Barrier from 30 to 40 seconds. Mag Barrier hit points were also reduced from 500 to 400.</li>



<li>The Phantoms’ AEGIS now takes damage from EMP grenades (lob six to put it out of commission).</li>



<li>DedSec Hijack cooldown decreased from 28 seconds (plus the remaining duration of&nbsp; the hacked skill) to 20 seconds (plus the remaining duration of&nbsp; the hacked skill).
<ul>
<li>For example, let’s say a Mag Barrier has 7 seconds left and gets hacked: The cooldown becomes 20 plus 7 seconds. Failed Hijack cooldown, meanwhile, decreases from 8 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>DedSec’s Spiderbot cooldown increased from 25 to 40 seconds.</li>



<li>Adjusted Spiderbot behavior so multiple Spiderbots won’t attempt to hug the same face, nor will Spiderbots continue to ignore faces they’ve hugged multiple recent times. Some give and take from the Spiderbot kingdom.</li>



<li>Decreased the cooldown of Libertad’s BioVida Boost from 25 to 20 seconds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fixed Libertad’s Medico Supremo so it will no longer disappear after the deploying player respawns as a different faction.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Maps</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the new Clubhouse map, a two-story hangout popular with international operators. Ideal for firefights in the short- to mid-range. Home to game modes Domination, Occupy, Hot Shot, and the new CTF.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Game Modes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added Capture the Flag, hereafter referred to as CTF. For the uninitiated: You take the enemy’s flag from their base and bring it back to your own, while protecting your team’s flag. CTF is available on a variety of maps.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Weapons</h3>



<ul>
<li>Improved the hit flinch penalty incurred when being shot with a sniper rifle equipped.<p>These changes are intended to refine the behavior of hit flinch, prevent instances where the camera would move off the target with the first hit and back onto the target with the second, and improve the experience for players sensitive to wild camera movements. Here’s the nitty-gritty:
</p><ul>
<li>The speed of the hit flinch camera transition has been increased by 25 percent.</li>



<li>The camera will now always kick upward rather than up or down at random.</li>



<li>The amount the camera will kick left or right has been increased by 3 times.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Added the L115 sniper rifle, which is not quite as heavy as the TAC-50 and has faster handling, although it deals slightly less damage and is not as effective at penetrating cover.</li>



<li>Added the LVOA-C,&nbsp;a snazzy customized rifle similar to the M4A1. It has a much faster rate of fire than the M4A1, but with that comes more recoil and less range. It also has slightly longer reload and equip times.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added the Sawed Off secondary weapon.&nbsp;This close-range version of the double-barreled shotgun packs a big boom for its size. Imagine carrying a primary weapon in your secondary slot and that’s this.</li>



<li>Added new Mastery skins: Titanium Violet (unlocked at Weapon Level 300), Titanium Azure (unlocked at 350), and Titanium Prisma (unlocked at 400).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fixed weapons and optics shake in first-person view while using ADS.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Devices</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added a new and improved visual effect for the flash grenade (replacing the previous effect, which was…intense). The new effect is less retina-searing but still appropriately disorientating.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Removed an exploit where players could respawn with multiple devices after fiddling with the “Copy Loadout” option in the lobby, so nice try.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Social</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the Creator Code program, which allows players to choose a creator to receive commissions from their XCoin purchases at no additional cost. Choose “Support a Creator” from the store to see a list of eligible creators.</li>



<li>Players were able to create a party with enemy players and voice chat during matches despite being on opposing teams, which seemed shady so that’s fixed.</li>



<li>Disabled whispers in text chat.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Audio</h3>



<ul>
<li>Tweaked the mix of in-game voices and sound effects for volume and clarity.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>



<ul>
<li>Players who participated in the Closed Beta were supposed to keep Kersey’s Dungaree skin. They didn’t but now they do.</li>



<li>Fixed Challenge-tracking issues with Ubisoft Connect.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Graphical and audio fixes, various.</li>



<li>Additional crash fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">The Season 4 battle pass ends on July 24, meaning that's likely the start of Season 5 and would make for a very well-timed crossover if the leaks are true, as the new Deadpool &amp; Wolverine movie releases in theaters on July 26.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty has introduced several major IP event crossovers in the last few years, including the recent collaborations with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-collab-arrives-in-call-of-duty-mw3-and-warzone-this-week/1100-6524372/">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/warzone-modern-warfare-iii-official-gundam-mobile-suit-bundles-gameplay-trailer/2300-6464213/">Gundam</a>, Dune, and The Walking Dead, so another major collaboration wouldn't be surprising.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely learn more about upcoming bundles and potential crossover events closer to Season 5's release. Activision is also hosting the Call of Duty: Next event on August 28 to reveal new details and showcase live gameplay of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/">Black Ops 6</a> multiplayer.</p>

<p><em>Editor’s note: this piece contains spoilers for </em>Final Fantasy IX</p>



<p>In 2000, venerated RPG developer Square kicked off the new year with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-impressions-from-square-millennium/1100-2460029/">a big announcement:</a> <em>Final Fantasy</em> was going back to its roots. After two games featuring high-tech weaponry, corrupt megacorporations, and sci-fi boarding schools, the beloved franchise was finally returning to the European fairy tale aesthetic of its foundational 8- and 16-bit titles.</p>



<p>And, sure enough, when <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>came out, all the classic elements were there. The game takes place in a steampunk-tinged fantasy world and features a cast of whimsical characters. Elemental crystals, the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series’ recurring McGuffin, were back. So were moogles, dwarves, and — most importantly — black mages.</p>



<figure>

</figure>



<p>Nothing showed Square’s commitment to <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>‘s back-to-basics approach more than Vivi Ornitier. After all, black mages have been part of <em>Final Fantasy</em> since the beginning and still serve as the de facto symbol of the series’ earliest days. In <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Final Fantasy III</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy V</em>, the black mage is one of a few classes (or “jobs”) you can assign to your characters, trading their physical strength for the ability to cast powerful spells. In <em>Final Fantasy II and Final Fantasy IV</em>, black mages live in their own city, Mysidia; during the first few minutes of <em>IV</em>, the protagonist slaughters Mysidia’s robed residents and steals their crystal.</p>



<p>Vivi even looks like the black mages of old, big head and all. The mages’ shadowy faces and glowing eyes might have been <a href="https://na.finalfantasy.com/topics/176">byproducts of the Nintendo Entertainment System’s limited palette</a>, but their design is evocative and instantly memorable. It’s no wonder that they became <em>Final Fantasy</em>‘s first major mascots.</p>



<p>But neither Vivi nor <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>are exactly what they seem. In an unusual move, Square unveiled <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>alongside its two sequels. <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, due out a year later, was the franchise’s first installment on the then-brand-new PlayStation 2, and featured a new combat system, more realistic graphics, and a world inspired by Southeast Asia. <em>Final Fantasy XI </em>was an MMORPG in the vein of <em>Ultima Online </em>and <em>EverQuest</em>, with gameplay to match. The 2001 feature film <em>Final Fantasy: Spirits Within</em> told an alien invasion story.</p>



<p>In other words, <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> wasn’t a revival. It was a eulogy for <em>Final Fantasy</em>‘s classic era, and Vivi was there to help us say goodbye.</p>



<p>Endings — and what comes afterwards — are baked into <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>‘s premise. “Following the death of my mother, I went through some things that made me think about death,” franchise creator and <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>producer Hironobu Sakaguchi said, according to Third Editions’ <em>The Legend of Final Fantasy IX.</em> “In the end, I told myself that this sort of thing is really not so unusual. In spite of the sadness it brings, life goes on.”</p>



<p>It’s probably not an accident that Sakaguchi uses Vivi, <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>‘s most direct link to the franchise’s earlier installments, to express this theme, and the mage’s arc serves as a potent metaphor for the fate of the original Final Fantasy games. Initially, Vivi is clumsy, naïve, and ignorant about his true nature, but he means well and tries hard. As the adventure continues, he learns that he’s actually a <em>product</em>, one of hundreds of black mages produced on an assembly line for use in war. Even worse, Vivi was born with a built-in expiration date. After about a year of puttering around, he discovers, black mages simply stop working.&nbsp;</p>



<figure>
<figcaption><em>captured via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Lacry">Lacry</a></em></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Vivi spends the rest of <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>making peace with his impending demise. He succeeds, but time catches up with him anyway. During <em>Final Fantasy IX’s </em>epilogue, Vivi is the only cast member who’s absent. He is not, however, forgotten; a message written by mage before his death plays over the final scenes. “Life doesn’t last forever,” it says. “Even if you say goodbye, you’ll always be in our hearts … Farewell. My memories will be part of the sky.”</p>



<p>Unlike Vivi, <em>Final Fantasy</em> didn’t die after <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, but it did change radically. Nobuo Uematsu is no longer the series’ sole (or even primary) composer. Sakaguchi is long gone. The Active Time Battle system, which powered <em>Final Fantasy IV </em>through <em>IX</em>‘s turn-based combat, has been retired.</p>



<p>And yet, like Vivi’s memory, those original titles’ influence remains. The first six <em>Final Fantasy</em> games have been remastered, remade, and re-released numerous times. They continue to provide a barometer for <em>Final Fantasy</em>‘s overall vibe, while the creatures, mechanics, and tropes they introduced — including black mages — have been remixed and reinterpreted repeatedly in later installments. Even when a <em>Final Fantasy</em> title tries something radically new, it still feels comfortable, thanks to the foundation those old games established.</p>



<p><em>Final Fantasy IX</em> foresaw this eventuality, of course. While Vivi doesn’t make it to the epilogue, a group of young black mages who claim to be his sons do. The message is clear: Vivi will be missed, but his death isn’t sad, exactly. His time was simply up; now, seeing how his descendants pick up his legacy will be its own, unique source of joy. You can say the exact same thing about classic <em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p>

			<p>As the ninth console generation approaches its fourth year, one question remained unanswered: how does Sony's PS5 console often outperform Microsoft's Xbox Series X, which is more powerful on paper?&nbsp;A few notable examples include <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-demo-performance-ps5-runs-better-xbox-series-x-better-vrr-rt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cod-black-ops-cold-war-performance-mode-ps5-better-ray-tracing-xsx-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-runs-better-on-ps5-than-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V</a> following the next-generation update.</p>
<p>As a reminder, both PS5 and Xbox Series X are powered by custom AMD hardware featuring Zen 2 and RDNA 2 CPU/GPU architectures. Microsoft's console has an eight-core CPU clocked at 3.8 GHz (3.6 GHz with simultaneous multithreading enabled), a GPU powered by 52 Compute Units clocked at 1.825 GHz for an estimated 12.16 TeraFLOPS of computing power, and 16GB of GDDR6 SDRAM with a split design (10GB with 320-bit bus and 560 GB/s bandwidth and 6 GB with 192-bit bus and 336 GB/s bandwidth).</p>
<p>On the other hand, PS5 has an eight-core CPU with variable frequency that is capped at 3.5 GHz, a GPU powered by 36 Compute Units with variable frequency up to 2.23 GHz for an estimated TeraFLOPS peak of 10.13, and 16GB of GDDR6 SDRAM with a 256-bit bus and 448 GB/s bandwidth.</p>
<p>Well, today, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQIBknDAj4g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a new DF Direct weekly episode</a> in which they attempted to share a more or less final take on the subject. John Linneman mentioned hearing from developers that the shader compiler and the API itself are faster on the PlayStation 5 side.</p>
<p><em>One of the big ones that we've heard referenced multiple times now is the shader compiler on the PS5 side is just extremely fast and optimized. It gets pretty complex, but it makes better use of the actual silicon in a way that allows the PS5 to speedier performance. That seems to be a huge thing. Obviously, Microsoft wouldn't be sleeping on that, they're clearly putting in the work on that, but so is Sony, and developers just seem to prefer Sony's implementation for this. Along those same lines, the PS5's main API also seems to be quite fast, faster than what Microsoft's doing with DirectX.</em></p>
<p>The DirectX topic is interesting, as it is mentioned that Microsoft's choice to provide an API that works fairly seamlessly between PC and Xbox consoles may prove to be a slight penalty in how low-level it is on the console side.</p>
<p>That's not the whole story. According to Alex Battaglia, Unreal Engine 5-powered games generally benefit from the Xbox Series X's higher count of Compute Units. However, other engines may well be more performant on PS5 due to its higher clock rate.</p>
<p>There's more to consider, anyway, as Microsoft's console has the advantage when it comes to variable refresh rate (VRR) implementation. For example, while FromSoftware's Elden Ring runs faster on Sony's console, the Xbox Series X provides a smoother and more stable experience. Ultimately, though, the differences between the two consoles are relatively minor in most games, providing a comparable experience.</p>

The battle begins with the Master tearing through several seemingly faceless Jedi, each of whom I’m sure each have their own dense backstories. Even amidst the spectacular all-versus-one action, the lack of intimacy we feel with these unknown Jedi left me feeling like an opportunity had been missed for us to feel more. As each Jedi fell, I would have loved for for their deaths to feel more impactful. All it would’ve taken was a simple meal scene like the goop dinner in the first <em>Matrix</em> movie in which Neo meets the crew of the ship that saved him.<br></p><p>Sprinkled between lightsaber martial arts combos, we have actual story progression. We’re in this fight to see Osha reunite with/arrest her twin sister Mae, both played by Amandla Stenberg. Amidst the battle, the Jedi tell Osha to get to safety, escorted by injured Jedi Knight Yord. Meanwhile, acolyte Mae attempts to evade her former dark Master unsuccessfully, and she sends a psychic distress signal to Osha. Osha tells Yord they have to go back or everyone will die. Osha gets the bright idea to use her pocket-droid’s flashlight to attract a swarm of umbramoths (giant, lethal moths) that surround them in the trees to use against the dark Master, and she and Yord run back to battle.</p><p>Yord lunges at the dark Master and hits his mask, but that doesn’t stop his adversary from slaying the best Jedi fighter, Padawan Jecki Lon (Dafne María Keen Fernández). Finally, we see the face of the Master. No doubt like many fans, up to this point I’d been wondering who the master is. Is it one of Osha and Mae’s mothers? Is it a former Jedi, perhaps the teacher of Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae)? Nope. It’s Qimir (Manny Jacinto). And now the volume on the episode turns down.</p><p>Manny is a great actor who’s performed well in previous episodes, but he feels  miscast in this moment. His reveal underwhelms, and the strength and mystery of the character is now gone. We learn of Qimir’s motivation—to be free—and the authenticity of a villain feels lost. This is not Vader. This is just a bad guy.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0d92967e4fc20101f5ba521fa5ddd6f" data-recommend-id="image://e0d92967e4fc20101f5ba521fa5ddd6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Manny Jacinto in a scene from The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Manny Jacinto in a scene from The Acolyte." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0d92967e4fc20101f5ba521fa5ddd6f" data-recommend-id="image://e0d92967e4fc20101f5ba521fa5ddd6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Manny Jacinto in a scene from The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Again, we feel the missed opportunities for character development, with the lack of time we’ve had to get to know Qimir up to this point sapping this development of its power. Yes, there are fan theories suggesting that more revelations await, but the narrative we’ve been fed up to this point isn’t potent enough to support this reveal in the here and now. But back to the episode’s highlight: Qimir kills Yord, cementing this scene as having some of the best deaths in any <em>Star Wars</em> battle.<br></p><p>As last Jedi standing Sol fights Qimir, Osha and Mae have gone through their back-and-forth of stun gunning (Osha shot Mae, but she woke up), and Osha sacrifices her droid (that we should care more about, but don’t) by sticking it on Qimir’s back. He’s attacked by the umbramoths and flown into the trees above. Mae awakens to stun-gun Sol, and she has a moment alone with Osha. Mae gives Osha a speech about how the Jedi brainwashed her and how they both need to believe in their sisterly bond. Mae hugs Osha, but Osha puts Mae in an arm lock. Then she delivers some dialogue about doing what she came to do: arrest her sister for murdering Jedi and burning their homeland. </p><p>One of my pet peeves is arm locking and dialogue, followed by reversing an arm lock and delivering more dialogue, which happens in this scene. Another example of the series being riddled with unnecessary tropes that take away from its built-in uniqueness. Mae ends up knocking Osha out cold, then lightsabers her hair and swaps clothing to impersonate her sister. This leads to Mae leaving the planet with the awakened Sol, and Osha being discovered by Qimir, who has defeated the swarm of umbramoths. Hopefully this leads to the truth being revealed behind what the Jedi did to destroy Mae and Osha’s home.</p><p><em>The Acolyte</em>’s fifth episode is the most exciting yet in terms of pacing and action. However, it also highlights how more focus on character development would allow us to understand how these individuals interact with the world and would convey emotional weight when characters die or return, or droid friends are lost. We don’t get enough intimate time with these characters for them to feel real, and I hope this changes with future episodes.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Acolyte</em></a></span><em> </em>is available to stream now on Disney+. </p><p>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There's some good news for Legacy of Kain fans this week, as for the first time in <em>decades</em>, the series is getting some new material. A graphic novel titled Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - The Dead Shall Rise has been announced, and it'll serve as a prequel to the games starring Raziel. It's not a new game or a remake of the classic titles, but something is better than nothing.</p><p>An official collaboration between Crystal Dynamics and Bit Bot Media, the Soul Reaver graphic novel will reveal more info about Raziel's past, his days as a Sarafan warrior, and how he came to serve under Kain as a vampire. The book will be written by Joshua Viola (True Believer) and Angie Hodapp (Shadow Atlas), with art by Juan Samu (Star Wars), letters by Jeremiah Lambert, and covers by Dave Rapoza and Aaron Lovett.</p><p>"In college, I created a Soul Reaver poster for a class project, never imagining I would one day officially contribute to the franchise," Viola said in a statement (via <a href="https://za.ign.com/legacy-of-kain-defiance/197058/news/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-returns-in-new-prequel-graphic-novel" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>). "Even today, Raziel graces my tattoo sleeve--a testament to my deep connection with this universe. Fans can expect a project infused with that same passion. Working directly with creatives from Crystal Dynamics and reuniting with former collaborators makes this a truly special endeavor."</p><p>The Soul Reaver graphic novel will launch on Kickstarter later this year, and anyone interested can <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/ec6d71d7-3906-45d4-aaab-40fc1a372416/landing?preview_mode=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up on BackerKit</a> to be informed when the crowdfunding campaign goes live.</p><p>Beyond this upcoming journey back to Nosgoth, things seem quiet for the Legacy of Kain franchise currently. The IP rights are currently held by Embracer Group, and in October 2022, over 100,000 people completed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-is-testing-the-waters-for-a-new-legacy-of-kain/1100-6508082/" data-ref-id="1100-6508082">Legacy of Kain survey</a>. According to Crystal Dynamics, fans were heard "loudly and clearly" about their desire to see the franchise return in some form.</p><p>The last true entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/legacy-of-kain-defiance/">Defiance</a>, was released 20 years ago in 2003, and Crystal Dynamics is currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-gets-first-gameplay-trailer/1100-6524084/" data-ref-id="1100-6524084">co-developing a Perfect Dark reboot</a> with Microsoft studio The Initiative.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_to_the_Barrier_Peaks"><em>Expedition To The Barrier Peaks</em></a> is an adventure that was originally written by Gary Gygax himself for <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1st Edition</em> in 1980. Our quickly thrown together party was DM'd by <a href="https://twitter.com/MakenzieLaneDA">Makenzie De Armas</a>, writer at Wizards of the Coast who recently worked on <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a46e779c-d41c-4fff-b5fb-f04a72837c67" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deck-of-many-things-review-dd-5e-has-new-best-sourcebook">The Deck of Many Things </a>and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8c2ec0c-8e1a-4fc6-a97f-23659c5ab321" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-call-of-netherdeep-review"><em>Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fun note as we began our game was sentiments shared by other players, including <a href="https://twitter.com/AntonTaleTeller">Anton The Storyteller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cozywizrd">Mike Dunn</a>, who had spent time exploring Expedition To The Barrier Peaks in AD&amp;D. It was exciting to be sitting at the table with those about to embark on the journey for the first time, as well as those who had at least a partial idea of what to expect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Settling in De Armas delivered a quick plot hook, the party had been tasked by a nearby town's mayor to investigate the strange creatures destroying settlements and so we were off to the mountains to investigate. It was explained that each of the adventures in this Anthology Series could be played in a sequential order, using Nafas the Genie who lives in the Infinite Staircase as a plot giver, but that each adventure can also be dropped into existing campaigns.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/quests-from-the-infinite-staircase-classic-and-alt-cover_1.jpg?itok=y_gTHado 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/quests-from-the-infinite-staircase-classic-and-alt-cover_1.jpg?itok=3VQ7Ea-T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nafas on both covers of Quests From The Infinite Staircase</figcaption></figure><p>Exploring the mountain the party encountered a cave, newly revealed by a landslide, and as we crossed the threshold the stone under our feet were replaced with cool metal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/games">De Armas took this moment to direct us towards the maps encounter</a>, which until now had been sitting with the message "Your DM is not currently hosting a game session." The screen came to life as we saw one of the beautiful maps from <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> appear, mostly obstructed.</p>
<p>Having built our characters as part of a Campaign within D&amp;DBeyond we could find our character tokens, add them to the map (already perfectly sized for the map) and begin combat as a Cloaker descended upon us.</p>
<p>After the quick battle we were met by a Robot who informed us that their leader wanted to speak with us. This wasn't an Auto-gnome, this wasn't an Automaton, Modron, or even a Warforged, but an honest to god Android.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robots-from-expedition-to-the-barrier-peaks_0.jpg?itok=QNSDxK0b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robots-from-expedition-to-the-barrier-peaks_0.jpg?itok=DW7u8Rzc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The top left robot is the one we met and our party named him Frederick</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, we had stepped out of high fantasy and even further past Science Fantasy, we were fully immersed in a Science Fiction world.</p>
<p>The Maps feature of D&amp;DBeyond, while currently in Alpha, is one that I've been using as part of my home games as well as for adventures with other TechRaptor staff, including our recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/podcasts/vecna-eve-of-ruin-session-1-techraptor-podcast-117">four-part <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em> series</a>. Admittedly, this was the first time getting to be on the other end of the map.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As De Armas revealed more of the map, erasing away the fog of war with a square erase tool, I was excited to hear my party mates reacting to the easy reveal of the world, and clicking sounds starting as De Armas let us know that you could move your tokens by selecting them and then using the arrow keys to direct them around the board like a video game. That was a new one for me too!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/an-effect-overlay-showing-a-breath-weapon-in-dndbeyond-map-tools_0.jpg?itok=2Vs7N3RS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/an-effect-overlay-showing-a-breath-weapon-in-dndbeyond-map-tools_0.jpg?itok=RznnHq7N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Another new feature I learned about (recreated here with my home game) is that you can create effect lines, circles, and squares and change their color and symbol</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the rest of the adventure the party got to use tact to negotiate a deal between two warring groups of residents on the spaceship, two families of Vegepygmy, and learn about a number of interesting Tech Weapons available to find. One party member quickly picked up a Laser Pistol, while another got to donn a suit of Powered Armor.</p>
<p>Hearing about all that <em>Expeditions To The Barrier Peak</em> had to offer, including but not limited to malfunctioning combat robots and sections of the lower ship floor flooded with irradiation, De Armas also teased that there was a creature in the depths of the ship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asking if we could fast forward to that encounter De Armas was able to quickly show us off the rest of the first floor (of which we'd only managed to see a quarter of in four hours of play), skip through the second floor, and arrive in a central lush garden and lake area on the third floor. Here we faced the Froghemoth Elder.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-view-of-the-third-floor-of-the-spaceship_0.jpg?itok=IhcHHyCn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-view-of-the-third-floor-of-the-spaceship_0.jpg?itok=A7KButxi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of space for a Froghemoth Elder to creep out of the water and leap on us...</figcaption></figure><p>Combat in the D&amp;DBeyond map tools against the Froghemoth was quick and easy. As the new map was loaded we were able to pop out each of our tokens, the Froghemoth Elder was already in place on the map where De Armas had put it prior to the session.</p>
<p>In combat we were able to keep an eye on all characters, use rings to indicate what status we might be under (the status options were only color based, I would love to see some text on the rings in the future to better indicate that especially if it could be tied to the status on the character sheet), and when three of our party had been devoured by the Froghemoth I was able to draw a box on the map outside of the battle that indicated tokens inside had been eaten.</p>
<p>Getting invited to this session was a lot of fun, and being led through the world by De Armas and a variety of robotic impersonations was an absolute blast. I can definitely see how while it's part of an anthology book depending on how your party takes their time this could easily be 5+ sessions of time.</p>
<p>It was also a blast getting to see others experience the D&amp;DBeyond map tools for the first time. There is still a lot of roughness around the edges, but if you're running a campaign inside D&amp;DBeyond, with maps and monsters that aren't homebrew it's incredibly easy to hit the ground running.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24189986/elden-ring-movie-tv-show-hidetaka-miyazaki-george-rr-martin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="rKbUbs"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22947204/elden-ring-review-from-software"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> creators Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin seem to be hinting that a movie (or TV series) based on the open-world fantasy role-playing game is coming — or at the very least, they’re trying to will one into existence, based on recent comments from the two <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23723957/elden-ring-nebula-award-george-r-r-martin-dlc-expansion">Nebula Award winners</a>.</p>
<p id="Nu0oAY">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a>, <em>Elden Ring</em> director and FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki said, “I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of <em>Elden Ring</em>, a movie for example.” He noted that FromSoftware doesn’t have “the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium” and would need to rely on a “very strong partner” to make it happen.</p>
<p id="Q2Cyxb">“We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure,” Miyazaki concluded.</p>
<p id="ctshJF">A few days after that interview was published, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24135223/elden-ring-did-george-r-r-martin-write-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc"><em>Elden Ring</em> lore co-creator</a> George R.R. Martin <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2024/06/29/lose-one-win-one/">cheekily wrote on his blog</a>, “Oh, and about those rumors you may have heard about a feature film or television series based on<strong> </strong><em>Elden Ring</em>...<strong> </strong>I have nothing to say. Not a word, nope, not a thing, I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me, mum mum mum. What rumor?”</p>
<p id="m4rqI3"><em>Elden Ring</em> publisher Bandai Namco has hinted at an expansion of the game’s universe for two years now, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22980899/elden-ring-new-franchise-fromsoftware">hailing the game as the start of a new franchise</a>. When <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20220316_eldenring_salesdata">FromSoft and Bandai Namco announced</a> in 2022 that <em>Elden Ring</em> had sold 12 million units in its first month, the companies said, “Please look forward to more of Elden Ring as an IP [...]) in hopes of expanding beyond the realm of games.”</p>
<p id="H0vIwr">“Much effort was placed into creating <em>Elden Ring</em> in order to exceed the expectations of our fans worldwide,” said Yasuo Miyakawa, president and CEO of Bandai Namco Entertainment, in that announcement. “With a similar goal, we will continue our efforts in expanding the brand beyond the game itself and into everyone’s daily life.”</p>
<p id="Z5twO1">FromSoftware’s other games, including <em>Dark Souls</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/3/27/8209199/bloodborne-review-PS4-playstation-4-exclusive"><em>Bloodborne</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/3/21/18274733/sekiro-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a>, have been adapted to other entertainment media, mainly in the form of manga and comic books that expand each title’s story. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elden-Ring-Road-Erdtree-Vol/dp/1975364899?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Elden-Ring-Road-Erdtree-Vol/dp/1975364899?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23954027__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23954027__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Elden Ring</em> has also been adapted to manga form</a>, but as a comedy starring a clueless Tarnished named Aseo who is pathetically struggling to become Elden Lord. Presumably, any bigger-budget adaptation of <em>Elden Ring</em> would take a more serious approach.</p>
<p id="Bbjr5B">While neither FromSoftware nor Bandai Namco have officially announced a film or TV adaptation of <em>Elden Ring</em>, it appears the game’s creators are on board. Such a project would give Martin another opportunity to not complete <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23560856/winds-of-winter-release-date-george-r-r-martin-new-york-giants-football"><em>The Winds of Winter</em></a>, and give FromSoftware much bigger exposure outside of games.</p>
<p id="cOoBGA">But what would an adaptation of <em>Elden Ring</em> even look like? Likely not a direct adaptation of the events of the game, but as an expanded version of the lore that leads up to the setting of <em>Elden Ring</em>. Existing prior to the playable portion of this universe is a sprawling medieval fantasy political drama that involves complex familial and romantic relationships, political power struggles, and just a <em>tiny</em> bit of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23344676/house-dragon-episode-4-review-targaryen">incest</a>. Not only is that a proven recipe for Martin, a prequel outlining the lore of <em>Elden Ring</em> would certainly go a long way to helping its more than 25 million players understand <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23020905/elden-ring-lore-story-plot-endings-radahn-ranni">what the hell is going on</a>.</p>

But can it be a relaxing expansion while also setting up the stakes for the MMO’s next decade? Steam reviews seem mixed on how well <em>Dawntrail</em> pulls it all off.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196805" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Many are praising <em>Dawntrail</em>, with some even calling it the best expansion the game has ever received (which is incredibly high praise considering how good <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-the-kotaku-review-1838105413&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-the-kotaku-review-1838105413"><em>Shadowbringers</em></a></span> was). Generally, positive reviews highlight the new world of Tural and its diverse cast of characters, including everyone’s favorite Hrothgar, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-wuk-lamat-npc-love-1851569954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-wuk-lamat-npc-love-1851569954">Wuk Lamat</a></span>. It’s no surprise that a lower-stakes adventure for the Warrior of Light and their best buddies through a tropical wonderland is hitting perfectly for a lot of long-time players. But it isn’t just the relaxing vibes and beautiful setting getting high praise, <em>Dawntrail</em> also brought with it quality-of-life features like a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-7-0-patch-visual-upgrade-1851559585&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-7-0-patch-visual-upgrade-1851559585">graphical update</a></span> which has made the game shine like new. The overall takeaway from positive Steam reviews is that <em>Dawntrail</em> is a breath of fresh air for the aging MMO in almost every way.</p><p>Shocking nobody, however, the fanbase is hardly unanimous on the matter. <em>Dawntrail</em> haters have two major problems. The first is Wuk Lamat. Yes, some of these people just hate Wuk Lamat! I cannot understand it but a lot of negative reviews are criticizing the character many other players adore. Specifically, the critique is that Wuk Lamat is so central to the overarching <em>Dawntrail</em> story that she effectively becomes the main character over the Warrior of Light. Second, some feel that the relaxing vibes of the expansion, rather than making it work as a vacation-like adventure, diminish it instead, making it too low-stakes with a boring nothing-burger of a plot. Some reviews go so far as to say that <em>Dawntrail</em> is as bad (if not worse) than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood-the-kotaku-review-1796771052&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood-the-kotaku-review-1796771052"><em>Stormblood</em></a></span>, the second and most-derided expansion to <em>Final Fantasy 14</em>.<br></p><p>Some of the criticism of <em>Dawntrail</em> is probably a result of how different its goals are from those of past expansions. From the release of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-the-kotaku-review-1440536417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-the-kotaku-review-1440536417"><em>A Realm Reborn</em></a></span> until the conclusion of <em>Endwalker</em>, each expansion raised the stakes of the story and led to a climactic finale to a decades-long story. <em>Dawntrail</em> couldn’t have raised the stakes from <em>Endwalker</em>, and it’s meant as a de-escalation. Inherently that may be less exciting, but it is intentional. To tell a new exciting story you have to start from square one.</p><p>At the end of the day, Steam reviews have given me a sense of what to expect in <em>Dawntrail</em> when I finally get around to it. Most importantly, I now know that I will encounter sentient corn at some point, so I have more motivation than ever to get to Tural. Check out what else players are saying.</p><figure id="" data-id="08e5fb27432ab968864a6f16061bb9df" data-recommend-id="image://08e5fb27432ab968864a6f16061bb9df" data-format="jpg" data-width="620" data-height="264" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam review that reads &quot;Game is pretty good if you skip the entire story&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steam review that reads &quot;Game is pretty good if you skip the entire story&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="08e5fb27432ab968864a6f16061bb9df" data-recommend-id="image://08e5fb27432ab968864a6f16061bb9df" data-format="jpg" data-width="620" data-height="264" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam review that reads &quot;Game is pretty good if you skip the entire story&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="b331b87eb2043a7c784db5c33f87a538" data-recommend-id="image://b331b87eb2043a7c784db5c33f87a538" data-format="jpg" data-width="617" data-height="308" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam review that reads &quot;I personally think that every time Wuk Lamat isn't on screen a character should ask &quot;Wheres Wuk Lamat?&quot;  (Edit - This actually happens.)&quot;&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steam review that reads &quot;I personally think that every time Wuk Lamat isn't on screen a character should ask &quot;Wheres Wuk Lamat?&quot;  (Edit - This actually happens.)&quot;&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b331b87eb2043a7c784db5c33f87a538" data-recommend-id="image://b331b87eb2043a7c784db5c33f87a538" data-format="jpg" data-width="617" data-height="308" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam review that reads &quot;I personally think that every time Wuk Lamat isn't on screen a character should ask &quot;Wheres Wuk Lamat?&quot;  (Edit - This actually happens.)&quot;&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="b1903241c492f3e0659783a8ca293838" data-recommend-id="image://b1903241c492f3e0659783a8ca293838" data-format="jpg" data-width="617" data-height="497" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam review that reads &quot;Follow the adventures of Brave Hero Wuk Lamat (OC DO NOT STEAL) as she learns the meaning of friendship along with her friends such as, no prior accomplishments you can do it person (This NPC is customizable!), Krile and guy with a backpack!

He also suggested a hotfix would arrive sometime "this week" alongside a brief server maintenance period.</p><p>"Firstly, I would like to thank everyone who has been playing Dawntrail since the start of early access," Yoshida said. "However, I would like to offer my sincere apologies regarding the issues that we have identified."</p><p>Xbox version issues have perhaps been most prominent, as the game client can become completely unresponsive when moving between locations. "Our preliminary investigation suggests that this issue is likely due to a phenomenon known as memory fragmentation," Yoshida said.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I would like to offer my sincere apologies regarding the issues that we have identified.</p></div><p>Square Enix is looking into a fix for the problem but it will be "several days" before one is released, Yoshida said. This is because a patch must go through myriad checks by the quality assurance team.</p><p>"We are working to expedite the release of this patch at the earliest possible opportunity," he said. "However, we regret to say that this process will require some time. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to address the issue."</p><p>Players, in the meantime, may encounter the issue less if they play on worlds with low populations. "Until we have resolved the issue, we kindly suggest you consider playing on either the Dynamis, Shadow, or Oceania data centers," Yoshida said.</p><p>An incoming patch will also address freezing abilities not functioning properly and an issue with the display and animations of cerain characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>"The aforementioned issues are being classified as a high priority," Yoshida said. "They are under investigation on our development server and are being addressed in a systematic manner. We are considering the release of a hot fix, which is likely to occur sometime this week, which would be accompanied by a brief maintenance period."</p><p>It's therefore likely all of these issues will still be in Dawntrail upon its full launch tomorrow, July 2, 2024. The accompanying <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-version-70-patch-notes-reveal-every-change-coming-alongside-dawntrail">Version 7.0 patch hade made plenty of positive changes</a> to the game too, such as new areas, quests, quality-of-life improvement, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-getting-a-major-graphics-update-with-new-requirements-for-dawntrail-expansion">a huge graphical upgrade</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-trailer-pictomancer-job-female-hrothgar-and-more-revealed-at-tokyo-fan-fest">the Viper and Pictomancer jobs</a>, but seemingly not without a few frustrating bugs.</p><p>Dawntrail's Steam page is also full of middling reviews, as while Final Fantasy 14 expansions are usually widely praised by fans and critics, Dawntrail has dropped to a "mixed" rating. Despite "review bombing" being a common tactic for players looking to express frustration, Dawntrail's current Steam user review rating appears to be the result of genuine grievances and not bugs.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Dino Crisis 2, which followed a year later in 2000, sold 1.2 million copies. Dino Crisis 3 launched as an original Xbox exclusive in 2003 and fans have yet to see a new game since.</p><p>Despite the occasional groundswell of opinion that Dino Crisis should return from hardcore fans, Capcom seems uninterested in reviving the franchise. Indeed Capcom's 2022 announcement of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/exoprimal">Exoprimal</a>, a multiplayer-focused action game featuring dinosaurs, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dino-crisis-exoprimal-producer">was seen as the final nail in the coffin for Dino Crisis</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But today, July 1, to celebrate Dino Crisis’ birthday, Capcom tweeted a picture of a bloody dinosaur foot, which some hopeful fans were taking as a positive sign.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">7月1日は『ディノクライシス』(1999年/PS)の発売日です！ <a href="https://t.co/s6vdi8ukQM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/s6vdi8ukQM</a></p>— CAPCOM公式 (@capcom_official) <a href="https://twitter.com/capcom_official/status/1807685651867082915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Capcom, though, has plenty to be getting on with right now. It’s got <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> due out at some point in 2025, as well as multiple Resident Evil remakes and a brand new Resident Evil game. Then there’s the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced">Dead Rising remake</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a>. Is there a place for Dino Crisis in Capcom's lineup? Only time will tell.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hard-difficulty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is an albatross hanging around the neck of the latest FromSoftware release, the same as every FromSoftware release: difficulty. The problem is that talking about difficulty in the abstract like it’s a set value is boring, reactionary, and not particularly productive, It obfuscates the real trade-offs that From often makes with their games, and <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is very much a game of trade-offs. And the worst thing about it is that talking about these games critically with nuance is simply not that difficult.</p><h2>Mixed Blessings</h2><figure><figcaption>If you've gotten to this point you know exactly what this game's deal was, or at least you did a year or two ago.

The placement, aside from its lore implications, is a significant choice and establishes who the DLC was always meant for: everyone who has beaten the extreme ends of <em>Elden Ring</em> into the ground, have hit the ends of the base game and gotten to around level 150. By touching the The Cocoon of the Empyrean, you are transported to The Land of Shadow, a reality with its own special rules.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Warning: Minor location, weapon, and boss spoilers ahead, although I have attempted to avoid discussing major plot elements whenever possible.</strong> </p><p>The second you go into the Land of Shadow, you quickly notice that everything in it hits you like a fucking fire truck. To balance the fact that people are probably overleveled going into this expansion, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> introduces a new mechanic, centred around items called Scadutree Fragments. By collecting these fragments, you are able to power up both the damage you deal and the damage you take. This is where nuance is important, because while the rationale for this system is smart and addresses a very real problem, it’s implemented quite badly.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>You will find Scadutree fragments around here, sometimes, mostly. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>It is clear that FromSoftware, who have created a gargantuan world, would like you to explore all of it instead of just boss rushing the whole thing, (To reduce this release to simple DLC would be underselling it, although I disagree that this is basically a sequel.) But they both clumsily tell you about the Scadutree Fragment system while never really stressing how significant a difference it makes in the basic playability of the DLC. The scaling, at least at launch, was gargantuan. What's more, by hiding leveling in a Korok-ass collectible, progression becomes a fetch quest.&nbsp;</p><p>This would be fine if there was some kind of cohesion about where shards appear, but there’s only a vague rhyme or reason behind their placement. Initially it seems like they mostly stay around crucifixes, but sometimes guys who have jars have them, and sometimes they are near statues, but also sometimes big hippos carry them, and once I saw one in a coffin under a waterfall. You could argue that this is no different than hiding Golden Seed flask upgrades, but I feel like those are fundamentally different mechanics. There’s a better way they could have done this, and I feel slightly vindicated here given the fact that they aggressively patched the scaling of the system as I was writing this blog, making the initial Scadutree Fragments more significant, and the later ones more gradual.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lands Between&nbsp;</h2><figure><figcaption>The verticality in these games is breathtaking, the map is somewhat annoying. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>Forcing the player to explore the world is a valid choice, because <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>has some of the most gorgeous landscapes I have ever seen in a game. But many of those vistas are also a little empty, even by <em>Elden Ring </em>standards. It’s not uncommon to see beautiful, striking biome in the distance, get there, and then find like two things to do in them.&nbsp;</p><p>I do admit there’s a kind of beauty to a huge, empty space. The Abyssal Woods are terrifying, so much so that your mount will not let you summon it, forcing you to take this space on foot. And some of these locations serve important storytelling purposes just by dint of being there, like the Finger Ruins. And yet I can’t shake the feeling that the entire thing was either scaled back at one point, or that the game itself is simply masquerading as a much larger experience, like a bag of potato chips as my colleague Ash Parrish observed on Aftermath Hours. This was always a fundamental compromise of the base game, particularly near the end, but in <em>Erdtree </em>it is felt much more aggressively. I don’t even know that I want more things to do in those places; the expansion is the perfect length to me, but I can’t help but feel a sense of disappointment, or that these areas feel unfinished, a sensation that <em>Elden Ring</em> delivered much less frequently.&nbsp; Like the base game, <em>Erdtree </em>has a very showy beginning and middle, but loses cohesion in the extremities and the back section. That said, there are real highlights to the end, especially in the way the structure of the final area looks like an impossible Rodin sculpture.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Some of the most breathtaking environments in any video game. I wish they were not so hollow. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most striking things about the map is its verticality. Much of the Shadow Realm consists of massive cliffs and valleys, and there is something breathtaking about seeing locations far in the distance and wondering “how the hell am I going to get there?” This is a valid question, and one you may ask yourself repeatedly, because the routes to get to those places are inorganic and uneven in a way that I don’t personally find enjoyable. Artistically, there is validity to making huge parts of your map aggressively convoluted to find, but I always found that to be both the most elusive part and greatest weakness of Miquella's Haligtree in the original game. But unlike the Haligtree, there’s no <em>there</em> when you get there in <em>Erdtree</em>, and the tease of having these spaces that are distant and gorgeous but ultimately hollow half the time left me cold.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who’s the Boss?</h2><figure><figcaption>This game features some of the best and most confusingly tuned boss fights From has ever done. Rellana is a standout. Credit: Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>There is also the issue of bosses in this game, and in my fair assessment as a From player, there’s simply a lot of bullshit here. This is not unusual for a From game, and I love a lot of bullshit Souls bosses.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the bosses themselves are the logical conclusion trying to one up <em>Elden Ring</em>, and to account for players already having a medium sized arsenal of disgustingly broken gear. Some of the bosses, like the Golden Hippo or the Shadow Sunflower, are just straight up bad, the big sloppy monster type that is often in line with From’s weakest offerings. A few of the bosses are among their most creative and beautiful designs, featuring gorgeous cutscenes. Rellana and Messmer are standouts here. A huge portion of them have either some tremendously cheesy thermonuclear bomb up their sleeve, some flowing combo similar to Malenia’s Waterfowl Dance, or both. A handful are tuned very bizarrely, and favor certain playstyles and builds overly aggressively. The final boss is particularly guilty of this.</p><figure><figcaption>Everyone hates this hippo. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the choices make sense, as <em>Elden Ring’s </em>design was originally about offering the player some unreasonable challenges coupled with almost too many options than could be playtested at launch, and seeing how the player base could break the game. This flexibility gave it a mass market appeal that previous games did not. In terms of design, <em>Erdtree</em> is no different. I see a lot of people complain that these encounters are too “hard,” but a more accurate word is “unsatisfying.” Are these encounters balanced well, and what audience are they balanced for? Is that the same audience of 25 million that bought the game, or diehards who solo Malenia naked wearing a big fungus helmet? Is the friction rewarding and meaningful and does eking out a win feel good? There are some shining standouts, but a lot of times the answer for me is no.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Shadow of the Erdtree</h2><figure><figcaption>I will say, I like these guys. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes I wonder what lessons From took away from the meme-like popularity of Malenia, the optional ultra hard boss hidden deep in an easily missable section of the original game, because I feel her presence, the tradeoffs in her design and location, a lot in this game. But aside from the decisions that are outright bad, I don’t know how much I can fault the developers for how <em>Erdtree </em>is shaped, because many of the things I personally dislike are simply the logical conclusion to conceptual tradeoffs FromSoftware made to make a game as gargantuan as <em>Elden Ring</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Reskinning bosses and locations from other games and encounters has long been one of From’s favorite bits, and oftentimes they are good at recontextualizing assets in a way that either adds a new spin to them, contributes to the lore, or is very funny. Sometimes in <em>Elden Ring </em>this was implemented poorly or contributed to fluff: for example, there’s no reason for me to fight Astel twice, when even as an optional fight this choice made the first fight less special. This also rears its head aggressively in the DLC, where many lesser bosses are reskins of enemies that I have already fought, in a way that is <em>not </em>additive. Many of the dragons you find in the fields will feel familiar. One dragon in particular is very annoyingly balanced in a way that feels both cheap and disrespectful to the original encounter. To From’s credit, however, Bayle The Dread is very much worth fighting.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>You can fight these guys a whole lot if you'd like. Credit: Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>I would be remiss if I did not praise the new gear and spells here. I got through much of the DLC with a weapon called Milady and using an ash called Wing Stance to bleed enemies to death. The hand-to-hand combat weapons are enjoyable, although they feel conservatively balanced to be initially underwhelming. Giant katanas are a welcome touch, as are perfume bottles, which are currently busted the same way Hoarfrost Stomp was at launch. <a href="https://youtu.be/v20jFYM0nLI?si=xPoHbd3f_UzozQMZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTuber Syrobe discovered that Rolling Sparks ash</a>, when aimed at the ground and with a specific loadout, will decimate any boss in less than 20 seconds. Probably the best addition is the Deflecting Hardtear, a flask upgrade that temporarily buffs timed blocks to behave closer to <em>Sekiro</em>. Considering that <em>Sekiro </em>is From’s best game, and people have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/3471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensively modded</a> the base game to add <em>Sekiro-</em>style combat, that was a good choice.</p><figure><figcaption>I would be shocked if they don't nerf this Ash of War. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>From games aren’t for everyone of course, but they’re also not for every From fan. They don’t have to be, which is an important part of this. I think <em>Bloodborne </em>and <em>Sekiro </em>are their most finely tuned games, in part because they are scoped much tighter. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>needs to account for so many variables because it’s an extension of <em>Elden Ring</em>, itself extended from the <em>Souls </em>games. There’s a million ways to beat every boss; it is an action RPG<em> </em>after all. Chasing that meta is itself a system to engage with, one that I find fun in the abstract but that has never got me to the same place of pure, placid flow as the Genichiro fight from <em>Sekiro </em>or even many of the fights in <em>Armored Core </em>VI.</p><p>I should stress that I do very much like <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. There is a lot to praise about it, particularly when it comes to visual design, music and how it adds to the lore, which rank among FromSoftware’s best work. But it is following up on <em>Elden Ring</em>, a once-in-a-decade game that was a singular, impossible achievement when the industry itself seemed devastated by covid. Even if things had gone perfectly, it would be hard to recapture that same sense of grandeur, because the reality is you can’t enter the same Siofra River twice.&nbsp;</p><h2>“Hit them where they’re weakest”</h2><figure><figcaption>Why tell me this? Who do you think I am? Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>There is one series of choices in <em>Erdtree </em>that may seem very minor but make me mad every time I think about them. Occasionally in the expansion, you will see messages infrequently left on the ground not by players but by the developers. Alexis Ong noted this in their (quite good)<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Eurogamer review of the game</a>, but I was not prepared for how inelegant these messages are. One group of them pertain to the behaviors of a very specific group of enemies. I will try to avoid spoiling the area or the enemies themselves, but they behave atypically. “Hide yourself,” “Await your chance,” “crouch in the undergrowth,” “combat is not an option.” Aside from sounding like tips in an Ubisoft open world game, that last bit of advice is categorically wrong in ways that are actively misleading, and not in a playful FromSoft way (several player notes around them advise the correct way to deal with the enemies.). There are other examples, like a lumbering golem with high defense and a huge obvious weak spot on its back. The game politely tells me “Hit them where they’re weakest,” as though I would never figure that out under my own steam. The worst offender I saw was a message that just said “I’ll be damned if there isn’t a way past the wall,” which seemed to nudge me to look for a small hole in the back of the building. I would understand this if it was in a mission critical area, but it’s just some side building with some stuff inside it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Who is the audience for this information? Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>These choices, which I am guessing are the result of playtesting, are baffling to me because it goes against so much of From’s design philosophy. Do they not have faith that the notes laid by players are enough? Are they not confident in their design choices, and if not, why resort to a note instead of addressing those choices? And who do they think is reading these notes, hidden in optional content, down labyrinthine paths, in an aggressively challenging 40 dollar expansion that is, itself, hidden inside an optional end game dungeon? Again, it’s a very minor complaint in the grand scheme of things, but it made me severely doubt that From totally knows what they are doing, which I don’t do that often.</p><h2>Sound and Fury</h2><p>The worst part about all of this is the sheer amount of noise adjacent to any criticism of From games. Many people can be normal. But when it does manifest it’s either wildly reductive to the work or, more often, a childish accusation that the critic does not understand or is bad at the game. (I saw this happen in real time about the aforementioned EuroGamer review.) The latter is some Reddit six years ago shit, so much so that it feels quaint. This is annoying because I know firsthand that if you willingly sign up for FromSoft duty at a publication you’re very probably qualified to do it. I know this because I have been on hand for these pre-release. It can be gruelling and I am glad that I have never had to put a number next to any of them. The largest issue is that these games are designed for and react to the ecosystem they are released in, and so going into one of them half blind and under a hard deadline before that equilibrium is established is fundamentally more difficult and limited than the average player will face. This goes doubly so for people who do guides work; they are saints and angels who hold up half of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>But even in ideal conditions, my favorite conversations about these games happen well after their release. I have talked to friends who rank this expansion among their favorite things FromSoftware has ever done, and others who really hated it in the second half. Aside from being living texts, people’s relationships to these games are deeply personal, and I feel better having taken my time with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, to have digested it like a big meal, and to think about how it sat with me. I am glad that I can write this without SEO optimization or deadlines. I think these games deserve nuance, but what do I know? I liked <em>Dark Souls 2</em>.</p><p>See? That wasn’t that&nbsp;difficult.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
