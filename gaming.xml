            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/5-triple-i-announcements-you-need-to-know-about<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While events like Nintendo Directs, PlayStation States of Play, and Xbox Showcases get all the headlines and coverage, often many of the best games are hiding just out of sight as indie games. These are innovative, clever, or otherwise different affairs than what we see from most of the big budget studios, but produce standout hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Blue Prince"><em>Blue Prince</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stardew Valley"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a>. Last year, some studios banded together for the Triple I Initiative, to create their own showcase event, and it was back today.</p>

<p>Fast paced, and without any of the clutter that you see from a lot of showcases (no Day-9 PC Gaming show shenanigans here), the Triple I Initiative shows off some of the most promising indie games coming. While I firmly believe you should watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnNhA7vLgZ0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Triple I Initative 2025 Showcase">the whole showcase</a>, I’ve picked out 5 announcements that I think you need to know about.</p>

<p><br><strong>Honorable Mention</strong>: I’m not a huge fan of it, but I know many people are, so here’s a brief shout out to Poncle’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vampire Survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, which had a delightfully weird trailer to announce their new free DLC available today that is a crossover with the <em>SaGa </em>series called Emerald Diorama. There’s also a general update with more goodies, so plenty of new content for Vampire Survivors fans.</p>

<h2>The Alters release date</h2>

<p>11 Bit Studios for the past decade has made their name with thought provoking and intriguing titles that push players to think while including deep game play mechanics in games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/this-war-of-mine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="This War of Mine"><em>This War of Mine </em></a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/frostpunk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Frostpunk"><em>Frostpunk 1</em></a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-balance-resources-or-city-will-burn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Frostpunk 2 Review - Balance Resources Or The City Will Burn">and <em>2</em></a>. Their next major title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/alters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Alters"><em>The Alters</em></a>, is one that I’ve been watching and really want to see as it seems to continue that lineage, with a new approach, as they seem to do each time.</p>


<p>Following a delay earlier this year, we now have a new <em>The Alters </em>release date, as we can expect to all become Jan on June 13th, and explore the differences between nurture and nature, as well as questions of identity.</p>

<h2>Duskfade Announced</h2>

<p>3D Action Adventure Platformers are a genre that came into being in the era of the PlayStation 1 and N64, and only a couple generations later it seemed to fade out for the grittier tones that the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 wanted. While we’ve seen the return of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Spyro Reignited Trilogy"><em>Spyro</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/crash-bandicoot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Crash Bandicoot"><em>Crash Bandicoot </em></a>in recent years, as well as the emergence of titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hat-in-time-review-change-system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" A Hat In Time Review - Change The System"><em>A Hat In Time</em></a>, there seems to be plenty of room for developers here in the larger indie space to fill, and that’s right where <em>Duskfade </em>fits in.</p>


<p><br>
A gorgeous looking game being published by Fireshine Games, it is described as an action platformer set in a clockpunk world. Hop on and off walls, go around, and slash things as Zirian in what was, in my opinion, a real coming out party for developer Weird Beluga, and has my eyes peeled to see more in 2026.</p>

<h2>Moonlighter 2 Release Date</h2>

<p>Digital Sun emerged onto the indie scene with the first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/moonlighter-review-buy-it-at-high-price" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monlighter Review"><em>Moonlighter</em></a>, and only gained more attention with last year’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-sales-120k-two-weeks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Manor Lords Publisher's Cataclismo Racks Up 120k Sales in Two Weeks"><em>Cataclismo</em></a>. Now, they’ve returned to their roots, with a sequel that promises to once again mix action and shop keeping in <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>.</p>


<p>While not quite my favorite of the odd genre of shopkeeping/action RPG (<em>Racettear </em>still holds number 1 in my heart), the first Moonlighter focus on combat led to a smooth, fast playing action roguelite that was a ton of fun, with great visuals in a relatively uncovered area of the gaming space. Now it’s sequel promises to take us to a new town, and be even bigger and better, including new features regarding shopkeeping the first game could have used.</p>

<p><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> is coming this summer, so strap on your backpacks and get ready to&nbsp; roll, slash, and sell later this year.</p>

<h2>Endless Legend 2 Release Date</h2>

<p>The first game I ever did a game review for was the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/endless-legends-review-never-ends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Endless Legend Review - Neverending"><em>Endless Legend</em></a>, and so I admittedly have a soft spot for it. I also have a soft spot for 4x games in general, and <em>Endless Legend </em>was an innovative title in a genre that had been stagnant in the area for a while, often swallowed by the influence of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/civilization-vii" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Civilization 7"><em>Civilization</em></a>.</p>


<p>Now, more than a decade later, we get <em>Endless Legend 2</em>, in an era when the genre’s title bearer has been taking more challengers to the throne. None of them have managed to really reach it’s heights, so there’s space for the great people at Amplitude to do what everyone else has failed to quite hit, and give us a proper <em>Civilization </em>killer, in their first game after leaving Sega. <em>Engless Legend 2</em> is hitting early access this summer.</p>

<h2>Frostrail Announced</h2>

<p>I don’t know what it is about trains and snow that seems to have gotten to everyone, myself included. For some reason, the idea of a train in a world covered in a winter apocalypse seems to have become an image that we all are interested in exploring, perhaps ever since we first saw <em>Snowpiercer</em>. Whether it’s in the original french graphic novel form, the movie, the tv show, or just in works taking inspiration from it, for over a decade it has been an ongoing thing.</p>


<p>It was perhaps inevitable that it would come to video games as well, though <em>Frostrail </em>isn’t an official <em>Snowpiercer </em>game. Instead, it’s a co-op survival crafting style game from the creators of <em>Barotrauma</em>, and published by Shiro (<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wartales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wartales"><em>Wartales</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/evoland-2-review-celebrate-gaming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Evoland 2 Review – Celebrate Gaming"><em>Evoland 2</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/northgard-preview-viking-smoothie" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Northard Preview"><em>Northgard</em></a>, and more). Gather resources, fight off enemies in FPS battles, and try to survive a world that wants to kill you. Well, wants to kill you even more than our current world does.</p>

<p><em>Frostrail </em>looks like a lot of fun, and while I’m not a longterm player of these games, I can see myself plugging in a decent amount of time into this with friends when it releases in early access in 2026.</p>

<hr><p>Overall, the Triple I Initiative had a great event and I strongly encourage you to watch it all if you want to know about games coming out in the next 18 months that aren't from the biggest publishers. In fact, you can watch it right here:</p>

                <p>Nintendo has added a new batch of classic games for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/making-sure-games-can-pass-age-ratings-around-the-world-is-a-very-niche-but-also-very-important-job.1161372/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/video-game-age-ratings<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to another instalment of<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> What I Do, a regular Aftermath feature</a> that takes a single person doing a single job in the video game industry and explains just what, <em>exactly</em>, that job involves.</p><p>Today we're speaking with Nic McConnell, whose official job title is "Manager - Game Production" at Riot Games, but whose <em>actual job</em>--working with folks on age ratings across the range of content created by Riot on a regular basis--is a lot more interesting than a one-line term on a business card can contain.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: Nic, hello, welcome to Aftermath! Can you tell us a bit about yourself?</strong></p><p><strong>Nic McConnell</strong>: I'm someone who sort of backed into video games - I went to school for broadcasting but graduated right when the economy tanked in 2008, dashing those plans. To earn even a little money I wound up getting a job in firmware QA at SIE (SCEA at the time) and sort of floated around the QA space for a while before dipping out and working in market research and then adtech (sorry). The thing is, I <em>love</em> video games and am in awe of the people who make them. I always wanted to get closer to game dev, so I took opportunities when they arose - first at a place called Skillz, then Niantic (both in account and partner management) before finally getting an opportunity to completely shift gears and join Riot as a manager supporting our global age ratings efforts as well as some more general regional sensitivity considerations.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of work, my just-for-fun side thing is a weekly stream where I read video game instruction manuals;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hic5wyueimjeowjtpsxuv752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it's called Instruction Derby</a> and it's More Fun Than You Might Think Given The Concept (should this be my official slogan?).&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that I'm so lucky to have a cool and supportive wife, amazing kids and a very cuddle-centric dog named Noodles all here with me in the Bay Area. I also have a Neo Geo cabinet, which I try not to make my whole personality but that's hard because have you played <em>Neo Turf Masters</em>? It's so good.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <strong>I'm more of a </strong><a href="https://aftermath.site/super-baseball-2020-ruled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Super Baseball 2020</em></strong></a><strong> man myself. So in terms of working in video games, what's your actual, exact job title?</strong></p><div><p><strong>NMc</strong>: My actual, exact job title is Manager - Game Production.</p><p><strong>LP: So what does that job actually involve? Like, what's your average day/week/month look like?</strong></p></div><p><strong>NMc</strong>: So, it's fairly varied, but boiled down it's split into two kinds of buckets.</p><p>The first bucket is actually a pipeline - I'm responsible for the overall health and impact of a really cool tool that allows for new and in-development game stuff (art, skins, levels, etc) to be reviewed by our colleagues around the world for both age ratings concerns (e.g., will this skinline risk bumping us from a GRAC 12 to a GRAC 15 in Korea?) and cultural sensitivity (e.g., if a character makes a hand gesture in an emote, is it accidentally a rude gesture in Italy?).&nbsp;</p><p>This side of the job involves a lot of discussion of different art with the amazing Age Ratings team and brainstorming improvements with my amazing team who make the whole thing work. I'm not particularly technical so watching that process play out is so incredibly impressive to me.</p><p><strong>LP: And the second bucket?</strong></p><p><strong>NMc</strong>: The second bucket is focused around understanding how age ratings efforts vary around the world and designing strategies for keeping on top of things as the world changes rapidly all around us. This part of the job is particularly exciting for me because it involves loads of conversations with colleagues around the world, learning about what's happening in their countries and how geopolitical shifts may impact our work.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Is there anything you'd like to see changed, or improved, about your job? Or its place in the wider industry?</strong></p><p><strong>NMc</strong>: I'm not sure I'd honestly change or improve much - I'm given an incredible opportunity to support people around the world, to learn from them and to build relationships with them, which for me is absolutely awesome. I suppose if I could change one thing about Age Ratings in the industry it would just be that I'd like for more people to have a chance to try it out! It's pretty cool stuff but I think gets a bad rap because so often it's just another task on a release manager's incredibly full plate.</p><p><strong>LP: And finally, what is it about your job that you love the most?</strong></p><p><strong>NMc</strong>: This sounds really corny but - the people.

            <p>
Here's a small but notable detail that might have passed you by amid the chaos of information that's spiralled out of last week's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> reveal: the souped-up Switch 2 Edition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> won't include any of its paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
That perhaps isn't a huge surprise given Nintendo has never claimed otherwise, but it seems the company's Switch 2 Edition sales pitch - which has had an air of 'definitive edition' about it - might have led to some confusion. 
</p>
<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is, to recap, one of six special Switch 2 Editions - basically, enhanced versions of existing Switch games - revealed during last week's Direct, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokémon Legends Z-A also getting similar spruce-ups.

</div><figcaption>Eurogamer goes hands-on with Mario Kart World.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU8yIgC206g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Each Switch 2 Edition includes frame rate and resolutions bumps, alongside a variety of game-specific features, and is available to purchase as a standalone digital or physical release. And that's in addition to the paid upgrade path Nintendo is offering to anyone who already owns the Switch 1 original. It's just convoluted enough to be a little confusing, and the fact Nintendo is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">selling its Switch 2 Editions at a premium price</a> compared to the originals has muddied the waters further - but the company has now moved to clarify Breath of the Wild's Switch 2 Edition doesn't come with its previously released paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC," the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">wrote in a statement to IGN</a>. "That DLC is available as a separate purchase." As such, anyone looking for the full Breath of the Wild experience on Switch 2 will be needing to set aside just shy of £85 based on Nintendo's own pricing.
</p>
<p>
That sounds like a lot for an eight-year-old game and its DLC, but it's far from the only price point that's raised eyebrows following Switch 2's reveal. The cost of the console itself has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">received plenty of pushback from fans</a> - and that was before the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">potential impact of US tariffs</a> - and then there's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">£75 price tag for Mario Kart World</a>, or the news Nintendo is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-charging-for-switch-2s-tutorial-game-because-of-the-amount-of-care-and-work-put-into-it">charging $10 USD for Switch 2's Welcome Tour tutorial game</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">console looks promising</a> and its two flagship games have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-keeping-quiet-about-donkey-kong-bananzas-developer-but-it-feels-like-a-souped-up-super-mario-odyssey">received plenty of praise</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">some early hands-on time</a> - but it's clear Nintendo has work to do to shake off the lingering controversy around Switch 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-70-million-prize-pool/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Esports World Cup is shaping up to return to Riyadh this summer, and it has just been confirmed that it’ll feature a monumental prize pool worth <strong>$70 million</strong>. This is a new all-time high for the esports industry, topping the record set by the Esports World Cup Foundation with last year’s $60 million prize pool.</p>



<p>It was stated by the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation, Ralf Reichert, that the team wanted to have ‘room for growth’, and the only way was well and truly <strong>up </strong>this year. This prize pool includes a staggering $7 million prize reserved for <strong>one organisation </strong>that tops the Club Championship.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-in">All In</h2>



<p>The Esports World Cup is, by sheer scope, the biggest competitive gaming event in human history. It features a full line-up of the most popular esports titles in the world, and it takes place over two-months in the heart of Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>It’s lavish, it’s opulent, and it’s designed to be the grandest spectacle the gaming world has ever seen.</p>



<p>Everything from the event’s opening ceremony to how trophies are awarded is bursting with pantomime and innovation. Last year’s event saw losing teams hand over their ‘piece’ of the trophy to the winning team to crush in a hydraulic press. That’s intense.</p>



<p>In a statement, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation explained what represents the pinnacle of the event:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you look at the Esports World Cup, the Club Championship is what holds it together.</p>



<p>On the one hand it’s fantastic that we have all of these games and can bring them together at one point in time, which is unique, then the Club Championship is what makes it a story and wraps it together. We don’t consider it as a side element but at the very heart and centre of the Esports World Cup. Naturally, this should have the highest prize money.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full list of games appearing at the Esports World Cup in 2025 is nothing short of incredible. From Tekken 8 to Call of Duty and from Rocket League to League of Legends, there’s a spot and a show for everyone. Even Chess is set to appear, as is Rainbow Six Siege X and Rennsport.</p>



<p>It’s a veritable feast of competitive gaming action, and you can follow it all here at Insider Gaming.</p>

                <p>No one is doing more for mascot platformers than Toys for Bob. Since 2018, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-4-studio-toys-for-bob-goes-independent-from-microsoft/1100-6521496/" data-ref-id="1100-6521496">formerly Microsoft-owned studio</a> has released the Spyro Reignited Trilogy, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Crash Bandicoot 4, and Crash Team Rumble, reinvigorating two beloved but largely stagnant franchises. Now, Toys for Bob co-studio head and creative director Paul Yan says the studio has its eyes on another iconic platforming series: Banjo-Kazooie.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CanadianGuyEh" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CanadianGuyE</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CanadianGuyEh" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">h</a>--which was then reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/since-going-independent-of-activision-microsoft-and-xbox-studio-toys-for-bob-says-theyd-love-to-work-on-a-banjo-kazooie-in-a-new-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>--Yan discussed Toys for Bob's upcoming projects. On top of seemingly teasing a new entry in the Spyro the Dragon series, Yan expressed the team's desire to work with Xbox on bringing back the dynamic bird and bear duo, Banjo-Kazooie.</p><p>"One company we'd like to work with is one we're already working with--Team Xbox! They've been a great partner and they also have a very interesting roster of characters that Toys for Bob could have a lot of fun with. The honey bear is the first one that comes to mind--I think we can all agree Banjo's been hibernating long enough, right?" Yan said.</p><p>Though this certainly doesn't mean a Banjo-Kazooie remake or reboot is already in the works, Toys for Bob's past work and relationship with Xbox makes this collaboration seem more like a matter of "when" than "if." Despite the studio breaking apart from the Microsoft-owned studio Activision back in 2023, it has continued to work closely with Xbox, and is currently collaborating with the company on an upcoming project that many <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/spyro-4-rumours-toys-for-bob-tease/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">speculate to be Spyro the Dragon 4</a>. Though Yan said he "can't spill the beans just yet" on the upcoming project, he assured fans that development is going well.</p><p>"I will say that we're very much in the thick of development. The team is very thrilled about how the experience is shaping up. This game is big and ambitious and pushes our craft to new heights."</p><p>Prior to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-4-studio-toys-for-bob-goes-independent-from-microsoft/1100-6521496/" data-ref-id="1100-6521496">leaving Activision</a>, Toys for Bob had been moved from working on the whimsical platformers it's known for to assist the Call of Duty series as a support studio. According to a former senior concept artist, Nicholas Kole, the team was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-artist-says-fifth-game-was-canceled/1100-6524957/" data-ref-id="1100-6524957">forced to scrap Crash Bandicoot 5</a>. After 86 employees were laid off from the studio as a part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/" data-ref-id="1100-6510650">Microsoft's 2023 mass layoffs</a>, the studio sought, and was given, independence.</p>

                <p>Anyone familiar with Nintendo's favorite gourmand Kirby knows that the pink blob has an insatiable appetite.

The left earcup shows Kirby preparing to inhale the headphones, while the right earcup displays Kirby's "mouthful" face.</p><p>As for the audio specs and performance, these are basic 3.5mm stereo headphones with 50mm dynamic speaker drivers and a detachable boom mic.

I was quite pleasantly surprised when it was announced last year that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-is-the-sequel-to-the-shopkeeping-dungeon-crawler-out-next-year">getting a sequel</a>. In that "oh, I never would have guessed this game would get one" kind of way. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a>, as its full name goes, doesn't have an exact release date just yet, but during today's Triple-I showcase it did get a release window, which is the next best thing I suppose. It's a vague-ish window though, sometime this summer.
</p>

<p>
That's not too far away at least, given that by my understanding of the way the Northern Hemisphere works summer is the next season. Might be a bit awkward if developer Digital Sun were based in the Southern Hemisphere, but last I checked Spain was in the Northern one, so we should be good.

<p>
The new trailer showed off a pretty nice look at the game too, which is looking quite lovely. Obviously the first game was all pixel art, whereas this one's taking the 3D approach - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enter-the-dungeon-2-gets-a-reveal-almost-a-decade-on-from-the-first-one-looks-like-more-of-the-same-but-in-3d">seems to be a bit of a trend these days</a> - and I think it's been translated very well so far.
</p>
<p>
As before you'll be exploring dungeons, fighting baddies, and most importantly grabbing loot to bring back to your shop to hopefully sell on and make a fat wad of cash. You'll apparently be able to invest in the local village so that you can eventually get better weapons and things like that. Everything looks neat if you ask me!
</p>
<p>
Again, no exact release date, but whenever Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault arrives this summer, it'll do so as an early access release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-old-country-release-date-revealed-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release date for Mafia: The Old Country has seemingly been revealed in a blog post published on Steam a short while ago. It looks as though the game will be released on August 8, 2025 – previously, the game only had a ‘window’ of 2025.</p>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country was first teased in August at the Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony, with a fuller trailer dropping in December 2024 at The Game Awards. Take-Two could have a stacked release slate lined up now, with Mafia: The Old Country, Borderlands 4, and GTA 6 all dropping within mere months of each other.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-go-to-the-old-country">Go to The Old Country</h2>



<p>The post that was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999?l=latam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published on Steam</a> mentions that the developers are hosting a live stream at PAX on May 8. They’ll be talking about the past, present, and future of the franchise, which spans a whopping 23 years.</p>



<p>At the base of the post, it reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country is available August 8, 2025. Pre-order now for PlayStation®5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, and stay tuned to the&nbsp;official&nbsp;Mafia&nbsp;website&nbsp;for more information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1910450426740088833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">videotechuk_</a> on Twitter)</p>



<p>This is the first indication we’ve had of a solid release date for Mafia: The Old Country. Until now, we’ve been working with a broad window of ‘2025’, which is as vague as it gets.</p>



<p>In Mafia: The Old Country, players will explore the very origins of the organised crime network in Sicily. It’s a journey back in time to the early 1900s, and it promises to be brutal, intriguing, and stunning as a game. It’s being pieced together by Hanger 13, the team that worked on Mafia III, Mafia: Definitive Edition, and TopSpin 2K25.</p>



<p>One of those games is not like the other.</p>



<p>This highly anticipated game will be the first new entry in the series since 2016’s Mafia III turned heads, and I, for one, cannot wait.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Mafia: The Old Country being released? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest talking points surrounding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> since its official announcement has been focused on the price of the console and its games--some believe the prices are simply too much.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSu0BQFTFPA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayerDriven</a>, former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden said Nintendo can charge what it wants for new first-party Switch 2 games because Nintendo makes compelling games. Some people might perceive the price increase for a game like Mario Kart World ($80) as being "hefty," Layden said, but in the end, people will buy it anyway.</p><p>"If it's the only place where you can play Mario, then you get your wallet out and you buy into it... and Donkey Kong and Zelda. That first-party exclusivity kind of mitigates the sticker shock, if you will, of these price hikes, because you want that content so bad," he said (<a

years.</p><p>"In 2025 dollars, $59.99 in 1999 is equivalent to $100. Your purchasing power compared to your cost of living, it's much smaller now than it was before, but still companies have been reluctant to push that price up," he said, adding that he thinks publishers should have charged $5 more for new games each new console generation.</p><p>Meanwhile, actor and video game developer Abubakar Salim told <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/abubakar-salim-why-price-of-games-accessible/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> that inclusivity is an important consideration to remember in a conversation about general socioeconomic issues. Salim questioned why Nintendo is charging more for the Switch 2 console and games.</p><p>"We're in a very tough time at the moment, so why make it harder and have that bar eventually so high? Yeah, I was a bit upset about the price changes, because Nintendo is a family game, Nintendo is a family genre. It's a family platform," Salim said.</p><p>For Mario Kart World, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">defended the $80 price point</a> by saying the game is a worthy upgrade over Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and people will understand this after the April 17 Nintendo Direct. Meanwhile, others have said Nintendo chose to price Mario Kart World at $80 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-80-because-thats-what-people-will-pay-for-it-analyst-says/1100-6530715/" data-ref-id="1100-6530715">simply because it can.</a></p><p>At $450, the Switch 2 is about $50 more than the original Switch with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">inflation factored in</a>.

            <p>
I suspect I might be in a minority here, but I can confidently say I didn't use a single repair kit as I bumbled and faffed my way through MachineGames' excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> late last year - mainly because I was so enamoured by the game's ludicrous clobbering loop I couldn't take two steps forward without hoovering up another handful of melee-focused bric-a-brac. So I very much appreciate that Indy's latest update finally gives my never-diminishing stash of repair kits a purpose by letting me lob them at foes.
</p>
<p>
Besides that, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's Update 4 comes with a heap of tweaks and changes designed to further enhance its already excellent action, starting with two new Adventure Books that'll provide Indy with some additional whip-focused benefits. Open Season, for instance, creates a temporary window after whipping enemies in which they'll take increased damage from subsequent attacks. And with Sleight of Hand, Indy can pull an enemy's weapon towards him after disarming them with the whip.
</p>
<p>
That brings us to Update 4's dozen or so quality of life improvements. These include new one-liners for Indy during fights, meaning you'll get a bit of extra vocal variety while punching Nazis and other miscreants. And Machine Games says Ray-traced Global Illumination has also been improved across all platforms "at no performance cost".

<p>
Elsewhere, there's now a timer around Indy's health showing how long you'll need to wait until enemies call off a search, and a number of UI elements and effects - specifically the HUD's centre dot and "stealth" vignette while crouching - can now be toggled on or off. Additionally, the journal has seen some improvements while in its somewhat fiddly "lowered" state; you can see more of it, for starters, and it's now possible to switch between local and level maps.
</p>
<p>
Moving on, there's a new "Always Allow Skipping Cutscenes" option if you have absolutely no patience for cinematic chatter; there are a couple off new tutorials; the menu for purchasing Adventure Books and map information booklets has been improved; the PC version now supports the PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller for advanced haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, and PlayStation or Steam Deck controllers will now show up in the controller configuration menu on PC. And for more on Update 4's lengthy list of bug fixes, you'll be <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/7gQFCUktT0FwdnHFlcZVOV/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-4?linkId=100000356791847">wanting to check out MachineGames' patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's fourth major update is now live on PC and Xbox, and it seems reasonable to expect all its additions and improvements will feature in the PlayStation 5 release when it launches next Thursday, 17th April. And it is, of course, well worth picking up. "Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in our five star review</a>, "The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames" - and that was before we went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">name it Eurogamer's game of the year in 2024</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-releases-out-of-early-access-in-september/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developed by Funday Games and published by Ghost Ship Games, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is the rougelike auto-shooter spin-off of first-person co-op mining shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deep-rock-galactic-a-dwarf-is-always-a-dwarf-even-in-space/">Deep Rock Galactic</a>. The top-down adventure launched in early access on Steam in February 2024, and Ghost Ship Games announced today it'll launch out of early access later this year.</p>
<p>Announced during the Triple-I Initiative Showcase, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor will hit its 1.0 launch on <strong>September 17, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>It'll be available on PC through Steam at launch, though hopefully, once it hits 1.0, we'll hear something about when it'll be moving to consoles.</p>
<p>Over 1 million players have already dived into Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor since its release a little more than a year ago, and in that time, Funday Games has released multiple new biomes and characters for players to try out, with more sure to come when its 1.0 release arrives.</p>
<p>Unlike Deep Rock Galactic, which has a co-op focus, Survivor is a single-player game that challenges players to take down waves of hordes of aliens. At the same time, you search for anything and everything shiny and valuable.</p>
<p>Funday Games promises that the 1.0 update will be "<em>the biggest update we've ever made</em>," though the exact details of the update remain unclear. Fans are hoping that it will include the anticipated endless mode, which was previously delayed from the last content update for Survivor, as Funday Games opted to focus on getting Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor ready for its September 1.0 release instead.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor - 1.0 Release Date Trailer | The Triple-i Initiative" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fxv51gpDO3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer for its release date does show players, though, that a new mechanic, 'Gear,' will be added with 1.0. Unfortunately, we don't have any concrete answers to how players get it, what functions gear has, or any other questions players have about it. Funday is holding off on those details until the game's release is closer.</p>
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor's release date wasn't the only news from Ghost Ship Games during the Triple-I Initiative Showcase, as we also got word that a closed alpha test for <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core-is-a-roguelite-spin-off-of-the-popular-co-op-game/">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a> will be taking place soon, ahead of the game's early access launch. You can sign up for a chance to participate in that playtest on Rogue Core's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605790/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Rogue_Core/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <p>
Right, anyone fancy a small look at the next update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enshrouded">Enshrouded</a>? Today's Triple-I showcase delivered exactly that, though I have to admit it's pretty brief, and doesn't show all that much. The game's sixth update, Thralls of Twilight, is due out sometime in May, and seems to come with some big additions. For one, there's new enemies that "creep, crawl, and stalk you further," which sounds… pleasant.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The update will give you a few more reasons to dive into the shroud too. There's more resources, the ability to unlock a new weapons customisation mechanic, and more besides that. Improvements have also apparently been made to the game's nighttime cycle, as there'll be enemy groups going around the world at night with some new rewards you can find too. Gems are also being added that'll let you can attach to your weapons that all have special effects.

Enshrouded's creative director Antony Christoulakis had a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/enshroudeds-next-update-promises-a-rebirth-of-the-shroud-with-new-monsters-resources-and-a-whole-new-weapon-customization-system/">PCGamer</a> recently too, where he explained that this update is focused on the shroud so much because it's "not strong enough yet from our perspective. So, we introduced new enemies that are coming with the next update, as well as improving the topology and adding more points of interest to these [shrouded regions], and also some new mechanics that hopefully make combat also more interesting."
</p>
<p>
The game has been out in early access for a little over a year now, and the intention was originally that it would be out within a year, but obviously the game needs a bit more time. It's also 20% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/">Steam</a> at the moment, so now seems like a good time to pick it up if you're so inclined.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-announcement-release-period-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After years of speculation, all signs point to The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake coming soon, so here is everything you need to know about the leaked announcement and release period. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-release-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a> and 2K Games partnered to create <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/virtuos-unannounced-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion</a>, which was released in 2006. The fourth installment in the series is often considered one of the greatest games ever made. In saying that, it is almost overshadowed by its successor, The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim, which is one of the best-selling games of all time and went on to receive several remasters. </p>



<p>As fans wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-6-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, Bethesda reportedly has plans to remind fans just how special the fourth game in the series is. </p>







<figure><figcaption>The Elder Scrolls gameplay has come a long way since 2006. Image via Bethesda </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion hasn’t officially been confirmed by Bethesda.</strong> </p>



<p>Rumors originated in 2022 when a remake or remaster of Oblivion first popped up during the FTC investigation into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The game was expected to be released during the 2022 fiscal year. </p>



<p>When that date passed, the project resurfaced again in December 2024, as rumors <span>suggested</span> Virtuos was developing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake on Unreal Engine 5</a>, which was further believed to be included in January’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Direct</a>, which came and went without an announcement. </p>



<p>No official announcement hasn’t stopped rumors from intensifying. </p>







<p><strong>No, The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion has no official release date</strong>.</p>



<p>However, Giant Bomb’s <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ifsfg5XFuRI&amp;t=14s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb</a> revealed, “I have been told it’s going to shadow drop at any moment this month.”  </p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with the term, a shadow drop is immediately releasing a game without any previous announcement or confirmed release date. </p>



<p>Shadow-dropping a game of this magnitude would be a surprise. Still, it isn’t something Bethesda hasn’t done before: Bethesda’s former studio, Tango Gameworks, shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush in January 20203. </p>



<p>The marketing strategy ultimately failed, as Grubb claimed in April 2023 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-microsoft-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a> “didn’t make the money it needed to make.” </p>



<p>Despite the game receiving positive reviews, the lack of marketing might have resulted in lackluster sales, and Tango Gameworks was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-microsoft-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to shut down</a> in May 20024. </p>



<p>That reportedly hasn’t scared Bethesda from trying the shadow drop strategy again. </p>







<p><strong>Bethesda has a proven track record of producing successful remasters, so fans should feel confident with The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake. </strong></p>



<p>In 2016, The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim Special Edition contained all three DLC add-ons with a graphical upgrade. In 2017, Bethesda brought Skyrim to VR with a new title and released an Anniversary Edition of the beloved game in 2021 with additional Creation Club content. </p>



<p>Based on that, fans should expect The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake to include the Knights of the Nine&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shivering Isles expansions and a much-needed visual overhaul. </p>



<hr>



<p>The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion isn’t the only remake reportedly coming soon. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-complete-ps-store-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last of Us Complete Edition</a> is now available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-animated-playstation-backgrounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-seemingly-teased-by-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 9 remake</a> was recently teased. </p>

No, he wasn’t paid to change his opinion (as far as we know), but he harped on the financial burden incurred when crafting elaborate VFX-heavy films like his <em>Avatar</em> series and Denis Villeneuve’s <em>Dune </em>movies<em>. </em>According to him, if we want to keep making such films, production costs have to come down, and AI might be the way to do that.</p><p>“If we want to continue to see the kinds of movies that I’ve always loved and that I like to make and that I will go to see—<em>Dune</em>, <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, or one of my films or big effects-heavy, CG-heavy films—we’ve got to figure out how to cut the cost of that in half.” </p><p>He made sure to clarify that in his view, AI shouldn’t replace humans’ jobs, but accelerate them. AI should be “doubling their speed to completion on a given shot, so your cadence is faster and your throughput cycle is faster, and artists get to move on and do other cool things and then other cool things.” It appears he views AI in movies as akin to the computer replacing the typewriter, rather than sentient killing machines replacing the human species.<br></p><p>As practical as that may be, it still sounds like it came from bizzarro world when you remember that Cameron gave an ominous warning about AI <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2023/07/terminator-director-james-cameron-on-rise-of-ai-1235441905/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/terminator-director-james-cameron-on-rise-of-ai-1235441905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2023</a></span> when he told CTV News, “I warned you guys in 1984, and you didn’t listen.” Finding AI so horrifying that he references his 1984 film <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Terminator</em>, whose plot is set in motion by an AI that seeks to wipe out humanity, when warning about its dangers doesn’t sound like a stance one can just pivot from in less than two years. <br></p><p>Still, he’s spent time since then studying the workings of AI, which may have contributed to the shift in his views. On the <em>Boz to the Future</em> podcast he discussed taking time to learn the nuances of the AI space in order to find a way to leverage its redeemable aspects to push filmmaking further. “The goal was to understand the space, to understand what’s on the minds of the developers,” he explained. “What are they targeting? What’s their development cycle? How much resources you have to throw at it to create a new model that does a purpose-built thing, and my goal was to try to integrate it into a VFX workflow.”<br></p><p>To his credit, he never said AI should be writing movies, having said in 2023, “ “I just don’t personally believe that a disembodied mind that’s just regurgitating what other embodied minds have said—about the life that they’ve had, about love, about lying, about fear, about mortality—and just put it all together into a word salad and then regurgitate it...I don’t believe that have something that’s going to move an audience.” So he’s not fully on the AI bandwagon. But he did join the Stability AI <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/james-cameron-joins-stability-ai-board-of-directors-1236097835/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/james-cameron-joins-stability-ai-board-of-directors-1236097835/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board of Directors</a></span> last September to help bring AI capabilities to future filmmakers. With Cameron on board, it could only be a matter of time before Hollywood begins finding ways to incorporate AI without killing us all.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>"No ads, no hosts, no sponsors, just games." <a href="https://iii-initiative.com/">The Triple-i Initiative</a>'s pitch for its now-annual showcase of games, crafted by studios working somewhere between "Solo dev or very small team" and "Investor-minded conglomerate with international offices," promises a lot of peeks at games without a lot of chatter, and once again it delivered.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/slay-the-spire-2-vampire-survivors-meets-contra-and-other-triple-i-games/">Last year's showcase</a> debuted titles like <em>Norland</em>, <em>Slay the Spire 2</em>, and <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, along with updates from&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>. This year featured looks at titles from the&nbsp;Deep Rock universe, the cloning-yourself-to-survive curiosity&nbsp;<a href="https://altersthegame.com/"><em>The Alters</em></a>, an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3407390/ENDLESS_Legend_2/"><em>Endless Legend 2</em></a> that continues tweaking the 4X formula, and more.</p>
<p>Below are five selected highlights for the Ars crowd, along with some notable other announcements. The full list is not yet up on <a href="https://iii-initiative.com/">the Triple-i site</a>, but you can see what jumped out from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMyziPJY_aw">the full showcase</a>.</p>

<p>Ghost Ship Games and its publishing arm advanced two of its <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/how-deep-rock-galactics-dwarf-miners-have-helped-me-survive-the-pandemic/">Deep Rock Galactic</a> (DRG) </em>spinoffs at the showcase, one of them with real gameplay. <em>DRG: Rogue Core</em>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/deep-rock-galactic-is-getting-a-roguelite-spin-off-but-core-game-remains/">run-based, shoot-ier game</a> set in the same dwarven universe as&nbsp;<em>DRG,&nbsp;</em>showed off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EfBOHWeaSo&amp;feature=youtu.be">a new trailer with actual play</a> and announced a closed alpha test, accessible on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605790/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Rogue_Core/">the game's Steam page</a>.&nbsp;<em>DRG: Survivor</em>, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-is-a-fine-entry-point-into-the-auto-shooting-depths/">fine entry</a> into the burgeoning "Survivor-like" genre (it <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/so-so-many-vampire-survivors-clones-came-out-this-year/">still needs a name</a>), now has a 1.0 date set for September 17. The <a href="https://youtu.be/EDnQNFn6vIk">trailer</a> shows off some of the new content updates, biomes, systems, and quirky little "overclocks" and artifacts that make the number of run variations nearly incalculable.</p>
<h3><em>Endless Legend 2</em></h3>

<p>The sequel to the game that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/stellaris-and-strategy-gamings-bad-luck-problem/">expertly incorporated randomness into a 4X strategy framework</a> is getting a sequel, and it hits early access this summer. The game will add more factions as the summer approaches, and the sequel promises more disasters and strategy options to come. You can sign up for early access through Amplitude Studios' <a href="https://ampli.click/insidersprogramsurvey">Insider Program</a>.</p>
<h3><em>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era</em></h3>

<p>It's been a minute since a turn-based game set in the&nbsp;Might &amp; Magic world of Enroth came around—about 10 years, actually, not counting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/songs-of-conquest-is-the-heroes-of-might-magic-rebirth-we-all-deserve/">spiritual successors</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/"><em>Olden Era</em></a> takes players to the continent of Jadame, never before explored in the game universe. Woodland spirits fight medieval armies, zombies spawn from the battlefield, demons get into the mix—there's a lot going on. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/">sign up for a playtest at the game's Steam page</a>, and it's due out in early access in Q2 2025.</p>

            <p>
If you thought Nintendo was the master of re-releases, then <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> might just be gunning for its title. The studio has announced yet another release for The Last of Us - but this time it's returning in the form of a two-game Complete edition.
</p>
<p>
Hints that Sony and Naughty Dog might be preparing another The Last of Us release first surfaced back in March, when it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-reportedly-getting-mysterious-new-physical-ps5-special-edition">reported a mysterious new PlayStation 5 special edition was on the way</a>. Little was known about it at the time, beyond the fact it was supposedly getting a physical edition, but all has now been revealed.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Complete, as its name suggests, bundles together the PS5 versions of The Last of Us Part 1 and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which initially released in 2022 and 2024 respectively. It'll be available in two forms; a digital edition, which is live on the PlayStation Store right now, and a special physical Collector's Edition, which arrives on 10th July.
</p>

<p>
The Last of Us Complete's digital release features exactly the same content as you'd get if you brought both games separately, but it does provide a bit of saving. It's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA29488_00-0000000000000000">priced at £94.99 on the PlayStation Store</a>, making a purchase £19.99 cheaper than buying Part 1 and Part 2 individually.
</p>
<p>
As for the Collector's Edition, it's exclusive to PlayStation's online store. It comes in a steelbook case with separate discs for Part 1 and Part 2, and also includes the Left Behind prequel chapter, The Last of Us: American Dreams Comics #1-4 with new cover art, a set of four lithographic art prints, and a Thank You letter from Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann - which I'm assuming isn't going to be handwritten. It costs £109.99/$109.99 USD, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-games/the-last-of-us-complete-collectors-edition-ps5">pre-orders are open now</a>.
</p>
<p>
But will Naughty Dog's latest The Last of Us release <em>actually</em> end up being the "complete" edition. Druckmann has sent mixed messages about the likelihood of a third series instalment over the last few years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">telling fans "there's probably one more chapter to this story" back in 2024</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">reversing course this March</a> and warning, "Don't bet on there being more."
</p>
<p>
There is, though, <em>sort of</em> new The Last of Us on the way, courtesy of HBO's live-action TV adaptation. Season 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">begins airing</a> this Sunday, 13th April (14th April in the UK), and looks like it'll be substantially expanding on the events of the second game. We already know some new characters are being introduced for Season 2 - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara's Gale</a> - and given showrunner Craig Mazin is predicting the series will run to four season, there's plenty of space to chart routes previously unseen. Especially as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">Season 3 is already confirmed</a>.
