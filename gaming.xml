            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/17/boyhom-r36h-handheld-console-review-retro-gaming-on-a-budget/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Retro gaming used to require a lot of hard work. Getting old consoles to play happily with modern, flatscreen displays was a constant challenge that wearied the very idea of it, ultimately making it an easier option to put everything in the loft and play the latest Call of Duty instead. That’s no longer the case, though, with retro handhelds becoming an affordable and fun option for playing all your older games, no matter where you are.</p>
<p>The Boyhom R36H is one of the cheapest retro gaming devices on the planet, coming in for less than £40 in the UK – it’s listed as having a <a href="https://r36h.com/">$49.99 RRP</a> but our unit was listed on AliExpress for a slightly ridiculous £18.27 with a 64GB memory card, before shipping and fees. The handheld shows some signs of that accessible price point, but its quality far exceeds the expectations you might have for a console priced this low.</p>



<p>Our review unit came in pure white, though the R36H is also available in grey, transparent black, purple or orange. Laid out horizontally with buttons on either side of the screen, it shares a similar outlook to Retroid’s older Pocket devices, with a chunky, slightly boxy aesthetic. It’s not sleek or premium-looking like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, but it’s charming in its own way. For the price I wasn’t expecting it to look or feel as good as it does, and it immediately sets you up for a positive experience.</p>
<p>The Boyhom R36H has a 3.5” IPS display, with a 640×480 resolution. Its 4:3 ratio makes it ideal for older games, and it’s plenty bright and vibrant. Frankly, it’s a continual source of surprise every time you boot a game up how good the display is, and for the type of games the R36H is capable of playing, you couldn’t ask for more.</p>

<p>Internally, the R36H is equipped with a RK3326 chipset and 1GB of DDR3L RAM. It’s definitely not the most powerful device out there, but for retro games up to and including the Dreamcast, it provides enough power to keep everything running smoothly, and relatively efficiently.</p>
<p>It uses Arkos 2.0, an open-source Linux-based operating system, that does exactly what it needs to, in so far as it lets you dump a frontend like Emulation Station onto it that pulls together your ROMS into different categories, with some smart artwork and labels to make it all make sense.</p>
<p>You’ll find Arkos on a batch of Powkiddy and Anbernic devices, and it’s been around for long enough to be well-optimised, keeping you gaming for longer, and with decent performance. The system as a whole is a little on the slow side, so hopping in and out of games can feel lethargic, but in-game, you’ll never notice. It boasts a 3000mAh battery – though its own advertising gets confused between 3000mAh and 3500mAh, but either way it’s plenty to keep you going for between 5 and 6 hours, and maybe even longer if you’re playing less demanding titles. One annoyance is that the battery LED can’t be turned off, and it’s lit at all times, even when you’re not playing. You can choose between it being red or green though, so… there’s that.</p>

<p>Everything has been stripped back in the R36H, and when you consider the price, that’s not surprising. There’s no Bluetooth or WiFi here, so any updates or connections need to be done via wired connections, or installing data onto your MicroSD cards. There are two MicroSD slots on the R36H, one for your OS, and the other for your ROMS, and they do exactly what you need of them. It makes working with the R36H slightly clunky, but chances are this is a device that would serve well as a gift, or a starting point for the retro gaming hobby, rather than the end point like the Retroid Pocket 5. That said, there’s some additional functionality with HDMI output via a USB-C OTG connection, which is a nice inclusion.</p>
<p>One of the best things about the Boyhom R36H is the D-pad. It’s sturdy, responsive, and ideal for classic retro games like Mario or Metroid. Given the price, I expected the different inputs to feel cheap, but that’s mostly not the case. The face buttons aren’t quite as good, being fractionally raised from the unit’s main body, and the travel feels ever so slightly too long, but they still do a decent job of responding to your inputs in games like Sonic the Hedgehog and Kid Chameleon.</p>
<p>The two analogue sticks are laid out asymmetrically, and for some people, this will be a sticking point. While it’s aping the Xbox or Nintendo Switch layouts, it does mean that the D-pad is at the bottom of the unit. Depending on how you hold the device, the size of your hands and the games you’re playing, this could make it uncomfortable over long gaming sessions. They’re also pretty short and soft, without much feedback, but they are there, which isn’t always the case for retro-focused devices. It means that you can properly control Dreamcast and later PlayStation 1 games, without having to resort to swapping the D-pad’s functionality, and that’s a big bonus for me.</p>

<p>The other controls are solid, with digital shoulder buttons that wrap around the top corners of the R36H, and two further inputs on top which are easily reachable with the tips of your fingers. Most retro games won’t use both sets, but they’re solid and useable if you need to call on them.</p>
<p>We’re here for retro gaming, and thankfully the R36H allows you to do that, and it does an especially good job with older titles from the 16-bit era and below. I love a good shoot ‘em up, and Aeroblaster – or Air Busters depending on where you played it – remains one of my all-time favourites. Here it runs flawlessly in its Arcade rendition, with a decent frame rate, and unspectacular but well-represented audio. This is retro gaming running through imperfect emulators, so support isn’t going to be perfect across the board – I found audio issues in the arcade Mortal Kombat games that weren’t present in other games, for example – so if you’re coming at this as your first entry into the hobby, don’t expect everything in your ROM collection to work straight out of the box.</p>
<p>The speakers on the R36H aren’t great. They’re thin-sounding, firing downwards into your hands and relying on how you place your palms to get the best audio, but they do have plenty of volume. That volume is controlled by two digital buttons on the top of the unit, and there is a 3.5mm socket for a wired headphone connection, which is the best way to hear your favourite game themes. I’ve been playing a lot of Final Fantasy Tactics, and the soundtrack sounded great when playing on the R36H with headphones – it’s definitely my recommended way to play.</p>

For Hire</a> evokes the classic cartoons of the 1930s in its rubberhose animation style, but it’s a first-person shooter at its core. That means it’s all about the guns, of which we’ve largely only seen era-specific firearms like Tommy guns and pistols. A new trailer reveals three more off-the-wall weapons that lean much more into the absurdity of Mouse’s cartoon world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First up is a freeze weapon called the COOL-D Cold Steam Applier, which can encase foes in ice, which you can shatter with a stiff kick. The CLEAN-D Automatic Turpentine Cleanse is a chemical weapon firing Turpentine that melts foes on contact. Lastly, you can scramble enemy brains with the MIND-D Self-Aware Attitude Changer. This mind-warping beam causes the target to go insane to the point that their head explodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nt4dqP9wtQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>First revealed in 2023, Mouse: P.I. For Hire stars Jack Pepper, a detective and war hero who becomes embroiled in a mystery within the criminal underworld of the city of Mouseberg. The Noir-inspired adventure lets players blast through non-linear levels using a variety of ranged and melee weapons and power-ups, like a Popeye-inspired spinach boost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire launches this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

<p>As a member of the Black Spider Clan, Kumori combines modern weaponry with demonic power to take down threats. She most prominently wields twin daggers to slice apart foes up close, but she can also toss them to hold back distant threats. See Kumori in action in the game’s new trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1X0Ot401Tk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound was announced last December during The Game Awards and is being helmed by Blasphemous developer The Game Kitchen and published by Dotemu (TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, Streets of Rage 4). Ragebound canonically takes place immediately after the conclusion of the original Ninja Gaiden for NES. Ryu Hayabusa has left his village to avenge his father, leaving a new playable hero and upstart Hayabusa Clan ninja, Kenji Mozu, to protect his home from a demonic threat.</p>

<p>The 2D action features optional side quests, upgradable abilities, and secret collectibles. Naturally, it will also sport the series' signature (or infamous) precision-based, skill-demanding platforming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound launches this summer for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It will be the second of three Ninja Gaiden releases in 2025, following Ninja Gaiden II Black in January and before the upcoming Ninja Gaiden 4 later this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This little nugget was casually tucked away in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/nintendo-switch-2-features">Split Fiction blog post</a> about Switch 2's features. "GameShare will enable Nintendo Switch 2 owners to invite another player to play together over a local wireless connection using just one copy of the game," the post reads.</p>
<p>"This 'other player' can be not only a Nintendo Switch 2 owner but a Nintendo Switch owner as well."</p>
<p>Well, I'll be, that is pretty neat! Perhaps it isn't a surprise to many, but I will admit I just assumed that Split Fiction would only be playable for those using an available release platform.</p>

<p>Nintendo gamers are really in for a treat, I have to say. Split Fiction is absolutely brilliant! And, I am far from the only one to think so. "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's five star Split Fiction review</a>.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will be released on Switch 2 on the console's launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">which is 5th June</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Atomfall surpassed Rebellion's expectations by far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-blows-past-2-million-players-in-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching over two million players in just one month</a>, and its presence on Game Pass was definitely helpful toward that goal. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley heaped praise on Microsoft and their subscription service:</p>
<p><em>It's been a huge success. Microsoft has been a fantastic partner to work with, they've really leaned in to helping us. They brought their skills and their scale to bear on our small project, and it's done really, really well for them, so they got a good deal, we got a good deal out of it as well.</em></p>
<p><em>With Game Pass, you can get people to try it, then as a result of those people trying it, they like it, and they then tell their mates on social media, 'I found this game on Game Pass, I really enjoyed it, you should have a go.' And then some of them are on Game Pass, and will play it. But some of them aren't on Game Pass, and will also want to be part of that conversation. So, they'll go and buy it. </em><em>At least, that's our theory – we don't have the data in for that. But Chris and I both feel, one of the biggest challenges for a company like us is discovery. And Game Pass has allowed for a lot of discovery for our game.</em></p>
<p><em>It does mitigate risk, because without going into details, they guarantee you a certain level of income, regardless of what it will sell for. But it potentially has a knock-on effect. Places like Xbox sales, for example. You could argue that all the hardcore are on Game Pass, and they're the ones that might buy a new IP like this, so therefore, are you cannibalising one section of the audience? And I think, perhaps, yes, a little bit. But what you gain from that cost is disproportionate.</em></p>
<p>Atomfall <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/801800/view/497192590186120441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just got a bug-fixing update</a> yesterday.

            <p>
Bethesda is still to announce its highly-anticipated The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake, but there's no denying the project is real and ready to launch.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots and details of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake were dug up from developer Virtuos' website</a>. Now, references to the project have been found on Bethesda's own website too - including code for a "Buy Now" button that has since been removed. 
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer previously reported, it's understood that Bethesda's current plans are to shadow drop the game next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass. But nothing has been officially announced - for now.

<p>
Still, Bethesda is clearly readying for next week behind the scenes, with some overly-eager website updating that - of course - caught the eye of fans. 
</p>
<p>
"I was digging through the source code of bethesda.net and found a reference to 'oblivion-remastered' in the Google Tag Manager setup," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k0o68n/just_found_reference_to_oblivion_remastered_on/?share_id=ZJgIC8zrHuGnKCtKH6nH5">fan posted on reddit</a>, showing a screenshot of the code in situ. 
</p>
<p>
"It points to this URL: https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/oblivion-remastered The page isn't live yet, but what's interesting is that I checked the Google Tag Manager container on the Wayback Machine, and this reference wasn't there as of April 10th. So it looks like it was added very recently!"
</p>
<p>
The code has now been removed - just as the screenshots from Virtuos' website were too. But, of course, copies are now all over the internet, and you can still see the original files in place via an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250415122013/https://www.virtuosgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/">archived version of Virtuos' website</a>.
</p>
<p>After years of leaks and an even lengthier wait for a new entry in The Elder Scrolls series (don't look up how long ago Skyrim landed), fans don't have long to go now. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">"remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. Maybe that could come next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tabletop Tavern is, currently, not quite where it needs to be to properly scratch that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> itch. The units can be a bit flaky, charges lack impact, and there's just not enough to do to keep early battles interesting. What is it, however, is a great concept with a lot of personality: you're playing actual tabletop miniatures inside a medieval tavern, gradually building up your army across Slay The Spire style branching progression nodes. I'm absolutely rooting for it, simply because there's still so little offering a comparable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> experience to Total War, and also because it's made by a solo dev. Trailer below, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337380/Tabletop_Tavern/">here's a Steam demo</a>.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, when the world was young, god still loved us, and no-one was trying to force AI assistants into my toothbrush, Warhammer makers Games Workshop had the absolutely wild idea that building a community might actually help them sell a few toys, and so used to host regular games in stores. It's the sort of thing you have to find a club these days for mostly, but that's the framing here: you've settled in for a bit of wargaming and a pint of ale or six in your local tavern.</p>
<p>A lot of the controls will be immediately familiar to Total War players - the Ctrl-Alt-drag formation shift even makes an appearance, as do the little triangles to denote individual units within formations. Much like Total War, you've got your rock-paper-scissors infantry-cavalry-ranged archetypes, along with different types of terrain and weather. Pikeman have an anti-large bonus, shielded units are handy at blocking missiles, and so on. But it's also just far less gloomy than Warhammer in general, with classic blinding green flock mats and notably less screaming about how Sigmar has abandoned us.</p>
<p>Again, it needs some work - there's not much impact feedback, and so things feel a little limp. Plus, the gradual army building of the roguelike structure means early skirmishes are quite similar. Still, the events between battles to restore unit health or perhaps recruit a few bonus mates are a great touch, and I'm eager to see how this one develops. Between this and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/real-time-tactics-game-strategos-aims-to-outflank-total-war-with-over-120-factions-at-launch">Strategos</a>, it's always good to see more games giving Creative Assembly a friendly poke out of complete complacency. Throw in an army painter, and I'm yours.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One of the biggest technical surprises when it comes to the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console was that it would support features like HDR (High Dynamic Range displays) and VRR (Variable Refresh Rate). However, as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-scrubs-mentions-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-supporting-vrr-on-a-tv-while-docked.1166361/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted by a ResetEra user</a>, any mention of VRR being available when setting the console in docked (or TV) mode has been removed from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canadian</a> websites.</p>
<p>The description used to say:</p>
<p><em>Take in all the detail with screen resolutions up to 4K when you connect the Nintendo Switch 2 system to a compatible TV using the dedicated dock. The system also supports HDR, VRR, and frame rates up to 120 fps on compatible TVs.</em></p>
<p>Now, though, it has been modified to:</p>
<p><em>Take in all the detail with screen resolutions up to 4K when you connect the Nintendo Switch 2 system to a compatible TV using the dedicated dock. The system also supports HDR and frame rates up to 120 fps on compatible TVs.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-More-details-about-features-2790188.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British website</a> still features the original description, hence the confusion. Needless to say, we'll reach out to Nintendo to try and get clarification on the subject. It would be very underwhelming if docked mode truly lacked variable refresh rate, which would be critical for a smooth gameplay experience when playing at 4K on the console.</p>
<p>This does not affect handheld mode, which has built-in NVIDIA G-SYNC through a native DisplayPort 1.4 connection. The speculation is that variable refresh rate might be lost in the conversion from DisplayPort to the HDMI output needed for docked mode.</p>
<p>In other slightly weird Nintendo Switch 2 news, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-do-not-support-cloud-saves.1166340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild nor The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will support the cloud save backup feature</a> that is included with the Nintendo Switch Online premium membership. To clarify, it will still be possible to transfer saves from the original Nintendo Switch, but users won't be able to create new cloud saves in these versions.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World fans will want to tune in to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated Direct stream later today</a>.</p>

            <p>It's soon bank holiday weekend for us in the UK, which means I'll be doing two things: sleeping and eating. Maybe I'll eat a duvet or two! Who knows. Four days with no imposed structure is enough time for things to <em>get weird</em>. Maybe I'll eat your duvet! No. Not again. Have to calm down.  I'll simply distract myself with the "culinary quest" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hungry-horrors">Hungry Horrors</a> - a game that, I must admit, I'm mainly drawn to because I'm not sure I've ever seen Yorkshire Pudding employed as an upgrade before.</p>

<p>If you hadn't noticed from all the pickled eggs, shortbread, and some sort of regional abomination called 'Toad In <em><strong>A</strong></em> Hole'? (literally unplayable), Hungry Horrors takes influence from British and Irish folklore and what they're calling 'authentic regional dishes'. I'm yet to spot my own authentic regional dish, the Super Noodle sandwich, but it's not too late. The idea is that you'll serve food to folkloric creatures to stop them snacking on you instead. Each creature has their own preferences, whether that be a yen for sweet food or a dislike for fish, and you'll have to work out what these are.</p>
<p>It's roguelikely in structure, and you'll return to your base after each run to try out new recipes. Here's a little more from the Steam page, which also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3048840/Hungry_Horrors/">houses a demo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Meet Black Annis, Jenny Greenteeth, Grendel, and other legendary beings straight from Celtic, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh legends. Each creature you encounter has been terrifying the people of these lands for centuries, challenging you to outwit their monstrous appetites".</p></blockquote>
<p>Dev team hungry horrors recently got caught in pickle of their own, having to <a href="https://clumsybearstudio.com/blog/post-008-launching-our-first-steam-demo.html">evacuate the Bangkok apartment they were living and working in</a> following the Myanmar earthquake. Given the circumstances, I suppose I can forgive 'Toad In A Hole', although just barely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Virtuos Games' remaster of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </a>is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-images-discovered-on-virtuos-games-website">all but confirmed</a> to be releasing later this month, and honestly, even that "all but" is looking shaky. A few different <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/">sets</a> of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">images</a> from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> have surfaced, supporting rumours that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">have been kicking about</a> since an internal Microsoft document leaked in 2020. Also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer said it was true</a>, and they've got an uncle that works at the White Gold Tower, although prodding Bethesda themselves <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-have-no-official-information-on-an-oblivion-remake-say-bethesda-which-isnt-a-denial-is-it">proved as forthcoming</a> as trying to get stones out of a blood orange.</p>

<p>If you've been following all this, you may have noticed that the timing of the remaster's (or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">remake's</a>?) release is a little bit, um, <em>convenient</em>. The team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">Skyblivion</a> - a full remake of Oblivion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine - is also due to release this year. While it's obviously tempting to frame this as the monstrous cads at Bethesda n' chums taking a power-hose grade widdle on the dreams, work, beds, and pets of volunteer modders, it seems the modders themselves aren't too bothered.</p>
<p>"The real remake is the friends we made along the way," says <a href="https://x.com/Rebelzize/status/1912137244036522179">Skyblivion lead KRebel</a>. "This changes nothing for me. This always was a passion project and still is until the end. For the community its a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster."</p>
<p>This echo earlier statements made to our <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remaster-leak-skyblivion-project-lead-stay-positive">network chums at VG247</a>. "I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined, friends, experience and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry which I ended up doing," KRebel said. "At the end of the day it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all."</p>
<p>And that's the key point here, I think. The official remaster has presumably been in the works for many years at this point. Bethesda knew it was coming, and still allowed the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> team to carry on doing their thing. The result? Well, it means we've all got a more bucolic Tamriel to visit when the official version's seemingly ubiquitous 2005 shooter piss-filter gets too much.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Over the last two months, both current and former Gamurs employees tell us things have only gotten worse.</p><p>Successive waves of layoffs have hit the network in February, March and April of this year, impacting not just many of the sites’ full-time editorial staff, but people <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/media-company-gamurs-group-reportedly-lays-off-more-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher up</a> at Gamurs as well including, we’re told, a large part of the company's SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) team, as well as those employed in positions like marketing, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamurs-group-reportedly-lays-off-more-staff-shuts-down-pc-invasion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content strategy</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/media-company-gamurs-group-reportedly-lays-off-more-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assignment editors</a>.</p><p>Former employees tell us that using the network's Slack userbase as a metric, there were approximately 320 workers registered on the company's account in late 2024, a number that by this week has dwindled to around 260. Of those remaining, a large number are freelance workers who say they have not only been kept in the dark about these dramatic workplace changes, receiving no notices or announcements from company leadership, but are contracted to sites that don't appear to have operating budgets for the immediate future.&nbsp;</p><p>We've been shown screenshots of internal Slack messages frequently rejecting these workers’ pitches at some of Gamurs' biggest websites by citing budget constraints, which recently laid-off writers speculate is part of a wider cost-cutting measure (Freelancers for Gamurs sites are paid by the post and must pitch stories to editors).</p><p>After this week's layoffs, The Escapist–which lost a number of full-time staff–is mostly now posting Roblox guides. Destructoid has lost several key writers and is now being updated with stories mostly being produced, we're told, by former DotEsports staff who have&nbsp; been moved over, with DotEsports now updating at a much slower pace than previously.</p><figure><figcaption>AOTF was purchased by Gamurs in 2022 as a site 'for all things relating to video games'</figcaption></figure><p>Twinfinite, which also lost staff, was last updated on March 27, while Attack Of The Fanboy--once a nerd culture site, but which had recently pivoted to celebrity gossip and political content--hasn't seen a new post since March 28. Siliconera and The Mary Sue, also affected by layoffs and resignations, are both down to just a handful of new stories a day.</p><p>PC Invasion, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamurs-group-reportedly-lays-off-more-staff-shuts-down-pc-invasion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply doesn't exist anymore</a>; the site now redirects to Prima Games, the once-mighty guides label that Gamurs purchased in 2022, with some of PC Invasion’s content moved under its masthead.&nbsp;</p><p>Former staff also tell us that, despite laying off successive waves of writers throughout 2025, Gamurs has been actively trying to recruit writers from regions like<a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/?#positions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> India, the Philippines and the Balkans</a>. Former staff speculated this could be because these workers can be paid less than writers from the US or United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's accurate to say that entire chunks of the network have just been shut down at this point", one former full-time staffer told Aftermath. Others we've spoken to wonder if the continued layoffs, coupled with silence from the company's leadership, could indicate that Gamurs is either about to be sold or is looking for a sale.</p><p>“Almost everyone [at my site] has been laid off over several waves, the most recent of which happened this morning”, one former Gamurs writer told us. ”Entire websites, like the Escapist and Twinfinite, are just sitting basically dormant. We're all speculating Gamurs are going to sell.”</p><p>“Right now operations have ground to a halt”, another full-time writer, recently laid off, says. “[Ownership] shutting down sites just seems inevitable, especially because they’ve always been willing to just let people go for literally no reason other than to try and save on overheads”.</p><p>I reached out to Gamurs for comment on this story. The company did not respond by time of publishing.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steel-ball-run-jojos-bizarre-adventure"><h3>Steel Ball Run Is The Best JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Part</h3></a><p>The Real Man’s World is a moment that’ll stick with me forever</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The dance has become incredibly popular, to the point of being shouted out in Charli XCX's tour and shared on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@charlixcx/video/7389277177629379872?lang=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charli XCX's TikTok</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/dress-to-impress-brat-update-promo-1744834699035.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's unsurprising that Roblox wanted the Apple Dance as part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dress-to-impress/Brat_Update_Details_and_Patch_Notes_(DTI_Charli_XCX_Collaboration)">collaboration between Charli XCX and one of the most popular games within Roblox</a>: creative fashion contest game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dress-to-impress-roblox">Dress to Impress</a>. Spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/559582/charli-xcx-apple-dance-roblox-lawsuit" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>, the lawsuit in question was filed last week in California, in which Heyer claims that originally, Robox did contact her to license the Apple Dance for the crossover event. Heyer says that she was open to the idea of the dance being licensed if the terms were right - she even <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kelley.heyer/video/7448063559411584299" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed it to Fortnite</a> and Netflix via actual, signed agreements - but never reached an actual agreement with Roblox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heyer alleges that Robox released the Apple Dance emote for sale in the event before negotiations were ever completed and without Heyer giving her consent for its use. Heyer says that Roblox sold over 60,000 Apple Dance emotes, resulting in an estimated $123,000 in sales. The suit also argues that while the emote was a part of a Charli XCX event, the dance emote itself is unattached to the song or Charli XCX, and thus is solely Heyer's intellectual property.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suit accuses Roblox of copyright infringement and unjust enrichment, and requests relief in the form  of the profits Roblox received from the dance plus damages as a result of Roblox harming Heyer's brand and Heyer herself, plus attorney's fees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 2:15 p.m. PT: </strong>Heyer's attoney, Miki Anzai, shared the following statement: "Roblox moved forward using Kelley's IP without a signed agreement. Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that. We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-edgerunners-combat-zone-board-game-review.1166313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-combat-zone-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-review"><u>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</u></a> is an electrifying animated Netflix series that debuted in 2022 and left me gobsmacked. Across 10 episodes, we rip through Night City alongside protagonists David and Lucy as they confront the terrors of the concrete hellscape while stuck between two warring MegaCorps. This brilliant anime is full of potential and is too damn good to be forgotten. Thankfully, it's now been reanimated via cardboard and plastic, allowing players to explore some of the key moments of the series through a refined tabletop miniatures game that's as razor sharp as the Cyberpunk 2077 setting.</p><div catalogid="ee2f861d-896e-452c-918b-38684ca2ff50" id="217983"><div id="217983" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The setup mimics the show – one player controls Maine and his crew of merc edgerunners, and another the Arasaka paramilitary team. Players select a scenario and then craft their gang from a selection of characters based on the assigned points value for the mission. Maine’s group can include any of the main protagonists of the series, including David, Lucy, and Rebecca. Arasaka has a mixed cast of faceless grunts alongside more menacing options such as the braindance editor Jimmy Kurosaki and massive hulk Adam Smasher. You can outfit team members with various weapons and cybergear, allowing for advanced tactics and more nuanced options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the strengths of this game is that the system it uses is already seasoned. The ruleset is identical to publisher Monster Fight Club’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-red-combat-zone-tabletop-game-review">Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone</a> miniatures game. I’ve already written many words about this excellent tabletop skirmish game, and I am more than pleased to see it return with a fresh exoskeleton. It’s really a top-notch ruleset that hasn't received the acclaim it deserves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting aspect is the activation system. Characters are allotted color-coded action tokens that are spent to roll matching dice. The stronger actions allow you to move farther or roll larger dice, such as a 12-sider, to perform various activities. The active player chooses one of their characters to activate, and then spends their assigned tokens to sprint across the board, attack their foe, or perform special actions such as netrunning or completing a scenario objective. There is added texture through leadership abilities allowing you to activate additional models out of order, or the option to react when wounded. This creates a dynamic flow to play with a controlled chaos that blends player agency with unpredictability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This splendid system is interesting in that it evokes a sense of resource management for players to puzzle over. Each action is precious and needs to be spent for maximum gain. For instance, if Dario is being targeted by an Arasaka Point Man, do you spend her best action token for the opposed defensive roll, or do you go with a weaker action to save her best die for later in the turn? This decision process evokes a similar feel to tactical board games, such as some of the more inspired <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon crawler board games</a>. It’s more opaque than traditional miniatures games such as Kill Team or Frostgrave. This quality isn’t a total surprise, as the founders of Monster Fight Club have a long established history, having designed hit board games such as Spartacus: A Game of Blood and Treachery and Star Trek: Ascendancy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the system here is identical to Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone, the content is certainly not. In addition to swapping out Night City gangs for edgerunner mercs and Megacorp goons, the plastic miniatures of that previous box have been abandoned in lieu of stylish acryllic standees. This style of plastic faux 3D figure has started to become popular in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> hobby, but it hasn’t quite been experimented with on the same scale in miniatures games. Monster Fight Club is looking to spearhead this movement as these standees are incredibly appealing for both ease of play and striking aesthetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the reasons the acrylic standees work so well in this game is that the characters' depictions are all grounded in the anime. The artistic style of the Edgerunners series is an iconic element of the property, so carrying it forward to the miniatures game is an enormous win. The sleek tone of the figures blends well with the cyberpunk terrain and battlefield, merging for an overall enhanced visual field that is fantastic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The standees are such an enormous benefit to the game that I can’t imagine the average wargamer opting for miniatures instead. Look, all of us that play these types of games have scads of unpainted figures occupying our shelves. This switch to illustrated acrylic standees is such a breath of fresh air, as it allows you to just dive into the game with virtually no assembly or prep time. And for many, they will look better than the average paint-job we are capable of. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The standees are such an enormous benefit to the game that I can’t imagine the average wargamer opting for miniatures instead.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some may instead find that desire for full-blown miniatures eating away at their soul. Fret not, for an <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxX4mx?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aftermarket option</a> does allow for a return to plastic multi-part miniatures. It’s a pricey option that will certainly increase your overall burden in entering this game, and I certainly find it entirely unnecessary, but it’s an option that’s there for collectors. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The terrain is of similar exceptional quality to the magnificent Cyerpunk Red: Combat Zone kit. Cardboard buildings, rubble, and barricades are composed of thick chipboard that slots together with ease. The surface is a sturdy mounted board similar to that found in hobby board games. There’s no paper mat needing an immediate upgrade here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This line of Cyberpunk miniatures games are also well supported with aftermarket purchases of Monster Fight Club’s various <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7EB3G?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">plastic terrain options</a>. They have crafted some of the best cargo containers in the industry, and have expanded that series of products to include walkways, crates, and various other small scatter options. It’s incredible stuff that rivals the top-notch cardboard options in the core box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone is an impressive box. It once again includes a fully featured <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign</a> reminiscent of its peers such as Necromunda and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcry-heart-of-ghur-brings-big-changes-to-the-tabletop-game">Warcry</a>. Players can take their gang through multiple battles and increase their characters' potency. Eventually your gang will reach the end of their story and engage in a climactic finale that wraps up their narrative. Campaign play isn't a requirement, however, as the game performs exceptionally well in one-off skirmishes. The wide range of scenario options are exciting and varied, affording for a large amount of experimentation. Couple that with full crew options allowing players to field a wide array of rosters, and this single box set feels wholly complete.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The characters are well realized, with abilities and play-styles that reflect the Netflix series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The attention to detail here is strong throughout. The characters are well realized, with abilities and play-styles that reflect the Netflix series. David, for instance, can really dig into cybergear and run wild. Adam Smasher is scary as hell. Lucy can netrun with the best of them. Owners of Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone products may be pleased to find out that you can mix content across games. Since both utilize the same core ruleset, they are fully compatible for those wanting to explore anachronistic conflicts that jump across the timeline. Regardless of Combat Zone experience, this new boxed set feels singular and expansive, offering a tailored skirmish game that is fantastic in its own right.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2rAp?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6odK3?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Atomic Empire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YDp5?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">See more board games based on video games</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 16, 2025 7:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">This is a wonderful miniatures skirmish game that begs consideration. The switch to acrylic standees has only improved the overall gaming experience, and it’s a trend that I hope catches on with other publishers. This Edgerunners boxed set is a fully-featured and complete game that will stand the test of time. For fans of the animated series, this game is everything you’d hope for.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
